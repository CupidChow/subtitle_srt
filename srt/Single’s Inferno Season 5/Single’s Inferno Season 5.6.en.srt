There's a new person I'm curious about.

19
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,394
But just a little bit curious.

20
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,855
- [gasps]
- [Jin-kyung] Another?

21
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,274
- Who could it be?
- Okay, who is it this time?

22
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,152
- I mean, that can happen.
- I'm on the edge of my seat.

23
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,154
When I'm here,
I don't know what happens to me.

24
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,406
My heart can't decide.
I know I'm being fickle.

25
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,450
How come your heart keeps
changing like that?

26
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,826
You're so easily swayed.

27
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,870
Come on. Come on, seriously?

28
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:22,123
Hee-sun's permanently
walking around in Su-been's hoodie now.

29
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,085
So am I just supposed to say
Oh, "Su-been's so cute."

30
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,753
I mean, is that bullshit or what?

31
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,797
Come on. Of course it's bullshit!

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,882
Don't you know who I am?
I'm Choi Mina Sue.

33
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,343
"I'm Choi Mina Sue." [laughs]

34
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,386
- Who's Choi Mina Sue, exactly?
- [Kyuhyun] Yeah.

35
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,847
I mean, I don't know who that is. Do you?

36
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,266
- [Hanhae] She must be struggling.
- [Da-hee] She must be.

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,935
I'm not gonna take that sort of thing.

38
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,144
- [Min-gee] You're not?
- No.

39
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,313
I'm gonna get someone else. Another one.

40
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,690
- Just move down the line.
- Who, though?

41
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,610
If I'm being honest,
I'm super curious about Hyeon-woo.

42
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,820
[Min-gee] Wow!

43
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,862
Yeah.

44
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,447
- Hyeon-woo?
- [Jin-young] Hyeon-woo?

45
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,657
[Kyuhyun] I'm totally lost.

46
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,201
Because there's no logic
behind any of this.

47
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,911
I'm super curious about Hyeon-woo.

48
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,122
- Wow!
- Really.

49
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,791
"Wow." So I'm going to use
this opportunity.

50
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,209
- [Joo-young] As an in?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,419
I don't get it, though. What did he do?

52
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,798
Nothing. He just caught
my attention today.

53
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,135
The way he said the game changer,
he had a similar vibe to me

54
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,054
that kind of, like,
sort of hurt my feelings.

55
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,223
- [Joo-young] Oh, that bothered you?
- Yeah, it did.

56
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,767
So I figured if he got to know me
a little, he'd realize

57
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,769
that I'm actually not like her at all.

58
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,858
- [sighs]
- She's so competitive.

59
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,818
[Kyuhyun] So Mina Sue's just being…

60
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,445
- She should've gone into sports.
- [both laughing]

61
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,365
- She probably would have won a gold medal.
- [Jin-young] Ah, so true.

62
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,413
Oh, do you not have anything
for Seung-il anymore?

63
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,665
- No feelings or interest or anything?
- [Mina Sue] No.

64
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,459
Uh, Sung Il? No.

65
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,752
- Because…
- You don't have to

66
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,921
- hold back because of me.
- Oh, no. That's not it.

67
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,007
We had a one-on-one
conversation yesterday,

68
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,425
it was fine and whatever.

69
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,261
But it's just like "Okay,
we'd be good as friends."

70
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,221
Yeah, there's nothing there romantically.

71
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,473
It's kind of…

72
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,935
- They drifted apart?
- So now she's not into him?

73
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,812
Yeah, good. Let's quote her on that.

74
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,440
- [Kyuhyun] Maybe she can't remember.
- [laughs]

75
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,735
I don't think he's attracted to me.
I feel like he's intrigued by me.

76
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,862
But that doesn't mean
there's attraction behind it.

77
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,364
- [Min-gee] Yeah. He's out to explore.
- Yeah.

78
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,827
I'm curious, though.

79
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,663
- About what?
- What exactly is it about Seung-il

80
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,082
that attracts you to him?

81
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,710
No, I don't want to tell you.

82
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,962
Okay, I'll give you that. I get it.

83
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,507
Okay. But you know how you said
Su-been was cute?

84
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,094
I found Sung-il cute, too.
Yeah, I thought he was really cute.

85
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,390
I still think Su-been's cute.
I don't know what it is.

86
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,101
- He's just a really cute type, you know?
- Cute like a baby?

87
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,770
Oh! No, not like that.

88
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,855
He's just a really cute person.

89
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,483
But everyone seems to think
he's all serious.

90
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,194
Like, he doesn't joke around
or show his chill side.

91
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,696
I like that it's a side of him
that only I know.

92
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,657
- I could see the real him.
- [Joo-young] Mmm.

93
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,951
So, yeah,
I totally understand how you feel.

94
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,662
No hard feelings for not wanting to share.

95
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,793
Huh? Now it's this guy?

96
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,961
Okay, I get that.

97
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,046
But then it completely changed again.

98
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,424
So I was like, "Okay, fine."
I thought that was the end of it.

99
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,094
Then she changed her mind again,
out of the blue.

100
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,305
<i>I honestly cannot keep up with her.</i>

101
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,099
<i>And my face probably said it all.</i>

102
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,185
[Jin-young laughs]

103
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,896
- [Hanhae] She's done.
- I bet her head was hurting

104
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,691
hearing stuff like that constantly
while sharing a room.

105
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,484
[Jin-kyung] It's so hard to keep up!

106
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,695
Okay, so I think it's just
a defense mechanism.

107
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,946
Do you remember earlier

108
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,366
how Su-been sort of humiliated her
in front of everyone?

109
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,285
It felt like she was
putting up a front going,

110
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,995
"I'm Choi Mina Sue" to the other girls

111
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,831
and telling them she's now curious
about someone else

112
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,251
when, honestly, she doesn't seem
interested in him at all.

113
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,629
- Because of the way Su-been made her feel.
- Yeah. Out of pride?

114
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,256
Mm-hmm. Out of pride or something.

115
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,091
That's maybe why she's going

116
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,552
"Well, I'm going to
get to know Hyeon-woo, too."

117
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,847
You know, at the end of the day,
I think Mina Sue's first choice--

118
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,181
[Da-hee] Su-been, it's obvious.

119
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,392
It's just that
after being humiliated by Su-been,

120
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,477
she can't keep pursuing him.

121
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,438
So she's suddenly noticing Hyeon-woo.

122
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,774
But even while going on about Hyeon-woo
she's still bringing up Su-been.

123
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,109
That's exactly my point.

124
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,070
- Those aren't her true--
- I'm genuinely confused about this.

125
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,615
I'm actually finding this
a little painful to watch now.

126
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,076
- [Kyuhyun] Don't say that.
- [Jin-kyung] Let's not give up.

127
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,246
We will try our very best
to be understanding toward Mina Sue.

128
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,748
Let's do that. I'm Choi Mina Sue.

129
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,833
Even the "I have high self-esteem" part.

130
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,002
- Lee Mina Sue.
- Oh, I'm Dex Sue.

131
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,837
- [Da-hee] Dex Sue!
- [Jin-kyung] Oh my gosh.

132
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,756
- I'll go with Dex Sue.
- [Jin-kyung] Dex Sue.

133
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,799
- So, Mina Sue does make it fun.
- Sure.

134
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,843
- Never a dull moment with her.
- Entertaining.

135
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,096
[Mina Sue] <i>Let's go. I'm starving.</i>

136
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,182
[Joo-young] <i>I can't wait to see</i>
<i>what we're eating.</i>

137
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,018
- [Mina Sue] We have to make it ourselves.
- Is that kimchi?

138
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,353
Oh, mackerel pike, kimchi stew!

139
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,647
- Yeah, mackerel pike.
- Oh my gosh. It's kimchi.

140
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,233
- Wow! It's kimchi!
- [both exclaiming]

141
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,030
- [Mina Sue] We have to make it ourselves.
- [Seung-il] Let's do it. Let's go.

142
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,573
[Hee-sun] What should I do?

143
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,035
- Do you want a hand? I want to help.
- Sure.

144
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,703
[Mina Sue] What? What should I do?

145
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,664
- It's over here.
- Gonna get chopping green onions.

146
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,874
- They're so big.
- Yeah?

147
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,585
- She's gone up to Hyeon-woo.
- [Kyuhyun] Yeah.

148
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,003
Springing into action.

149
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,339
- Okay. Could you chop them?
- Do you want me to do this?

150
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,091
Yeah, that would be good.

151
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,176
You can do this too, if you feel like it.

152
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,302
No, you're doing great.

153
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,765
Oh, you're good at that.

154
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,642
I'm not too bad.

155
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,729
How do I say it's not sparking well?

156
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,980
The fire just isn't catching.

157
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,273
It's not, kick-- catching?

158
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,566
- It's not taking.
- Not at all.

159
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,609
Let's teach each other.

160
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,986
I teach you Korean. You teach me English.

161
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,989
Didn't you say you're good at Chinese?

162
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,199
When do you use it?

163
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,409
He can't tell you that.

164
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,870
- No, you can't. Don't say it.
- I can't tell you.

165
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,372
Do you prefer English?

166
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,998
Yeah, I'm more comfortable with it.

167
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,250
[Hyun-jae] Actually,

168
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,462
I expect that the first taste
would be kind of American meal.

169
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:05,216
- [Sung-hun] Oh!
- But we added some sesame oil and…

170
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,217
- Right?
- Yeah.

171
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,594
- It really tastes like Korean style.
- Korean… Yeah.

172
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,638
- Your English is good.
- [Hyun-jae] Not really.

173
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,974
- He speaks Chinese too.
- [Mina Sue] Really?

174
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,433
You speak Chinese?

175
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,060
Only, like, a little.

176
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,603
You also speak Chinese?

177
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,981
Yeah. Everyone was speaking
Chinese all of a sudden.

178
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,774
- We're all doing it.
- No, I'm all good.

179
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,067
I became more intrigued.

180
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,403
Like, I wonder what he does for a living.

181
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,447
Could it be something
crazy and unexpected?

182
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,824
That will make me more attracted to him?

183
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:33,953
It made me want to go to Paradise with him
so I could hear about his job.

184
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,497
Should I bring some firewood?

185
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,582
- Yeah.
- Great.

186
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,417
[Sung-il] Yup. Put it in.

187
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,043
- Looks good.
- [Hyeon-woo] Okay, great.

188
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,879
- [Hee-sun] Careful with your hands.
- Okay.

189
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,298
- [thud]
- [both screaming]

190
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,553
- Wow! Impressive.
- [Seung-il] You done?

191
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,346
- That was easy.
- Whoa!

192
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,140
- Amazing.
- Nothing to it.

193
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,975
I want to try it, but I don't think I can.

194
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,102
- Wanna give it a try?
- [Hee-sun] What do I do? Yeah.

195
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,271
Wow, Mina Sue!

196
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,772
[all chuckling]

197
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,484
- Put more force on the right.
- On the right? Like this?

198
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,777
No, I mean your right hand
when you're hitting it.

199
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,239
[grunts, laughs]

200
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,368
- I don't think it's gonna work.
- Yeah. No. You got this.

201
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,204
[Su-been] I'll do one last one.

202
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,455
[thuds]

203
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,540
[Hee-sun sighs] That's amazing.

204
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,334
Hyeon-woo? Give me a break.

205
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,044
- It's Su-been.
- It's Su-been, for sure.

206
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,421
- [host laughs]
- [Jin-young] You're right.

207
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,048
[Mina Sue] Did you do it? Yeah?

208
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,677
- Hold on. Are you okay?
- [Mina Sue] I'm fine.

209
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,471
- Did you hear about that?
- I did actually.

210
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,306
[Su-been] Hey, it's hot. Careful.

211
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,476
- I don't think you should do that.
- Oh, okay.

212
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,769
Oh, okay.

213
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,939
- [Su-been] I didn't upset you, did I?
- Mmm?

214
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,691
- I didn't upset you.
- Well, you know, I'm an F, right?

215
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,402
- Really?
- Yeah, I told you about it. Remember?

216
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,282
[Hyun-jae] Get the onions and radishes.

217
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,408
- [Su-been] Really?
- Yeah.

218
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,244
Su-been's not budging.

219
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,578
That's how it looks to me.

220
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,080
It's a done deal at this point.

221
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,082
But I can't shake off the feeling

222
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,334
that Su-been's acting that way
because he's angry.

223
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,752
I kind of get that sense, too.

224
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:08,506
Because, look. There's no need for him
to speak to her that coldly.

225
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,591
- I agree.
- I don't think you need to do that.

226
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,510
- It was kind of…
- Robotic.

227
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,345
[Da-hee] Yes, that's exactly how it felt.

228
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,847
But the fact that he said
"I didn't upset you, did I?"

229
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,141
means he's deliberately
speaking harshly to her.

230
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,851
It's not coming from the heart.

231
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,813
He's deliberately speaking harshly to her.

232
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,607
And there was a moment of
"Did I take it too far?"

233
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,068
They're starting to act
like an old married couple.

234
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,611
[Jin-young] They kind of are. Yeah.

235
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,281
[Sung-hun] Enjoy everybody.

236
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,908
- [Min-gee] Thanks for cooking.
- [Hee-sun] It looks so good.

237
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,412
- [Mina Sue] How much rice are you having?
- [Seung-il] I'm gonna have a ton.

238
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,247
[Hyeon-woo] I'm interested in that too.

239
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,082
Oh, wait. No, it's okay. I'm okay.

240
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,083
Come on, take it.

241
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,751
Have it, please.

242
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,296
- [Hee-sun] Thank you.
- [scoffs]

243
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,715
[Mina Sue] That's hot.

244
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,509
- [Su-been] Have some rice.
- [Hee-sun] Oh. Thank you.

245
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,304
[Min-gee] Six, maybe?

246
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,431
- Do you want some?
- Would you like some chili paste

247
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,807
- or sesame oil?
- Chili, please.

248
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,267
- How much rice?
- This much.

249
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,686
I'll serve you some of the soup.

250
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,062
[romantic music playing]

251
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,522
[sighs]

252
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,441
Su-been really takes care of her.

253
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,402
I'll serve you some of the soup.

254
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,112
Sure. Thank you.

255
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,451
- [Hee-sun] Thank you.
- [Su-been] Of course.

256
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,202
She can't help but look over.

257
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,204
Should have treated him better
when she had him.

258
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,332
I know. Why did she act that way?

259
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,334
- [Hee-sun] This is so good.
- Yeah.

260
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,295
- Thank you so much.
- Let's share it.

261
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,047
[Sung-hun] Sesame oil, if there is any.

262
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,800
- It's good. Have some more.
- Okay.

263
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,219
Mina, if you haven't had any fish yet,
help yourself.

264
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,180
Will do. Thank you so much.

265
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,015
- Wow!
- [Su-been] One more.

266
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,808
[calm, pop tune plays]

267
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,526
It's spicy.

268
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,945
I can handle it.

269
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,572
[Seung-il] You can handle it?

270
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,366
- [Min-gee] Yeah.
- [Su-been] Okay.

271
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,659
[Hyun-jae] This is good.

272
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,578
- This is tasty.
- We're really doing the whole--

273
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,996
- Mackerel pike.
- It's nothing.

274
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,623
I can handle it. I'm tough.

275
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,582
The last meal I ate…

276
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,085
- [Seung-il] I can handle it too.
- [Min-gee] Okay.

277
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,672
Wow. This is the most
I've eaten since getting here,

278
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,423
Including when I was in Paradise.

279
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,426
- Yeah. You didn't eat much there.
- Mmm.

280
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,137
It tastes a bit similar to
the kimchi stew we had in Paradise.

281
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,056
- I think this is better.
- I think so.

282
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,643
[sighs]

283
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,234
Mina Sue doesn't have anyone to talk to.

284
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,902
[Kyuhyun] No.

285
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,071
Because she specifically told Min-gee

286
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,657
she would no longer have
any interest in Seung-il.

287
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,243
- [De-hee] She did tell her.
- She shouldn't pursue him anymore.

288
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,787
- But who knows what will happen later on?
- Don't forget,

289
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,998
- "I'm Choi Mina Sue!" [laughs]
- Yes. That's exactly my point.

290
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,334
Well, whatever Mina Sue does,

291
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,586
I hope she doesn't get caught by Min-gee.

292
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,548
Yeah. Seriously.
If she gets caught this time around,

293
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,425
she could get into some serious trouble.

294
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,635
[Kyuhyun] She really needs
to watch her back.

295
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,099
[Mina Sue] Sung-hun?
I kind of need your moral support.

296
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,185
[Sung-il] I'm gonna sit with them.

297
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,021
[Mina Sue] I'm tired of this, like…

298
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,567
- [Sung-hun] You're handling it fine.
- No, I fainted, and nobody notices.

299
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,528
I'm just, like, busy
and, like, clean that shit up.

300
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,071
She fainted?

301
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,030
Did she really?

302
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,158
- The girls…
- You'll be good at it.

303
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,868
[all chattering]

304
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,288
- You feel sick?
- Yeah, like throwing up.

305
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,540
You okay? Maybe take some medicine.

306
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,083
[Sung-hun] I did say that.

307
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,544
Just sneak around the back
and ask the producer.

308
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,046
- [Min-gee] You take that seriously?
- Yeah.

309
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,549
- That was my favorite.
- What should we do then?

310
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,426
She says she's not feeling well.

311
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,219
Yeah, her stomach's bothering her.

312
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,141
- [Min-gee] Oh, well…
- [Joo-young] She's not feeling great.

313
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,100
Mmm.

314
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,023
I'm just really not
feeling well at the moment.

315
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,775
My stomach feels a bit off,
and I have a headache.

316
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,613
Maybe she has indigestion?

317
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,698
I think Mina Sue's
going through a rough time.

318
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,700
She looks worn out
mentally and physically,

319
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,119
like everything's just
weighing heavily on her.

320
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,872
- She's been under a lot of stress.
- For sure.

321
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,086
- [Sung-hun] I think they didn't see you.
- I know they didn't see me.

322
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,964
- [Sung-il] Where is everyone?
- [Mina Sue] I feel a bit let down.

323
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,382
[Hyun-jae] they're regrouping.

324
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,635
[Sung-hun] If I had seen you,
I would have helped.

325
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,636
Are you annoyed?

326
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,095
[Mina Sue] Mm.

327
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,515
- [Sung-il] Come over here.
- [Hyun-jae] Sure.

328
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,267
You guys can stay.

329
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,646
- I actually have something to say to you.
- Really?

330
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,774
Are you okay? How are you?

331
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,858
Uhh… I'm good.

332
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,860
Yeah, I'm feeling like…

333
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,862
I think you're burning
yourself out, honestly.

334
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,906
Yeah. I think I try too hard, right?

335
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,450
[Sung-hun] But that's not a bad thing.

336
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:55,084
[sighs] Min-gee, she doesn't seem happy
with her guy, like, talking to me,

337
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,545
and I don't even want him to talk to me.

338
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,383
You feel like you have
to walk on eggshells.

339
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,469
And I'm honestly
so kind to everyone here.

340
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,846
Every time some other girl
wants to talk to the guy

341
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,723
I was just, like, "Let them be."

342
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,809
- I want to talk to Su-been, but…
- Right, right.

343
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,310
I know, like, Hee-sun…

344
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,563
Like, relies on him a lot.

345
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:19,066
So that's why I just let them talk
instead of, like, budging

346
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,859
- between their relationship.
- True.

347
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,238
And even when Sung-il…
I was interested in him since day one

348
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,658
but since there's Min-gee, I…

349
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,160
- You let go?
- Yeah.

350
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,454
And then now,
they're like, they're trying…

351
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,959
When someone tries to talk to me,
I feel like I'm being the villain.

352
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,755
And I've honestly been
pretty kind to most people here.

353
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,510
And the fact that I was kind of
feeling like I was sick there, and I…

354
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,722
I felt like people didn't care
and were being really selfish.

355
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:53,684
- And I've been so good to the girls.
- Into the girls?

356
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,438
I've been so good to the girls, like
they may be wearing my, like, bikinis.

357
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,648
- Really?
- Yeah, I like, lend it to them.

358
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,109
I, like, lend them my stuff.

359
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,777
And then I always try to, like…

360
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,282
ask them if they need anything,
and then I would help them out.

361
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,118
But then all I get is like, oh…

362
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,164
Like the guy I'm interested in
is sort of, like, interested in you.

363
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,334
And they start getting
kind of, like, iffy about it.

364
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,335
- Yeah.
- So.

365
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,463
[sighs] I'm like…

366
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,216
I think I'm cooler
than most people here. Not gonna lie.

367
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,427
- Cooler? I think so, too.
- Yeah.

368
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,762
I already know that, but…

369
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,556
And I'm always, like, smiling
and, like, I'm always…

370
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,599
I try to be the one

371
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:37,227
to liven up the mood,
but today I'm like burnt out.

372
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,021
Don't gas yourself out like that.

373
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,565
It's fine,
but if you get tired, just chill out.

374
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,317
- Yeah.
- You don't need to do that.

375
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,402
[Mina Sue sighs]

376
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,904
- What?
- Su-been's been…

377
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,282
I think he's busy trying
to get to know someone else.

378
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:55,079
But then it's just like it feels
calculated and almost fake, honestly.

379
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,915
[chill, lo-fi tune plays]

380
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,459
Mm.

381
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,712
[Sung-hun] I always say…
Because I always think, in reality…

382
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,593
- You get me?
- Mmm.

383
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,471
- You get me?
- Mmm.

384
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,644
[knock on door]

385
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,479
[Hee-sun] Yes?

386
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,816
Oh, you're here. All good.
I'll let you rest.

387
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,317
No, it's okay, what's up?

388
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,610
Did you just want to rest?

389
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,654
- [Hee-sun] No. I'm free.
- You look pretty tired.

390
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,615
- [Sung-hun] Dude, I feel sorry for you.
- [Mina Sue] It's okay.

391
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,367
[Su-been] Let's go.

392
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,788
- [both laughing]
- [door opens]

393
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,082
- Sorry for you. Honestly.
- It doesn't matter.

394
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,423
[sniffs]

395
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,925
What was the game changer girl like?

396
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,553
- I feel comfortable talking to her.
- Yeah.

397
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,222
- And I find her kind of engaging.
- Mmm.

398
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,392
- But there's nothing beyond that.
- Mmm.

399
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,853
So today I really wanted to stay here.

400
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,147
Mmm.

401
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,735
What's the guy like? I'm curious.

402
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,196
Not really sure,
but he seems nice and really confident.

403
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,407
He looked big, like, strong.

404
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,410
I was like, "The games are gonna be tough
now that he's here."

405
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,120
You're good at them.

406
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,580
- Huh?
- You're good at them.

407
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,874
- Uh, I'm not too bad.
- [sighs]

408
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,253
- But there's someone…
- [laughs]

409
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,797
…I want to take to Paradise
so I can give her the experience.

410
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,757
[laughs]

411
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,008
- I wonder who.
- Oh.

412
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,509
Some girl.

413
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,556
How are you doing?

414
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,726
Me? Well, it's been a bit tough,

415
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,063
but I feel really at ease now
because I'm clear about my feelings.

416
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:44,980
Mm.

417
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:51,153
Once I get hooked on something
or someone, I am 100% in, so…

418
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,113
I'm a bit like that as well.

419
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:54,990
- Really?
- Yeah.

420
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,244
When I get hooked on someone,
I go all in on them.

421
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,664
But if it doesn't work out or whatever,
I just naturally drift away.

422
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,041
That's valid.

423
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,586
What about friends of the opposite sex?

424
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,714
I don't think that guys and girls
can be just friends.

425
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,382
I don't have guy friends.

426
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,968
- I really don't have any.
- You don't have any either?

427
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,053
I'm glad.

428
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,054
[both sigh]

429
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,972
So we're a good match.

430
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,100
[both laugh]

431
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,353
It's hard to date someone
with different views on things like this.

432
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,647
- Totally.
- It'd be tough. We're a good match.

433
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,690
[both laugh]

434
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,193
We're a good match. Even in Inferno.

435
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,779
I wonder if we would be in Paradise too.

436
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,280
- You're not sure?
- Sorry?

437
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,990
- You're not sure?
- We'll have to see.

438
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,033
[Hee-sun laughs]

439
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,494
- Won't know till then.
- That's true.

440
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,832
I think you're the most
mysterious one here.

441
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,501
Yeah, actually, I feel like
no one really knows me.

442
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,920
I think it's because
you're usually really shy.

443
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,296
Do you think I'm shy?

444
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,341
Well, I mean, I think people
find you cute, you know?

445
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,259
Yeah.

446
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,261
Which is actually true.

447
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,972
- What is?
- You have a cute face.

448
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,974
Oh. [grunts]

449
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:02,891
Do I?

450
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,809
[both laugh]

451
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,644
- Don't you think so?
- I don't know.

452
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,897
- Wait. Do you not like being called cute?
- I do.

453
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,900
- [Su-been] Don't you think so?
- [Hee-sun] I don't know.

454
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,528
- Wait. Do you not like being called cute?
- I do.

455
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,118
Is it cool if I go somewhere else?
I don't like having to hear them.

456
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,121
Let's go far. I love having space.

457
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,541
[sighs softly]

458
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,087
[Mina Sue sighs]

459
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,133
I feel ugly and…

460
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,345
- I feel unattractive right now.
- Don't say that.

461
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,141
- Oh, man.
- Stop overthinking. You're beautiful.

462
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,143
I think I am.

463
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,689
Then… then something's wrong
with my personality.

464
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,860
- No, your personality is great.
- No, it isn't.

465
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,406
What's Su-been's psychology? As a guy?

466
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,074
He's very quiet.

467
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,619
But the more I see him,
he seems conservative.

468
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,622
Yeah, I don't think he liked the fact

469
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,957
that I was, like, talking to other people.

470
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,085
I don't get men sometimes.

471
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,759
[gulps]

472
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,972
I'm gonna let Su-been go now.

473
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,061
Dude, it's day five.

474
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,395
Chill out.

475
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,189
I have no chill.

476
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,607
[laughs]

477
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,733
I have no chill.

478
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,901
I have no chill.

479
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,027
That's not who I am.

480
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,445
I'm, like, I have no chill.

481
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,822
- I'm No chill-Na Sue Choi.
- Really?

482
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,826
Yeah, I'm so bad at keeping my cool,
but really good at not showing it.

483
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,120
I'm actually a really sensitive person.

484
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,082
I just don't let people see when I'm upset

485
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,541
or going through something.

486
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,460
I usually do it behind closed doors.

487
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,545
Yeah, very true.

488
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,382
That's my way of being considerate
to others, you know?

489
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,761
And then because I do that,
people have no idea that I'm struggling.

490
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,971
- [sighs in agreement]
- Yeah.

491
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,139
That's why it's so…

492
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,231
[emotional music plays]

493
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,108
Don't cry.

494
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:18,819
Hey.

495
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,487
What the hell?

496
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,160
[sniffs] I'm sorry. I'm--

497
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,873
- [crying] I'm sorry.
- Here.

498
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,792
Wipe your tears.

499
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,217
It's okay to cry sometimes.

500
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,393
[sniffles]

501
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,023
[Min-gee] They're talking
over there. Wait.

502
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,691
I think she's crying.

503
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,234
[Seung-il] Why?

504
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,361
Well, she's actually really sensitive.

505
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,198
She goes back and forth about things,
but women are often like that.

506
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,869
I wish I could be more like that
sometimes, to be honest.

507
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,163
- [Seung-il] What, why?
- My heart could change on a whim.

508
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,040
[Seung-il] I like you
just the way you are.

509
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,084
I can't do what she does.
Like "You're gonna do that? Fine.

510
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,919
I'm gonna go off and do my own thing too."

511
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,504
- You like, stay and chase?
- Yeah.

512
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,923
I'm like if I try harder,
maybe he'll like me.

513
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,303
It's not true.
I'm sure they care about you.

514
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,680
I don't think so.

515
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,515
The way I see it,

516
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,810
a romance movie
can't only have romance in it.

517
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,312
That would be boring.

518
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,230
There must be some friendship, some, like…

519
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,274
- That's right.
- But, like, out of those…

520
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,234
From everyone else's point of view,

521
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,487
I don't think they think this is friends.

522
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,529
That's my point.

523
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,075
That's my point!
What is-- I mean… [groans]

524
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,826
It's not like there's none.

525
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,495
It's not like there's no romance.

526
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,790
- Well, it's more than--
- I'm not 100% in the friend zone, right?

527
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,917
Mm, that's true.

528
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,884
This isn't just your average
romance to me.

529
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,970
More than, like, love interest.

530
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,139
What's that mean?

531
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,226
I don't know. Like, like…

532
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,647
I think we care about each other.

533
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,191
But the thing is

534
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,444
it's not that I want to care about you,
but it's kind of like…

535
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,989
you're under my skin,

536
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,326
- but not by choice.
- Mmm.

537
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:35,163
It's like I really don't want to look
at you, but I literally can't help it.

538
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,998
Mm-hmm.

539
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,291
Um, can I be honest?

540
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,962
I don't think I can love anyone here
except for you.

541
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,464
- But then I think--
- Chill out with that.

542
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,384
Whoa. Whoa! What?

543
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,805
[Mina Sue sighs wearily]
I don't want to face anyone.

544
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,142
I think I'm gonna go to sleep soon.

545
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,525
I'm gonna be honest.
I can no longer relate to Mina Sue.

546
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,193
With that kind of behavior…

547
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,322
For me, at first, it was kind of like
I feel so bad for Mina Sue.

548
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,367
She threw herself into the show,
determined to do her best,

549
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,743
getting to know different people

550
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,912
while taking care
of her fellow contestants.

551
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,290
It's so unfortunate
she has such a hard time.

552
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,209
She even ended up with
an upset stomach because of it.

553
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,628
But now, I don't really know.

554
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,674
Okay, to be completely honest
with Mina Sue, the way I see it is

555
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:31,136
this is how she's played this whole game,
the campfire and everything.

556
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,763
She's free to date whoever she wants,
but at the end of the day,

557
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,349
she's made people uncomfortable
to some extent.

558
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,350
Given everything,

559
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,437
the fact that she doesn't want to suffer
through an uncomfortable situation

560
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,272
- is really selfish of her.
- Mm.

561
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,900
Mina Sue probably thinks
that in her own way,

562
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,569
she's been really nice
to everyone, you know?

563
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,072
She mentioned lending her stuff
to the other girls and all that.

564
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,408
In her mind, she's doing them favors,

565
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,660
but from the other girl's perspectives,

566
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,495
they're not here to make friends.

567
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,540
They're here to find love,
so it's entirely natural for them

568
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,584
to keep their distance from her,

569
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,753
especially when she makes them nervous

570
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,172
by going after the guys
they've expressed interest in.

571
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,049
Plus, what Mina Sue
thinks are acts of

572
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,885
kindness might not come across
that way to the other girls.

573
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,553
This is what she needs to learn.

574
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,223
Relationships aside,
there are times when someone

575
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,141
just completely breaks down mentally,

576
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,644
particularly in an environment
like this one.

577
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,729
When that happens,
instead of running around,

578
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,273
stirring up trouble
and making everything about yourself,

579
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,693
you just need to lay low,
stay quiet and do nothing.

580
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,987
At least until everything blows over,
you know?

581
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,822
Just let things cool down first.

582
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,158
- Yeah, that's right.
- [Jin-kyung sighs]

583
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,452
So, yeah, I think
this is just unforgivable.

584
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,788
- That's how I feel.
- [Hanhae] Yeah.

585
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,998
Anyway, Mina Sue says
she's letting Sue-been go.

586
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,418
- What do you think about that?
- She has zero intention of letting him go.

587
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,338
In my opinion, that was just her pride
talking in the moment.

588
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,633
In that moment, she was all
"Whatever. I don't need Su-been."

589
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,842
But that was just then.

590
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,387
The second she sees him,
they'll be back on.

591
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,846
You can't turn off your feelings.

592
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,099
Can't change how you feel.
It doesn't work like that.

593
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,603
PARADISE
JO I-GEON AND HAM YE-JIN

594
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,565
[Ye-jin] What have you done so far?

595
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,234
I've been having lots of fun.

596
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,611
- I've had a nice time.
- Only a nice time?

597
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,114
- No, truly, I have. It's been great.
- Oh, okay.

598
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,324
You had a great time, then, huh?

599
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,452
- I mean, how fun was it exactly?
- It was interesting, actually.

600
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,998
Go-eun was totally different
from my first impression of her.

601
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:23,915
Go-eun?

602
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,876
[I-geon] Mmm.

603
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,589
- Want some wine?
- [Ye-jin] Sure.

604
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,174
Ah, thank you so much.

605
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,095
- [bubbling]
- [romantic music plays]

606
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,598
- [laughs]
- [glass clinking]

607
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,899
Thank you so much.

608
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,737
Can I ask you why you chose me?

609
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,492
Well…

610
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,119
[laughs]

611
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,079
…I picked you because you were pretty.

612
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,124
I picked you because you were pretty.

613
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,710
- Am I the prettiest?
- Yes, the prettiest.

614
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,253
Am I in first place?

615
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,630
I'm number one?

616
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,342
You were first place in my opinion, yeah.

617
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,888
Really? So I was the prettiest to you.

618
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,599
Never know what'll happen tomorrow.

619
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,143
[laughs] Ah, I see. Touche.

620
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:30,940
How old are you?

621
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,568
What do you think?

622
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,697
- Twenty-five?
- Twenty-five?

623
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,324
Yes, 25 or six.

624
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,533
Or six?

625
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,287
You're not gonna be shocked, are you?

626
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,663
I won't be.

627
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,664
I'm 30.

628
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,209
Are you really?

629
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,418
[both laugh]

630
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,920
Your acting was too obvious there.

631
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:56,883
You good?

632
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,553
I'm older than you.

633
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,222
- Are you really?
- Mm.

634
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,432
- Much older.
- Much older?

635
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,685
- I'm 34.
- Seriously?

636
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,145
Thirty-four?

637
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,399
I can't believe you're 34.

638
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,862
Are you happy to have someone older here?

639
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,240
Yeah. I actually like guys
who are older than me.

640
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,909
But all the guys in Inferno
are young and look young.

641
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,122
- Gosh, I'm old.
- What?

642
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,791
- You really think that you're old?
- Yes. I'm so old.

643
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,836
I might be the oldest
out of all the girls that are here.

644
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,171
Isn't that a good thing?

645
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,882
[scoffs]

646
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,806
So how are you finding it?
Have you been having fun in Inferno?

647
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:50,019
In Inferno, I've been finding it
a little tough, honestly.

648
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,354
Why?

649
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,317
I think just because I feel
like I haven't found my match yet.

650
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,318
[sighs in agreement]

651
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,656
How come you haven't found anyone yet?

652
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,910
- You look like you'd be really popular.
- Me? I'm not. What makes you say that?

653
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:06,911
- My--
- You're not?

654
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,207
- I'm surprised.
- Are you, really?

655
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,959
I thought you'd be the most popular.

656
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:13,918
Really?

657
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,545
Thanks for that.

658
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,092
So do you think that's been
making you feel down?

659
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,012
No, I wouldn't say I was down. It's just…

660
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,306
You know, it just felt like everyone else

661
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:29,642
- had something going on apart from me.
- [sighs softly]

662
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,645
I'm kind of in a situation
where I need to push my way in,

663
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,483
but I've never done that before,
so I don't even know where to start.

664
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,028
What's getting in the way?

665
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,112
Getting in the way?

666
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,822
This whole experience is a lot more

667
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,951
emotionally draining
than I thought it would be.

668
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,203
[Ye-jin giggles]

669
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,955
- Want to know how to attract guys?
- Yeah.

670
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,709
I thought I could pull it off, though.
[laughs awkwardly]

671
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:06,054
- I genuinely felt so grateful.
- Because I picked you?

672
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,096
Yeah, exactly.

673
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,809
Things were going a certain way,
and then you came along.

674
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,192
[I-geon] I see.

675
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,074
Things aren't really working out here.

676
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,159
- [Kyuhyun sighs deeply]
- No.

677
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,079
Feels like Ye-jin just hasn't
found her match quite yet.

678
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,665
- Yeah, basically.
- Ye-jin's totally lost her confidence.

679
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,750
I know, I know. She's like a poor puppy.

680
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,002
- [Kyuhyun] She is.
- Caught in the rain.

681

PARADISE
LEE HA-EUN AND KIM JAE-JIN

683
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,635
- Welcome.
- Oh! Hello.

684
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,638
Wow!

685
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,432
This is amazing.

686
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,892
- It's huge in here.
- Right?

687
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,727
It's enormous.

688
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,107
[Ha-eun] Give me a tour of the place.

689
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,692
- A tour?
- Yeah.

690
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,944
I'm not the owner, but…

691
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,321
- You look like you're the owner, though.
- [Jae-jin laughs]

692
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,491
- Well, yeah, since I arrived before you.
- You did.

693
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,243
- I'll be the owner.
- That suits you.

694
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,036
You look very wealthy right now.

695
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,663
So what's this room?

696
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,540
[both laughing]

697
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:19,544
This is where I have my tea
every single morning.

698
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,463
- Gosh. Is this the tea you drink?
- Yes, that's it.

699
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,798
What kind of tea is it?

700
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,175
This is, uh, boiled chamomile tea.

701
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,636
Nice. Chamomile is perfect for relaxing.

702
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,306
- And this is the bedroom.
- Is this where you sleep?

703
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,058
I gotta say, it seems very short
for your height.

704
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,768
Do you lie on it diagonally?

705
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,978
- Yeah, I do.
- Gotcha.

706
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,105
- Since this is my own private space.
- [exclaims]

707
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,149
I sleep at an angle.

708
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,735
- This is where I…
- The shower.

709
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,486
Yes. This is where I shower.

710
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,572
[exclaims in surprise]

711
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,573
What about there?

712
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,910
Oh, yeah, that's where I take care
of a lot of business.

713
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,330
- [laughs raucously]
- [funny tune plays]

714
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,748
Stop it. You're so funny.

715
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,958
I get why everyone calls you
the funny man.

716
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,461
- [sighs] I'm not actually a comedian.
- [exclaims]

717
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,047
- You're not?
- I haven't told what my job is yet.

718
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,717
- [Kyuhyun] They get along really well.
- She's loving it.

719
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,676
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

720
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,680
Oh, so I've heard that you've already

721
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,849
- been here to Paradise twice before.
- That's right.

722
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,059
- That's correct?
- Yes.

723
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:20,730
So to be completely honest with you,
I was a bit shocked when I heard that.

724
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,483
You can't believe I've been here twice
because I'm not hot?

725
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,609
That's not what I meant.

726
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,735
[both laughing]

727
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,028
Seriously, it's not.

728
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,531
I'm getting a bit of an ego.
I must leave a good first impression.

729
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,784
I didn't pick you
based on your first impression.

730
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,619
- [chuckles] Good. That's a relief.
- [laughs]

731
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,163
- I'll go back to being humble.
- Yeah, you do that.

732
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,331
No, I'm just kidding.

733
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,542
The reason is I wanted
to talk to you a little more

734
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,295
because you were the hardest guy
for me to figure out.

735
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,090
- You are…
- You had a decent sense of the other?

736
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,508
Yeah, I'd say I did.

737
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,593
I couldn't get a sense
of what you'd be like.

738
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,719
I can't get a read on you.

739
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,097
It seems like you don't express
your true feelings.

740
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,182
At least that's how it looks.

741
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,558
Mmm.

742
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,686
Am I wrong?

743
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,022
No. I think that you're
a good judge of character.

744
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,023
You think so?

745
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,943
[gentle guitar tune plays]

746
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,947
- What do you want to know about me?
- About you?

747
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,908
I really want you to tell me
more about your background.

748
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,662
Mm. I used to be a dancer.

749
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,122
Oh.

750
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,458
But now I work as a beauty model.

BEAUTY MODEL

756
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,937
You used to dance,
and now you're a beauty model?

757
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,814
What kind of dance?

758
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,733
Hip-hop.

759
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,235
You know how it's on
a lot of TV shows these days?

760
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,570
- Of course.
- Yeah, right.

761
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,614
- So I trained in that kind of dance.
- Mm.

762
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,201
And what do you do for work?

763
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,078
Oh. We're getting right into it.

764
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,205
Are you maybe a Daoist or…

765
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,915
A professional Daoist?

766
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,000
A job in Daoism.

767
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,715
Yeah, or maybe make pottery or something?

768
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,550
[Jae-jin exclaims]

769
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:16,262

- Oh, dancer?

[both laugh]

771
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,601
Interesting.

[Ha-eun] <i>Jae-jin and I share</i>
<i>an interest in dance,</i>

773
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,690
but we do completely different genres,
which I think is really cool.

774
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,985
The fact that his type of dancing
is something I never trained in

775
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,988
and can't do at all,
really intrigued and fascinated me.

776
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,907
He's definitely sparked my interest.

777
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,744
Can I ask how old you are?

778
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,746
How old do I look? Take a guess.

779
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,790
I bet I can guess correctly.

780
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,832
Okay. Do it.

781
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,293
Between 23 and 28.

782
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,712
That's cheating. That's too wide a range.

783
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,547
[Jae-jin laughing] So I'm correct.

784
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,258
Fine.

785
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,426
[Ha-eun laughs]

786
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,972
So you switched to modeling about 22?
No, no, 23.

787
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,682
You got it. I was born in '03.

788
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,478
You probably can't guess my age.

789
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,521
I think I can.

790
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,606
Then guess the year. The year I was born.

791
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,774
Twenty…

792
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,652
You're 28.

793
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,030
Okay, yeah, that's my guess.

794
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,950
Wow, you're good.

795
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,035
Good job. You actually got it right.

796
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,288
I knew that I would get it.

797
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,666

799
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,838
[Ha-eun] Do you have an ideal type?

800
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,590
- Ideal type?
- Appearance, personality?

801
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,886
I was surprised before because
not many people talk about sense of humor.

802
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,181
- But it's really important to me, too.
- Is it really?

803
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,643
It's so important to me,
like, it's essential.

804
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,437
I liked the landlord thing
you did earlier.

805
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,398
I love doing bits like that, you know?

806
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,233
- Do you like role play?
- I do, yeah.

807
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,609
It was so funny.

808
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,279
Oh, but that was meant
to be sophisticated.

809
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,489
- Yeah.
- It was sophisticated.

00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,826
- [both laughing]

Spending that time together
really deepened my attraction to her.

816
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,303
She has a very mature side to her
that I really love.

817
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,181
She's also got a fun and playful side.

818
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,975
And I love the way
she leads conversations.

819
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,351
I totally vibe with that.

820
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,479
It's rare to hear Jae-jin talk like this.

821
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,483
Jae-jin and I have a very
similar sense of humor.

822
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,777
So we clicked on a lot
of different levels.

823
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,988
More than I thought we would.

824
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,364
And saying that,

825
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,617
I felt more comfortable with Sung-min.

00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,952

- Mmm. It's tasty.

00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,334
You don't get food like this
in Inferno, okay?

831
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,172
I wanted to have a meal

<i>We haven't met before, but it felt</i>
<i>like I'd known him for a long time.</i>

836
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,268
Kind of like a friend or a cousin.

837
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,979
The date really helped
get rid of all my tension.

838
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,649
We had a really fun
and chill time together.

839
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,276
Like a cousin?

840
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,987
- She's totally friend-zoned him now.
- Friend zone.

841
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,616
Anyway, it seems Han and Jae-jin
instantly vibe

842
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,202
- and really hit it off with each other.
- Yeah, totally.

843
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,120
- They clicked.
- [Kyuhyun] They got along well.

844
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,539
And I've noticed
that Jae-jin and Joo-young

845
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,960
don't seem to bounce off each other
as much as Jae-jin and Ha-eun do.

846
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:34,919
That's right.

847
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,838
It kind of felt like Joo-young
was laughing by herself the whole time.

848
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,216
But with these two,
there's a back-and-forth exchange.

849
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,635
[Jin-kyung] Their responses
to each other are funny.

850
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,554
Do you find yourself attracted to
girls who respond well to your jokes?

851
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,932
Say you weren't attracted to her before.
Then she laughs.

852
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,184
- Absolutely.
- Of course, absolutely.

853
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,352
As long as it's not fake.

854
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,730
How about a girl not your type at all,
but responds really well

855
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,566
versus a girl who is your type
but responds badly?

856
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,611
- I'll just provide the responses.
- [hosts laugh]

857
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,779
[all laughing]

858
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,198
- Kyuhyun?
- I'll be like "Try this. It's delicious."

859
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,199
Guys are all the same.

860
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,868
- You know, when you…
- "Wow, delicious." All by myself.

861
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,913
- Here it's out of this world.
- You weren't like that before.

862
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,749
Well, if she's my type,
do I even need a response?

863
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,419
- Ah, Of course.
- That should be part of the package.

864
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,421
[Hyun-jae] You want a drink?

865
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,256
[Joo-young laughs] Okay.

866
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,426
Do you have high self-esteem?

867
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,510
I'd say it's high.

868
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,929
I had a loving upbringing.

869
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,097
[sighs in agreement]

870
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,684
I have high self-esteem, thanks
to all the love I got from my family.

871
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,186
Me too.

872
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,522
I'm really grateful for that.

873
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,941
Oh, really, you are?

874
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,568
Because it

875
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,738
obviously feels genuine
to those around me.

876
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,406
Not like I'm full of myself.

877
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,241
I think it's an attractive quality

878
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,910
because people think this guy
genuinely loves himself.

879
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,080
And to me,
that has nothing to do with looks.

880
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,624
I completely relate
to everything you're saying.

881
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,584
Hmm. Really?

882
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,717
So you know how you've said to me
before, that I'm mature?

883
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,137
I think the main reason for that is how
I was brought up.

884
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,638
My family, particularly my parents.

885
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,684
So I'm also really grateful to my parents
for the way they raised me.

886
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,021
Like you, I see myself as someone
with high self-esteem.

887
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,105
I'm a confident person.

888
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,984
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, I think so, too.

889
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,362
That's so weird.
The fact that we think the same way.

890
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,322
I don't think I've ever found that before.

891
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,281
[Hyun-jae] I know.

892
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:32,203
I'd say my ideal type is a girl
who treats her parents well.

893
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,746
Mmm. I'm good to my parents.

894
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:34,997
Her parents, not mine.

895
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,916
Would you say you're good to your parents?

896
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,959
As a son, I behave like a daughter.

897
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,544
[sighs in agreement]

898
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,797
Oh really? Lucky them.

899
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,883
[Jin-kyung] I think I'm starting
to like Hyun-jae.

900
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,260
His attractiveness
just shot through the roof.

901
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,096
[hosts laughing]

902
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,431
I behave like a daughter.

903
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,516
[sighs in agreement]

904
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,727
That's awesome.

905
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,771
- You think?
- Mm.

906
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,731
Totally.

907
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,151
Just like I'm thankful for the love
my parents have given me.

908
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,654
I'd want the guy I'm with
to have that same kind

909
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,447
of appreciation toward his family.

910
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,534
- It says a lot, you know.
- That's true.

911
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,327
That's an important quality
in a boyfriend.

912
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,286
[Hyun-jae exclaims]

913
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,456
The most important thing to me
is what they're doing with their life.

914
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,583
- What their future dreams are.
- The vision?

915
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,836
- Yes, vision.
- Same here.

916
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,046
It's not really about
what kind of job he has.

917
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,548
That isn't a big deal to me.

918
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,675
What I really care about
is that he feels proud

919
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,969
of what he does and puts effort into it.

920
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,303
I'm exactly the same.

921
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,013
- Really?
- Totally.

922
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,600
I really want to know what you do.

923
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,602
You're good at Chinese,
you're good at English.

924
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,854
[laughs]

925
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,022
- Chinese.
- If you want to know…

926
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,691
- It'll be a dollar. [laughs]
- Exactly.

927
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,276
We have to go to Paradise.

928
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,612
I'll show you. I'll win the next game.

929
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,074
During my conversation

930
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,494
with Hyun-jae yesterday,
I learned a lot of new things about him.

931
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,539
Things I hadn't expected
that allowed me to get to know him more.

932
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,083
Because of that,
my feelings have shifted a bit.

933
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,003
Now Hyun-jae and Jae-jin
are pretty much neck and neck.

934
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,215
[Mina Sue] Oh, Hyeon-woo,
would you like to chat?

935
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,134
- [Hyeon-woo] Sure. Let's go.
- Yeah.

936
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,929
- [Hyeon-woo] Ta-da!
- Oh, wow, the photos!

937
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,515
They're still here.
I was checking them out earlier.

938
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,435
Finally, Mina Sue said
she was curious about him.

939
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,854
- Is it Mina Sue and Hyeon-woo?
- Yeah, that's good.

940
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,314
- I gotta see this.
- Yeah.

941
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,648
She's working her magic.

942
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,569
I really wanted to talk to you,
but I didn't know how

943
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,155
because you're the top pick
for every girl here.

944
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:34,575
You always seem to have someone around you
or waiting to get a moment with you.

945
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,702
So I wasn't sure when to approach you.

946
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,579
- Really?
- You're just so popular.

947
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,664
That's nice of you to say. Thank you.

948
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:45,628
I think you're the kind of person
whose true worth becomes clear

949
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,964
after a few days
rather than during the first impression.

950
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,759
You seem so relaxed and confident.

951
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,344
I'm curious what your secret is.

952
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,262
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

953
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,515
I'm actually struggling a little lately.

954
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,767
- You can tell, right?
- No, I hadn't noticed.

955
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,684
- Oh, really?
- No.

956
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,896
You seem like someone with standards.
That's really attractive.

957
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,272
- Really?
- Yeah.

958
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:09,026
In the guys' room, a bunch of guys said
they admire how you're truly yourself.

959
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:12,446
You don't hold back or act a certain way
to impress anyone. It's attractive.

960
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,740
I don't think I can be admired
for being that way.

961
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,200
- Not true.
- Have you seen me?

962
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,161
The guy I went to Paradise with
is hanging out with another girl,

963
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,623
and I'm just stuck watching like a loser.

964
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,125
- Totally valid.
- It does kind of bother me.

965
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,462
- If you said you weren't bothered by it…
- I'm pretending not to care,

966
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,382
All of this is really hurting my ego.

967
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,801
But I also don't want
to take him away from her

968
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,595
because they look so happy together.

969
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,389
So you're respecting them?

970
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,975
Yes. But then what about my own feelings?

971
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,351
- [Hyeon-woo] Mmm.
- Yeah.

972
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,688
I'd love your advice on what I should do
about my own feelings

973
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,565
in this type of situation.

974
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,692
Oh. Right, okay.

975
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,277
This is so hard.

976
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,403
What would you do?

977
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,822
You strike me as someone
who sticks to their principles.

978
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,783
Like, you follow what you believe
is right, no matter what.

979
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:01,495
I feel like I could probably learn
a lot from you.

980
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,081
I find myself
asking, "What would Hyeon-woo do?"

981
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,125
Well, all right.

982
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,713
If there were two drinks like this,
which one would you have?

983
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:12,798
Just do that.

984
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,342
Go with the most natural choice.

985
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,762
I've tried to do that, but I…

986
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,764
But are you also curious

987
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,725
to see what this one tastes like?

988
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,144
Yeah.

989
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,478
Then go for it. Try both.

990
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,732
Rather than overthinking things,

991
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,818
and like hiding your true self,

992
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,237
one thing to try
whenever something comes up

993
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:39,116
would be to just go with
whatever your gut feeling is.

994
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,662
Hyeon-woo is such a sincere person.

995
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,539
I really admire that about him.

996
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:49,001
He's very genuine and sincere. Yeah.

997
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,837
Out of all the guys
in terms of attraction,

998
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,008
I would say that he's now sitting
at the very top of my list.

999
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,510
[Hanhae] He's in.

1000
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,472
[laughs]

1001
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,726
For number two,
I'm thinking it's Sung-hun.

1002
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:10,105
Actually, no, I still can't quite seem
to shake off my attraction to Sung-il

1003
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:15,319
but he seems like someone
that I just shouldn't be attracted to.

1004
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:20,366
It's just way too obvious
that there's one girl

1005
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,285
who really wants Sung-il all to herself.

1006
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,454
Min-gee.

1007
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,874
I'm scared.

1008
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,168
Oh, my gosh.
I'm too scared to even say it.

1009
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,589
You go ahead and do what you want.

1010
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,715
Seriously.

1011
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:38,634
[Da-hee] Wow!

1012
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,429
Wait, so Hyeon-woo has become
Mina Sue's top choice,

1013
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,139
with Sung-hun in second place

1014
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,392
and she's also attracted to Seung-il.

1015
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,728
Has she really lost
all interest in Su-been? Doubt it, right?

1016
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,648
- [Da-hee] I don't think so. No way.
- No. Never.

1017
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,943
What she's saying here is that she wants
to take things further with Seung-il.

1018
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,153
She's worried about
how Min-gee will react.

1019
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,238
[Hanhae] That's right.

1020
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,948
I wish Mina Sue would just go

1021
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,825
"I'm here to do something
no one's ever done

1022
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,368
on a dating show before."

1023
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,746
To find out how every guy here feels
about me, and then do what she says.

1024
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,165
- I'd actually prefer that.
- There's not much time left.

1025
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,292
[laughing]

1026
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,552
- [Sung-hun] Hello. Good morning.
- [Mina Sue] Good morning.

1027
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,845
[Hyun-jae] Good morning.

1028
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,014
- [Su-been] Hello.
- Good morning.

1029
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,100
- [Sung-hun] Good morning.
- [Mina Sue] Good morning.

1030
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,810
Ooh.

1031
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,523
- [inhales sharply]
- It's pretty chilly.

1032
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,570
[Seung-il] They gave us
something good today.

1033
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,696
[Min-gee] Wow. It's bread.

1034
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,781
[Hee-sun shivers]

1035
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,492
- You're cold?
- Yeah.

1036
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,829
Is this the only outerwear you have?
The hoodie I gave you? Really?

1037
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,998
- Yeah, pretty much just this.
- Oh, really?

1038
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,378
- Did you sleep well?
- Oh, yeah. Did you sleep well?

1039
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,297
[Su-been] I did. Really well.

1040
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,507
- Want to sit there?
- [Hee-sun] Sounds good.

1041
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,676
[Min-gee] How do you use those things?

1042
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,681
- Do you want me to…
- This isn't the weather for a tank top.

1043
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:08,682
- It isn't?
- No.

1044
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,058
[Min-gee] Everyone…

1045
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,977
[Seung-il] You'll learn
once you catch a cold.

1046
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,437
Thank you.

1047
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:20,819
[Hee-sun] Thank you.

1048
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,655
[Su-been] Mm? Yeah.

1049
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,616
Her face says it all.

1050
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,451
[Mina Sue] Mm. Can I show you something?

1051
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,286
You have a mark on your face there.

1052
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,622
- Really? Right here?
- Uh-huh. Yeah, you do.

1053
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,214
She doesn't want to look,
but she can't help it.

1054
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,632
No, it's just impossible.

1055
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,722
[Mina Sue] <i>No matter how I look at it,</i>

1056
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,308
I can't help but feel humiliated

1057
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,478
seeing him with another girl
right in front of me.

1058
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,687
I seem so pathetic.

1059
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,525
And let's be honest,
no one finds a pathetic girl attractive.

1060
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:03,570
So I've reached a point where
I no longer want to get to know a guy

1061
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,864
who makes me feel small, or look pathetic.

1062
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,785
[Min-gee] Have you talked
with Su-been lately, Su-been?

1063
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:13,205
No, I haven't had time to,
but I do want to talk to him.

1064
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,915
Maybe today, if I get a chance.

1065
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,001
Yeah, look, I don't know.

1066
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,421
I don't want to get
to know Su-been anymore.

1067
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,965
He makes me feel like shit.

1068
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,718
But didn't Su-been express
a lot of interest in you?

1069
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,345
[Mina Sue] At the start.

1070
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:31,265
All I see now is him
with another girl every day,

1071
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,933
being affectionate in my face,

1072
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,186
and her wearing his hoodie like
they're in a relationship or something.

1073
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,105
But you can't think that way.

1074
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,440
Su-been has barely talked
to anyone all this time.

1075
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,734
He's just trying
to get to know people now.

1076
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,862
He's finally having
a conversation with Hee-sun.

1077
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,447
Yeah, that's fine and all,

1078
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,784
but he has no consideration at all
for how that affects me.

1079
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,119
That's not true.

1080
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,247
[Mina Sue] I really don't like
that type of behavior.

1081
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,126
I'm rooting for Hee-sun,
and I'm rooting for Su-been.

1082
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,878
I don't want to be the person
that comes between them.

1083
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,094
Will talking to him
make you change your mind again?

1084
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,346
Uh… No, it won't.

1085
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,766
I kind of…

1086
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,690
So Seung-il…

1087
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,610
So Seung-il…

1088
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,155
- I wanted to ask how--
- Things are going well.

1089
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:32,868
I'm not really sure
what I should do about him. [laughs]

1090
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,828
[Min-gee] Do whatever you want.

1091
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,497
I'm just gonna continue
doing my thing, too.

1092
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,335
I guess I'm just worried
about what you'll think.

1093
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,729
[Min-gee] Come in.

1094
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,482
Uh, are you busy?

1095
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,443
- Uh, are you busy?
- No, I'm not.

1096
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,029
Mina, are you free for a chat?

1097
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,947
Oh. Yeah, I'm free.

1098
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,787
[cryptic music playing]

1099
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,706
- Whoa!
- [Jin-kyung and Da-Hee gasp]

1100
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,959
[Jin-young] Wow.
His timing was seriously not good.

1101
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,795
This is a horror movie, seriously.

1102
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,006
[Seung-il] Mina, are you free for a chat?

1103
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,758
[Mina Sue] Oh. Yeah, I'm free.

1104
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,095
See you later.

1105
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,263
See you. See you soon.

1106
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,891
No way, is she really leaving like that?

1107
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,059
What is she doing?

1108
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,687
Is that really the right way
to be acting right now?

1109
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,772
Did you see that?

1110
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,024
I mean, okay, talk. Like, fine. Talking?

1111
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,401
I'll try to be understanding.

1112
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,237
But did she really have to waltz
out of the room like that?

1113
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,031
- [Jin-young] I know, seriously.
- [Hanhae] She's a bit over the top.

1114
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,076
- That's not just over the top, it's rude.
- Can't contain her excitement.

1115
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,036
- That is crazy work.
- This is so insane.

1116
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,287
Yeah, for real.

1117
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,999
- [Min-gee] It's fine.
- [Joo-young] Mm.

1118
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,127
[Mina Sue] Aren't you cold?

1119
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,295
[Seung-il] Oh, I'm wearing a hoodie.

1120
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,547
Oh.

1121
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,632
I tried to look stylish, but it--

1122
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,009
No, no, you're better off
being comfortable.

1123
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,886
Comfy is the only way.

1124
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,264
Comfy is the only way.

1125
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,563
[groans] I'm not feeling well right now.

1126
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,064
Not because of that.

1127
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,816
It's not because of how she left.

1128
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,235
I've just had some other stuff going on.

1129
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,530
Just a little stressed lately.
That's why I'm not feeling well.

1130
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,577
When Seung-il knocked on the door
and stuck his head in,

1131
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,203
I was like, "You want me?"

1132
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:44,750
And then there was this sudden feeling of,
"Oh, I don't think it's me that he wants."

1133
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,627
Of course, I can't say I didn't care.

1134
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,339
But I did my best to act like I was fine.

1135
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,968
- [Seung-il] Is this a good spot?
- [Mina Sue] Yeah, it's fine.

1136
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,553
I've had a lot of conversations here.

1137
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,930
You were talking with Sung-hun yesterday,

1138
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,849
so I didn't want to get
in the way of that.

1139
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:01,850
LAST NIGHT

1140
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,894
- Where are you going?
- [Hyun-jae] Just out here.

1141
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,437
Can we take some?

1142
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,521
Bye.

1143
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,357
[Sung-hun] Take all of it.

1144
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,610
- [Seung-il] All?
- [Sung-hun] Yeah.

1145
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,154
[can pops open]

1146
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,198
Can you let me know when you're done?

1147
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:18,992
I'm sorry.

1148
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:22,579
During the chat last night,
I was feeling really unwell.

1149
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:26,666
And I was feeling a bit stressed
over the whole situation

1150
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,877
- with Su-been and all that.
- Oh, because of Su-been?

1151
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,757
Yeah, well, I mean,
because he told me that he liked me

1152
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,177
and gave me chocolates
and even went to Paradise together.

1153
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,888
I really felt like we were
getting closer, you know?

1154
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:43,892
But now suddenly he's spending all his
time with Hee-sun and it kind of threw me.

1155
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:47,145
So I didn't know what to do
and thought maybe I should wait for him

1156
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,064
to test the waters and figure it out.

1157
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,274
But I've decided I'm not going to.

1158
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,778
I'm just going to be happy for them
and support them and be done with it.

1159
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,822
- Oh. So you've made a firm decision.
- Yes.

1160
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,282
And I was honestly
also stressed out over you.

1161
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,575
Why?

1162
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,160
Mmm…

1163
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,163
Min-gee kind of bothers me a lot.

1164
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,248
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1165
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,792
I mean, I kind of got the feeling

1166
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,628
- that you were approaching me, right?
- Yeah.

1167
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,089
But because
I care about how Min-gee feels,

1168
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,883
I kept thinking,
"Oh, I shouldn't approach him,

1169
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,593
we shouldn't be alone together,"

1170
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:22,180
because I didn't want
to hurt Min-gee's feelings, you know?

1171
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,224
So I was really stressed out
because of that.

1172
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,184
Well, here's the thing.

1173
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:29,938
I'll still be talking to Min-gee
and she knows how I feel about her

1174
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,189
- and everything.
- Right.

1175
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,234
Right now, my first choice is Min-gee.
We've been to Paradise together.

1176
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,821
I know her well, and I feel like
our personalities are compatible.

1177
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,448
But that doesn't mean
my attraction to you is gone.

1178
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,326
I've been attracted to you
since day one, and I still am.

1179
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,038
- Okay.
- But that being said,

1180
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,708
I kept thinking today
that it must be easy for you

1181
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,710
to think that as more time passes,

1182
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:54,170
my feelings for Min-gee
would become more solid.

1183
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,922
- But it's not that simple.
- All right.

1184
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:59,009
That's why I wanted to take
some time now to talk to you.

1185
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,849
- She's gonna be swayed again, isn't she?
- [Jin-young] For sure.

1186
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,853
It looks like he's just given Mina Sue
her favorite thing, don't you think?

1187
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,439
Does being on that island
make you like that?

1188
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,190
Being there seems really stressful.

1189
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,693
It is stressful, absolutely.
It's super stressful.

1190
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,904
[Da-Hee] Do you think someone
can fake who they are?

1191
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,948
I think so. It's like Inferno
takes over your entire life.

1192
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,243
So Mina Sue could very well watch herself
on the show later and be surprised.

1193
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,287
Like, "Oh, I'm not that kind of person.

1194
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,748
I can't believe I got
so caught up in it at the time."

1195
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:33,251
But most importantly,
Seung-il's been Mina Su's third choice.

1196
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,712
And still was
when she last spoke about it.

1197
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,548
Can he beat Hyeon-woo
and move up to first place?

1198
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,301
- I think he'll go straight to first.
- [Kyuhyun] I think so.

1199
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,179
After this conversation,
Seung-il will be first.

1200
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:47,349
Hyeon-woo will be second,
Sung-hun will be third.

1201
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,601
- [Da-Hee] Exactly.
- Can Sung-hun make it to first?

1202
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,561
- No, he can't.
- [Jin-young laughs]

1203
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,688
- I'm sorry, but he just can't.
- You don't think so?

1204
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,149
All right, this is just
my own personal question.

1205
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:59,361
Mina Sue says she'd chat with Su-been
to end things with him.

1206
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,613
If Su-been gives her any hope,
could he move up?

1207
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,531
- Absolutely.
- He'll go straight to first.

1208
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,576
- [laughs] "He'll go straight to first."
- [Hanhae] No questions asked.

1209
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,704
We've literally all become experts
on Choi Mina Sue now.

1210
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,000
I truly don't think there's anyone
who knows her as well as we all do.

1211
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,503
At least in South Korea,
the five of us know her the best.

1212
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,214
- [Kyuhyun] We're close with her.
- [Jin-kyung] A little too close.

1213
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,715
[Jin Young] That's true.

1214
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,926
[upbeat music playing]

1215
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,098
- [Ye-jin] Are you getting nervous?
- [I-geon] Yeah, I am.

1216
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,724
- [Ye-jin] Oh, really?
- [I-geon] Yeah.

1217
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,102
- And they're back
- Come on.

1218
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,853
Stir things up a bit.

1219
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,898
You guys are gonna be fighting now.

1220
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,108
[Ye-jin laughs]

1221
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,693
Like, "Back off."

1222
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,403
[Min-gee] Are they back?

1223
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,990
- Oh, I think they are.
- [Min-gee] Really?

1224
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,659
- [Hee-sun] I can see them now.
- [Min-gee] It's just a new guy.

1225
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,328
[Go-eun] Take your hands
out of your pockets.

1226
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,497
- Should I?
- [Go-eun] Yeah.

1227
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,665
Take them out.

1228
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,377
- [Min-gee] Hey, he looks hot.
- [Hyeon-woo] Nice physique.

1229
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,004
Oh, his shoulders.

1230
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,756
So that's what guys look at.

1231
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,091
- It is.
- Guys look at shoulders.

1232
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,175
It's what they focus on.

1233
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,511
They look at the build first,
the physique.

1234
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,680
- [Joo-young] Oh.
- [I-geon] Hello.

1235
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,265
- [Hyun-jae] Hello.
- [Joo-young] Hello.

1236
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,683
It's nice to meet you guys.

1237
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,226
- [Min-gee] Hello.
- [Sung-hun] Hello.

1238
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,354
- [Hyun-jae] Hello.
- [Hee-sun] Hello.

1239
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,939
- [I-geon] Hello.
- [Hyun-jae] Hey.

1240
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

1241
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:21,985
[Mina Sue] Hello. Nice to see you.

1242
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,153
Hello.

1243
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,613
[suspenseful music playing]

1244
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,410
Ooh, the confidence.

1245
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,079
They're going to be intimidated by him.

1246
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,501
So… what's your name?

1247
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,045
My name is Jo I-geon.

1248
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,921
- I-geon? Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

1249
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,508
[Sung-hun] <i>He's a good-looking dude.</i>
<i>Super attractive.</i>

1250
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,136
<i>I'd say he looks pretty different</i>
<i>from the rest of us</i>

1251
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,013
and seems to have his own unique appeal.

1252
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,807
He has so much confidence.

1253
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,935
<i>I think the girls will definitely</i>
<i>find that appealing.</i>

1254
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,145
<i>They'll like him.</i>

1255
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:01,858
I-geon's expression's literally like,
"Not much competition here." Right?

1256
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,194
- Yeah, he's cool--
- I think he's the oldest guy.

1257
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,904
Yeah, he grows on you.

1258
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:09,157
That kind of confidence in a guy
is really attractive.

1259
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,416
[Hyeon-woo] <i>I was a little jealous, yeah.</i>

1260
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,710
But I'm already in too deep,

1261
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:24,005
so I don't think there was
much change in the way

1262
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,423
I'm currently feeling.

1263
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,759
This guy is crazy for Kim Go-eun.

1264
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,848
Go-eun, your face
is seriously glowing today.

1265
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,141
Thanks to Paradise.

1266
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,811
- [Seung-il] "Thanks to Paradise."
- I should go more.

1267
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,733
- So you haven't seen the girl, right?
- Oh, really?

1268
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,402
- The one who joined with me? I haven't.
- Yeah. Oh.

1269
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,655
We didn't get to go
in the helicopter. Yeah.

1270
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,240
[Min-gee] So you traveled by boat?

1271
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,449
Did you come back together?

1272
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,119
- No, we didn't get to see them.
- Oh, really?

1273
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,079
- Oh, so you…
- We haven't seen them,

1274
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,413
but we know who went.

1275
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,706
You just found out now?

1276
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,041
Yeah, that's right.

1277
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,919
- [Min-gee] You didn't know?
- Guess they didn't.

1278
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,754
[Min-gee]
Oh. You've only just found out.

1279
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,507
When we got back
I realized Seong-Min wasn't here,

1280
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,175
so that's when it hit me.

1281
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,345
They probably talked,
and he felt attracted to her.

1282
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,682
Then they decided to go
to Paradise together.

1283
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,434
What if they really hit it off there?

1284
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,146
I think that's what
I'm the most worried about.

1285
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:25,316
[Ha-eun] How do I look?
Can you check for me?

1286
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,861
[Jae-jin] Mm. You look great.
Really natural.

1287
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,658
[chuckles] You've gone quiet now.

1288
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,828
[Sung-min] It's all about to begin.

1289
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:40,415
Joo-young, your face is the one
I'm curious to see.

1290
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:43,293
I'm gonna try to keep a poker face.

1291
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,128
[suspenseful music playing]

1292
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,339
Here they come.

1293
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,218
- [Sung-hun] They're here.
- [Ye-jin] Are they coming?

1294
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,429
[Min-gee] She had long hair before.
Did she tie it up?

1295
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,680
Hello, everyone.

1296
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,974
[all] Hello.

1297
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,767
Hello, everyone.

1298
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,060
[all] Hello.

1299
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,271
[Min-gee] Wow! She's so pretty.

1300
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,023
[Ha-eun] Hello. How are you?

1301
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,358
[Min-gee] Even prettier up close.
Come, sit here.

1302
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,527
[laughter]

1303
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,905
That look on her face is the best.

1304
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,240
- Huh?
- Like this.

1305
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,658
Go-eun literally didn't blink.

1306
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,411
The wind was blowing really hard,
but her eyes stayed like…

1307
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,747
[Kyuhyun] I'm surprised
she didn't get sand in her eye.

1308
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,709
And with Ha-eun being so bright
and bubbly, sure, she stands out.

1309
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,087
- [Min-gee] She's so pretty.
- I know.

1310
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,089
[Seung-il] Come sit over here.

1311
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,592
- [girls] Hello.
- Hello.

1312
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:33,885
Whoa!

1313
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:34,969
Hello.

1314
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,638
- [Seung-il] Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

1315
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,306
- [Ha-eun] Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1316
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,017
My name is Lee Ha-eun. Ha-eun.

1317
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,394
- Yeah, that's it.
- [Ye-jin] Nice to meet you.

1318
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,230
[all exclaiming]

1319
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:48,816
[Mina Sue] <i>The first impression</i>
<i>she gives off is so adorable.</i>

1320
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,362
<i>So I do think that she'll be</i>
<i>pretty popular with the guys.</i>

1321
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:56,074
Straightaway, she seemed
very bright and bubbly as well.

1322
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,408
Cute, too.

1323
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,994
I don't think I need
to worry about her, though.

1324
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,705
What did you have for dinner yesterday?

1325
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,500
Oh, we had steak and… what else?

1326
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,503
- Steak tartare and hamburger.
- [Joo-young] You got steak tartare?

1327
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:11,631
[Sung-min] Oh, we ended up going somewhere
different yesterday.

1328
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,301
Yeah, it was an actual restaurant.

1329
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,263
I was so shocked to hear
it was their third time in Paradise.

1330
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,598
[Min-gee] These two have
already been there three times.

1331
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,225
[Ha-eun] I can't believe it.

1332
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,602
[Ye-jin] There must be
something about them.

1333
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,812
[Ha-eun] Totally, right?

1334
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,189
- You're Mr. Popular.
- Not the little prince anymore.

1335
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,733
[Ha-eun] That's so selfish
of you to go that much.

1336
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,443
[Mina Sue] Grown-up prince.

1337
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,993
So everyone's here now,
including the newcomers I-geon and Ha-eun.

1338
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,662
But I-geon's just so chill
quietly sitting there.

1339
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,539
He's not trying to draw
attention to himself.

1340
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,917
- Exactly. That's right.
- [Kyuhyun] He's… just taking it all in.

1341
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,711
The guys might find that intimidating.

1342
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,297
- He's got that older brother vibe, right?
- He totally does.

1343
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,924
And then Ha-eun has
a completely different vibe.

1344
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,510
- She's so bright and bubbly.
- Yeah. She's very lively.

1345
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,972
[Min-gee] So how were the dates
with the two guys?

1346
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,266
[Ha-eun] First of all,
my reasoning for choosing them

1347
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:07,061
was that one was the strangest guy
with a kind of intriguing quality.

1348
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:10,815
Okay, so the strange and intriguing
one is obviously Jae-jin.

1349
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:12,150
Mm.

1350
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,571
Yeah, and the other one
was the most comfortable to talk to.

1351
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,156
I had a five-minute chat with them.

1352
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,826
I get what you mean
with both of those guys. Yeah.

1353
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:25,288
Would you say that you were
physically attracted to either of them?

1354
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,540
Honestly, I'd have to say Jae-jin.

1355
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,667
- You're so open.
- There's something about him.

1356
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,629
- He draws you in.
- [Min-gee] Seriously.

1357
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,130
- Whoa.
- She's so open.

1358
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,465
She just told them.

1359
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,426
- [Min-gee] He draws you in.
- Seriously.

1360
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:41,179
Does everyone have someone
they're attracted to?

1361
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:44,599
- Yes. Mine's Seung-il. Seung-il.
- [Ha-eun exclaims]

1362
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,062
I do, too.

1363
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,230
- [Ha-eun] Who?
- [Hee-sun laughs]

1364
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,107
- [Ha-eun] Who is it?
- It's Su-been.

1365
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,275
[Ha-eun exclaims]

1366
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,402
Are you all in on him?

1367
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,363
- [Hee-sun] Yeah, just him.
- [Ha-eun] Oh, okay.

1368
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,698
[Hee-sun] One person. For now.

1369
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,908
[Ha-eun] Who is it?

1370
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:05,203
So what's the male game changer's
personality like?

1371
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:08,748
I was the most comfortable
I've been here when I was with him.

1372
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,041
[all gasp]

1373
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,877
I felt the same.
I think he's a good conversationalist.

1374
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,545
[others exclaim]

1375
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:18,341
He was nice. The more I talk with him,
the more I feel he's a nice guy.

1376
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,427
The more you talk to him,
the more attractive he becomes.

1377
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,012
He's really fun to talk to.

1378
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,472
[Hee-sun] Mmm.

1379
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:28,184
[Sung-min] How did you feel
about your chats with the girls yesterday?

1380
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,144
They went better than I expected.

1381
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,939
Yeah, better than I could have hoped for.

1382
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,023
[Hyeon-woo] Oh.

1383
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,199
I hear you like refined and demure girls.

1384
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,410
That's right.
How did that spread all the way here?

1385
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,829
[Seung-il] I know, right?
Word spread so fast here.

1386
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:50,540
- Oh, yeah, real fast.
- [Sung-min] There aren't many of us.

1387
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:54,043
So was your choice of Go-eun
and Ye-jin based on that?

1388
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,422
No, I don't really think
Go-eun comes across as demure.

1389
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:00,925
Ye-jin was the closest
to my ideal type out of all the girls,

1390
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,094
but Go-eun was just… I was…

1391
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:05,930
- [Seung-il] You were curious?
- Yeah, I was drawn to her.

1392
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,142
You're left or right-handed?

1393
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,727
[all laughing]

1394
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,729
Oh, gosh, is he left-handed?

1395
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,147
How cute.

1396
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,023
[Hanhae] Aw, Hyeon-woo.

1397
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,900
That's a question
I never thought I'd hear.

1398
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,360
[Jin-young] Seriously.

1399
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,071
You're left or right-handed?

1400
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,614
I'm right-handed.

1401
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,324
Why are you asking him that?

1402
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,826
No reason.

1403
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,495
[laughs]

1404
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,415
Oh, you're super competitive, aren't you?

1405
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,625
[tense music playing]

1406
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,048
I bet he's thinking, "one-zero,"

1407
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,425
[all laughing]

1408
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:44,427
Oh, Go-eun likes left-handers.

1409
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,928
He has the upper hand

1410
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,974
Hyun-jae, did anything interesting
happen yesterday?

1411
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,392
- [Hyun-jae] For me?
- Yeah.

1412
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:54,562
- It was pretty much Paradise for me.
- [laughter]

1413
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:57,565
I'm telling you, couldn't wipe the smile
off the guy's face all day.

1414
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,609
It was Hyun-jae's day yesterday.

1415
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,695
- [Seung-il] Hyun-jae's day.
- Yeah, It was my day yesterday,

1416
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,327
[notification chimes]

1417
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:12,663
[master] <i>Contestants, up next,</i>
<i>there will be a guy's game.</i>

1418
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,707
Wow!

1419
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,418
<i>You may now all gather</i>
<i>at the challenge zone.</i>

1420
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:21,172
- Finally. I've been waiting for this.
- [Jin-kyung] Here we go.

1421
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,800
- I hope it's something intense.
- Some of the guys need this win.

1422
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,259
- Yeah, totally.
- Yeah.

1423
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,845
[Jin-young] Let's see
what they're made of.

1424
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,019
[all exclaiming]

1425
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,395
It's the trench, isn't it?

1426
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,147
Another strength battle.

1427
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,316
Man, I've been waiting
all season for this.

1428
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,860
[Min-gee] What is this thing?

1429
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,154
Some kind of trench?

1430
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,490
Oh, gosh.

1431
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,158
Oh, wow.

1432
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,452
It feels like they're
always stripping down.

1433
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,704
- [all laughing]
- [Joo-young] Here they come.

1434
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,790
[dramatic music playing]

1435
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,598
Ooh! They look hot.

1436
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,231
[alert dings]

1437
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:26,571
[Master] <i>Today, the guys are competing</i>
<i>in a game to win a special meal date.</i>

1438
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:27,989
Special meal?

01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:30,658
[upbeat music playing]

1440
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:35,037
<i>The game will be</i>

Ah!

1442
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,790
It's not a team game?

1443
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,542
[Min-gee] It's a tournament?

1444
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,256
[Master] <i>The two guys who come in first</i>
<i>and second place in the game</i>

1447
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:52,179
Only two guys?

1448
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:57,143
[Master] <i>The meal is</i>
<i>fried chicken and ice-cold beer.</i>

1449

[all exclaim excitedly]

1450
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,937
Fried chicken.

1451
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,647
- That's so good.
- I want that.

1452
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,773
- Sounds good.
- Me too.

1453
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,358
Fried chicken!

1454
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:08,446
<i>Today's game is… Fight For the Ball.</i>

1455
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:09,906
<i>Fight For the Ball.</i>

01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,741
[all exclaim]

1457
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:16,037
The type of ball makes all the difference.

1458
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:23,127
<i>Once the guys enter the trench,</i>
<i>they will stand at opposite ends.</i>

1459
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:28,507

<i>they must run and grab the ball.</i>

1460
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,598
<i>The person who has possession of the ball</i>

1461
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:39,226
<i>at the end of the one-minute</i>
<i>time limit wins that round.</i>

1462
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,312
Mm. You win If you have it at the end.

1463
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,023
[Min-gee] They keep it from each other.

1464
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:47,902
[Master] <i>Balls will be drawn to decide</i>
<i>your opponent for the game.</i>

1465
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,862
- Oh, man.
- All right, so fight for the ball

1466
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:53,699
is a one-on-one tournament with the guys
versing each other to get the ball.

1467
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:57,954
If there's no winner at the end
of the time limit, it goes into overtime.

1468
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,247
If there's still no winner after overtime,

1469
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,500
- our favorite flag grab…
- Flag grab.

1470
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:05,920
- Yeah, that'll determine the winner.
- Wow.

1471
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:07,505
- This is going to be intense.
- Yeah.

1472
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:10,091
Should we predict
who the top two will be?

1473
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:13,886
Well, I mean, Su-been is
one of the strongest contenders,

1474
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,638
being a former athlete.

1475
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:19,308
- And Hyeon-woo.
- Oh, his back. It's like so built.

1476
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,686
[Jin-young] He just looks like
a really strong guy.

1477
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:24,355
I also think Hyun-jae,
because he has clear motivation.

1478
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:26,816
- That's right, motivation to win.
- He'll go all out.

1479
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:27,984
[Hanhae] Let's go.

1480
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:32,113
[Master] <i>First up are Song Seung-il</i>
<i>and Lee Sung-hun, who drew the red balls.</i>

1481
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:34,156
<i>Please make your way into the trench.</i>

1482
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:38,619
[Kyuhyun] <i>Sung-hun versus Seung-il?</i>
<i>This will be good.</i>

1483
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,330
[Da-hee] <i>This will be a good watch.</i>

1484
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:44,458
- Just don't get hurt.
- [Ye-jin] I know, right?

1485
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,128
I'm not even playing, and I'm nervous.

1486
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,297
I was definitely hoping
that Seung-il would win.

1487
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,675
But since I'm really close friends
with Sung-hun,

1488
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:55,219
I kind of wanted him to do well, also.

1489
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,804
May the best man win.

1490
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:05,021
- Whoever gives me fried chicken.
- [Joo-young] That's all I care about.

1491
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,105
Whoever it is.

1492
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,775
[Master] <i>The game begins</i>

1495

[Ha-eun] Why are they walking?

1496
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,912
Oh, don't waste energy, guys.

- Whoa!
- Oh!

1498
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,708
- [Da-hee] He threw it.
- He wants to fight.

1499
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,962
[Jae-jin] Whoa.

1500

1505
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,143
- Aren't they supposed to grab the ball?
- Right.

1506
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,729
[Mina Sue] They're supposed
to grab the ball. Why…

1507
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:49,398
[Ha-eun] 'Cause they're trying
to stop each other.

1508
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,858
[girls gasping]

1509
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:53,486
[Ha-eun] Oh! That's dangerous.

1510
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,821
What is this?

1511
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:59,784
- [Ha-eun] Wait! Hold on.
- [Mina Sue] No, no, no.

1512
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:05,873
- [Ye-Jin] Oh, my gosh!
- [Ha-eun] Someone's gonna get hurt.

1513
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:07,541
[Mina Sue] This looks too dangerous.

1514
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,169
- Can you play the game, please?
- The ball's over there.

1515

[Ha-eun] Wow!

1525
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:56,298
- [Ye-jin] They're really scratched up.
- [Ha-eun] They are.

1526
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,509
[Master] <i>The winner is Song Seung-il.</i>

1527
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,764
But can you imagine
if he puts in all that effort,

1528
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:07,518
fights that hard to win and then ends up
choosing another girl instead?

1529
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,562
I think Min-gee would be done with him.

1530
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,314
- She would let him go.
- You think Min-gee would?

1531
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,984
I don't think she'd be able
to keep holding on. No.

1532
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,653
- You might be right.
- Honestly, yeah. That'll be her limit.

1533
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:20,156
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

1534
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,448
You killed it.

1535

1537
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:27,621

1540
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,297
This isn't good for Jae-jin.

1541
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,007
You never know.

1542
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,968
[Ye-jin] I'm worried
he's gonna get crushed.

1543
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,136
[Min-gee] Yeah.

1544
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:44,889
Me too. We're all thinking the same.

1545
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,516
What if Jae-jin uses techniques to go…

1546
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,976
Some Jeet Kune Do.

1547
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:50,936
Jeet Kune Do.

1548

- [Min-gee] Pick up the pace.

1560

- Oh, no, no, no. That's awful!
- Poor Jae-jin. Oh, no!

No plot twist after all.

1569
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:04,802
It's because dancers have
to keep their bodies as light as possible.

1570
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:07,972
Yeah, yeah.
He has to maintain a little body weight.

1571
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,349
- [Da-hee] It's because he's a dancer.
- That's right.

[chuckles]

Yeah. Baseball player.

- I love fried chicken.
- Fried chicken?

the top two no matter what."

Honestly, a part of me
was hoping he'd just lose.

1695
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,887
He already looked pretty beaten up,

1696
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:44,141
and even if he won,
I had this feeling he wouldn't pick me.

1697
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:52,691
The food on this special meal date turned
out to be fried chicken, which I love,

1698

and so does Hyun-jae.

1699
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:55,944
He said he'd make sure I'd get to have it.

1700
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,696
So I thought, "Is this my chance?"

1701
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:00,407
I was cheering him on extra hard
because of that.

- [Hee-sun] It really is.

1749

- That's just impressive.

1750
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:50,660
[Mina Sue] Damn.

1751

[Hee-sun] Just so unbelievable.
He's so good.

Seung-il was really amazing.

1753
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:56,958
Yeah.

1754
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,586
He showed a side of himself
I hadn't seen before,

1755
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:01,046
and honestly, it was kind of hot.

1756
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:03,131
I wasn't expecting it, but I liked it.

1757

<i>Shin Hyeon-woo and Woo Sung-min.</i>

1760
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:18,522
Of course, the two guys I like, Sung-min
and Hyeon-woo end up going head-to-head.

1761
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:20,524
Honestly, what are the chances of that?

1762
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:24,444
Hyeon-woo is so strong,
So he was obviously going to be fine.

1763
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:29,032
But Sung-min's a bit more gentle, so I was
pretty worried about him getting hurt.

1764
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,539
[Sung-min] <i>My aim was to do</i>
<i>whatever I could to take it to overtime.</i>

1765
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,333
I thought if I take it to overtime
and tire him out, I could win.

1766
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:41,086
[Hyeon-woo] <i>I was super set</i>
<i>on getting first place,</i>

1767
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:43,588
<i>mostly because I wanted to talk to Go-eun.</i>

1768
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,632
That thought just got
my head back in the game

1769
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:47,801

01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,429
[Master] <i>The winner is Shin Hyeon-woo.</i>

1813
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:57,597
[girls] Whoa!

1814
01:22:57,681 --> 01:23:00,058
- [Master] <i>…Shin Hyeon-woo.</i>
<i>- </i>[girls] Whoa!

1815
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:03,645
[Jin-Young] He was quicker
to snatch it at the end.

1816
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:05,021
That was a good strategy.

1817
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:08,608
- [Master] <i>…Shin Hyeon-woo.</i>
<i>- </i>[girls] Whoa!

1818
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,320
- That was crazy.
- That was so close.

1819
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:14,906
[Min-gee] It came down to strategy.

1820
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,574
[Mina Sue] Nice job. Well done.

1821
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,164
[Ye-jin] This was a fun match to watch.
Don't you think?

1822
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:24,958
Uh… no.

1823
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,628
[Master] <i>And now the final match.</i>

1824
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:32,590
<i>Song Seung-il and Shin Hyeon-woo</i>
<i>will go head-to-head.</i>

1825
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:38,513
<i>Song Seung-il and Shin Hyeon-woo,</i>
<i>please make your way to the trench.</i>

1826
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:40,515
[upbeat music playing]

1827
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:52,360
So I kept turning my head
to the side like this,

1828
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:54,821
and I kept thinking I was
catching Go-eun's eye.

1829
01:23:54,904 --> 01:23:56,781
<i>It felt like she was cheering me on.</i>

1830
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,783
<i>It gave me the motivation to win.</i>

1831
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:01,077
Wow. I think this one's gonna be fun.

1832
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:04,080
[Ha-eun] Yeah, me too.
I'm really excited for this one.

1833
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:05,874
This one's gonna be neck and neck

1834
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:08,084
Skill versus strength.

1835
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:09,461
It's gonna be interesting.

1836
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:13,006
[Master] <i>The game begins</i>
<i>when you hear the signal.</i>

1837

- [Master] <i>20 seconds remaining.</i>

1841
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,489
- [all exclaiming]
- [Mina Sue] Oh, my gosh!

1842
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,491
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1843
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:49,834
[Hee-sun] Whoa!

1844
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:55,340
- [Ye-jin] What does Seung-il do?
- [Master] <i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

1845
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,675
<i>- seven, six…</i>
- He's good.

1846
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:01,471
[Master] <i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

1847
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,598

1848

- [Ha-eun] Oh, my God!
- His thighs!

1849

[Master] <i>…five, four…</i>

1850
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:09,020

1852

[Master] <i>…five, four, three, two, one.</i>

1853
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:18,196
- [whistle blows]
- Whoa!

1854
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,949
[all] Whoa!

1855
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:22,075
That's more like it.

1856
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:23,409
He just threw him off of it.

1857
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:26,162
- [Kyuhyun] So strong!
- [Hanhae] He lifted him off.

1858
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,288
That's insane.

1859
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:36,631
- [Joo-young] That's crazy.
- [sighs]

[Master] <i>The match has ended in a tie.</i>

1862
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:42,971
[Mina Sue] Wow.

1863
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,143
Aw, look at Min-gee's face.
She's so worried.

1864
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,477
[Da-hee] Aw.

1871
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,671
[Joo-young] Great job, you guys.

1872
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:18,506

[Mina Sue] Good job.

1875
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:26,222
[Seung-il] Good job, guys.

1876
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:29,392
[Hee-sun] Good job.

1877
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:33,062
Good job, man. Nice job

1878
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:35,982
[Mina Sue] They're good sports.

1879
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:39,485
That was just wow. Seriously. Wow.

1880
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:42,530
[Go-eun] Wow. Seriously.

1881
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:45,992
All right, so first and second places
have been decided.

1882
01:26:46,075 --> 01:26:48,578
Hyeon-woo in first. Seung-il in second.

1883
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:51,539
With Hyeon-woo, it's obvious
he's going to pick Go-eun.

1884
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:53,416
- No question about that.
- [Jin-kyung] Yeah.

1885
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:55,960
With Seung-il, I really don't know.
There's two options.

1886
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,296
It all comes down to
if things stay amicable,

1887
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,006
or all hell breaks loose.

1888
01:27:00,089 --> 01:27:03,301
I think Seung-il will
definitely choose Mina,

1889
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:04,886
which will solidify his feelings.

1890
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:07,555
And then I think they will end up
going to Paradise together.

1891
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:11,142
What? Both a special meal date
and also Paradise?

1892
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:14,145
- Ooh, I think he'll split them up.
- Split them up?

1893
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,480
Oh, I don't know about that.

1894
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:18,066
These opportunities
don't come up that often.

1895
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:20,401
Anyway, this time
I do think he'll pick Mina.

1896
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,195
I agree.

1897
01:27:22,278 --> 01:27:26,074
I still think… Well, he's been spending
time talking with Mina Sue lately,

1898
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:28,117
so I think he'll end up
having a conversation

1899
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:29,953
with Min-gee over the meal instead.

1900
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:32,538
And then, who knows
where it'll go from there?

1901
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:35,500
[Kyuhyun] You're not convinced, are you?

1902
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:37,001
[laughter]

1903
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,795
That's what I'm hoping.

1904
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:41,965
- That's what we're all hoping for.
- Exactly. I can't wait to find out.

1905
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:44,634
- He's gonna pick Mina Sue, right?
- Yeah. I think he will.
