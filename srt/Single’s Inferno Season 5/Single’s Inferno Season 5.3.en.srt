The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,060
<i>Choi Mina Sue has matched with…</i>

17
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,731
<i>Lim Su-been.</i>

18
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,734
<i>Lim Su-been,</i>
<i>please step outside your lodging.</i>

19
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,529
You were right.

20
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,574
- The game had a huge impact.
- It did.

21
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,701
He enticed her with his muscles.

22
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,870
<i>Lim Su-been.</i>

23
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,956
<i>Lim Su-been,</i>
<i>please step outside your lodging.</i>

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,793
<i>Lim Su-been.</i>

25
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,088
<i>Lim Su-been,</i>
<i>please step outside your lodging.</i>

26
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,884
Have a great time.

27
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,302
- Have a good one.
- See you.

28
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,315
Hee-sun lost her smile.

29
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,243
Hello.

30
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,413
- Shall we?
- Yes.

31
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:07,127
- Let me help you with one.
- Then can you help me with this one?

32
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,670
- Let's go.
- Okay.

33
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,172
Thank you.

34
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,134
This is surreal.

35
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,428
- I'm getting excited.
- Right?

36
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,228
This isn't easy. This place isn't easy.

37
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,690
I'm losing my mind.

38
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,913
<i>I'm interested in Min-gee right now.</i>

39
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,167
We were told to converse freely,
but our conversation got cut off

40
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,960
while we were still talking.

41
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,214
So it felt like I only watched the preview
of a film I'd been waiting for.

42
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,094
<i>She had an easygoing personality,</i>

43
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:01,055
and that caught my attention from day one.

44
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,100
And today, we somehow ended up
chatting for a long time.

45
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,393
During our conversation,

46
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,688
I realized we might have
compatible personalities.

47
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,524
That's when I became
even more interested in Min-gee.

48
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,155
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

49
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,408
It's probably Seung-il, right?

50
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,369
She hasn't had a chance
to chat with Hyeon-woo.

51
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,539
<i>Kim Min-gee has matched with…</i>

52
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,254
<i>Song Seung-il.</i>

53
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,048
- I'll get going.
<i>- Song Seung-il.</i>

54
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,549
<i>Please step outside your lodging.</i>

55
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,675
I knew it.

56
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,929
It must be disappointing for Hyeon-woo.

57
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,597
Here we go.

58
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,891
You have so much stuff.

59
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,143
Do you need help with that?

60
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,145
- Need a hand?
- Maybe just this one?

61
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,897
- What's heavier?
- This one? I don't know.

62
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,148
- Give me this.
- This?

63
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,067
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

64
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,361
- Okay.
- My heart almost dropped.

65
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,196
- Were you worried I wouldn't call you?
- Yes.

66
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,741
- I guess I had my hopes up.
- I see.

67
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,910
Aren't you leaving too often, Min-gee?

68
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,246
This is only my second time.
What do you mean?

69
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,789
And why are you speaking casually?

70
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,165
- Ms. Min-gee?
- Good.

71
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,544
- They're hitting it off.
- Yes.

72
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,213
Their conversations are playful.

73
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,090
They have a similar vibe.

74
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,428
<i>Today's Paradise-bound</i>
<i>couple matching is over.</i>

75
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:31,396
- I'm the only one who never left.
- Stop it. You'll be going nonstop soon.

76
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,898
I seriously want to go home.

77
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,150
Not me.

78
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,612
- I'm going to see this through.
- Really?

79
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,698
- What about you?
- Me too.

80
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,284
Until the day I go to Paradise
with Joo-young.

81
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,495
You two are such manly guys.

82
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,373
- I'll follow through.
- I can't stand losing.

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,960
His competitive spirit is kicking in.

84
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,381
- In any case, four couples have left.
- Yes.

85
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,845
The couple we're looking forward to
the most is probably Mina Sue and Su-been.

86
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,596
- I'm curious.
- It's Mina Sue and Su-been.

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,015
- Mina Sue-been.
- Mina Sue-been.

88
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,559
I feel like they'll make my heart flutter.

89
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,519
- Right? I bet.
- Yes, totally.

90
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,856
- We'll get our dose of dopamine.
- I'm excited.

91
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,733
I'm excited for Seung-il and Min-gee, too.

92
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,151
- Those two.
- Right?

93
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,193
They seem fun.

94
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,113
It seems like they'll have a good banter
back and forth.

95
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,240
- Their personalities seem to click.
- Yes.

96
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,700
- Yes.
- I look forward to it.

97
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,288
PARADISE
KIM MIN-GEE & SONG SEUNG-IL

98
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,748
Let's go.

99
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,667
I got it. I really got it.

100
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,461
- It heavy, isn't it?
- My gosh.

101
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,507
- This place is nice.
- It really is.

102
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,303
- Where's the room?
- Right here. It's this way.

103
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,387
Let's see the room.

104
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,057
I'm at a loss for words.

105
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,308
This is the room.

106
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,811
This place is huge.

107
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,813
I can't get used to it.

108
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,649
Here, Min-gee. These are your stuff.

109
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,526
I want to look over there.

110
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,444
Sure.

111
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,994
- I guess that's the only bedroom. Oops.
- It is.

112
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,581
You could've asked.

113
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,167
You said you weren't in this room.

114
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,795
- They're the same with a few differences.
- I see.

115
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,797
- Really?
- Yes, they all look similar.

116
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,382
The bathroom is as big as my room.

117
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,134
I mean it.

118
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,603
He looks fascinated.

119
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,854
Of course, he is.

120
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,189
He's just like me.

121
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,151
Can I change into comfy clothes?

122
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,915
Seung-il?

123
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,969
- He's checking the water pressure.
- And looking around.

124
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,098
Man, this place is insane.

125
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,891
It's so nice.

126
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:21,941
Where do you keep going?

127
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,527
- I'm just looking around.
- Okay.

128
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,445
It's so nice.

129
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,238
- Come here.
- Is it that nice?

130
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,365
- Did you see the pool outside?
- Yes.

131
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,867
- I've seen it.
- Right.

132
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,662
- How cute.
- He's so endearing.

133
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,205
That place looks really nice.

134
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,374
I completely understand how he feels.

135
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,295
- What if you catch a cold?
- The water's warm.

136
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,672
- Both?
- I mean, they both seem warm.

137
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,756
Look at the steam.

138
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,469
- You're right. It's warm.
- Yes.

139
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,096
- But this is so nice.
- Isn't it?

140
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,600
Seeing this is making me feel emotional.

141
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,852
I'm serious.

142
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,145
- Really?
- Yes.

143
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,483
They'll have lots of fun joking around.

144
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,903
- But I think Min-gee…
- Yes?

145
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,363
- I think she's getting too laid-back.
- Right.

146
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,657
It's a shame
that her charm is slowly fading.

147
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,659
I know even today,

148
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,455
she'll come across
as almost too laid-back in that room.

149
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,001
- I'm a bit worried about that.
- But some people are into that.

150
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,420
Aren't you also into people like that?

151
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,839
- Yes, I like to joke around.
- Like friends.

152
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,133
I still think romance can blossom.

153
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,845
- Have a seat.
- What?

154
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,639
Let's talk.

155
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,100
We began to talk casually,
almost too naturally.

156
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,853
I assumed that you'd be
much more comfortable that way.

157
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,854
- True.
- Yeah.

158
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,773
- That's what you mean.
- Like that.

159
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,691
- Like this.
- Hold on.

160
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,485
Look at her pose.

161
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,487
"Let's talk."

162
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,573
Why is she like that?

163
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,284
But, Jin-kyung,
I'm sure some people are into that.

164
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,328
Don't you prefer this to being fake?

165
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,581
- Isn't this too much?
- Sitting like that is beyond easygoing.

166
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,167
- "Let's talk" is a bit…
- It's a bit…

167
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,628
- It could've gone better.
- "I said, let's talk."

168
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,215
I assumed that you'd be
much more comfortable that way.

169
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,174
- True.
- Yeah.

170
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,969
You're different from what I thought.

171
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,887
- How?
- When you first walked in,

172
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:19,225
- you seemed aloof and not very talkative.
- I know, right?

173
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,476
- Yes.
- Everyone says so.

174
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,812
- You looked a bit cold.
- Yes.

175
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:28,234
But the moment you sat next to me,
I could tell what you were like.

176
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,819
- I didn't even say much.
- No.

177
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,488
But you're very different
from how you look, too.

178
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,031
You have a great personality.

179
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,700
- You're--
- How do I come across?

180
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,868
- Like a bad boy.
- I look like a bad boy?

181
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,372
But you're the total opposite.

182
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,541
You're quite gentle, unlike how you look.

183
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,376
- I am?
- Yes.

184
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:47,920
Really?

185
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,882
But I'm aiming for an image with a calm

186
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,593
- and serious vibe.
- Sure.

187
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,177
- Someone who's--
- Not even close.

188
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,598
I think that unexpected difference
makes you more attractive.

189
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,807
- Really?
- Yes.

190
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,686
I guess today is the first time we talked.

191
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,314
Yes, so this is all new.
I'm intrigued by you.

192
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,316
How did I seem on the first day?

193
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,068
- Did I seem gentle back then?
- No.

194
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,363
Like you said, you gave off a strong aura.

195
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,949
- Did I look serious?
- Not exactly, but…

196
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,993
That's why only my forearms are tanned.

197
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,454
- It was intended.
- Was it to give off that aura?

198
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,913
Because I sat like this.

199
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,585
You try to talk like a tough guy,

200
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,630
but your words are really sweet.

201
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,300
I think this is it.

202
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,595
- You are the main character.
- I am?

203
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,513
- You came in last.
- Is that so?

204
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,601
- Is there a type you particularly dislike?
- People who wear masks.

205
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,145
Is that why you chose me?

206
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,607
Yes, I really like people
who are easygoing and not pretentious.

207
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,984
People who aren't two-faced.

208
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,028
- Yes.
- Yes, they're the kind of people I like.

209
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,200
- What's your ideal type?
- Someone that I'm drawn to.

210
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,494
I need that jolt of attraction.

211
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,205
- That feeling?
- Yes, someone I keep glancing at.

212
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,208
Or it could be someone who intrigues me.

213
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,129
- Well, someone like you.
- Why are you flirting with me?

214
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,631
Should I keep quiet?

215
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,384
Someone like you.

216
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,678
So I need to get that feeling first.

217
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,515
Only then will I want
to get to know who you are.

218
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,308
I like your sense of humor.

219
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,810
- Humor?
- Yes.

220
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,603
You say random things out of the blue.

221
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,021
- Like earlier.
- "Get out."

222
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,190
- You told me to jump.
- "Jump off."

223
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,402
Do you want to jump off?

224
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,081
- Hey, what was that?
- What was that?

225
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:51,544
- What was that?
- What was that?

226
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,337
That's so childish yet funny.

227
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,297
That's how they grow on each other.

228
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,299
That's what we used to do as kids.

229
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,136
Those are the things I find funny.

230
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,471
- That's how I hang out.
- I like that.

231
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,849
- Yes, me too.
- That's how I have fun.

232
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,393
Just like friends.

233
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,602
- They both find it fun.
- Yes.

234
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,104
- That's great news.
- It is.

235
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,564
- They're a good match.
- Yes.

236
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,233
- Let's eat.
- Sure.

237
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,111
- Time to eat!
- I'm so happy.

238
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,447
- Welcome.
- It's Korean food.

239
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:21,824
This is Paradise.

240
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,662
I'm so happy right now.

241
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,501
- Let's eat first.
- Yes.

242
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,211
You must be starving.

243
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,797
My gosh. I'm dying
to know how old you are.

244
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,008
- My age?
- Yes.

245
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,305
- I have a feeling you're younger than me.
- Are you sure?

246
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,392
- Yes.
- Really?

247
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,353
You're probably younger.

248
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,359
Do you prefer someone older, younger,
or around your age?

249
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,988
I think age is just a number,
but I prefer someone older.

250
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,993
A person's maturity
is very appealing to me.

251
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,538
I like older guys, too.

252
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,832
- What now?
- I like older guys.

253
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,877
Actually, I like people
who are on the cuter side.

254
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,880
- Not someone who acts cute.
- Cute guys?

255
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,382
There are times
when people suddenly seem cute.

256
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,842
- You mean the person?
- Yes.

257
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,887
Just like how you just said, "The person?"

258
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,349
When you see that cuteness
in someone older, it's really cute.

259
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,808
Younger guys are cute by default.

260
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,353
- When they have an unexpected charm?
- Yes.

261
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,649
I think people are really cute
when they have an unexpected charm.

262
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,734
- I see, like a twist.
- Yes.

263
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,572
It's hard for me to tell how old you are.

264
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,869
I want to take a guess.
Want to guess my age?

265
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,746
You seem like you were

266
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,706
born in 1998.

267
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,666
- In 1998?
- Yes.

268
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,584
I thought the same for you.

269
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,171
I'm 30 years old.

270
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,756
- You're 30?
- Yes.

271
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,759
I was born in 1996.

272
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:04,718
- In 1996?
- Yes.

273
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,887
- Did you say 1998 for me?
- Yes.

274
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,307
- Is he?
- He's maybe 26?

275
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,351
I'd say he was born in 1997 or 1998.

276
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,520
- Did you say 1998 for me?
- Yes.

277
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,233
- Why are you so happy?
- I'm happy to hear that.

278
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,485
I was born in 2001.

279
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,238
- Oh, my gosh!
- No way!

280
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,700
Hearing it now, I can see it.

281
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,369
- I knew he'd be young.
- He looks so young.

282
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,454
- He's a baby!
- Is he 26, then?

283
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,665
Look, he looks like a high school kid.

284
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,666
Exactly.

285
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,876
He's way too young.

286
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,419
Is he five years younger?

287
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,922
I was born in 2001.

288
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,760
I was born in 2001.

289
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,931
- Really? You're that young?
- Yes.

290
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,808
Born in 2001?

291
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,936
- I was born in 2001.
- Are you serious?

292
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,188
My gosh.

293
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,567
- No way. Were you really born in 2001?
- Yes.

294
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,821
You're really mature for your age.

295
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,740
That's wild.

296
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,829
- Should I talk politely again?
- Yes, how dare you?

297
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,247
You're five years younger.

298
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,000
No, speak casually.
That way, I'll seem younger.

299
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,795
I knew you wouldn't get it right.

300
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,925
It is a bit of a shock. It's wild.

301
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,014
- You said you like older guys.
- Yes, but I also like cute guys.

302
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,395
I like someone who's mature.

303
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,318
Younger guys aren't too bad.

304
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,116
You're good.

305
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,207
Yes, this is what I'm talking about.

306
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,334
What do you do?

307
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,377
- For a living?
- Yes.

308
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,255
I work at a fashion marketing company.

309
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,882
- I'm a marketer.
- It suits you.

310
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:12,888
<i>I currently work as a marketer</i>
<i>at a fashion marketing company.</i>

311
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,185
<i>I'm in charge of advertising expenses,</i>

312
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,522
<i>meeting with advertisers,</i>
<i>providing brand consultations,</i>

313
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:25,192
<i>and handling everything the client needs</i>
<i>to grow their business with us.</i>

314
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:31,031
SONG SEUNG-IL,
BORN IN 2001, FASHION MARKETER

315
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,741
- How cool.
- Are you curious?

316
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:34,994
Born in 2001?

317
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,664
- What?
- I still can't get over your age.

318
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,458
I'm still trying to process your age.

319
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:45,754
- But I've been working since I was 20.
- I see.

320
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,214
I began work right away.

321
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,926
- You're next, Ms. Min-gee.
- Yes?

322
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,886
So, what do you do?

323
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,724
I'm a track-and-field athlete.

324
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,017
It's like…

325
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,604
- What's your specialty?
- It's 400 m for me.

326
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,981
- You run 400 m?
- Yes.

327
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,066
We can't go running together.

328
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,612
No, I run longer distances
at a slower pace. I find it hard, too.

329
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,992
- Where do you live now?
- I live in Hwaseong now.

330
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,370
- Gyeonggi Province?
- I'm on a team with Hwaseong City Hall.

331
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,165
I know my way around Hwaseong.

332
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,628
This is what I find cute.
Yes, that was cute.

333
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,715
- That was just so cute.
- How cute!

334
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,841
So very cute.

335
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,427
- "I know my way around."
- "I know my way."

336
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,721
I see. That's what they mean.

337
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,599
- I still don't get it.
- I didn't know, either.

338
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,351
- How cute.
- It's things like this.

339
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,855
That was so cute,
like a child pretending to be an adult.

340
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,565
- He's just a kid, though.
- I see.

341
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,820
This is what I find cute.
Yes, that was cute.

342
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,947
No, I'm so serious right now.

343
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,493
No, you were so cute just now,
like someone born in 2001.

344
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,371
- Why aren't you eating?
- Me?

345
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,083
Did you know you lose your appetite
when you're sleep deprived?

346
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,753
Do you want me to feed you?

347
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,468
- You said you couldn't eat.
- No, I can eat.

348
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,053
But if you feed me, I won't say no.

349
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,389
This is nice.

350
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,104
You're so annoying.

351
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,358
- I do feel happy here.
- Right?

352
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:35,239
Today feels like
my very first time in Paradise.

353
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,866
- That's how I feel.
- Why?

354
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,956
I thought
I'd naturally have these feelings,

355
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,709
and I expected that yesterday,
but I didn't feel anything.

356
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,217
I was so worried on my way here.

357
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,302
- About what?
- If that continued…

358
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:01,056
I was afraid I might go back home
without feeling anything.

359
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,560
But I'm definitely
feeling something today.

360
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,105
I'll make you feel it today.

361
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,526
"I'll make you feel it today"!

362
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,654
- He just gave me chills.
- He's the real deal.

363
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,823
He's full of vigor.

364
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,408
- That was sheer vigor.
- It was.

365
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,201
He's on a roll now. He's on the rise.

366
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,453
- He's on fire.
- I got chills.

367
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,582
I'll make you feel it today.

368
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,088
- I thought you liked older guys.
- Can you talk louder?

369
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,507
- I feel too shy to talk louder.
- Right?

370
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,385
You keep mumbling,
but I have excellent hearing.

371
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,137
I noticed.

372
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,681
I didn't think you'd hear me, but you did.

373
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,808
My hearing is still good.

374
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,019
You're only 30.

375
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,023
- Only 30?
- Yes, you're young.

376
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,193
Well, it's funny coming from me.

377
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,280
Seriously.

378
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,952
I love how they're interacting.

379
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,788
- I love this.
- That was the best line so far.

380
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,875
- "I'll make you feel it."
- "I'll make you feel it today."

381
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,251
The best pick-up line.

382
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,503
Is this what younger guys are like?

383
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,009
PARADISE
KIM GO-EUN & WOO SUNG-MIN

384
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,679
It looks good.

385
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,181
They look amazing.

386
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,391
- You should try some first.
- Should I?

387
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,310
Oh no.

388
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,314
Shouldn't you eat first?
Try the soup first.

389
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,234
You shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

390
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,530
Isn't it good?

391
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,951
It surprised me when I first tried it.
I can eat it from here.

392
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,121
- Doesn't it taste better today?
- It does.

393
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,251
It's good.

394
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,631
- How is it? Is it good?
- Try it. Yes.

395
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,138
So how old are you?

396
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,557
- Do I just say it now?
- Yes.

397
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,101
Take a guess.

398
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:10,978
How cliché.

399
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,732
I really didn't want to say it,
but I couldn't help it.

400
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,152
I'd guess you were born in 1997 or 1998.

401
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,783
Are you stunned?

402
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,579
- I was born in 2000.
- Really?

403
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,707
I was born in 1996.

404
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,500
Really?

405
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,627
We're not that far apart.

406
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,170
What do you do?

407
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,048
You said you'd guess.

408
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,717
Something that has…

409
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,343
to do with computers?

410
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,096
- Not at all?
- No.

411
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,640
- A lyricist?
- Nope.

412
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,228
- I'm an optician.
- What? Really?

413
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,898
- I make and sell glasses.
- Wow.

414
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,734
That's amazing.

415
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,653
What do you do, Go-eun?

416
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,698
- I'm a model.
- You are?

417
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,617
<i>I work as a model.</i>

418
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,625
<i>I currently model</i>
<i>for beauty and fashion brands.</i>

419
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,508
KIM GO-EUN
BORN IN 2000, MODEL

420
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,095
- You can speak casually.
- Sure.

421
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,890
- Let's both do that.
- Okay.

422
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,311
What was your first impression of me?
I'm curious.

423
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:40,442
I told you I called you
a taller version of the Little Prince.

424
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,944
So everyone remembers you
as the Little Prince.

425
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,112
So…

426
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,491
Yes, it's my fault.

427
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:55,082
But I think your shorts
made you look even younger.

428
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,917
Even younger.

429
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,044
- Only I was in shorts.
- Yes.

430
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,253
But it was nice.

431
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,547
- It was? It was embarrassing.
- It suited you.

432
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,343
You know, being tall
when you look like this is…

433
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,302
- Is it odd?
- It's odd.

434
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,598
- Do I not look tall?
- You don't look tall.

435
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,308
So…

436
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,102
Yeah…

437
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,103
How tall are you?

438
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,064
- I'm 168 cm.
- You are? You're tall.

439
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,316
- Everyone's tall.
- Everyone is.

440
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,193
- How tall are you?
- I'm 186 cm.

441
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,862
I thought I'd be the tallest,
but some are taller.

442
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,072
- Who? Hyun-jae?
- Yeah.

443
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,451
- Hyun-jae and--
- We talked yesterday.

444
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,037
How did it go?

445
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,164
It was just…

446
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,625
Never mind.

447
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,420
What's it like talking to me?

448
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,339
It's fun.

449
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,549
- It is?
- Yes.

450
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,093
I'm a really boring guy.

451
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,928
You're fun.

452
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:54,266
- I'm not a lot of fun, either.
- We both seem to think that way.

453
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,270
We both seem
to think of ourselves as boring.

454
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,940
Only people similar to me
tend to find me fun.

455
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,568
What matters is
being on the same wavelength.

456
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,319
- Yes.
- I'm glad.

457
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,074
Before the game began,

458
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,995
all I had on my mind was,
"What am I going to do?"

459
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,748
Was it after the game when you decided
you wanted to talk to me?

460
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:23,211
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
even on the first day.

461
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,841
That was why I wanted to change my pick
on first impressions.

462
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,593
- Was that why?
- Yes.

463
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,931
Are you not curious about the two guys
you picked yesterday?

464
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,727
I don't think
I need to get to know them any further.

465
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,855
I kept thinking,
"I wrote down the wrong name."

466
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,608
- "I want to change my decision."
- Why?

467
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,611
I kept thinking,
"I made the wrong choice."

468
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,044
One thing's for sure.
It feels different from yesterday.

469
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,380
- Really?
- Yes, it feels quite different.

470
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:13,094
- I don't know what it was like yesterday.
- No, but I do. I know.

471
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,888
It feels different.

472
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,734
Do you drink often?

473
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,695
Not this often.

474
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:35,450
I actually decided to get drunk
only four times a year.

475
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,286
Today might be the day.

476
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:40,914
That sounds great.

477
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,624
I love that.

478
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,627
You won't be sleeping tonight either.

479
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,129
I don't think I can
with this dopamine rush.

480
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,762
Where do you live?

481
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,973
- I--
- I live near Konkuk University.

482
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,224
Really? I'm nearby.

483
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,934
- I live in Seongdong-gu.
- Really?

484
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,480
- Do you live alone?
- No, I live with my family.

485
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,107
How many siblings do you have?

486
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,693
- I have an older sister.
- You do?

487
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,904
I have an older sister
and a younger sister.

488
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,698
Our family is kind of unique.

489
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,492
My younger sister and I
are 18 years apart.

490
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,620
- A late-born child?
- Totally.

491
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,788
She must be adorable.

492
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,748
I think your daughter
will be really pretty.

493
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,375
I really want a daughter.

494
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,336
I've never seen you so passionate.

495
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,839
I really want to have a daughter.

496
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,550
My family has
a strong streak of daughters.

497
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,594
We're all girls.

498
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,351
The thing is, I love children.

499
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,564
That's why I honestly thought

500
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:51,651
I'd get married very early in life.

501
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,030
You know, while I was in my 20s.

502
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,073
Find a girl in her 20s.

503
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,745
- You're in your 20s.
- Yes, I am.

504
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,955
I'll leave it at that.

505
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,217
Don't they seem
like they're getting along well?

506
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,469
- They do.
- Right?

507
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:21,181
More than anything,
I think Sung-min is smitten.

508
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:25,435
He looks completely different today
from how he was in Paradise yesterday.

509
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,646
He's so intrigued and smitten by her.

510
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,192
I can tell how badly
he wants to get to know her.

511
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,069
They both seem to be
attracted to each other.

512
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,488
Yes, definitely. That's for sure.

513
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,625
- Do you like it?
- It smells like a pool.

514
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:52,253
- This place is just for us.
- Really? No way!

515
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,507
Look at that.

516
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,261
- Man.
- This is amazing.

517
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,516
Seung-il would've cried if he came here.

518
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,519
- Totally.
- Without a doubt.

519
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,230
Do you want to swim?

520
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,023
I just want to float like this.

521
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,358
Go ahead. I can hold you.

522
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,947
Shouldn't you put your face inside?

523
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,990
- No, I'm just going to float.
- No?

524
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,660
I'm just floating.

525
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,664
- You're--
- This is too hard.

526
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,958
Next time, I'll get wine…

527
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,127
We should've ordered wine then.

528
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,258
- We don't know who it'll be with.
- Yes, right. That's true.

529
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,968
Feelings can change.

530
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:47,642
When we held hands in the pool,

531
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,185
it felt nice.

532
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,814
This is really embarrassing.

533
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,318
Come here.

534
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,531
How do I turn on the flash?

535
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,868
It just goes off automatically,
so we have to take it like this.

536
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,746
No, I want to take a photo of us
in the mirror.

537
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,622
I like taking mirror selfies.

538
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,005
- Can you see?
- Yes.

539
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,558
- There will be dots.
- Why?

540
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,269
- Because of the flash?
- Yes.

541
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,854
Have you done this before?

542
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,272
Yesterday.

543
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,152
I did it yesterday.

544
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,822
Then, I wouldn't have taken one.

545
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,618
- Well, you wanted to try it.
- I've always wanted to try it.

546
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,039
I did something like this.

547
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,667
Yesterday? I don't really want to know.

548
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,547
- You should be curious.
- I'm not. I don't want to know.

549
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,383
- Only answer the questions I ask.
- Okay.

550
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,975
- How do you feel after the swim?
- It's nice.

551
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,065
- How do you feel?
- It's nice.

552
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,610
The thing about today was that

553
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,156
I kept wondering
if what I was doing was right.

554
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,827
I thought I might be able
to make up my mind if I came here.

555
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:34,165
So it was really nice
to get a chance to talk to you.

556
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,877
- I think so, too.
- Right.

557
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,548
That's why I also understand
your ever-changing feelings.

558
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,717
Try everything out while you're here.

559
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,971
- You too.
- I will, if I get the chance.

560
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,641
But I have a feeling…

561
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,855
I'll stay the same.

562
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,110
I'll probably stay like this.

563
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,445
How can you be so sure?

564
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,781
Because I know me.

565
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,158
I just do.

566
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,536
There won't be any change.

567
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,547
Am I drunk?

568
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,263
About this much.

569
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,224
This much?

570
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,272
Just a little.

571
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,650
No, not this much.

572
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,819
- This much.
- Just a bit.

573
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,446
It's that much?

574
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,240
This much.

575
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,621
- Today is the day she gets drunk.
- It is.

576
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:59,125
Go-eun must feel relaxed
after having a drink.

577
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:04,297
I think that was her being herself.
Being sweet and cute.

578
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,257
I wish Sung-min would

579
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:11,387
show his feelings more openly
if he's really into Go-eun.

580
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,556
But he hasn't expressed much.

581
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:18,436
- It feels like he's shy and is nervous.
- Yes.

582
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,396
Maybe because he likes her so much.

583
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,524
I don't think he's the type
to take the lead in a relationship.

584
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,652
- No.
- I want to see his move.

585
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,320
It's a shame we didn't see that.

586
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,363
This is nice.

587
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,864
PARADISE
LEE JOO-YOUNG & KIM JAE-JIN

588
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,075
- Do you want to sit?
- Sure.

589
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,471
When we wrote down the names earlier,

590
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,059
- was it hard to decide?
- No.

591
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,644
- It wasn't?
- No.

592
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,317
- But it was hard for you, right?
- No, it wasn't for me either.

593
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,235
- No?
- No.

594
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,404
- But--
- I told you, didn't I?

595
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,115
I said that I decided right away.

596
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,578
Even though today was the first time
we actually interacted,

597
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:23,751
playing a game together
helped me bond with you.

598
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,422
So I wanted to talk to you,

599
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,215
but I wasn't able to.

600
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,136
We'll have another chance
to have some coffee.

601
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,554
Come in.

602
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,473
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

603
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,183
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

604
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,603
- See you.
- Okay, see you.

605
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,276
That was

606
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,194
quite a bummer.

607
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,908
I'm glad we both chose each other
for our first trip to Paradise.

608
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,076
We really clicked.

609
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,418
What's your ideal type?

610
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,711
Tell me your ideal type.

611
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,712
My ideal type?

612
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,882
I'm not sure what that means.

613
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,136
- What do you mean?
- This is what I tell people.

614
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,221
I say I like someone who is sexy,

615
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,518
but I don't mean someone with crazy curves
or anything like that.

616
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,979
No, but more like their aura?

617
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,315
Simply put, I like people
who seem sexy to me.

618
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,524
I see.

619
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,944
I don't want to limit
my ideal type with words.

620
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,949
That's why it's a bit difficult for me
to talk about my ideal type.

621
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:42,121
We usually talk about the kind of vibe
we're looking for in a person.

622
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,664
I guess I'm the one at fault.

623
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,542
- Shall we try again?
- Here's my ideal type.

624
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:52,131
I like someone smaller
and slimmer rather than chubby.

625
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,342
- I like someone who is slim.
- Someone slim.

626
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,345
Someone with big eyes
instead of very small ones,

627
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,431
and with double eyelids rather than none.

628
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,600
I swear I'm not describing you.

629
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,190
- Someone who can be sexy, then cute.
- "Sexy, then cute"?

630
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,068
That's just how I put it.

631
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,531
When it comes to looks,

632
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,534
I prefer someone with a good vibe

633
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,161
rather than someone
who's stunningly good-looking.

634
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,205
- A good vibe?
- Someone with a nice aura.

635
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,626
That's when I start wanting
to get to know them.

636
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,426
It's a bit hard to explain.

637
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,888
- I think they're into each other.
- Right.

638
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,891
- They seem to be lovey-dovey.
- You're right.

639
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,106
That looks good.

640
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,566
Do you want some?

641
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,901
- What is it?
- Tofu.

642
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,362
Tofu is…

643
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,490
made with soybeans, right?

644
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,825
Yes.

645
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:02,910
Soybeans.

646
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,623
- They have lecithin.
- What? How do you know that?

647
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,001
I don't know. I just do.

648
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,712
- I enjoy reading nutritional information.
- You do?

649
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,798
- That's new.
- I thought everyone was like me.

650
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,051
- No, not everyone.
- Right? I realized it much later.

651
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,556
You cracked me up earlier
talking about sweet potatoes.

652
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,808
The corn talk.

653
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:30,021
- That was funny? All right!
- Yes, it was so silly that it was funny.

654
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,439
I have a hundred of those.

655
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,608
I can do it with everything here.

656
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,068
But I'm happy
as long as you find it funny.

657
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,198
- Someone who can find this funny.
- I see.

658
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,158
Especially the random things.

659
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,871
Things like, "It raises blood sugar."

660
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,582
How do you feel about women
with an appetite?

661
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,377
- Add that to my ideal type list.
- Someone who eats well?

662
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,298
But I did say I like someone slim.

663
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,883
Someone who's slim but eats well?

664
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,802
There are too many prerequisites.

665
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,971
I can't believe I met someone…

666
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,183
Did I just meet my ideal type?

667
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,692
Jae-jin flirts quite a lot, too.

668
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,694
- He must find her cute.
- He's falling for her.

669
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,948
This is odd to discuss over steak,

670
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,659
but how old are you?

671
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,077
26.

672
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,206
- I was born in 2000.
- Wait, I should've guessed.

673
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,792
Why didn't you ask?
I thought you'd go, "Try to guess."

674
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,336
That's so boring. Everyone does that.

675
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,462
- That was fun.
- Yes.

676
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,756
- I wanted to be different.
- Yes, I love it.

677
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,052
- How old are you?
- I was born in 1998.

678
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,806
- Not a huge gap.
- Surprising, right?

679
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,599
You look very young.

680
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,601
Nicely done.

681
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,938
You have a good eye for people,
so you saw through my immaturity.

682
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,732
I noticed you were a bit of an oddball

683
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,443
starting from the game.

684
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,989
Do you enjoy what you do for a living?

685
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:08,869
- I do it because I like it.
- You do?

686
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,788
It's something I've always done.

687
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,125
It's either arts or sports.

688
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,710
You're right.

689
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:24,260
I studied furniture design,
and now I'm a craft designer.

690
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,679
That's what I do.

691
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,849
<i>I'm a craft designer.</i>

692
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,728
<i>While studying furniture design,</i>

693
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,022
<i>I started making home decor.</i>

694
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,694
<i>My main focus is on resin-made vases,</i>

695
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:46,449
<i>and my designs are patented.</i>

696
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,660
<i>I really love flowers,</i>

697
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,205
<i>and because I felt sad seeing them wilt,</i>

698
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:57,376
<i>I began using resin</i>
<i>to preserve them longer.</i>

699
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,087
<i>That idea has led me to where I am today.</i>

700
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,592
<i>I hold exhibitions</i>
<i>and continue to pursue my artistic career.</i>

701
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,722
LEE JOO-YOUNG
BORN IN 2000, CRAFT DESIGNER

702
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,183
I mostly make home decor.

703
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,103
- Do you know what that is?
- Of course, I do.

704
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,358
- I'm a modern dancer.
- You do modern dancing?

705
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,902
Arts and sports? All right!

706
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,238
It's nice to meet someone in this field.
But really?

707
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,574
- You're a dancer?
- Yes.

708
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,203
- Do you perform on stage?
- I do.

709
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:33,788
It suits you.

710
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,712
What are you like when you date?

711
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:45,966
I have to fall in love
to start dating someone,

712
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,428
and once I'm smitten,
I tend to accommodate her needs.

713
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,479
When it comes to love,
I think I'm a strong believer in fate.

714
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,816
- Those who are meant to be will meet.
- I agree.

715
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,901
I believe in fate.

716
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:16,539
Would we have had this time to chat
if we hadn't played that game together?

717
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,458
The past is the past.

718
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,378
Let's not think about that.
Let's focus on the positive.

719
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,965
Unbelievable.

720
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:28,843
Well,

721
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:33,055
you might laugh more with the others,

722
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,099
but I'm probably the most fun.

723
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,186
- You are fun.
- I know.

724
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,857
You're really unique.

725
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,069
- You can't take it that way.
- What?

726
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,613
I've devised everything
to make this funny.

727
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,907
You planned everything? Don't do that.

728
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,201
- It's a habit. I want to be funny.
- Really?

729
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,662
- I'm obsessed with saying odd stuff.
- Stop that.

730
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,540
It's because I want
to see you laugh once more.

731
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,210
- You must be racking your brain.
- It's that smile.

732
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,755
- I do it without thinking, just for this.
- Really?

733
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,759
- You know what I mean?
- Sure.

734
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,346
Seriously…

735
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,265
One thing's for sure.

736
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,727
- What is it?
- I don't know what'll happen to us later,

737
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,188
but if our feelings are real,

738
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,691
we would've met
even if we hadn't played that game.

739
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,776
- We would've met anyhow?
- That game didn't matter.

740
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,113
- Those who are meant to be will meet.
- Yes, you're right.

741
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,331
I love those eyes.

742
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,707
- Yes, it's nice.
- Yes.

743
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:48,047
We got to see how Jae-jin changes
when he's with someone he likes.

744
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:53,677
When people are with someone they love
and feel drawn to,

745
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:58,516
they show their most natural
and loveliest sides.

746
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:02,394
I think their innate charm
naturally emerges

747
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,439
when they're trying to woo someone.

748
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,817
- I saw a bit of love in Jae-jin's eyes.
- Yes.

749
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,362
PARADISE
CHOI MINA SUE & LIM SU-BEEN

750
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,114
- Is this place all for us?
- I think so.

751
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,507
So, how were…

752
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,136
the last two days like for you?

753
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:43,060
- At first, you didn't seem to talk a lot.
- Yes.

754
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,438
There are a lot of people there.

755
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,317
So instead of getting to know everyone,

756
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,320
I wanted to focus on the one
I'm the most interested in.

757
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,406
Something like that.

758
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,286
What did you think
when you first came yesterday?

759
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,704
You know…

760
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,416
- About first impressions?
- First impression.

761
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,834
Well…

762
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,296
You left the best impression on me.

763
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,547
- Really?
- Yes.

764
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,299
I have a question.

765
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,135
This was on the first day.

766
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,512
- You wrote your letter, right?
- Yes.

767
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,763
Who did you send it to?

768
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,477
- I can't tell.
- I'll keep this one to myself.

769
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,732
But I really want to know.

770
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,359
Let's go back to the first impressions.

771
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:36,196
- You seemed like--
- You're changing the subject.

772
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,825
- I want to know.
- What?

773
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,245
I'll keep it a secret, so can you tell me?

774
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,330
It wasn't me, right?

775
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,459
- Why do you think so?
- I don't know. I don't think it was me.

776
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,793
How many did you receive?

777
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,046
I got three.

778
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,552
- I doubt you sent it to me.
- You don't think so?

779
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,348
- I said I'd focus on one person.
- You did.

780
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,265
- Yes.
- Yes.

781
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,436
- Really?
- Yes.

782
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,729
- For real?
- Yes.

783
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,230
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

784
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,986
One of the three was from me.

785
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,154
- I see.
- Yes.

786
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,906
I knew it. I was correct.

787
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,076
Because towards the end,

788
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,953
we had a chance
to have a quick conversation, right?

789
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,956
- We talked about MBTI types.
- Yes.

790
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:33,045
- Are you shy around strangers?
- Just a little, when I first meet them.

791
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:38,133
I want to know your MBTI type,
but I'm not sure if I can ask, so I won't.

792
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,052
I think I can guess yours.

793
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,679
- My MBTI type?
- Yes.

794
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,389
Try taking a guess then.

795
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,061
Good luck guessing my MBTI type.

796
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,146
- Is this a bet?
- Yes, okay.

797
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,898
- I think I can guess yours.
- Okay.

798
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,651
- Let's talk about it later.
- Okay.

799
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:04,785
I had a feeling that moment
might've been memorable.

800
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:11,542
- It wasn't because of that moment.
- Really? I thought it was.

801
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,587
For me, it was all about
your first impression.

802
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,049
- My canary dress.
- Yes.

803
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:20,467
Hello.

804
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,886
You walked over with confidence,

805
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:29,059
but when you sat down,
you seemed rather shy.

806
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,729
So, that was an unexpected charm.

807
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,732
I see.

808
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,278
I had no idea.

809
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:44,616
I can't tell what you're thinking
from your face.

810
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,576
Me?

811
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,495
Yes, I get that a lot.

812
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,455
- You do?
- Yes.

813
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,624
My ideal MBTI type is INTJ.

814
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:56,295
- Really?
- I keep thinking you might be an INTJ.

815
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,422
That's my guess.

816
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,300
Okay.

817
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:08,515
After you had chicken breast with me,

818
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,435
did you talk to anybody else?

819
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:12,978
No, I haven't.

820
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,108
Mina Sue seems really pleased.

821
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,485
- Yes.
- Very much.

822
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,653
She loves that he only talked to her.

823
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:27,868
I'm starving.

824
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,246
- I could eat a cow.
- I could eat a horse.

825
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,915
Yes, I bet you're hungry.

826
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,875
- Oh my. This is--
- Wine first?

827
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,002
A toast with wine?

828
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,921
Should we toast with the same drink?

829
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,549
I'm not very good at this,
so please bear with me.

830
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,094
It's all right.

831
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,228
Goodness.

832
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,355
Hey, wine expert. What do you think?

833
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,731
He didn't use the lever.

834
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,816
- He just used his power.
- Just his power?

835
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,194
- Yes.
- We usually use the lever.

836
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,529
He just pulled it out.

837
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:07,241
- I want to try the soup first.
- Yes, sure.

838
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,413
How is it?

839
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,333
It's good. I feel much better.

840
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,887
- It's really good.
- You look so happy.

841
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,349
- Can you look that way, please?
- What?

842
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,353
You can stop now.

843
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,649
This really is Paradise.

844
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,235
It really is.

845
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,409
Is it good?

846
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,203
I'm so curious.

847
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:57,499
I don't know where to begin.
My thoughts are all over the place.

848
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,376
What's at the top of the list?

849
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,379
Honestly speaking,
I want to know how old you are.

850
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:06,216
- But you want to say that last.
- Yes, I'll tell you that last.

851
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,260
Okay, then.

852
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,345
What do you do?

853
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,306
- What do I do?
- A model?

854
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,310
What you said before
was kind of right, too.

855
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,769
- An athlete?
- Yes.

856
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,063
Really? See? I knew it.

857
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,323
Athlete? Are you an athlete?

858
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,074
I think you might be an athlete.

859
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:42,419
I used to be an athlete,
but I'm now a model.

860
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,297
- May I ask what sport you played?
- Take a guess.

861
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,965
Volleyball?

862
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,091
Is it basketball?

863
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,344
Throwing… Baseball?

864
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,262
- That's right.
- You did baseball?

865
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,180
Yes.

866
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,683
- I see. For how long?
- For about ten years.

867
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,060
- Ten years?
- Yes.

868
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,939
<i>I was a baseball player for ten years.</i>

869
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:08,111
<i>I was a pitcher, but I had to quit</i>
<i>because I injured my shoulder.</i>

870
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,448
Man, a baseball player
who looks like that?

871
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:14,159
- That's so unfair.
- Gosh.

872
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,453
And he was a pitcher, too.

873
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,498
<i>I'm currently working as a model</i>

874
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:24,544
<i>for lookbooks and advertisements</i>
<i>of many clothing brands.</i>

875
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,674
LIM SU-BEEN
MODEL

876
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:35,847
That was why you were so good at throwing.

877
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,433
It was so fast, scary even.

878
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,268
I didn't notice yesterday

879
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:43,897
because you were wearing
oversized clothes.

880
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,150
But today, you were different.

881
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:50,821
Yes.

882
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:54,366
I thought you had a nice shape.

883
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:02,374
From my first impression of you,
I also had a feeling you were a model.

884
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,625
- Really?
- Yes.

885
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,545
Do you want to know?

886
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:10,132
Yes, I don't have the faintest idea.

887
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,552
- I'm still a student.
- I see.

888
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:18,890
I'm studying Communications
at a university in America.

889
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,226
And currently interning at a beauty brand.

890
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,394
- I see.
- Yes.

891
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,688
<i>I'm currently a student.</i>

892
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,317
<i>I study Communications</i>
<i>at the University of Illinois.</i>

893
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,571
<i>I'm currently on leave,</i>
<i>so I've returned to Korea</i>

894
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,574
<i>to work as an intern at a beauty startup.</i>

895
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,369
<i>I'm primarily responsible</i>
<i>for English communications</i>

896
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,955
<i>with international buyers at my workplace.</i>

897
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:44,875
CHOI MINA SUE, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS
COMMUNICATION MAJOR

898
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,462
- That's why you were good at English.
- Yes.

899
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,547
I spent quite a while overseas.

900
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,759
- Ever since you were a child?
- I was born overseas.

901
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,427
- I see. In America?
- Australia.

902
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,262
- Australia?
- I was born in Sydney.

903
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,475
We have completely opposite personalities.

904
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,727
You mentioned MBTI types, right?

905
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,146
I think we have the exact opposite.

906
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,898
- Right?
- Come to think of it, yes.

907
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,691
I am an INTJ, as you said.

908
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,360
- See? I told you so.
- Yes.

909
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,113
- Did I surprise you?
- You did.

910
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:20,494
- People rarely guess INTJ.
- I always hit it off well with INTJs.

911
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,998
What are the exact characteristics?
I don't know them well.

912
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,376
First, they aren't talkative.

913
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,003
Right.

914
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,924
They aren't too outgoing.

915
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:37,052
And they get fully invested
in what captivates them.

916
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:42,390
When they're into someone,
they go all in with only that person.

917
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,768
Are you drawn to INTJ
because it's the opposite of yours?

918
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,811
I think so.

919
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:51,608
As you may have noticed,
I'm the chattering type.

920
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,736
- INTJ types don't talk a lot.
- No.

921
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:01,243
So, they seem to be intrigued
and fascinated by that side of me.

922
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,119
If not, never mind.

923
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,666
That was interesting.

924
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,711
Can you tell me your age now?

925
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,672
My age?

926
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,674
May I take a guess first?

927
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,842
- My age?
- Yes.

928
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:21,513
- Which year do you think I was born in?
- The year?

929
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,391
Either 1999 or 1998.

930
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,728
Are you around those years
or are you younger?

931
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,652
- I'm not older.
- So you're younger?

932
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,905
I was born in 2002.

933
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,991
- What? In 2002?
- Yes.

934
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,076
- In 2002?
- Yes.

935
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,745
- He's so young!
- Really?

936
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,830
He looks young.

937
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,833
- Mina Sue must be older.
- I think so.

938
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:50,792
Why?

939
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,590
- You were born in 2002?
- Yes, am I too young for you?

940
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,468
No, the difference isn't too big.

941
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,596
It's my first time
meeting someone born in 2002.

942
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,097
- Pardon?
- Yes.

943
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,100
It's your first time
seeing a World Cup baby?

944
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,311
- Yes, he's a World Cup baby.
- A World Cup baby.

945
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,395
He really is.

946
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:13,148
- That's right.
- A World Cup baby is on <i>Single's Inferno?</i>

947
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,568
It's your first time
seeing a World Cup baby?

948
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:17,485
It's my first time.

949
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:21,948
I've never sat down and had a meal
with someone born in 2002.

950
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,159
In my life. Really.

951
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,955
- When were you born?
- Well, I'm not that much older.

952
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,458
- I was born in 1999, like you said.
- I was right.

953
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,001
That's nothing.

954
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:37,589
But in 2002? I had a feeling
that you might be older than me.

955
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:40,342
- I see.
- So, I thought you might be older.

956
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,224
Have you never dated anyone younger?

957
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,685
- Not even on a blind date?
- No.

958
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:55,440
- I knew you'd be older.
- You did?

959
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,526
- Because I'm on the younger side.
- I see.

960
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,403
But I thought we'd get along

961
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,697
- I see.
- regardless of our ages.

962
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,200
Thank you.

963
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,290
I'm a bit taken aback right now,
so I might start glitching.

964
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,584
- All right. I'll give you time.
- Okay.

965
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,721
You can speak casually with me.

966
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,889
- Me?
- Yes.

967
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,225
Speak…

968
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:37,774
- Can I take my time and do that later?
- Yes, of course.

969
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,651
If I do that now,

970
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,362
I might act like I'm older.

971
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,031
But I won't call you "<i>noona."</i>

972
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,533
- No?
- No.

973
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,702
I kind of want to see you do it.

974
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,371
But don't do it.
I might start acting weird.

975
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,914
I can't do it back there anyway.

976
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:57,544
Right, it's a perk we can only enjoy
while we're here.

977
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,212
Yes.

978
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,301
- Can you swim?
- Of course.

979
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:08,930
Okay, let's go swimming.

980
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:17,022
- Why are you suddenly talking casually?
- I tried to do it naturally just now.

981
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:17,939
Okay.

982
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,776
- Why did you point it out?
- Because my heart skipped a beat.

983
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,946
- Okay, let's move on.
- Okay.

984
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,202
- Let's go swimming.
- Shall we?

985
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:37,500
This is nice. They revealed their ages,
but the dynamic hasn't changed.

986
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,335
I love how it's the same.

987
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,963
- And the difference isn't much.
- Just three years?

988
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,132
- And Su-been is calm.
- Yes.

989
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,051
- He's mature.
- He is.

990
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,595
Do you want to jump in?

991
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,055
- Really?
- Yes.

992
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:02,817
- You really did it.
- Of course.

993
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,362
- She went all the way in.
- Even her face!

994
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,156
- Isn't that a first?
- She's so bold.

995
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,949
- Yes, totally.
- She's so bold.

996
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,701
Gosh, that was so satisfying.

997
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,330
I'm jealous. I want to do it, too.

998
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,380
I'm the happiest I've been
since we got here.

999
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,799
- Really?
- Yes.

1000
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:30,178
- You must like getaways.
- I really do.

1001
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:35,058
This is fun. It's waking me up.
This was a great idea.

1002
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,311
- They look so free.
- Yes.

1003
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,606
<i>- She's like a Disney princess.</i>
<i>- She's so pretty.</i>

1004
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,528
<i>- They're both good-looking.</i>
<i>- I love seeing these two together.</i>

1005
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:54,494
<i>I had the most fun when we went swimming.</i>

1006
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:58,039
It felt really freeing.

1007
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:03,753
I liked how we spent time
enjoying that moment together.

1008
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,923
Who do you think will play tomorrow?
Men or the women?

1009
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,218
Probably the women.

1010
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,097
I wonder if I can win.

1011
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,226
I want to win and come back here.

1012
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,729
- With me?
- What?

1013
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:23,857
Yes.

1014
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:37,620
As more time passed
and the night deepened,

1015
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,873
we got to have more honest conversations.

1016
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:44,461
After I took off my makeup
and put on comfortable clothes,

1017
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,588
that's when we became closer.

1018
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,674
Do something sexy for me.

1019
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,134
- Sexy?
- Yes.

1020
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,051
Sexy?

1021
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,345
Yes, stick out your waist.

1022
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:55,763
Excellent.

1023
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,765
Here we go. One, two, three.

1024
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,687
- Let's take one together.
- Sure.

1025
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,814
One, two, three.

1026
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,112
- Why did you look?
- I didn't look!

1027
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,658
What is this? You don't look ugly.
You have to look even uglier.

1028
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,079
I had a lot of fun today.

1029
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,415
Me too.

1030
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:27,086
I had much more fun than I imagined.

1031
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,966
- You had that much fun?
- Yes, it was that fun.

1032
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,261
I hope it was the same for you.

1033
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,430
It was.

1034
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,354
- Good night.
- Night.

1035
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:54,239
They're the type of couple
that makes you smile.

1036
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,782
This season is a lot of fun.

1037
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,868
And Su-been is different

1038
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:02,705
because when guys are younger,
they try to act more mature,

1039
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,124
and that becomes almost too predictable.

1040
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,126
But he doesn't pretend.

1041
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,921
He just naturally seems mature.

1042
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:14,801
Mina Sue said
she has never dated a younger guy,

1043
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,512
but I don't think she's against it.
She's interested in Su-been.

1044
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,638
I think she's into him.

1045
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,682
- I look forward to seeing them.
- Yes.

1046
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:23,017
He's young, but he doesn't act like it.

1047
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:23,935
- No.
- Right.

1048
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:28,022
What I like about Su-been is when he said,
"I won't call you '<i>noona.</i>'"

1049
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,983
- That's the perfect attitude.
- Yes.

1050
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:34,654
He's saying
he'll keep his appeal as a man,

1051
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,698
and it probably made her heart flutter.

1052
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,743
But there could come a time
when he suddenly calls her <i>"noona."</i>

1053
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,037
- That's another twist.
- She'll fall for that, too.

1054
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,373
Why are you excited?

1055
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,084
- I mean, I was watching them.
- What's with you?

1056
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,544
He's on her list.

1057
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,714
Please try to understand
when we put ourselves in their shoes.

1058
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,383
- Especially, as we watch the footage.
- Yes, of course.

1059
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,385
- All right.
- That's the fun of the show.

1060
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,804
Did you imagine him saying that?

1061
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:00,763
No, I…

1062
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,392
- She did.
- I want to see it happen.

1063
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,561
We might see it in the future.

1064
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,396
Su-been is a cool guy.

1065
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,606
- I like him.
- Yes.

1066
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,524
They're cute together.

1067
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,568
- Yes, they're cute.
- Such a cute couple.

1068
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,037
We're back in Inferno.

1069
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,499
They must be at the Cafeteria.

1070
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,419
What if there's someone new again?

1071
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,923
- They're back.
- What? Where?

1072
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,724
The Hyun-Hyeon brothers.

1073
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,187
- Hello.
- Hello.

1074
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,315
- Hello.
- It's nice to see you.

1075
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:56,569
We're back.

1076
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,488
Welcome back.

1077
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,077
We're back.

1078
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,045
- Wait, you haven't eaten?
- I couldn't eat a lot.

1079
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,340
Sweet potato.

1080
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,760
That was quick.

1081
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,934
How was everyone?

1082
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,186
Not bad.

1083
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:33,564
Did you have fun?

1084
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,858
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

1085
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,652
- Not bad for everyone?
- Yes.

1086
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,989
Did you do anything fun?

1087
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,743
- I went swimming.
- Really?

1088
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,412
Breaststroke, with my head out.

1089
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,665
- Can you say…
- I put on a show all by myself.

1090
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,752
We dove into the water.

1091
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,130
We jumped in.

1092
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,592
- We counted to three and jumped in.
- That sounds fun.

1093
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,387
- We went to an amusement park.
- It was all to ourselves.

1094
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:08,141
- I wanted to do backstroke.
- We would've…

1095
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,059
- Right?
- Swam the night away.

1096
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:15,314
We made a bet,
so we became competitive and jumped in.

1097
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,483
This is bad.

1098
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:21,779
Those who were left behind
start to feel spiteful,

1099
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,823
while those who had left are still happy.

1100
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:24,907
- You're right.
- Yes.

1101
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,618
Who are you most curious to ask?

1102
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,748
Me? Seung-il and Sung-min.

1103
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,999
- Us two?
- Yes.

1104
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,796
I was surprised that Go-eun and I
seemed to be on the same wavelength.

1105
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,215
I thought otherwise.

1106
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,052
For me,

1107
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:48,222
Min-gee was just as I thought
she would be.

1108
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:52,101
She's friendly,
and our personalities seemed to click.

1109
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:00,693
What about you, Su-been?

1110
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:04,363
For me, I never had a dull moment.

1111
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,573
- Really?
- No.

1112
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:08,034
She's really energetic.

1113
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,245
I had a lot of fun.

1114
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,665
You're smiling way too much.

1115
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,626
- Yes, his smile…
- He's smiling ear to ear.

1116
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:17,543
No way.

1117
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,295
- You're beaming.
- Literally ear to ear.

1118
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,303
It's great to have everyone back.

1119
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:31,682
Yes, do you know how lonely I felt
sleeping here alone?

1120
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,519
- Everyone here had left.
- You two had each other at least.

1121
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:38,189
- Who did you miss the most?
- Me?

1122
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,445
Who do you want
to talk to the most, Hyeon-woo?

1123
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,076
Me? My first choice.

1124
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:52,912
- First choice? Who?
- Yes.

1125
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,374
Yeah.

1126
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,877
- Wasn't it Go-eun?
- Go-eun?

1127
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:00,795
Min-gee?

1128
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:03,548
- Was it Min-gee?
- It was Min-gee.

1129
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:13,516
- Who did you miss?
- I missed Joo-young.

1130
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,562
I missed her the most.

1131
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:24,902
Start talking.

1132
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:26,779
You start talking. Now.

1133
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:31,117
What was it like, everyone?

1134
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,410
Jae-jin?

1135
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,246
- Joo-young?
- Jae-jin?

1136
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:37,790
- Jae-jin.
- I had fun.

1137
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,959
- You guys had a nice vibe.
- Yes.

1138
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,961
- You seemed closer.
- Yes, we are now.

1139
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,589
We got to talk a lot.
We really got to talk.

1140
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:48,801
He was similar to the idea I had of him.

1141
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,553
- Really?
- Yes.

1142
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,848
I think he's a very composed guy.

1143
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:55,266
- Yes.
- He was.

1144
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:58,019
And calm. Yes.

1145
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,812
Now, Go-eun's turn.

1146
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:02,481
Me?

1147
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,067
Did you two hit it off?

1148
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,362
- I had fun talking to him.
- Are you more interested in him?

1149
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:09,322
I am.

1150
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,825
If you could go there with him again,
would you?

1151
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,785
Yes, I think I would like to.

1152
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,456
I understood why people
want to go to Paradise.

1153
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,416
Not only is it about the environment,

1154
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:24,211
but you can also talk more freely
about everything.

1155
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:25,296
You seemed really happy.

1156
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,256
- Me? What do you mean?
- Yes.

1157
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,551
Your eyes were full of love.
Love was written all over your face.

1158
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,469
You're lying.

1159
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:33,846
I could see his eyes sparkling
through his sunglasses.

1160
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,389
He put them on intentionally.

1161
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,309
It was more fun than I anticipated.

1162
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:42,146
But did having fun together
spark more interest?

1163
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,857
Well…

1164
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:51,072
I became more interested than I expected.

1165
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:53,783
We became really close.

1166
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:58,955
But we seemed closer last night.
Things were awkward when we woke up.

1167
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,665
We also heard

1168
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:04,669
that Su-been is taciturn and quiet
even when he's with the guys.

1169
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:08,005
- I'm not so sure about that.
- Really?

1170
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:11,926
- He must've been talkative.
- He must've felt awkward with the guys.

1171
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:13,594
Min-gee's turn.

1172
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,639
I had fun.

1173
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,307
- What?
- I had so much fun.

1174
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:22,144
Isn't that enough?
I was quite happy. All right.

1175
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,063
Don't look at me with those eyes.

1176
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,191
- Seriously.
- Like a deer in the headlights.

1177
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,486
Did your heart flutter?

1178
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:34,031
My heart definitely skipped a beat.

1179
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,575
I think my heart fluttered.
I think so. Probably.

1180
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,160
- It's different.
- Maybe?

1181
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:42,623
- Your response is different from day one.
- But I was really nervous.

1182
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,375
- Really?
- I got nervous, me!

1183
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:45,835
I mean, me!

1184
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:52,258
Anyway, the conversations were fun,
and he was just my type.

1185
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,512
I said I wanted to talk to others
because I was curious about them, right?

1186
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:58,389
But I'm not curious at all now.

1187
01:06:58,472 --> 01:06:59,849
- Really?
- Wait, really?

1188
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:02,518
They all had a great time in Paradise.

1189
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,937
The older girls all fell
for the younger boys.

1190
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,064
- They are all smitten.
- Completely.

1191
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,693
But I'm not curious at all now.

1192
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:12,862
- I don't need to explore now.
- I got goosebumps.

1193
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:14,864
My gosh! She got goosebumps. What is this?

1194
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,782
- I got goosebumps.
- She really got goosebumps!

1195
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,784
It's all over.

1196
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:23,539
- Is he your type in terms of looks, too?
- I'm not into the bad boy look.

1197
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,752
But now that I like him, he seems cute.

1198
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:30,504
I even like the way he looks now.

1199
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:34,341
He wore his hair down today,
and even that looked really cute.

1200
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:37,136
Oh no.
It's over once they start to look cute.

1201
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,723
If she's that open about it,
others might find it hard to approach him.

1202
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,518
He looks so cute.
Even his smile looks cute.

1203
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:47,730
- That's love.
- It's not that serious yet.

1204
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,106
But he's cute.

1205
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,276
- It's over if they look cute.
- It is.

1206
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:55,321
When women find men cute,
the game is already over.

1207
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:58,240
But I'm not sure about how he feels.

1208
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,660
Did anything happen to you two?

1209
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:04,872
You must've had one-on-one conversations.

1210
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:08,501
- Did you get to know anyone?
- No, not really.

1211
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:13,339
- At this point, I'm back at ground zero.
- Zero?

1212
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:14,340
Really?

1213
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,426
Geez!

1214
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:22,181
<i>Singles, please gather</i>
<i>in front of the Photo Studio.</i>

1215
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,099
Over there?

1216
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,226
- We're taking pictures…
- We are?

1217
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:26,435
Do we get to see them?

1218
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,687
Do we get to see them?

1219
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:38,614
What will we be doing?

1220
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,075
What is this?

1221
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:49,834
<i>Today's mission is a photoshoot.</i>

1222
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:51,418
A photoshoot?

1223
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,336
What?

1224
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,008
A photoshoot?

1225
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,263
A photoshoot.

1226
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:04,557
- That's new.
- What's a photoshoot mission?

1227
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,143
- Isn't this the first time?
- Yes.

1228
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:14,859
<i>The theme of the photoshoot</i>
<i>is being the hottest couple in the world.</i>

1229
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:19,488
The hottest?

1230
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,365
- That's hard.
- What? That's hard.

1231
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,909
- That's really hard.
- It's so hard.

1232
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:30,166
<i>The couple that gets voted as first place</i>
<i>will receive a special benefit.</i>

1233
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,794
<i>We will begin matching couples.</i>

1234
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:40,176
<i>Women will draw numbered balls</i>
<i>and choose the men in that order.</i>

1235
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:43,137
I'm doomed.

1236
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:49,018
<i>However, one woman has a chance</i>
<i>to select two men.</i>

1237
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:50,811
That's the winner.

1238
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:56,817
In the couple photoshoot mission,
one woman gets to choose two men.

1239
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,402
- Just one woman.
- An advantage.

1240
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,653
- Just one.
- Lucky her.

1241
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,031
If the woman in the front

1242
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:05,242
does not pick two men,
the next person in line gets the chance.

1243
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:06,202
Next in line?

1244
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:10,748
What happens if nobody picks two men
and the process keeps going?

1245
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:14,251
Then, automatically,
the woman who's in last place

1246
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,003
- will get to do it with two men.
- I see.

1247
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:20,257
For example, if the woman
who got first place doesn't want two men,

1248
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,593
she can just shoot
with one person if she wants.

1249
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:25,638
- Then the next person gets the choice?
- You're right.

1250
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:29,016
This can be risky.
Let's say we have a good relationship,

1251
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:32,269
but if I choose someone else
to do the photoshoot with…

1252
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,897
- This dynamic might become awkward.
- You're right.

1253
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,315
They'll have to be careful.

1254
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,733
- Will you be greedy?
- Right.

1255
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:40,110
Or will you go for one person?

1256
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:43,405
But you have to pick two men
to enter two different photos.

1257
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,742
- It's a better chance.
- That gives you a higher chance to win.

1258
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,161
Mina Sue said that was the winner

1259
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:52,373
because the probability goes up
when someone picks two men.

1260
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:57,461
<i>Now, please take turns drawing the ball</i>
<i>starting with Kim Min-gee.</i>

1261
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:58,712
Kim Min-gee.

1262
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:16,313
<i>Let me announce the order in which</i>
<i>you will select your photoshoot partner.</i>

1263
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,691
<i>First, Lee Joo-young.</i>

1264
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:21,026
<i>Second, Park Hee-sun.</i>

1265
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,279
<i>Third, Kim Min-gee.</i>

1266
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,572
<i>Fourth, Ham Ye-jin.</i>

1267
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,033
<i>Fifth, Choi Mina Sue.</i>

1268
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,452
<i>Sixth, Kim Go-eun.</i>

1269
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:33,247
<i>Lee Joo-young.</i>

1270
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:36,917
<i>Please choose the person</i>
<i>you'd like to do a photoshoot with.</i>

1271
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,961
Oh, right now.

1272
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:44,800
Will it be one or two?

1273
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,385
- One person.
- One?

1274
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:49,305
- It might be two.
- She wouldn't do that.

1275
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,818
The person I'd like to do
a photoshoot with is…

1276
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,655
There's a chance it might be Hyun-jae.

1277
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:07,948
Youn Hyun-jae?

1278
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,869
The person I'd like to do
a photoshoot with is…

1279
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,790
Shin Hyeon-woo.

1280
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:22,671
- Shin Hyeon-woo?
- Hyeon-woo?

1281
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:23,797
What's going on?

1282
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,508
Shin Hyeon-woo.

1283
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,229
<i>I was the first to make a choice.</i>

1284
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:45,152
<i>I gave my vote to Hyeon-woo.</i>

1285
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:49,031
She did write the letter to Hyeon-woo
because she was interested in him.

1286
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:50,491
- Really?
- You're right.

1287
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:55,829
<i>We haven't had a chance to talk,</i>
<i>so I decided to choose him.</i>

1288
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:58,874
I see.

1289
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,376
- This is a new dynamic.
- Yes.

1290
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,544
We forgot about the first impression vote.

1291
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,964
<i>I was a bit heartbroken</i>
<i>when Joo-young chose Hyeon-woo.</i>

1292
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:10,552
But I just figured it was for the mission.
I tried not to read into it.

1293
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:15,933
I hope she gets to know Hyeon-woo…

1294
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,020
and return to me.

1295
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:24,650
<i>Park Hee-sun.</i>

1296
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:27,945
<i>Please choose the person</i>
<i>you'd like to do a photoshoot with.</i>

1297

1298
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:36,286
Lim Su-been.

1299
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:39,164
- There we go.
- Yes.

1300
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,666
They'll make a nice picture.

1301
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,668
Lim Su-been.

1302
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,257

that I'm blanking out on their names.

Name…

1315
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:11,131
