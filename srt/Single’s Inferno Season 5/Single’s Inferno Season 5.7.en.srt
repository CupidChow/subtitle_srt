The person I chose to go on
a special meal date with is…

00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,115
Kim Min-gee.

19
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,077
Kim Min-gee.

20
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,340
Kim Min-gee.

21
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,970
<i>Shin Hyeon-woo and Kim Go-eun.</i>

22
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,807
<i>Song Seung-il and Kim Min-gee.</i>

23
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,892
<i>Please enjoy your special meal date.</i>

24
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,271
Smile.

25
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,484
- Good work.
- Good work.

26
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,444
Smile all you want.

27
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,615
- You're not crying, are you?
- No, I'm not the emotional type.

28
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,242
- You won't cry, will you?
- No.

29
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,754
I thought for sure he would take
Mina Sue to the special meal date.

30
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,966
I went through…

31
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,344
It's difficult
to put into words how I felt.

32
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:19,764
But I felt all the feelings
surging through me at the same time.

33
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,145
She's seriously about to cry.

34
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,521
- She's about to cry.
- Yes.

35
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,482
- She must've been on edge.
- She must've.

36
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,861
- Fried chicken sounds so good.
- Fried chicken.

37
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,530
I'm jealous of these two.

38
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,491
Chicken sounds so good.

39
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,870
- Chicken.
- It's probably fried chicken, right?

40
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:45,582
- You look rather excited.
- Yes, my heart is racing like crazy.

41
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:50,211
- It's racing. I keep trying to--
- You didn't think Seung-il would win.

42
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,839
- You said there's no way.
- But I was serious.

43
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,799
I kept putting him down
and said he would lose.

44
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,426
- Right?
- But he won.

45
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,553
- That was such a positive twist.
- Right.

46
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,596
Really.

47
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,222
- A huge twist.
- He had a death glare.

48
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,766
- I've never seen him like that.
- Same.

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,938
What got me
was how Seung-il smiled after his match.

50
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,732
I loved that sportsmanship.

51
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,901
I had to admit it was cool.

52
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,945
- Was it that, or was he just cool?
- It might've just been him.

53
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,489
It could've been his looks
or his sportsmanship.

54
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,033
He was considerate of his opponents.

55
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,952
- They were considerate of each other.
- Yes.

56
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,787
They were, even during the game.

57
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,128
Have fun talking to her.

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,465
It's a great chance.

59
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,386
- It was a good game.
- Yes, it was.

60
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,304
You have my respect.

61
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,640
It couldn't have been easy.

62
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,809
Wasn't I an easy match?

63
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,897
Come on. No way. Don't say that.

64
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,942
You toyed around with me.

65
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,526
- Yes, he really did.
- I didn't.

66
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,862
When you pushed, he let out an "Ouch!"

67
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:03,368
That last move was a good one.
I liked how it turned into a fun finale.

68
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,997
- I've been wanting to see you, Ye-jin.
- Why?

69
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,667
- I think I've been stressed out.
- What happened?

70
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,460
I'm the type who walks on eggshells.

71
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,546
Really? I'm like that, too.
Did something happen yesterday?

72
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,092
- I feel cautious around women.
- Why? Because you like the same guy?

73
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,053
I want to get to know everyone,

74
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,931
but I'm afraid
I'll come across as a pick-me girl.

75
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,809
I want to at least talk to everyone,

76
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:33,606
but dynamics have already formed
between people at this point in time.

77
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,983
So it's kind of hard.

78
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,026
- I admire that, though.
- Really?

79
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,320
I guess I don't have enough courage.

80
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,031
I admire that about you.

81
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,950
Today…

82
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,577
Who should it be today?

83
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,415
- Should I get to know Seung-il?
- No way!

84
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,916
Okay, I'll get going.

85
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,548
I wonder where Seung-il is?

86
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,384
I wonder where Seung-il is.

87
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,636
She heard her.

88
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,433
Why is she looking for my Seung-il?

89
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,854
Seung-il and Mina talked, right?

90
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,190
- They did earlier.
- They talked.

91
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,319
What's going on?
Did she not like how it went?

92
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,611
Maybe.

93
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,655
- Hello.
- Hello.

94
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,576
Can we talk?

95
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,001
I'm getting kind of mad.

96
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,754
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

97
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,717
Oh gosh.

98
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,599
SHIN HYEON-WOO & KIM GO-EUN

99
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,364
- Take your time.
- Okay.

100
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,161
- Aren't you cold?
- No, I'm fine.

101
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,163
That looks so good.

102
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,628
- Doesn't it look amazing?
- Yes.

103
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,756
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

104
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,466
You won first place.

105
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,593
Let's eat.

106
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,429
Let me serve you.

107
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,893
- We only have two forks, right?
- Yes, and you don't get any.

108
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:34,811
What?

109
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,653
Is he deboning it for her?

110
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,279
What a sweet guy.

111
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,282
- Okay.
- Yes, sure.

112
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,159
- Eat up.
- Gosh. Thank you.

113
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,954
- Here.
- Thank you.

114
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,339
- What did you think?
- It was so scary.

115
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,425
- Me?
- You all were charging like bulls.

116
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,885
- Everyone.
- All of us?

117
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:12,348
- Mina kept saying you were sexy.
- Me?

118
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,601
He looks great.

119
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,271
His physique.

120
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,859
This is exhilarating.

121
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,904
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,201
- When did you say that, Mina Sue?
- She said that?

123
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,289
- She's so blunt.
- She's the type who expresses everything.

124
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,748
Me?

125
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,378
So I listened.

126
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,088
Did that bother you?

127
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,677
Yes, she was saying you looked great,

128
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,513
so I was agreeing internally.

129
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,143
I won't fall for her.

130
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,603
- What?
- What?

131
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,439
I won't fall for her.

132
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,487
- I went to Paradise yesterday.
- Yes.

133
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,238
How did you feel then?

134
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:14,494
- Why do you keep leaving?
- I really had no idea he'd pick me.

135
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:15,912
How was it?

136
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,793
I liked it better
when I could talk one-to-one.

137
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,338
A three-way conversation was too…

138
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,091
What if you could go with him alone?

139
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,969
That could change things, I guess.

140
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:36,098
Then give me that chance first.
You said you'd go with me first.

141
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,683
Okay.

142
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,478
- I'll--
- Okay, then.

143
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,400
Go with me, and then stop going there.

144
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,946
You should stop going.

145
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,409
I won't go if it isn't with you.

146
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,578
- You mean that?
- Yes.

147
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,706
- We should.
- I've met everyone now.

148
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,625
- Among the men…
- Yes?

149
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,502
…I'm the only left-handed guy.

150
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,965
He checked everyone until the last person.

151
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,050
I'm the only left-handed guy.

152
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,010
You're right.

153
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:14,762
You're right.

154
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,931
- You were the only lefty.
- Yes.

155
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,394
It's a huge advantage.

156
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,903
- Such a big guy saying that is adorable.
- Right?

157
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:32,989
How cute.

158
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,159
- Do you feel cold?
- No, I'm fine.

159
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:45,418
How did your talk with Sung-min go
when you went to Paradise?

160
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,254
I had fun with Sung-min, too.

161
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:55,177
He has a witty personality,
so I quickly felt at ease.

162
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:00,516
So I thought
I'd have to get closer to you…

163
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,313
- Okay.
- …to make up my mind.

164
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,651
I also want to get closer to you faster.

165
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,736
- Right?
- Yes.

166
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,781
I want to know what you're like.

167
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,409
And what you like.

168
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,371
I also feel like
I haven't shown you my whole self yet.

169
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,623
- You haven't?
- No.

170
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,502
How will I get to see that side?

171
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,215
I'm sure it'll show once we become
more at ease with one another.

172
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,594
How can we feel more…

173
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,514
How can we feel more at ease?

174
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,642
- We should talk more.
- Okay.

175
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,352
But that's something we can do

176
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,146
once we know each other's jobs and ages

177
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,690
and after we've had a deeper conversation.

178
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,028
The conversations we have there
are important.

179
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,079
After hearing all that,

180
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,248
Hyeon-woo must be dead set
on going to Paradise with Go-eun,

181
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,335
- even more than ever.
- Yes.

182
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:13,756
Go-eun had a great time
with I-geon in Paradise, didn't she?

183
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,841
The way she looked at him was different.

184
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,301
- It was different.
- Was it?

185
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,677
She seemed different.

186
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,430
We haven't seen her eyes
like that in Paradise before.

187
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,681
But here's my take.

188
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,768
There's a certain atmosphere
that's only created in Paradise.

189
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,437
So I think she'll have
to go to Paradise with Hyeon-woo.

190
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,024
- Something new could happen.
- I hope they get to go sometime.

191
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,651
- Just once.
- Yes.

192
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,861
SONG SEUNG-IL & KIM MIN-GEE

193
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,113
Dig in, Min-gee.

194
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,322
- Okay.
- Enjoy.

195
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,617
- You were good.
- Of course.

196
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,035
I mean…

197
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:49,208
Don't go showing
your charming sides to other people.

198
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,209
Why not?

199
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,961
Just because.

200
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:56,215
Everything you did there
could be charming to someone.

201
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,717
- Who'd be interested?
- What?

202
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,555
- I'll be honest.
- Okay.

203
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,474
I cursed you, hoping you'd lose.

204
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,684
- Why?
- What?

205
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,978
- Why?
- You know, I had my reasons.

206
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,564
I have many reasons.

207
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,901
You didn't want me to choose?

208
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,695
No.

209
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,573
- In case I'd choose Mina?
- Yes.

210
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:25,411
I didn't even get my hopes up.
I had sort of given up.

211
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,456
I was a bit torn, you know.

212
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,295
But I concluded that I should pick
someone I am most interested in now.

213
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,755
- That's you, Min-gee.
- Yes.

214
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,716
And you wanted fried chicken.

215
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,968
LAST NIGHT

216
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,386
What are you craving?

217
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,597
Fried chicken.
Can you raise some chickens?

218
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,223
Please raise them.

219
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,562
I thought,
"Min-gee wanted chicken, didn't she?"

220
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,941
- So I said, "Kim Min-gee."
- Hey.

221
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,027
"I pick Min-gee" is what I said.

222
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,196
That's how it went.

223
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,701
Unbelievable.

224
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,207
- How sweet is that? He remembered.
- He's younger, too.

225
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,875
Min-gee is so happy right now.

226
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,754
Then, if the prize…

227
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,924
was Paradise,

228
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,592
would you have chosen Mina?

229
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,052
Well…

230
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,304
- We want to know too.
- Yes.

231
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,931
- Tell us.
- I'm dying to know.

232
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:27,848
What's his answer?

233
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,684
I think he'll be honest.

234
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,438
…was Paradise, would you have chosen Mina?

235
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,080
Yes.

236
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,625
The curiosity hasn't disappeared.

237
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,216
- He's right. He should go once.
- True.

238
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,510
- But Min-gee must feel awful.
- Of course.

239
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,512
It's better to go than stay curious.

240
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,013
- Better than wondering.
- Yes.

241
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,432
- She should tell him to go.
- Yes, just go.

242
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,519
Yes.

243
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,064
The curiosity hasn't disappeared.

244
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,029
- Okay, I got it.
- Yes.

245
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,532
- Okay, that's it.
- Yes.

246
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,367
- He can't help it.
- True.

247
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,872
If his feelings change to Mina Sue
afterwards, she'll know he's not worth it.

248
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,541
- And let him go.
- Of course.

249
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,085
Or he might realize,
"Min-gee is the one for me."

250
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,421
- Then he can return to her.
- Of course.

251
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,549
I think Mina Sue
will do her best to win him over.

252
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,967
Right?

253
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,136
She's good at one-to-one dates.

254
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,514
I think he'll return mesmerized by her.

255
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:56,228
Jin-kyung, I think he'll return
knowing what his heart wants.

256
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,439
- That'd be great.
- And stick with Min-gee?

257
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,357
That's what I think will happen.

258
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,737
- We're not talking about your wishes.
- Well, I'm just saying.

259
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,447
Mina Sue is fatally charming.

260
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,407
- Of course.
- That's why.

261
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,243
She's naturally very captivating.

262
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,956
- Let's eat.
- I'm hungry.

263
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,500
- It's <i>doenjang</i> stew!
- All right.

264
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,627
That looks so good.

265
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,339
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Enjoy your dinner.

266
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,345
I burned my mouth.
It's sizzling. Be careful.

267
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,557
Gosh, it's so good.

268
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,684
Wasn't it cold during the game?

269
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,520
During the game? It was cold after.

270
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,231
- After the game?
- I was fine during the game.

271
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,399
- You were wet.
- Yes.

272
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,651
Why? Did I look cold?

273
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,862
No, but you got hurt.

274
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,365
- I wasn't hurt.
- Weren't you bleeding?

275
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,201
- I realized that much later.
- Exactly.

276
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,495
I have a low pain tolerance.

277
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,502
Sorry I didn't get you the chicken.

278
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,795
This is so good.

279
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,091
It's so good.

280
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,176
How are you feeling today?

281
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,972
I'm doing okay today. Thanks for asking.

282
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,644
- What about you? Are you hurting anywhere?
- I think I'm fine.

283
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,156
Does this taste better because we're here?

284
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,033
Or is this actually good?

285
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,619
We have that view as we're eating.

286
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,622
- Even plain rice would be good.
- It's so nice.

287
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,290
- Yes.
- Right.

288
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,334
I find Inferno much prettier.

289
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,213
You're prettier.

290
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,840
You're prettier.

291
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,177
That came out of nowhere.

292
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,221
- That's hilarious.
- Any thoughts, Da-hee?

293
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,180
It was so unexpected.

294
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,349
What do you think? You like it, right?

295
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,478
- You're smiling ear to ear.
- It was completely out of the blue.

296
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,231
Wasn't that such a cheesy pickup line?

297
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,899
But still, it's nice.

298
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,444
All pickup lines are equal.

299
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,447
If you're going to say it,
make it classic.

300
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,948
- It was a classic.
- She loves it.

301
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,033
That's too outdated.

302
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,951
- But Hyun-jae is serious.
- Yes.

303
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,411
He does mean it.

304
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,206
I find Inferno much prettier.

305
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,125
You're prettier.

306
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,797
Please let me eat in peace.

307
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,632
Can we ban flirting while we eat?

308
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,301
Did I just hear that right?

309
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,221
How was Paradise?

310
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,807
- Paradise?
- Yes.

311
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,976
I had a lot of fun.

312
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,897
I'm not sure if I'm the only one
who thinks that, but I had fun.

313
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,315
What was fun about it?

314
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,071
I think I really clicked
with the people I went with,

315
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,405
even when we were all together.

316
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,783
The three of you got to hang out?

317
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,659
- Yes.
- Really?

318
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,205
I had dinner with Go-eun,

319
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,708
champagne with Ye-jin,

320
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,212
and the three of us chatted
and then went to bed.

321
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,261
- Aren't you tired, Jae-jin?
- I'm not.

322
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,014
- Paradise was huge.
- I see.

323
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,350
But he walked out like the landlord,

324
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,894
showed me around the room,
and it was so annoying.

325
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,562
It was so stupidly funny.

326
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,064
I'm sure he fit the part.

327
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,650
- What part?
- When he showed you around.

328
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,360
He even dressed like a guru.

329
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:35,489
He'd chime in from time to time and go,
"Let me tell you about this place."

330
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,282
The thing is, he was convincing.

331
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,159
- You know?
- I see. Sure.

332
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,036
- A guru?
- Yes.

333
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,748
- It feels like you're badmouthing me.
- It's a good thing.

334
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,041
- It is.
- Right?

335
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:46,959
Yes.

336
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,086
Then, I'll be happy.

337
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,507
Goodness.

338
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,300
Joo-young looks quite irritated.

339
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,469
- Her expression…
- It shows right away.

340
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,763
When Mina Sue mentioned
her health condition,

341
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,600
- Su-been seemed to glance a little.
- I think she's still on his mind.

342
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,394
- Right?
- Yes, still.

343
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,895
And to me,

344
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:12,109
the way Su-been looks
seems like he's really mad at Mina Sue.

345
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,946
And the fact that he's angry
also says something.

346
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,323
- It means he still has feelings…
- Oh, dear.

347
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,033
…even if he's angry.

348
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,953
- I don't think it's over.
- Me either.

349
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,331
But Su-been has Hee-sun, a safe bet.

350
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,667
That's why he's not having fun there.

351
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,170
- That--
- Jin-kyung.

352
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,921
- That could be…
- She's set on him.

353
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,590
Do you only like the fun ones?

354
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,383
- Here's the thing.
- It's the dopamine rush.

355
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,010
- Careful.
- He has her in a bag.

356
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,803
But I totally understand.

357
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,431
- I get it.
- Hee-sun only has eyes for him.

358
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,016
- From his perspective…
- Right?

359
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,559
- she's too obvious.
- Yes.

360
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,020
I get what you mean
about how she isn't fun.

361
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,692
- Are you going to rest now?
- Do you want to talk?

362
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,527
I was going to ask you.

363
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,779
I seriously…

364
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,038
So, what's on your mind?
What's bothering you?

365
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,832
What's bothering me?
Nothing at the moment.

366
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,044
I just want to get to know everyone.

367
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,088
What about you?

368
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,009
At first, during the vote for Paradise,
I voted for you.

369
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,844
But…

370
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,679
And yesterday,

371
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,849
- I was concerned about you.
- Okay.

372
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,399
- But I felt great today.
- Why?

373
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,828
When I woke up today,
I kept thinking about you.

374
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,121
I see.

375
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,249
I think I'm certain now.

376
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,753
- I don't know. I really didn't know.
- Really?

377
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,339
We're talking like this now,

378
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,675
but I'm still not sure.

379
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,386
We already said, "We're just friends."

380
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,179
Then we keep going back and forth.

381
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,266
That could be why
our feelings are all over the place.

382
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,767
That's true.

383
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:19,486
But it's not an attraction
or in a romantic way.

384
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,741
But nothing is set in stone.

385
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,376
But that's not entirely false.

386
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,169
- What?
- We're not void of romance.

387
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,715
- Well, I think--
- We're not 100% just friends.

388
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,758
Right.

389
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,970
I think it's more than romance.

390
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,480
I am curious.

391
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,067
Yes, and I think
we would have a great time.

392
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,575
- Exactly. We'd be more relaxed there.
- Yes.

393
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,119
I'm glad I got it out.

394
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:15,625
But honestly, my feelings always
seem to wander here and there.

395
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,919
- This place does that to you.
- True.

396
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:25,385
How would you feel about a guy
who only has his eyes on you, Da-hee?

397
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,179
- It'd be great.
- But here's the thing.

398
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,973
- You're interested in someone else.
- Then no.

399
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,477
Really? But when you look back,
he's always there for you.

400
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,854
- That would be scary.
- Really?

401
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:40,108
But there are couples
who end up together that way.

402
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,444
- Because one side did not give up.
- Exactly.

403
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,361
- Yes.
- Yes.

404
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,238
I think that would be impossible for me.

405
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,825
- You wouldn't be able to?
- I mean, we were friends all along.

406
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,911
Many people become lovers from friends.

407
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,871
Here's what I felt after seeing that.

408
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,874
I had a feeling that
Mina Sue kept drawing the line

409
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,419
and beating around the bush
to tell him they're just friends.

410
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,297
Sung-hun was already
interested in her as a woman,

411
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,550
but Mina Sue led the conversation
as if they were friends.

412
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,012
So he just went along and said,
"I also feel like we're friends."

413
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,555
But he later realized it was a lie.

414
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,226
That's why he confessed his true feelings,
thinking he should be honest.

415
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,852
But will it go well?

416
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,063
They'll have to go to Paradise
to find out.

417
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,607
They'll know for sure after that.

418
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,650
There's no need.

419
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,610
It's not necessary.

420
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,446
- Mina Sue already seems certain about him.
- That's true.

421
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,865
- She's interested in too many men now.
- Right.

422
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,702
This lady here won first place
during the photoshoot mission.

423
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,496
Really?

424
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,834
- No one's here.
- Wait, what is this?

425
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,377
- What?
- Are you serious?

426
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,503
Aren't these wild?

427
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,214
- This is…
- Aren't these amazing?

428
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,968
- Aren't these insane?
- What is that?

429
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,470
This was our couple mission.

430
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,348
- Why didn't I get here sooner?
- Aren't these amazing?

431
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,060
- But seriously. Look at these!
- Aren't they incredible?

432
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,896
- And this won first place?
- Yes.

433
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,484
I think this is the best one.

434
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,654
How dare you?

435
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,200
- What about this one?
- This is far from sexy.

436
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,995
We didn't express hotness as sexiness.

437
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,999
- It's not hot at all.
- Why not? We thought this was…

438
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,500
There's a hint of innocence.

439
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,586
- We look like newlyweds.
- Without the cameras…

440
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,630
<i>The two I was concerned about</i>

441
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,549
were I-geon and Ye-jin.

442
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,760
The three of us went to Paradise.

443
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,889
- Ye-jin, can we talk?
- Okay.

444
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,812
But I saw I-geon asking Ye-jin

445
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:45,817
to spend one-on-one time with him, not me.

446
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:51,656
I began to wonder if he liked her better,
so I was more concerned about them.

447
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,035
- Go-eun.
- Yes?

448
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,412
- Are you going in?
- I was about to.

449
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,583
I'll be back.

450
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,672
- You went to eat some fried chicken.
- I did.

451
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,258
You became Ms. Popular
in the blink of an eye.

452
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,053
Ms. Popular? Stop it.

453
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,890
Yesterday, I was talking to I-geon.

454
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,226
- He kept calling me a dummy.
- Okay.

455
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,313
- In what way?
- No idea. He just kept calling me a dummy.

456
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,691
He told me to ask others
if they also think I'm a dummy.

457
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,109
No.

458
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,861
- No?
- No.

459
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,073
He also said they're lying if they say no.

460
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,577
- What about you did he think was silly?
- Well, you know.

461
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,956
We were talking about
how people either play games or don't.

462
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,792
I think he meant that I was simple-minded.

463
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,961
Really? I didn't get that from you.

464
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,046
- Really?
- I guess it's different for everyone.

465
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,756
- Yes.
- He could've felt that way.

466
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,845
It would've been nice if he kept it fun.

467
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,764
Yes, he's way too laid back.

468
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,976
I think Go-eun is into funny guys
who like to joke around.

469
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,978
He should've said, "You do seem silly."

470
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,813
- She would've liked that more.
- Right.

471
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,565
But he was dead serious,
"No, you're not a dummy."

472
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,944
- "I didn't get that."
- Exactly. That's a bit of a shame.

473
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,530
It seems like…

474
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,201
- some people have made up their minds.
- Yes.

475
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:22,080
- Some people seem unsure.
- I thought I was a bit…

476
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,000
Never mind. I won't say too much.

477
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,334
What?

478
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,422
No, I don't want to.

479
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,340
- Why not?
- What?

480
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,847
- Well, I'm rather certain now.
- Okay.

481
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,146
I want you to feel more anxious.

482
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,691
- What?
- What does she mean by that?

483
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,029
I want you to feel more anxious.

484
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,158
- I think you really are a dummy.
- Yes.

485
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,910
- You're really silly.
- I'm bad at playing hard to get.

486
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,621
- He was right on.
- How are you supposed to do it?

487
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:09,919
But seriously, I think
going to Paradise is really crucial.

488
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,421
Yes.

489
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,673
We can't talk freely here.

490
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,217
- No.
- We can't have deep conversations.

491
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,056
I think we'll feel a lot more
if we go there a second time.

492
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:21,973
Yes.

493
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,769
No couple has gone there twice yet, right?

494
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,729
We'll go.

495
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,398
Just wait.

496
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,527
- Just you wait.
- Are you going to find a way?

497
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,864
- We'll get a chance.
- We will.

498
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,157
As long as we match.

499
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,575
Yes.

500
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,619
Yes.

501
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,997
Who does she feel certain about?

502
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,916
- Sung-min? But…
- You're right.

503
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,753
- She means the person next to her.
- Is she saying she has decided on him?

504
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,588
- I think so.
- I guess.

505
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,215
- I don't believe her.
- Me neither.

506
00:27:55,298 --> 00:28:00,804
From what we saw, Go-eun seemed to have
a lot of fun with I-geon in Paradise.

507
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,723
Her vibe changed completely
when she was with him.

508
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,434
They even made our hearts flutter
as we watched.

509
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,853
- They had chemistry.
- Even in her interview.

510
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,523
She said she was concerned
about I-geon and Ye-jin.

511
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,524
Yes, you're right.

512
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,943
Does this mean
Sung-min is her second choice?

513
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:19,739
But she's known him longer,
so he's probably closer to first place.

514
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,908
I-geon came into the picture now.

515
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:25,578
What she said wasn't a lie,
but she just gave a vague answer.

516
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,289
It can go either way.

517
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,876
It seemed like an ambiguous answer.

518
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,587
Where do you want to go?

519
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,381
Let's talk.

520
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,809
It's been a while.

521
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,230
- Joo-young was upset earlier.
- Yes, her feelings were hurt.

522
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:56,109
- I think she'll bring up Paradise.
- She'll go, "So I heard you had fun."

523
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,572
It's been a while.

524
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,577
- I was away for just one day.
- Well, it's been a while.

525
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,538
Anything to report?

526
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,876
What about you? You're the one who left.

527
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,877
- Me?
- Yes.

528
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,587
- There's one thing.
- What is it?

529
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,548
- Did you have fun?
- What?

530
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,926
- Did you have fun?
- There's one thing for me to tell you.

531
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,845
- Did you have fun?
- No.

532
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,263
I'm asking if you had fun.

533
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,434
She must've been really concerned.

534
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:34,731
I went to the same place
I went on the first day.

535
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,399
Yes, so did you have fun?

536
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,569
- Well, it was fun.
- I see.

537
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:40,904
The place from day one.

538
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,697
- And I was waiting.
- Okay.

539
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:48,328
There were many lovely flowers,
unlike the first time I visited.

540
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,749
- How nice was it? I'd like to go too.
- Right?

541
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,250
So, anyway, that's…

542
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,377
It was… Yes.

543
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,714
- Here's a man making excuses.
- Yes.

544
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,884
He's falling into his own trap.
It's only getting worse.

545
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,385
So, anyway, that's…

546
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,930
It was… Yes.

547
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:13,603
- So, what did you want to report to me?
- So I took a picture.

548
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,232
This is what they did.

549
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,150
- Really?
- Do you see this table?

550
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,069
- My gosh.
- But look.

551
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:26,741
This flower wilted very quickly,
so the petals kept falling off.

552
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,244
- No way.
- Gosh.

553
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,578
It was a present?

554
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,790
He's so caring.

555
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,125
- They set it on this table.
- Really? No way.

556
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,710
It was set without a vase.

557
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,380
Jae-jin thought of me

558
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:45,760
and brought back a photo to show me.

559
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:53,101
The main thing I work with is vases,
and he saw a flower set without one.

560
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,854
And he thought of me.

561
00:30:55,937 --> 00:31:00,567
YESTERDAY AT PARADISE

562
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,369
I was genuinely surprised
and deeply moved.

563
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,497
He also said that was the only thing
he had to tell me.

564
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,666
It really made me happy.

565
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,545
- He's good.
- He's really good.

566
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,630
- He set the mood first.
- Right?

567
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,717
He made her feel jealous
and said, "I did this for you."

568
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,428
Was it smoother
compared to "You're prettier"?

569
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,763
- Yes, way smoother.
- He's really good.

570
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,806
He's on another level.

571
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,350
Because that picture isn't just a picture.

572
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,603
- It's saying, "I was thinking of you."
- Yes, right.

573
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,438
- He didn't even have to say it.
- No.

574
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,981
- His photo said it all.
- Yes.

575
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,733
You should all learn from him.

576
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:45,320
- Jot it down.
- Hyun-jae needs to learn from him.

577
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,324
- I've never seen this.
- Right?

578
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,825
- No vase.
- No.

579
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,119
Yes, this is amazing.

580
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,704
This is your report?

581
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,000
That's all. I wanted to show you this.

582
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,046
If that's all you wanted to report,
you may leave now.

583
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,051
- You can go now.
- Well, not everything goes my way.

584
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,266
You can run along
and join that conversation.

585
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,937
I really love the flowers.

586
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,866
- There's Hyun-jae waiting for Joo-young.
- Hyun-jae.

587
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,329
It must break Hyun-jae's heart
to hear them giggle.

588
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,539
Wouldn't he feel quite jealous?

589
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,834
- "You're the prettiest."
- Joo-young acts differently with Jae-jin

590
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,379
- compared to Hyun-jae.
- Totally different.

591
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,548
- But you never know until the very end.
- Yes, that's true.

592
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,300
It can change at the last minute.

593
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,764
How's it going with Su-been?

594
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,144
I like him, but I'm not sure
how he feels about me.

595
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,521
- Really?
- No.

596
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,899
- But you two are always together.
- We are, but…

597
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,444
- I heard he gave you his jacket and all.
- It's this one.

598
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,740
- I see.
- But it's because I don't have a jacket.

599
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:18,204
I think she'd be the first to know
if the person she likes

600
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,915
isn't actually interested in her.

601
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,835
She would, yet that jacket
feels like her only lifeline.

602
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,712
- Yes, right.
- I agree.

603
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:29,465
- It's the only thing she can hold on to.
- Really.

604
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,385
She feels like he'll cut all ties with her
if she gives it back.

605
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,178
Hey, what a witty comment!

606
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,264
- What was that?
- You made it so clear.

607
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:43,104
- Hello.
- Hi, Mina.

608
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,316
- It's warm in here.
- May I?

609
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,360
Yes, of course. I left it on.

610
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,031
Are the men in their room?

611
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,866
- Sung-min.
- Sung-min?

612
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,492
Yes, I just heard his voice.

613
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,787
Over there? Where?

614
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,205
No idea.

615
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,208
- It's cold. Let's go to the photo room.
- Okay.

616
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,004
Go now!

617
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,300
- I want to speak casually.
- See you soon, Hee-sun.

618
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,135
- Bye now.
- Bye, Hee-sun.

619
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,513
Hello.

620
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,974
Who will you talk to?

621
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,602
Who is she going to talk to?

622
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,812
Who are you planning to talk to?

623
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:29,192
I think Su-been and I should
come to a clear conclusion or--

624
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,069
I think she went to see him.

625
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,238
- Yes, so I--
- I think she went to see him.

626
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,365
Should I take a peek?

627
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,706
Is that him?

628
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,628
I want to see, too.

629
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,629
What?

630
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,131
It's not Su-been.

631
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,342
- It wasn't Su-been. Go for him.
- Go now.

632
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,135
I'm a bit flustered at the moment.

633
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,012
- Really?
- What?

634
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,013
It's not him?

635
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,140
She shouldn't leave them alone.

636
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,392
- Should we talk?
- Sure.

637
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,811
Have a seat.

638
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,480
That's a chance.

639
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,737
- Did you have fun in Paradise?
- Yes, I had lots of fun.

640
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,783
- May I talk to Su-been?
- Let's go.

641
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,201
- Wow, here we go again.
- No way.

642
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,994
Mina Sue doesn't miss her chance.

643
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,539
- This'll be huge.
- What will happen now?

644
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,166
- Where should we talk?
- Are you cold?

645
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,919
- I am.
- Is there anywhere warm?

646
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,130
- Our room? Who's in the men's room?
- The women's room?

647
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,798
- No one.
- Okay.

648
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,634
Hey, so this is what it looks like.

649
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,928
- Is this your first time here?
- It is.

650
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,850
- It feels new seeing you here.
- Yes, it feels like it's been a while.

651
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,686
Yes, have you been well?

652
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,605
Why do you look under the weather today?

653
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,818
- I haven't been well since yesterday.
- Really? Were you cold?

654
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,653
I fainted. Did you know that?

655
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,071
- Yesterday?
- No, right?

656
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,575
I didn't feel good after dinner.

657
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,827
- Yeah.
- So I fainted.

658
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,370
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

659
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:10,084
- So I took an IV shot this morning.
- I see. You didn't seem well this morning.

660
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,629
- Really? Do you mean I looked ugly?
- No, it's not that.

661
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,631
You didn't have your usual energy.

662
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,091
- Not really.
- Right.

663
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,093
So I was a bit concerned.

664
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,053
- I see.
- Yes.

665
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,981
- Gosh, this is dangerous.
- It's a tense atmosphere.

666
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,316
What's with this vibe?

667
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,484
- Something's going on.
- It's not over yet.

668
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,362
How are you feeling?

669
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,407
- Right now?
- Yes, honestly.

670
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,205
What do you mean?
Are you asking who I'm attracted to?

671
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,207
- Yes.
- Well…

672
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:54,253
Honestly speaking, at this point,

673
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,633
I want to get to know Hee-sun some more.

674
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,967
Honestly.

675
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:06,057
I get that you want to get to know her.
But please don't ignore me too much.

676
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,603
- I don't ignore you.
- The thing is, I felt like…

677
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:16,192
It felt as if you were treating me
like a total stranger.

678
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,114
I've also been meaning to say this.

679
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,701
During the campfire session,
when we had a drink,

680
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,913
I thought that we were into each other.

681
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,249
- Yes.
- But…

682
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:37,046
I began to question that a little.

683
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,384
I wasn't even one of the people
you wanted to get to know.

684
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,346
Your feelings changed on the spot.

685
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,265
So…

686
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,186
I began to think, "Was she not serious?"

687
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,732
Even after we talked,
it didn't feel sincere to me.

688
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,859
- It didn't?
- No.

689
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,819
I see.

690
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:06,242
I began to get a little confused
after the campfire.

691
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,868
I had a lot on my mind.

692
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,871
That's why I couldn't
approach you easily to talk.

693
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:15,918
So, when you came up to me to talk,
I was grateful.

694
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,503
I see.

695
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,049
I also had a great time
with you in Paradise,

696
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,552
and I want to have fun with you again.

697
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,847
I thought I made myself clear
when I said things like,

698
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,682
"We should dive in the pool again!"

699
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,142
- Right.
- Yes, so…

700
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:35,229
I was honestly irritated
because you wouldn't talk to me.

701
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,358
You weren't willing to talk.

702
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,069
But I still came to talk to you.

703
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,948
Well, I keep going back to the campfire…

704
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:51,287
- I was a bit too--
- Yes, I thought you weren't being honest.

705
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,582
I was really irritated back then.

706
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,875
- I'm sorry.
- I see.

707
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,418
That's why.

708
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,464
I think I acted more coldly
because of that. I'm sorry.

709
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,635
Shall we move on?

710
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,849
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

711
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:17,521
But my feelings for you
haven't disappeared completely.

712
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,109
I just didn't show it.

713
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,946
I tried to make it look natural
and look for a chance to sit next to you.

714
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,115
When? You never sat next to me.

715
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,617
- You didn't see it.
- What?

716
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,619
- You didn't notice.
- Notice what?

717
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,163
You just didn't notice me
doing that, Mina.

718
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:37,375
"Mina"? Listen to yourself.

719
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,379
I'm not going to call you "<i>noona.</i>"

720
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:47,968
See?

721
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,930
- How did he change so suddenly?
- He's serious?

722
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,014
How's that possible?

723
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,725
Why not? I'd like that.

724
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,520
You said you'd do it
when it's just the two of us.

725
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,733
Only when we're in Paradise together.

726
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,405
- Anyway.
- Anyway.

727
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:11,200
I kept looking at you.

728
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,620
I never felt it, not once.

729
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,831
I just…

730
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,002
- Yes, I just…
- I'll try to work up the courage.

731
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,047
But you seemed unapproachable.

732
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,133
Who?

733
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,804
- I felt that way to you, Mina.
- Yes.

734
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,806
To you, <i>noona.</i>

735
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,352
This is Paradise!

736
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,731
- It's over.
- He's got his game on.

737
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,528
- He's got his game on.
- Excuse me, I surrender.

738
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,405
"To you, <i>noona."</i>

739
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,449
To you, <i>noona.</i>

740
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,119
It just felt a bit like that.

741
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,207
And there's a rumor
that you said I was cute.

742
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,126
- Should I stop telling people?
- What?

743
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,547
- Should I stop saying that?
- No, it's not that.

744
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,508
I thought you were much cuter.

745
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,886
- Is that so?
- Yes.

746
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:17,516
- No, you smile like a baby.
- Well, that's just how I look.

747
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,562
- But the way you are and your character…
- You're cute when you act awkward.

748
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,606
I don't know about that.

749
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,359
Did you see my dress today?

750
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,863
- The one in the afternoon?
- Yes, what did you think?

751
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,325
Was it so-so? Be honest.

752
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,494
I didn't get a good look.

753
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,166
You're…

754
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,127
Let's just call it off.

755
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,671
But you look good in everything.

756
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:52,927
I looked really pretty
in my brown dress today.

757
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,512
But you were never not pretty.

758
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,810
All right.
I'll try to express my feelings more.

759
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,812
- I'll take a closer look.
- Okay.

760
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,233
All right. I'll be nicer to you, too.

761
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,652
But I wasn't mean, was I?

762
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,613
It kind of shows
that you're doing it on purpose,

763
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,282
like when you walk past me coldly.

764
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,785
- Really?
- Yes.

765
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:22,414
So I thought that side of you was cute.

766
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:28,379
So, I thought that side of you was cute.

767
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:36,178
I don't mind
that we're getting to know others.

768
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,723
But even after you get to know everyone,

769
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,477
I hope you still choose me.

770
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:46,897
Yes.

771
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,401
So, how's your condition now?

772
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,111
- It still hurts.
- Still?

773
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,738
- Yes, I'm very unwell.
- I see. You don't look well.

774
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,199
Yes, you'll need to take care of me.

775
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,463
- See that?
- I was in denial all this time.

776
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,257
I said Su-been would never go back to her.

777
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,384
- It wasn't over.
- But you said otherwise.

778
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,594
- You said it wasn't.
- No.

779
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,762
The way he acted cold seemed feigned.

780
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,681
- Yes.
- Really? I had no idea.

781
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,351
- The way he acted cold seemed robotic.
- It was robotic. You're right.

782
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,813
- That must've been his way of sulking.
- He was just sullen.

783
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,983
His head kept saying he shouldn't,
but his heart wouldn't stop.

784
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,235
This is him being real.

785
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:38,866
That one heartfelt conversation
immediately cleared the misunderstandings.

786
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,660
- Where did Mr. Cold Shoulder go?
- If he likes her,

787
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:46,790
I guess he can't stop liking her
even after what she did at the campfire.

788
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,500
She said, "I'm sorry."

789
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,753
She apologized and said,
"Shall we move on?"

790
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,713
- Is that enough for men?
- She said sorry.

791
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,050
She said sorry and wanted to move on.
And he agreed, so it's over.

792
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,092
He agreed.

793
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,470
Mina Sue can be so cute.

794
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,096
- Hee-sun isn't in the picture.
- What?

795
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,264
She's not on his mind.

796
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,434
- This was purely Mina Sue's work.
- It was.

797
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,562
She melted his heart by being herself.
You can't argue with that.

798
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,522
This was just purely who she was.

799
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,899
- Her skills.
- She melted it.

800
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,609
Even I got bewitched watching her.

801
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,194
- Even my heart fluttered.
- Yes.

802
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,613
- That's love.
- You're right.

803
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:21,450
Everything was settled
in that brief moment they shared.

804
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,495
- It was a lover's quarrel.
- Yes, it was.

805
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,413
I'm all for this couple.

806
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,707
- You're convinced.
- I changed my mind.

807
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,169
That was the most thrilling moment
in all of Season 5 so far.

808
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,088
- Paradise or not.
- Right?

809
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,014
Goodbye.

810
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,349
- See you later.
- Okay.

811
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:54,024
- Did you have a good talk?
- He just went to the restroom.

812
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,067
All of a sudden?

813
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,319
- No idea. He suddenly went.
- Suddenly?

814
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:05,202
Why are there so many men in our home?

815
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,163
We were talking.

816
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,919
- Did you have a good talk?
- Yes, we did.

817
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,755
I'm confused all over again.

818
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,259
Did you have a good talk?

819
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,095
Yes, I guess we did.

820
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,350
You rarely say anything.

821
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,018
- What?
- You rarely say anything.

822
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,189
About my interaction with Mina Sue?

823
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,235
You don't talk much in general.

824
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,696
It's really hard to read you.

825
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,614
- Really?
- Yes.

826
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,327
<i>I still think</i>

827
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,038
he has some feelings for Mina Sue.

828
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:53,834
He continuously seems
to care about Mina Sue.

829
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:58,255
Whenever I looked at him,
I saw his eyes on her.

830
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,966
So I'm pretty sure he still likes her.

831
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:04,928
I've never felt this way
before in my life.

832
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:07,973
She already knows.

833
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,516
- She has a good hunch.
- She'd know.

834
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,936
Hee-sun isn't someone
who would sit and keep an eye on a man.

835
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,105
- Look at her.
- Or walk on eggshells.

836
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,694
Everything is changing in real-time.

837
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:21,862
- It is?
- Yes.

838
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,865
- Can you tell me?
- I'll tell you.

839
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:25,824
- It's fun.
- It is.

840
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,494
- Can we talk one-on-one?
- Let's go.

841
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,288
- What is it?
- Su-been is way too cute.

842
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,960
Really? What will you do?

843
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,587
He's seriously too cute.

844
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,633
- But you said the talk went well.
- It did.

845
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,760
- So, what's up?
- I was going to end it today.

846
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,513
- But it came back? It rekindled?
- Yes.

847
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,680
Oh no.

848
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,226
Why are women…

849
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,063
Why are women so capricious?

850
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,774
Not all women are like that.

851
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,653
- Mina Sue.
- It's because she's that charming.

852
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,071
We aren't all like that.

853
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,407
It looks like Mina Sue
likes Su-been the most right now.

854
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,409
What will happen to those two?

855
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,204
Actually, I'm starting
to worry about Hee-sun.

856
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,497
Here's my take.

857
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,707
Su-been's feelings are back with Mina Sue.

858
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,751
So she'll feel relieved.

859
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,294
- She may hit on another…
- No way.

860
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,754
- I have a feeling.
- Wait.

861
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,340
- There's a huge possibility.
- There is, right?

862
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,425
She hasn't ended things with others.

863
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:29,805
- She has to get to know Seung-il, too.
- Sung-hun is also done waiting.

864
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:33,642
He doesn't want to be friend-zoned,
so he'll flirt more blatantly.

865
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,186
And that might change Mina Sue's mind.

866
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,398
Really? She wouldn't.
You really think she'd change again?

867
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,774
I'm going to keep quiet.

868
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,611
The important thing
is that they are back on.

869
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,697
- It'll go on.
- Yes, that's for sure.

870
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,952
Did you have a good talk?

871
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:58,250
I had a short one-on-one talk,
then we talked as a group.

872
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,004
Do you think Ye-jin is interested in you?

873
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:08,385
I can't really tell.
I have no idea right now.

874
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:12,180
- I can't tell who she's into.
- Me either.

875
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,933
- There's no one.
- I'm not sure either.

876
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,185
That could be the case.
Her feelings are hers.

877
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,353
I say there's no one.

878
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,148
When I talk to Ye-jin…

879
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:27,738
I felt more attracted to you
after we grew a little closer.

880
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,781
You thought I was attractive? Really?

881
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,951
- You keep losing weight.
- I am?

882
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,661
What do I do? Are my cheeks sunken?

883
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,332
- I really…
- I like sunken cheeks.

884
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,084
People pay money to make them look full.

885
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,337
Really? I like them, though.

886
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:49,134
- It makes me look old.
- You aren't old enough to say that.

887
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,761
You've seen everyone else.

888
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:55,474
- You have, and I look much older.
- No way. You aren't that old.

889
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,520
I feel like everyone has made up
their minds on their picks.

890
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,148
I don't think anyone is certain.

891
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,360
- They all say they're unsure, though.
- Nothing's certain here.

892
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,278
I don't know.

893
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:11,615
This is hard.

894
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,661
<i>We weren't having a conversation.</i>
<i>We were in different worlds.</i>

895
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,247
I don't care if she doesn't like me a lot.

896
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:23,960
I might even find that more appealing.
It's something that gets men going.

897
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,505
Yes, you begin to feel competitive.

898
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,634
I'm not sure if she's into me or not.

899
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:35,263
But the way she acted
didn't seem appealing to me,

900
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,224
and it wasn't a lot of fun.

901
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:44,564
My feelings for Go-eun haven't changed,
but they have for Ye-jin.

902
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,693
But why won't I-geon talk to Go-eun?

903
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:51,363
What he's doing now
is playing hard to get.

904
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:56,118
- He's looking for the perfect timing.
- Like a lion waiting for its prey.

905
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,577
- He's not rash.
- He's a lion.

906
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,913
Deer are the most vulnerable
when they drink water,

907
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,541
so he's biding his time in the bushes.

908
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,668
And that's tomorrow.

909
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,504
- I bet he'll do it.
- After a good sleep.

910
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,005
He'll get his prey.

911
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,425
We'll get to see the tension
between Sung-min and I-geon.

912
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,844
I'm looking forward to it.

913
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,680
I don't know.
I-geon is way too good at his game.

914
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,850
But Sung-min doesn't look like
the type who'd give up easily.

915
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,692
This is nice. I was starving.

916
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,360
Let's eat.

917
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:44,416
Thank you.

918
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,962
- He always sits there.
- Yes, right next to her.

919
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,219
- Do they have water?
- Pass it along.

920
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,430
Give one to Go-eun.

921
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,109
- I can't.
- What?

922
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,779
What's so hard about giving her water?

923
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,281
- Why?
- He's just being awkward

924
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,326
- because he has a crush on her.
- Really?

925
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,913
- I can't.
- What?

926
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,624
Give it to her.

927
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,876
Try giving it to her.

928
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,004
- Should we get the bread?
- What?

929
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,839
- Bread.
- I'll get the bread.

930
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,218
Bread.

931
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,555
Thank you.

932
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:44,976
Thanks.

933
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,814
- Bread.
- I want bread too.

934
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,275
How embarrassing.

935
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,113
- Do you want some milk?
- Thanks. Just a little.

936
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,283
Thank you.

937
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,161
- What? Seung-il and Mina Sue?
- What?

938
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,372
- No way.
- All of a sudden?

939
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,166
Thank you.

940
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,841
The weather is nicer than yesterday.

941
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:19,094
- But it's still cold. It's so cold.
- At least the sun is out.

942
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,977
He's keeping it moderate
because Min-gee is his brakes.

943
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,146
He pulled his side brake,
but the car is already heading downhill.

944
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,232
- Slowly.
- Yes.

945
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,943
You're supposed to put
a brick under the tire.

946
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,487
- Or turn the wheel.
- Yes.

947
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:41,366
He didn't do that, so the car is
rolling down toward Mina Sue.

948
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,576
The car must be heavy.

949
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,915
- Do you feel all right?
- Yes.

950
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,418
I had my medicine.
I'll take one more after this.

951
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,296
You still don't look well.

952
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,214
I didn't put on much makeup.

953
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,344
- Do I look sick?
- It's called fragile beauty.

954
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,608
<i>In a moment, we will play a couples' game.</i>

955
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,525
Again?

956
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,153
A couples' game?

957
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,280
Geez, I had too much to eat.

958
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,867
<i>Everyone, please gather on the beach.</i>

959
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,913
- My arms won't go up.
- Mine too.

960
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,042
- I knew this would happen.
- They never let a day slide.

961
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,668
I shouldn't have worked out.

962
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,930
What are we playing?

963
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,101
What are these?

964
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,103
Is this about who lasts the longest?

965
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,232
- I want to play with someone who can win.
- Right?

966
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:06,660
<i>Today's couples' game</i>
<i>is the Wooden Board Game.</i>

967
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:13,792
<i>The wooden board</i>
<i>will get smaller every round.</i>

968
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,962
<i>The couple that lasts the longest wins.</i>

969
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:26,429
<i>If either of the two touches</i>
<i>the ground with any part of their body,</i>

970
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,847
<i>the couple is eliminated.</i>

971
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,725
- We have to stick together.
- Yes.

972
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,937
<i>You will play a total of three rounds.</i>

973
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,148
<i>You must last 60 seconds</i>
<i>in rounds 1 and 2,</i>

974
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,611
<i>but in round 3,</i>
<i>you will continue indefinitely.</i>

975
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:47,242
<i>The couple who reaches the third round</i>
<i>and lasts the longest</i>

976
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,410
<i>will be the winners.</i>

977
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,664
It'll require lots of touching.

978
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,290
A touchy-feely game?

979
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:55,709
No way.

980
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:01,423
<i>The winning couple will receive</i>
<i>a chance to have a special meal date.</i>

981
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,300
That's crazy.

982
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:08,013
<i>Today's special meal</i>
<i>is cold noodles and an iced rice drink.</i>

983
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,725
- Iced rice drinks!
- Gosh, I want some cold noodles.

984
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,854
<i>The couples will be decided</i>
<i>by drawing balls.</i>

985
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,942
<i>Please pick a ball</i>
<i>starting with Kim Min-gee.</i>

986
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,444
Gray again.

987
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:35,206
<i>Please pick a ball</i>
<i>starting with Song Seung-il.</i>

988
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,043
Blue.

989
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,128
<i>Choi Mina Sue and Song Seung-il.</i>

990
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,882
- What will happen?
- Really?

991
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,967
- A twist of fate.
- Really?

992
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,261
- I can't believe this.
- A twisted fate.

993
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,152
<i>Kim Go-eun and Kim Jae-jin.</i>

994
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:05,862
The winning couple.

995
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,989
- The photoshoot winners.
- Right.

996
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,326
<i>Lee Joo-young and Shin Hyeon-woo.</i>

997
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,748
<i>- Ham Ye-jin and Jo I-geon.</i>
- That's me.

998
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,795
<i>Lee Ha-eun and Youn Hyun-jae.</i>

999
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,135
<i>Kim Min-gee and Woo Sung-min.</i>

1000
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,221
He's a weak one. I think I'm cooked.

1001
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,017
<i>Park Hee-sun and Lim Su-been.</i>

1002
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,061
How?

1003
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,022
Su-been picked the green ball.

1004
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,315
I was happy about that.

1005
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,696
He doesn't look too happy.

1006
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,621
What? There are two blue balls.

1007
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,999
What? There are two blue balls.

1008
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,796
It's two and one again.
You'll play with two guys again.

1009
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,007
<i>Choi Mina Sue,</i>
<i>Song Seung-il, and Lee Sung-hun.</i>

1010
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,427
Two to one? Oh no.

1011
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,888
That's an odd combination.

1012
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,390
- How did that happen?
- Right?

1013
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,142
Mina Sue is lucky.

1014
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,228
- Is that a good thing, though?
- Isn't it good for her?

1015
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,146
It's not bad…

1016
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,858
<i>Choi Mina Sue,</i>
<i>Song Seung-il, and Lee Sung-hun.</i>

1017
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:25,817
MUST COMPETE AS 3

1018
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,734
What?

1019
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,240
How can this be?

1020
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,077
This makes no sense. Seriously?

1021
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,954
<i>I was really surprised.</i>

1022
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,040
Yes, so I felt like a lucky girl today.

1023
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,376
The universe…

1024
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,546
It feels like
everything is falling into place for me.

1025
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,797
They're all on my side.

1026
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,632
That was how I felt. It was great.

1027
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,135
- See? She's happy.
- You were right.

1028
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,970
She never disappoints.

1029
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:59,434
- Why do I always get this?
- Yes, you always get the special one.

1030
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,979
I don't think this place is for me.

1031
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:04,814
This island.

1032
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,192
During the first game,

1033
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,611
I picked the pink ball.

1034
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,697
DAY 2 COUPLE DODGEBALL

1035
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,619
The people I'd like
to do a photoshoot with

1036
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,831
are Lee Sung-hun and Woo Sung-min.

1037
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,921
And even now,
I have to play as a team of three.

1038
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,174
Am I that unlucky?

1039
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,843
Oh no.

1040
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,596
Mina Sue took all of Sung-hun's luck.

1041
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,228
<i>All seven couples have been decided.</i>

1042
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,398
<i>Now, please step on the wooden board.</i>

1043
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,567
Let's do this.

1044
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,863
How are we going to stand here?

1045
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,615
- Let's make a diamond.
- Like this?

1046
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,575
Yes, this is easy.

1047
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,118
- This is way too easy.
- Right?

1048
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,037
- Everyone can probably do this.
- Yes.

1049
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,289
Okay. This is the first one.

1050
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,209
It's only a problem for the middle team.

1051
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,461
- Go all the way.
- All the way.

1052
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,930
- Oh no.
- What are they going to do?

1053
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,934
- May I touch your pants?
- My gosh.

1054
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,519
You can, but just a second.

1055
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,774
We don't have to pay for <i>Cirque du Soleil.</i>
We can stand here and watch them.

1056
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,359
That must feel so comfortable.

1057
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:38,491
It was embarrassing and awkward,
but our team had a ripped guy.

1058
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,035
I was kind of enjoying it.

1059
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,622
When else will I get to touch
such muscles?

1060
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,042
Mina Sue must be over the moon.

1061
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,589
- I think her honesty is very appealing.
- It is.

1062
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,673
She's so blunt.

1063
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,760
- This is good for me.
- Okay, I'm good. Are you?

1064
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,389
I'm so happy. Gosh.

1065
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,932
I'm so happy. Gosh.

1066
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:04,350
<i>Good for him.</i>

1067
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,020
Good for him.

1068
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,980
He's with someone he's curious about.

1069
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,484
<i>The game will begin after the whistle.</i>

1070
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,402
<i>Ready.</i>

1071
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,326
Can we push our neighbors?

1072
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,536
- We have to win.
- Yes.

1073
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,920
Mina Sue, tell us
if you feel uncomfortable.

1074
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,798
No, if you feel uncomfortable,
let me know.

1075
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:37,967
I'm fine.

1076
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,261
- Which shoulder hurts?
- Both, but I'm fine.

1077
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,931
That means you're not fine.

1078
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,143
Mina, can you grab
the right side of my neck?

1079
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:48,895
- My right leg?
- The balance is a bit…

1080
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:49,979
- Hold me here.
- Here?

1081
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,314
Wrap your hand around.

1082
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:52,774
- Like this?
- Yes, that's it.

1083
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:53,858
<i>Twenty seconds left.</i>

1084
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,698
Let's stop breathing. One, two, three.

1085
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,955
<i>- Everyone cleared round one.</i>
- Nice and easy.

1086
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,293
No one got eliminated.

1087
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,962
- They will soon.
- We should push each other.

1088
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:19,217
- How much smaller will it get?
- What now? How much smaller is it?

1089
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,218
- Half.
- Half?

1090
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:28,518
- How will they stand on that?
- Either a piggyback ride or carry them.

1091
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,561
They'll have to get very close.

1092
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,398
<i>The game will begin after the whistle.</i>

1093
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:36,567
<i>Ready.</i>

1094
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,946
You can take a nap.

1095
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,781
May I do this?

1096
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,282
- No, that's harder.
- It is?

1097
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,993
- Just lean on me. That's much better.
- Okay.

1098
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,746
Drop your arms.
Stretch out your arms. Yes, like that.

1099
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,123
- Really?
- Yes, it's fine.

1100
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,543
- I'll hold you a bit tighter.
- Okay.

1101
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,296
We look way too loving.

1102
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,841
What are they doing?

1103
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,843
This looks kind of weird.

1104
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,431
It's rare for two men
to hug with their tops off.

1105
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,641
- Tell me about it.
- No, it rarely happens.

1106
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,769
They might start having feelings
they've never had before.

1107
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,522
It must feel so weird.

1108
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,150
We look way too loving.

1109
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,986
Stop making me laugh.

1110
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,537
Hey, this isn't too bad.

1111
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:31,873
I'm not breathing.

1112
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,834
<i>I wanted to be alone with Mina Sue,</i>

1113
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,713
so I wanted to get rid of Seung-il.

1114
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:42,759
I wanted to push him off the wooden board.

1115
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,720
I wanted to do it alone.

1116
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,767
<i>I wanted to do it alone with her.</i>

1117
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:54,020
How were the three of us
supposed to play the game?

1118
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,899
Was it really designed
with a chance for us to win?

1119
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,485
It was a bit of a shame.

1120
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,570
We had great teamwork.

1121
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:06,032
The chemistry
among the three of us wasn't bad.

1122
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:10,119
Is it possible
to leave <i>Single's Inferno</i> with two men?

1123
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,456
It'd be nice if I could leave
holding both their hands.

1124
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,334
Enough is enough.

1125
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,755
Mina Sue.

1126
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,134
There we go.

1127
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,471
<i>Everyone cleared round two, too.</i>

1128
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,890
We have to think of a plan
for the next round.

1129
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,063
It's starting to get harder.

1130
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,649
- It's so tiny.
- Really?

1131
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,984
They'll have to cling together.

1132
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,487
Wait.

1133
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,407
- Right there.
- Right there. Like this?

1134
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:49,951
Like this?

1135
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,412
- What do you think?
- Can you stop me from swaying?

1136
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:54,747
Right here.

1137
01:03:58,918 --> 01:03:59,961
What do you think?

1138
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:01,546
Is that okay?

1139
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,548
- Are you okay? I'm good.
- Yes, me too.

1140
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:06,717
Hey, you're a problem-solver.

1141
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,931
- This is good.
- It'll be funny if we win this, too.

1142
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:16,519
- Joo-young is irritated.
- She must be bothered.

1143
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,481
<i>The game will begin after the whistle.</i>

1144
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,440
<i>Ready.</i>

1145
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,659
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1146
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,870
It's the last round.

1147
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,455
- Mina, can you move back? Okay. Stop.
- We got this.

1148
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,333
What is that?

1149
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,172
- Are they serious?
- This is hilarious.

1150
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,258
I never imagined a posture like that.

1151
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,177
It's the last round.

1152
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,805
- Mina, can you move back? Okay. Stop.
- We got this.

1153
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,600
Let's stay calm. This is the last round.

1154
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:58,769
- I'll stay still like this.
- Okay.

1155
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,230
Let's give it our all.

1156
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,529
- I can…
- No, don't move.

1157
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:09,447
Just stay there.

1158
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,784
Geez, my feet.

1159
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,537
- Can I touch this area?
- Yes.

1160
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,080
Never mind, I won't.

1161
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:24,670
- This is hilarious.
- Look at Sung-hun.

1162
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,297
- Isn't he cute?
- Isn't he?

1163
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,214
He's adorable.

1164
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,592
What on earth is this?

1165
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,303
He's like a calm baby being carried.

1166
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:33,930
Never mind, I won't.

1167
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,266
Guys, I'm really sorry.

1168
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:41,520
Can we step down?

1169
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,689
- Yes, go ahead.
- I'm really sorry.

1170
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:44,607
I'm so sorry.

1171
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:45,733
- Are we done?
- Yes.

1172
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,610
<i>Choi Mina Sue's trio is eliminated.</i>

1173
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,321
They're called "Choi Mina Sue's trio"?

1174
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,823
It's like a band name.

1175
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:55,284
<i>Choi Mina Sue's trio is eliminated.</i>

1176
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,827
Don't move.

1177
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:00,915
I don't feel secure.

1178
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:03,000
- Stop moving.
<i>- Kim Min-gee's couple is eliminated.</i>

1179
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,543
- What?
- Oh, you touched the ground.

1180
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,505
Sung-min's pinky toe touched the ground.

1181
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:10,383
Why? What's wrong?

1182
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,303
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Park Hee-sun's couple is eliminated.</i>

1183
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,388
- Did we fail?
- Why?

1184
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,722
You must've touched the ground.

1185
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,684
It must've been your toes.
I couldn't feel it either.

1186
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:23,062
- Gosh, I should've asked for a piggyback.
- My feet were up.

1187
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,402
<i>Ham Ye-jin's couple is eliminated.</i>

1188
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:33,531
- Just keep an eye on the situation.
- Okay.

1189
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:37,994
Three teams are still in.

1190
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,371
They keep holding out?

1191
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,332
It's too small even for one person.

1192
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,251
Will it ever end?

1193
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:48,754
I don't think so.

1194
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:52,174
- Should we share the meal?
- Sounds good.

1195
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,510
I'll take just the broth.

1196
01:06:56,971 --> 01:07:01,642
<i>The game came to a tie.</i>
<i>All three couples will get special meals.</i>

1197
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,311
Hyeon-woo's amazing.

1198
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,354
He won again.

1199
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,816
- He won all the special meals.
- He doesn't need Paradise.

1200
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:09,984
He can eat everything here.

1201
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:15,448
<i>Today, there will be another</i>
<i>Paradise-bound couple matching.</i>

1202
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,951
<i>The matching will begin in an hour.</i>

1203
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,078
- He had fried chicken and cold noodles.
- Yes.

1204
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,831
They played a couples' game
called the Wooden Board Game.

1205
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:27,126
- Which team was the most memorable?
- Mina Sue's trio.

1206
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,921
- They were cool.
- Definitely Mina Sue's trio.

1207
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,924
Did you see any couples
that had a romantic moment?

1208
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:38,637
I didn't, but I saw a couple
that didn't show any romance.

1209
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,931
- Hee-sun and Su-been.
- It was Hee-sun and Su-been.

1210
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:44,060
They kept a bit of distance
even when they were hugging.

1211
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,562
They could've gotten closer
or played more aggressively,

1212
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:50,399
but even Hee-sun
wasn't trying to get closer to him.

1213
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:55,154
I think she's afraid Su-been will push her
away if she tries to get closer.

1214
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,655
I think she's just cautious.

1215
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,324
- That could be the case.
- Right.

1216
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,545
- Do you feel the same way as yesterday?
- Yes.

1217
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,047
- Really?
- Yes.

1218
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,215
I already voted.

1219
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,885
I wanted to check
if you were just messing around again.

1220
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,058
When did I ever mess around?

1221
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:29,355
- I've finally found my peace.
- Really?

1222
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,190
Well…

1223
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:35,277
Well, about yesterday.

1224
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:40,658
- Yes, you did.
- Yes, but I don't think I can help it.

1225
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:43,035
- It's because I went to Paradise with him.
- That's true.

1226
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,329
True.

1227
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:49,125
It feels weird. I think it's inevitable
with the first person you go with.

1228
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,627
- So I feel…
- He's on your mind?

1229
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,046
He is. I don't want to,
but I can't help it.

1230
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:56,715
I'm not sure how I feel.

1231
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,472
I've never seen them together.

1232
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:06,976
But I'll bring it up
since I've already mentioned it.

1233
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,228
It's something I've done,
so I have to resolve it.

1234
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,233
Su-been and Min-gee?
They're just giving each other advice.

1235
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,234
Yes.

1236
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,779
Honestly, I don't mind.

1237
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:24,201
Do as you please.

1238
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,580
What?

1239
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,039
- What do I do?
- Why?

1240
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,749
I don't know.

1241
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,837
How do you feel about me?

1242
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:38,799
No idea. At first,
you kept changing your mind.

1243
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,552
- No?
- You're torn because of that?

1244
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:44,722
At first, you kept changing your mind.

1245
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:47,391
Saying we were just friends
and then saying we were not.

1246
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:48,309
So…

1247
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,895
- So are you done with me?
- It's not over.

1248
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:54,231
- You're on my mind.
- I see.

1249
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,776
- Bye now.
- Okay. See you later.

1250
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:02,823
So who will Mina Sue choose in the end?

1251
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,408
- I really--
- I have no idea.

1252
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,493
But it's not Sung-hun.

1253
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,120
- Not him.
- That's evident.

1254
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,206
Why do I have a feeling it might be him?

1255
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,291
- Come on.
- Really? No way.

1256
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,709
- Her final pick?
- Yes.

1257
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,920
- You think she'll pick him?
- He's always wrong.

1258
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:19,715
Seung-il announced that
he wanted to go to Paradise with Mina Sue.

1259
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:22,051
Her choice will be crucial this time.

1260
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:23,052
- Yes.
- Yes.

1261
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:27,973
But the romance just reignited
between Mina Sue and Su-been.

1262
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,059
- She may not choose Seung-il.
- Right.

1263
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:31,560
I think she'll pick Su-been.

1264
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:35,022
If she goes with Seung-il
instead of Su-been…

1265
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:37,816
- It'll stir up…
- Something new will happen.

1266
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,026
- It'll begin.
- Su-been.

1267
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:40,319
She can apologize again.

1268
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:41,820
- Yes.
- She'll say sorry.

1269
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,698
Do you think he'll forgive her again
if she apologizes?

1270
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:48,535
- After what happened yesterday, yes.
- How many times can men forgive?

1271
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,288
- Infinitely? If they like her?
- No way.

1272
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,082
No, the number isn't important.

1273
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:55,960
- Then?
- He forgave her because he likes her.

1274
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:58,754
- Her choice will be very important.
- I can't wait to see.

1275
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:09,723
I want to help her.

1276
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,726
Then go ahead and help.

1277
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,144
- Yes.
- Yes.

1278
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,688
He can't even pass her water.

1279
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,657
- Ms. Go-eun.
- Yes?

1280
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,659
- Can we talk?
- Yes, sure.

1281
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:30,619
Let's go.

1282
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,126
- Let's talk here.
- Okay.

1283
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,711
Have you settled in?

1284
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:42,589
- I have. Can we just talk casually?
- Sure.

1285
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:44,550
Why are you suddenly talking politely?

1286
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,552
Other people might pass by, so…

1287
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,886
- To keep the vibe?
- Yes.

1288
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,596
I can speak casually.

1289
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,850
Do as you wish. I'll do as I like, too.

1290
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:04,778
When you go out, do guys hit on you?

1291
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:05,779
No.

1292
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,491
I bet you're really popular.

1293
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:12,745
No, things are similar.
It's no different from here.

1294
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:14,955
You're popular here.

1295
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,708
No, at first,
people found me difficult to approach.

1296
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,752
They like me better
after they chat with me.

1297
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:21,837
- You?
- My first impression…

1298
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,715
You're just like me. My kind of gal.

1299
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:26,675
"Gal"?

1300
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:28,177
"Gal"?

1301
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,636
- "His kind of gal."
- "Gal."

1302
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,597
- "Gal."
- At times, he…

1303
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:35,684
This guy.

1304
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,395
You and I seem really similar.

1305
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,647
- Yes, we are.
- In many ways.

1306
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,941
- But I have a nicer personality.
- The vibes.

1307
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:45,069
What do you mean?

1308
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:50,616
What?

1309
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:51,950
I have a nicer character.

1310
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,869
But I'm the nicest.

1311
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:57,373
I get that you're nice,
but you need to speak more nicely.

1312
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,502
I do, to my girlfriend.

1313
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:03,754
You came here to find one.

1314
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,299
You got me there. You're right.

1315
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,760
- Yes.
- You're right.

1316
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:17,351
- So, how's it going?
- I've been narrowing down my choices.

1317
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:24,900
- My pick was between you and Ye-jin.
- I see.

1318
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,945
I feel like I already know
what the others are like.

1319
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:28,946
Okay.

1320
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:33,617
I had a chat with Ye-jin yesterday.

1321
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:37,496
And it was so hard to talk to her.

1322
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,248
- Really?
- Yes.

1323
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:41,166
I'm not saying it was bad.

1324
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,710
- It was hard to keep it going?
- Yes, it was hard.

1325
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:49,174
So I began to think,
"I guess we aren't compatible."

1326
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:53,762
I see.

1327
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:55,681
What about you?

1328
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,975
Me? I have been…

1329
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,311
to Paradise with Sung-min.

1330
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:03,522
- And then--
- Sung-min.

1331
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:07,025
Next is Hyeon-woo.

1332
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:10,988
- He's someone I'm curious about.
- Hyeon-woo.

1333
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:15,451
You had a moment with Sung-min,
and you want to get to know Hyeon-woo.

1334
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,036
Am I not one of the candidates?

1335
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:20,956
You are.

1336
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,127
- Why didn't you say so?
- You're on my list.

1337
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:30,132
My goodness. You left me out.

1338
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,717
- You're there.
- How disappointing.

1339
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,138
- You're--
- I thought we had such a fun time.

1340
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:43,061
- I had such a fun time talking to you.
- Me too.

1341
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:45,314
- It was fun.
- Yes.

1342
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,691
- We laughed out loud.
- It was fun.

1343
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:50,360
And I was at ease.

1344
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:53,280
The thing is,
I had a lot of fun talking to you,

1345
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:56,200
but I wasn't sure
if you were romantically interested

1346
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:59,828
or if you just found me funny.

1347
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,001
I also had a tough time
differentiating between the two.

1348
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:11,006
I think we'll know
when we're in Paradise by ourselves.

1349
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:12,174
You're right.

1350
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:17,346
- I-geon, may I steal Go-eun?
- Yes, sure.

1351
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:19,097
- May I?
- Yes, of course.

1352
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,892
- In private.
- Yes, sure. Okay.

1353
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,437
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

1354
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,648
- We're finished talking anyway.
- You are?

1355
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,650
We've said what we needed to.

1356
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:31,360
- We were just chatting.
- We were.

1357
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,988
- You can sit here.
- Okay, thanks.

1358
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:35,948
- Bye.
- See you.

1359
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:36,865
Bye.

1360
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:40,285
- Let's talk again tomorrow.
- Okay.

1361
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,870
- Bye.
- And see you later.

1362
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:42,788
Okay.

1363
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:46,041
"See you later.
Let's talk again tomorrow."

1364
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:47,543
"Let's go to Paradise."

1365
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:53,215
- Did you have a good talk with him?
- Yes.

1366
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:59,513
- How do you feel?
- A bit troubled.

1367
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:04,059
- Why do you feel troubled?
- I'm not sure.

1368
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:05,477
- Really?
- Yes.

1369
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:10,399
I don't mind
that you're talking to others, Go-eun.

1370
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:12,401
Even if you go to Paradise with them,

1371
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,736
I don't want you to feel burdened.

1372
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,906
I'm sure we'll have
other chances to talk when you're back.

1373
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,032
Yes.

1374
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:19,950
I think this is it.

1375
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:23,954
I don't mind if you go with someone else.
But I'd like it if you went with me.

1376
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:28,041
You could go with someone else,
but it would be even better if it were me.

1377
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,751
That's pretty big to me.

1378
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:30,961
Like I mentioned yesterday,

1379
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:34,131
it'll be completely different
if we go there the second time.

1380
01:16:34,214 --> 01:16:36,133
Yes, it'll be different.

1381
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,264
Sung-min isn't a lot of fun.

1382
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:45,934
Go-eun's face turned grim,
and she said she was troubled in the end.

1383
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,978
I think she feels troubled

1384
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:50,564
because she wanted
to get to know Hyeon-woo.

1385
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:52,316
She wanted to do that today.

1386
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:53,734
- She's curious.
- In Paradise.

1387
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:57,279
But I-geon and Sung-min
came and confused her.

1388
01:16:57,362 --> 01:17:00,407
- They're getting in her head.
- They've left her confused.

1389
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,867
I think she'll choose Hyeon-woo.

1390
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,285
- Me too.
- Really?

1391
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,037
- I think otherwise.
- Really?

1392
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,247
I don't think
she even considered I-geon at first.

1393
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:12,252
She must've thought of someone else,
probably Hyeon-woo or Sung-min.

1394
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:14,880
But after talking to I-geon,
who gave her a clear answer,

1395
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:17,382
now she's thinking,
"Should I go with him?"

1396
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,676
I think that's why she feels troubled.

1397
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,304
- I also don't think it's Hyeon-woo.
- No, she'll pick him.

1398
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:24,181
I agree. Go-eun will choose Hyeon-woo.

1399
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:26,016
- Me too.
- Who thinks it's Hyeon-woo?

1400
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:27,476
- I say I-geon.
- Me too.

1401
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:28,727
- I-geon? Okay.
- Okay.

1402
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,312
- They've already gone.
- Let's see.

1403
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:33,398
It would be a shame for Go-eun
if she didn't get to know Hyeon-woo.

1404
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,109
She's been there with others,
so it'll be Hyeon-woo.

1405
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:41,740
He would've had a chance if he had come
and talked to her, but he didn't.

1406
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:44,451
- I'm sure it's the next scene.
- The next scene?

1407
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:45,702
- He'll come.
- Will he?

1408
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:46,995
- Shall we?
- Let's see.

1409
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,789
- Hyeon-woo will talk to her.
- Yes, he will.

1410
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:49,998
- Let's go, Hyeon-woo.
- Now.

1411
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:59,341
<i>Now, we're going to match the couples</i>
<i>who will go on a date in Paradise.</i>

1412
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,427
- They're doing it now?
- He didn't come.

1413
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,262
This isn't good.

1414
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:07,224
- He didn't come.
- Why didn't he talk to her?

1415
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:10,519
- The possibility plummets.
- Why was he talking to Sung-hun?

1416
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:16,358
<i>The men have already chosen the woman</i>
<i>they'd like to go to Paradise with.</i>

1417
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:26,576
<i>Ladies, please come to the common area</i>
<i>one by one as your names are called.</i>

1418
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,708
I'm dying to find out.

1419
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:36,294
- I want to know who Mina Sue chooses.
- Yes, there are so many unknowns.

1420
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,799
<i>Choi Mina Sue.</i>

1421
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:46,221
<i>Please say the name of the person</i>
<i>you'd like to go to Paradise with.</i>

1422
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:48,223
- It's the main round.
- She's here.

1423
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:49,558
It's the ending!

1424
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:52,060
Please.

1425
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:55,313
Under normal circumstances,
she would choose Su-been.

1426
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:56,273
- Yes.
- That's true.

1427
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:59,067
- I doubt she will.
- But she is no ordinary woman.

1428
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,571
Mina Sue is unpredictable.
Mina Sue, Dex Sue.

1429
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:22,799
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1430
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,056
<i>Choi Mina Sue has matched with…</i>

1431
01:19:31,975 --> 01:19:35,729
- I bet it's Su-been again.
- That would make the most sense.

1432
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:38,315
Who is it?

1433
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:46,031
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1434
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:25,070
