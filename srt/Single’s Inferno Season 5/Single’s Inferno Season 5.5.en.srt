SINGLE'S INFERNO

00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,888
[Master] <i>Contestants,</i>
<i>The Truth Game is now over.</i>

4
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,182
- [Min-gee] Oh, it's cold.
- [Mina Sue] Hey, can we talk?

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,727
You wanna talk to Hee-sun first?

6
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,812
Do you want to talk, or can we talk?

7
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,106
- Like, right now? Sure.
- Yes. Is that okay?

8
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,317
- Okay, cool.
- Mina, you busy right now?

9
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,860
- Oh, I…
- You busy?

10
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,196
- Go ahead and talk.
- Oh, we can. No, no, no.

11
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,199
- We can talk now. I can talk to him later.
- You sure?

12
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,784
[Min-gee] I guess that's not too bad.

13
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,244
Do you want soju or beer?
You have a preference?

14
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,121
Uh… A beer feels good.

15
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,706
[Seung-il] You sure? There's also soju.

16
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,709
Beer? Yeah.

17
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,002
Shall we talk?

18
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,255
[Seung-il] Beer, then?

19
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,507
- Yes, beer.
- [Seung-il] Got it.

20
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,553
We got basically no time to talk here.

21
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,096
Mmm.

22
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,975
You know, I've been the same from day one.

23
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,353
I've only been interested in getting
to know two people.

24
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,021
And that's Min-gee and…

25
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,565
And… Miss Tiramisu.

26
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,360
Miss Tiramisu.

27
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,321
- Tiramisu.
- Yeah. Miss Tiramisu.

28
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,454
Did you honestly have no idea?

29
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,539
I'm curious to know.

30
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,167
Well, I… I thought you were
interested in me at first,

31
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,503
but then I wasn't entirely sure,
to be honest.

32
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,464
Is there a particular reason
you thought that?

33
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,967
It just felt like you and Min-gee
had already,

34
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,968
I don't know.

35
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:20,807
You two just seemed like you paired up
together and decided to stick with that.

36
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,562
So it was a bit weird for me
to try and muscle my way in there.

37
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,688
[Seung-il] Mmm.

38
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,065
I'm a bit of a chicken,
as you saw earlier.

39
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,317
You're really different
from what I first imagined.

40
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,445
- How so?
- Well, my first impression of you was that

41
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,574
if you were interested in someone,
you'd just go for it.

42
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,450
I thought you were more headstrong,

43
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,287
like that kind of woman,
but I guess you're not really.

44
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,873
I honestly thought you weren't interested.

45
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,374
- So I just…
- And you?

46
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,168
Well, yeah, because it's not like

47
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,171
you and I have really talked much
while we've been here.

48
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,881
But after hearing all of that today,

49
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,008
especially when we were
playing the game,

50
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,718
I thought… "Oh!

51
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,137
if I get a chance,

52
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,056
maybe I should work up some courage."

53
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,100
So I changed my mind halfway through.

54
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,311
Ah.

55
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,479
[both chuckle]

56
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,359
So, yeah.

57
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,571
Oh, and that first time,
we, uh, with the postcards?

58
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,572
Yeah, that was me.

59
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,699
- You're talking about E, G, G?
- Yes, egg.

60
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,867
- Egg.
- Yeah.

DAY 1 LIKABILITY CHOOSING

62
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,376
I wanted it to be obvious
it was me.

63
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,841
That was the same
when I was writing that postcard.

64
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:41,012
I really gave it a lot of thought
because I wanted to give you a hint

65
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,431
- that it was me as well.
- Right.

66
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,809
Was there anything that stood out to you
from those postcards?

67
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,105
There was one person who mentioned
the yellow dress in their postcard.

68
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,023
Right.

69
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,236
I really wanted to bring that
up to you at some point.

70
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,324
But actually, when you joined us,
you were the last to arrive, right?

71
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,576
In that yellow dress.

72
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,373
DAY 1 FIRST MEETING

73
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,707
Hey, guys.

74
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:13,795
Hello.

75
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,970
As soon as I saw you walk over,
my first thought was

76
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,555
"I hope she sits next to me."

77
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,683
- Yeah.
- And all I could think was "Wow."

78
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,726
- Really?
- Yeah. So for me…

79
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,190
Well, actually, your extroverted
personality is the type I usually go for.

80
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,528
[both chuckle]

81
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,905
I like the charm that comes from maturity.

82
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,744
- Seriously?
- And I feel only two girls here have that.

83
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,789
Here I am, thinking that I was
the cute girl this season.

84
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,916
Yeah, I did realize that a bit late.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,335
I didn't know that
when I saw you in the yellow dress.

86
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,337
Really? So did your perception change?

87
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,840
Yeah. At the time, I didn't know.
I just thought,

88
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,050
"Oh! This is going to be interesting."

89
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,470
I just don't know how exactly,
but this is going to be interesting.

90
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,431
If you want to find out…

91
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,849
[Seung-il chuckles]

92
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,728
- Oh, my heart. Yeah.
- [chuckling] Stop!

93
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,315
So tell me, what's your ideal type, then?

94
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,858
My ideal type?

95
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:21,738
Hmm. Honestly, I really like someone
who is sure they like me and expresses it.

96
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,325
They show me just how much I mean to them,
and to be real with you,

97
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,535
I thought I felt that from you at first.

98
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,121
But then suddenly
that feeling disappeared.

99
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,623
At least that's how it felt
from my perspective.

100
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,460
I don't know how it felt from yours,
but that's how it came across.

101
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,295
Well, at the start, I did get

102
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,130
the feeling that

103
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,553
you weren't going to
or didn't want to approach me.

104
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,889
- Huh. Wait, why?
- That's the sense I got.

105
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,348
I just thought that

106
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,185
I should be the proactive one here

107
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,687
- if I wanted to talk to you.
- Right.

108
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,191
But you didn't approach me,
did you? Sadly.

109
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,445
Who turned on the AC
for you in the helicopter?

110
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,490
Oh. But that's not approaching me!

111
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,992
How would I know that?
I just thought that was…

112
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,169
[imperceptible]

113
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,308
I don't do that kind of thing
unless I like someone.

114
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,103
Oh. Really?

115
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,527
Yeah. Well, actually,
you've been on my mind.

116
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,571
And earlier,

117
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,115
I kept thinking about you.

118
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,659
Yeah. [chuckles softly]

119
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,286
Oh, sorry.

120
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,550
Mina Sue is showing this open
and innocent nature,

121
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:09,262
and Seung-il has become the dominant one,
taking charge of the situation.

122
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,930
- You're right.
- Wow.

123
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,183
The other thing I find fascinating
is that Seung-il kept saying,

124
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,812
- "You, you, you" to Min-gee like…
- Was it her ear or hood or something?

125
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,273
He expressed his interest
in her quite clearly--

126
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,151
But as soon as the party was done,
he walked over and asked Mina

127
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,986
to go for another drink with them.

128
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,447
You'd think he'd be hesitant
to do that in front of Min-gee.

129
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,489
But he didn't care.

130
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,450
He just went straight over
to talk to Mina Sue.

131
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,661
Seung-il said from day one that Mina Sue
is the one who intrigued him.

132
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,164
I don't think it's wrong
for him to explore that.

133
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,208
Otherwise he's just going
to keep wondering "What if?"

134
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,211
So I think speaking with Mina Sue
is the right thing to do

135
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,172
because it could help him
reach a clearer decision.

136
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,048
- Hanhae, what are you so unhappy about?
- Me?

137
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,967
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not unhappy at all.

138
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,428
- I can relate to him because…
- [Kyuhyun] You can relate?

139
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,097
I mean, it's only been
two or three days in Inferno.

140
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,475
So I can see how this kind
of situation might arise.

141
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,935
I can absolutely understand
where Seung-il is coming from.

142
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,896
I mean, he can't help
who he's attracted to.

143
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,397
And he said so from the beginning.

144
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,983
And the fact he and Min-gee
had one date together

145
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,569
- doesn't mean he now belongs to her.
- [Jin-young] So true.

146
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,404
[Jin-kyung] I want to know
Mina Su's motive

147
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,240
for acting this way,
like what's her angle right now?

148
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,534
I think we need to keep watching
to find out.

149
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,953
These other guys
are waiting in line for her, right?

150
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,831
There are four of them waiting for her,
so it's a…

151
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,791
It's a bit weird, but still, hmm.

152
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,211
[gentle music playing]

153
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,301
[Sung-hun] Should we just go barge in?

154
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,429
[Min-gee] No, because they might
want to keep talking.

155
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,431
They've been talking over there
for a while now.

156
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,558
[Sung-hun] Should we just leave them?

157
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,895
I mean, he's been saying this whole time
that he wants to do this,

158
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,730
so I really don't want to get in the way.

159
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,440
- Okay.
- Yeah.

160
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,984
- Okay. If you're cool with it.
- I've gotta be understanding.

161
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,445
- I'm trying my best. Sounds good.
- Let's sit here and wait.

162
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,282
[Min-gee] Wake me up when they're done.

163
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,702
I think I can tell
what kind of person you are.

164
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,039
Like how you, uh…

165
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,710
- How you feel, the way you're feeling.
- Mmm-hmm.

166
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,753
I can totally tell.

167
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,178
- [Hee-sun] Suddenly gotten really cold.
- [Su-been] Mmm.

168
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,471
[Hee-sun] It's freezing.

169
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,558
- Do you want this? I'm all set.
- Sure.

170
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,475
Here.

171
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,313
I really hope things work out
between these two.

172
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,898
Please. Just this once.

173
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,152
[gentle music playing]

174
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,030
[Hee-sun shudders]

175
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,666
[Hee-sun laughs]

176
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,627
Oh, my gosh.

177
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,841
[chuckling]

178
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,719
So you think I look like
your ex-boyfriend or something?

179
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,512
[laughing]

180
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,183
- Do I?
- You're really good looking.

181
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,102
I… I mean, earlier you…

182
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,314
So you… Well, your face is my type.

183
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,356
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

184
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,566
And what type is that?

185
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,568
Just…

186
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,820
this type.

187
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,323
- You know, this kind of…
- Ah. Okay.

188
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,366
I meant it in a good way.

189
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,327
- Mmm?
- I really meant it in a good way.

190
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,578
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

191
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,997
- I did. I promise.
- Ah.

192
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,585
Su-been just looks so down right now.

193
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,837
- Different from when he's with me.
- He really does.

194
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,757
Meanwhile, Hee-sun can't contain herself.
She's so happy.

195
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,300
Her body's turned toward him.

196
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,802
She's thrilled and she's constantly
watching his reactions.

197
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,306
What would you say is your ideal type?

198
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,225
- I, uh…
- Yeah?

199
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,771
Someone who makes me feel good.

200
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,189
Mmm.

201
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,193
Didn't you say
you don't have an ideal type?

202
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:53,986
Me?

203
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,114
I care more about
what they're like on the inside.

204
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,324
[Hee-sun] Mmm.

205
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,703
Yeah. I guess I'm looking for someone
who's genuine and honest.

206
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,913
For sure, yeah.

207
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,585
I really wanted to talk
to you too, you know.

208
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,586
- Really?
- Yeah.

209
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,800
Because you were someone
I wanted to get to know.

210
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,051
[Hee-sun] Mmm.

211
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:25,101
So look, if I'm being completely honest,
the person who intrigued me first was

212
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,354
- actually Mina Sue.
- Mmm.

213
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,817
And I know saying you were next
sounds a bit…

214
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,027
but yeah, I wanted to get to know you.

215
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,487
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

216
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,242
The person who intrigued me was you.

217
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,451
Why?

218
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,954
What was your first impression of me?

219
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,289
I wrote it on the postcard.

220
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,583
- [chuckles]
- [exclaiming]

221
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,044
Yeah.

222
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,840
DAY 1 LIKABILITY CHOOSING

223
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,259
You're my type.

224
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,969
I'LL START A CONVERSATION!
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT

225
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,263
Hee-sun approached him
a lot to try and talk.

226
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,347
[Jin-young] She really did.

227
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,807
Yeah.

228
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,811
If I'm being honest,
I did kind of feel it.

229
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,355
- Right? I expressed my feelings.
- Yeah.

230
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,441
- Yeah.
- I could kind of tell.

231
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:17,486
Yeah, but I sort of got the sense
I was making you uncomfortable.

232
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,196
Oh, I didn't feel uncomfortable.

233
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,241
It was just that I… Uh…

234
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,871
I just wanted to quickly
get close to the person

235
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,623
who left the strongest impression
on me at the start.

236
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,751
- That's the reason I spoke to her first.
- Hmm.

237
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,297
To get to know her quickly,
to see if she's not the one, then move on.

238
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,214
[Hee-sun] Mmm.

239
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,386
- Oh, she's…
- [all laughing]

240
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,513
She can't relax after that, can she?

241
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,432
That's what happens when you like someone.

242
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,767
[Jin-young] She doesn't know
what to do with herself.

243
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,480
So, yeah, that was my approach.

244
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,360
But having been to Paradise now

245
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,698
and with what happened today,
I think my mind might change a bit.

246
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,579
Ah. Right, well…

247
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,582
- [chuckles]
- [Su-been] Huh?

248
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,627
- Is she happy? Is that better?
- She is.

249
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,213
Every word he says makes her swing
between joy and sorrow.

250
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,590
[Jin-young] That's absolutely right.
That's spot on. Yeah.

251
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,719
I feel like you and I
might have similar dispositions.

252
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,304
- Oh.
- Yeah.

253
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,641
- I think so too.
- That's honestly the reason I wanted

254
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,810
to find out more about you immediately.

255
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,522
- I think I've changed a bit after today.
- Mmm.

256
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,148
Yeah.

257
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,698
Those two actually suit each other.

258
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,493
You can see that Su-been's
opening up more and more over time.

259
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,120
If I was Su-been, I think Kee-Sun
would catch my interest.

260
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,205
No doubt in my mind.

261
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,290
You have to remember
that Mina Sue and Su-been

262
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,709
had planned to talk after the campfire.

263
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:59,588
But she ditched Su-been and left
with Seung-il the moment he came over.

264
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,840
That was probably another sign for Su-been

265
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,677
- that she was slipping away from him.
- [Da-hee] Right.

266
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,847
Is there anyone else besides
Min-gee and me for you?

267
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,099
Oh, definitely not.

268
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,308
- Really?
- Yeah.

269
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,102
I think I'm good with this.

270
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,020
- Really? Mmm.
- Yeah.

271
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:20,109
Oh. But if I, uh…

272
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,822
still have a few, basically,
if I still have a few other people

273
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,699
I want to talk to
and see what they're like,

274
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,159
- is it okay with you if I do?
- Of course. Sure.

275
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,120
This is so much fun, but…

276
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,748
can I go talk to them?
Is that okay?

277
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,333
- Yeah, let's head out.
- Okay.

278
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,793
It's better to do it now.

279
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,796
Why did you ask that
so cautiously, though?

280
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,298
Because I'm here with you,

281
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,092
and the person in front of me
takes priority of course.

282
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,802
I didn't want to be rude to you.

283
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,390
Oh, there's Min-gee.

284
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,604
How much are you planning to drink?

285
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,397
Oh! No, they're from over there.

286
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,398
Oh, okay.

287
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,067
- [Seung-il] Ah.
- Mmm.

288
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,278
- Yeah.
- Yep.

289
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,279
[Seung-il] Mmm.

290
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,950
Did you have a good talk?

291
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,369
- Mmm.
- You've been wanting that.

292
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,580
Mmm.

293
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,625
Mmm.

294
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,089
[pensive music playing]

295
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,266
- About Mina.
- Mmm-mmm.

296
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,896
I have a much better idea now.

297
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,357
- Of what?
- I know if I were to choose Mina…

298
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,524
Yeah?

299
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,737
My feelings for you and for Mina
would be very distinct.

300
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,198
It would be a clear choice
of one or the other.

301
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,908
Well, seriously, give it a shot.

302
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,701
If the conversation went well, go for it.

303
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,454
And if you decide to choose her,
then you choose her.

304
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,794
[all laughing]

305
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,296
He's shocked, like,
why is she okay with this?

306
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,422
Like, can I go?

307
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,557
So did you only talk to Sung-hun?

308
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,226
Didn't you talk to anyone else tonight?

309
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,770
Yeah, I only talked with Sung-Hun and…

310
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,189
Yeah, I mean, I was only talking to him

311
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:26,068
so that waiting all that time
for you wasn't as difficult.

312
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,862
You waited for me?

313
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,616
Mmm.

314
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,836
What?

315
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,214
You're just… You've gotten
under my skin now, in a good way.

316
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,926
That's nice to hear.

317
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:03,063
But, you know, honestly day one, day two,
day three, they all kind of feel the same.

318
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,648
And for me,

319
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,778
unless someone gets to me just like
you have, I lose interest in them.

320
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,783
But seriously, this one little heart
of mine, it's done, it's you.

321
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,874
No one else is curious
about me here like you are.

322
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,002
[chuckles softly]

323
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,683
A lot of thoughts are going
through Min-gee's mind right now,

324
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,477
like, is this good or is this bad?

325
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,438
What does he even mean?

326
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,856
It's about the chocolates.

327
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:51,111
Do you remember that red was for someone
they liked and he only got one red one.

328
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,280
SONG SEUNG-IL

329
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,575
So he's basically saying to her,
"None of the other girls

330
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,203
are curious about me,
so I don't need them."

331
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,246
- [Jin-kyung] Oh.
- So that works out well then

332
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,957
because Min-gee only has Seung-il
now, doesn't she?

333
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,626
- [Da-hee] Right.
- That's where she's at.

334
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,337
But Seung-il was actually wavering
for a minute there

335
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,380
That's why she told him
"Go ahead. I don't mind."

336
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,300
But her face is showing her true feelings.
Looks very upset by it all.

337
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,510
She won't feel great.

338
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,387
[Kyuhyun] Yeah, you can totally see
the struggle on her face.

339
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,354
Shall we open the door?

340
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,355
Yeah.

341
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,358
Hi.

342
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,359
[Su-been] Hey.

343
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,071
She's here.

344
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,615
The moment we've all been waiting for
has arrived.

345
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,866
[Jin-young] Ah-ha.

346
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,786
Oh! It's just the two of you left.

347
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,996
I'll let you guys talk.
You go ahead.

348
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,332
Are you sure it's okay
if I talk with Su-been?

349
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,333
Totally fine.

350
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,794
[Mina Sue] Um…

351
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,673
Did you have a good chat?

352
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,508
I wrapped it up as fast as I could.

353
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,219
I told him that I had to go.

354
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,265
Wow.

355
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,063
Oh, look, look, our photos are here.

356
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,815
- [Su-been] Where?
- Right here.

357
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,068
But they're all of her
with the different guys.

358
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,572
- How was the photoshoot?
- That shoot?

359
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:21,160
Um, I wanted to do a good job
for both of them. Mmm. So…

360
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,204
Yeah, you were really good at it.

361
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,205
- Really?
- Yeah.

362
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,293
But did you see me
get all flustered earlier?

363
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,503
- It was awful.
- Earlier?

364
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,672
Yeah. During the challenge
this afternoon

365
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,425
when I had to call out
the names of my partners.

366
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,343
I forgot them. You remember?

367
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,262
Ah, that, yeah.

368
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,764
I actually wanted to do that shoot
with you.

369
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,602
I was gonna say your name, but Hee-sun
picked you first, and I was last.

370
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,687
- All I could think of was your name.
- Oh.

371
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,355
Mmm.

372
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,399
There's nothing we could do
about that, though.

373
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,483
No.

374
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:59,156
But you know what
I was thinking to myself?

375
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,074
Maybe you know now.

376
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,244
I mean, you spent the whole day
with Hee-sun,

377
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,664
so I naturally thought that you might have
wanted to get to know her better

378
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,876
after doing the shoot
with her, right? Yeah.

379
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,546
Then when we were sitting around
the campfire, I got the same feeling.

380
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,090
- I just came to my own conclusion that…
- Yeah?

381
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,468
…since you were sitting next to Hee-sun

382
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,387
and you chose to sit there,
I'll be honest.

383
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,932
I took that as a sign
that you must not like me.

384
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,266
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

385
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,354
Well, you have to know
that the seating around the campfire…

386
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,234
wasn't entirely up to me, really.

387
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,736
And what I wanted to ask you about is…

388
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,367
Well, you said that the situation changed
during the course of the game.

389
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,451
- Yeah.
- When you said

390
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,203
the person you liked had changed,

391
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,747
that was a bit unexpected.

392
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,499
Why?

393
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,127
Because I'm just wondering if you
weren't considering Seung-il before,

394
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,213
what suddenly made you change your mind.

395
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,506
- Seung-il?
- Yeah.

396
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,841
About Seung-il, um…

397
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,679
I didn't mention him
when we were in Paradise.

398
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,638
Yeah.

399
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,516
But on the first day, on the first day…

400
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,227
- Ah, first impressions?
- Solely based on first impressions.

401
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,646
But I never

402
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,109
attempted to get to know him
more during the game.

403
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,986
When I heard he had made
a different choice,

404
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,364
I felt like I wanted to get to know him
if I ever had the chance for a quick chat,

405
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,992
just to see if that first
impression was right.

406
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,994
- I see. Mmm.
- Mmm.

407
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,829
- Yeah.
- I totally respect that.

408
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,164
- Not that I wasn't thinking about you.
- Mmm.

409
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,835
Yeah, but I honestly kind of felt bad
that I wasn't respecting your--

410
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,753
You don't have to worry about that.

411
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,631
I care about your feelings
even if you tell me not to.

412
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,010
No, seriously. You don't have to feel bad
for me or anything like that.

413
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,011
- Okay.
- Don't.

414
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,387
No, I won't feel bad.

415
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,680
- Okay.
- I don't feel bad.

416
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,348
No, there's nothing to feel bad about.

417
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,599
- I really don't.
- Great.

418
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,393
Actually, I'm kind of pissed off.

419
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,896
Yeah. I don't like the fact
that the guy who went to Paradise with me

420
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,941
was suddenly getting
all cozy with someone else.

421
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,653
I even saw you take off your hoodie
for her. So there's that. So no.

422
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,779
Mmm-mmm.

423
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,324
I don't feel bad after all
that chatting and drinking

424
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,992
that you did with me yesterday.

425
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,910
Come on. You were worse.

426
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,121
- [Jin-young] Exactly.
- [Kyuhyun] Man.

427
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,875
Those aren't justifiable reasons for her
to say those things to him.

428
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,793
[Mina Sue] And what you're doing,

429
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,921
um, yeah, if I'm being honest
with you, I don't like it.

430
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,424
I don't like that you're spending
all your time with Hee-sun.

431
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,177
I don't like it.
It really gets on my nerves.

432
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,472
- But…
- I really had no idea you felt that way.

433
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,057
Mmm. But still.

434
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,391
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

435
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,894
There were things
that bothered me too, you know.

436
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,020
- Okay.
- Yeah.

437
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,355
Like it bothered me
when you chose Seung-il.

438
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,900
And when you said that you wanted to go

439
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,944
to Paradise with someone else,
and then you chose Seung-il,

440
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,154
that bothered me too.

441
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,822
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

442
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,741
- Plenty of things bother me, too.
- Sure.

443
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,494
Anyway, we've decided
to get to know other people, so.

444
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,038
Yeah, ideally, we get to know
other people.

445
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,457
And then after you've done that,

446
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,919
you ultimately decide
that I'm the one you like.

447
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,004
- That's what I want. Yeah.
- Mmm.

448
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,882
[Mina Sue] Mmm. Mmm.

449
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,844
Look, if I'm being
completely honest with you…

450
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,597
- Mmm.
- Uh, so…

451
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,059
I was curious about Hee-sun
before all this.

452
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,936
I've been curious about her
from the start.

453
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,230
But after today, how should I put it?

454
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,109
I've become a bit more interested
in getting to know her.

455
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,068
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

456
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,030
Isn't it clear to you
that I'm bothered by all of this?

457
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,953
That's not really how it looked to me.

458
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:33,954
- Really?
- No.

459
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,876
Um, I'm honestly trying my hardest
right now not to show it on my face but…

460
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:42,879
yeah.

461
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,844
Su-been should be allowed too, as well.

462
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,847
She's trying to get to know other people.
Su-been should be allowed to.

463
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,641
So you've got to be more
understanding towards him.

464
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,145
Yeah. Look, I do get what
you're saying right now, and…

465
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,314
what I want to say is,

466
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,985
so you know how you mentioned to me
yesterday that you don't like people

467
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,778
who go around hitting on everyone?

468
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,280
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah.

469
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,700
I don't like the type
who goes around hitting on everyone.

470
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:16,872
Yeah, like, don't be flirting with me
and every other girl as well.

471
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:22,878
I really don't like it when I can,
you know, see it with my own eyes.

472
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,879
I get that.

473
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,381
And yet she's doing that.

474
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,591
[Jin-young] It's true.

475
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,260
- Wait a sec. Huh?
- Seriously.

476
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,970
That's exactly what she's doing.

477
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,848
I guess you thought
that's what I was doing.

478
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,726
Yeah, that's how it felt,
if I'm being honest, yeah.

479
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,061
So it doesn't exactly make me feel great.

480
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,230
I just have to be
honest with you about this.

481
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,524
And I'm also bothered
by all of this as well.

482
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,692
I just don't show it.

483
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,943
That's only natural.

484
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,862
- Yeah.
- Okay.

485
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,699
Anyway, I think that the absolute
best thing I can do for myself right now

486
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,702
is to get to know other people,
and you should do the same.

487
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,996
And then, you know…

488
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,416
if you find that the time
you've spent with me

489
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,085
was more enjoyable,
then I'd like you to tell me.

490
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,880
Mmm. I'll tell you
and be totally honest with you.

491
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,841
- So you're not confused. Yeah.
- And I'll do the same.

492
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,802
I just felt like there was
a misunderstanding,

493
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,804
so I wanted to clear it up

494
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,475
After hearing you out,
I feel like everything's clear now.

495
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,102
- I'm glad we talked.
- Mmm.

496
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,730
That was cleared up easily.

497
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,024
[all chuckle]

498
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,735
I guess it's really that easy
to resolve things, huh?

499
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,072
Right? Yeah. He said the misunderstanding
had been cleared up,

500
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:35,784
but it felt like he just said it
to end the conversation quickly.

501
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,371
You know what? I think Mina Sue
wanted to keep a tight grip on Su-been.

502
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,540
But when she realized
that wasn't gonna work, she loosened it.

503
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,084
But only because she had no choice.

504
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,087
Based on how he's been so far,
you'd expect Su-been to say,

505
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,214
- "I'll make sure you don't have to worry."
- Yeah.

506
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,591
But instead he said, "Well,
you're doing the same thing."

507
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,386
He threw it right back in her face
instead of reassuring her.

508
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,847
She tried to frame what she was saying
as being honest and upfront.

509
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,392
But as soon as Su-been pointed out
the facts,

510
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,769
all the holes
in her argument were exposed.

511
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,230
- You're right.
- And then it turned into a situation

512
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,648
where she had to admit to it all.

513
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,277
- She was exposed for being a hypocrite.
- But if she had said to him,

514
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,238
"Since I'm exploring other people,
you can too, go ahead,"

515
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,656
that would have been fine.

516
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,825
But all she said was
that she was ticked off.

517
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:21,121
Exactly. But Mina Sue is just someone
who expresses herself openly and honestly.

518
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,373
She'll tell people
if she's ticked off about something,

519
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,834
So she's not saying
"I can do this, but you can't."

520
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,087
- It's more like "This is just how I feel."
- That's right.

521
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,882
- [Sung-hun] How are you?
- [Mina Sue] I'm good. How are you?

522
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,050
[Sung-hun] Me too.

523
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,678
I actually wanted to talk to you.

524
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,179
Mmm. That's why I'm here.

525
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,809
Yeah, I know, but I want to talk about,
like, more our true feelings.

526
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,228
I like talking about things
like true feelings.

527
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,439
Um, well, today…

528
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,109
- Honestly?
- Yeah, honestly.

529
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,028
What chocolates did you get?

530
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,156
I got one. One red.

531
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,367
That was me.

532
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,995
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

533
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,288
- That's how I felt.
- Why?

534
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,498
Um, after the shoot…

535
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,334
honestly,

536
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,171
I was thinking about the person
I felt most comfortable with

537
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,590
and the one who gave me
the most enjoyment here

538
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,468
and taking into account
conversations and everything.

539
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,097
I wanted to give that chocolate
to that person. To you.

540
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,600
Yeah. Yeah.

541
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,061
I didn't give you one.

542
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,730
I know. Oh, bro, I know. Wait.

543
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,024
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

544
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,026
Tell me why you tell me
what you think about me.

545
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:38,198
Okay, you were always, like,
part of like my top, like, three.

546
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:42,744
But rather than just general attraction,
like attracted to you as a guy.

547
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,412
- Comfort.
- Comfort.

548
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,415
I think you know I do like talking to you.

549
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,586
I… I like hanging out with you,
but then, and that I'm not sure if it's…

550
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,799
romantic interest
or if I'm really fond of you,

551
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,717
because I think I do care a lot about you.

552
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,260
- I get that.
- Like… Yeah.

553
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,138
Those are my true,
sincere and honest feelings.

554
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,477
Mmm.

555
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,231
I always say the same thing.

556
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,192
With you,

557
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,902
- I'm comfortable with you.
- Yeah.

558
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,279
But I don't know if it's like, romantic,

559
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,489
- Right.
- Yeah.

560
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,573
Oh, that's a relief.

561
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,741
- I agree.
- Yeah.

562
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,370
Honestly, just hearing that, I, yeah,
I'm like, so relaxed now.

563
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:29,499
So what I always say is,
right now I'm just comfortable with her

564
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,042
because she speaks my language.

565
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,669
- Yeah.
- I don't know…

566
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,796
But people think we're
interested in each other.

567
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,632
It's because other people
misunderstand our relationship

568
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:41,219
and they don't like…
They don't come up to me.

569
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,346
- Yeah, but they… This will like…
- Really?

570
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,348
…tell them it's not that.

571
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,393
Okay, but then… So for now, we're,
for now, we're friends.

572
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,936
We're friends right now.

573
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,730
- Who knows what will happen.
- Yeah.

574
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,858
But I think honestly, like right now,
I think we're just friends.

575
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,651
Yeah, I think so too.

576
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,319
Yeah, and I love that.

577
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,281
[both sigh]

578
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,659
[Go-eun] Did I keep you waiting?

579
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,911
- [Hyeon-woo] No, I just got here too.
- Okay.

580
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,457
[chuckling]

581
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,458
What?

582
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,555
- We've had so little time to talk.
- Yeah, that's true.

583
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,390
But at least we're here now.

584
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,017
Finally getting to chat.

585
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,854
Do you usually take things a bit slow?

586
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,064
- Yeah, I'm pretty calm.
- Mmm.

587
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,151
Actually, my impression of you
was that you were reserved as well.

588
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,320
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. But I've been noticing

589
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,738
that you actually smile a lot,

590
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,157
and have this natural allure about you.

591
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,076
That's really been catching my eye
since we got here.

592
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,162
- Mmm.
- I want to find out more about you.

593
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:55,168
Well, to me, in Inferno,
you seem pretty reserved, right?

594
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,378
Like when we're in a big group.

595
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,338
Yeah, yeah.

596
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:03,635
Also, when we're all in the dining area,
cooking together and after we've eaten

597
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,762
and we're cleaning up doing the dishes,

598
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:09,015
I've noticed you're always
the one doing the grunt work.

599
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,309
That really made a good impression on me.

600
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,310
Oh, thank you.

601
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,607
- Or to cover your shoulders.
- Thanks.

602
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,403
Mmm.

603
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,865
And even when your hand was bleeding
that time, you were just like,

604
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,492
- "Eh, I'm fine."
- [chuckles]

605
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,452
Is your hand okay?

606
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,206
- Oh, yeah. It's fine.
- Did you hurt yourself?

607
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,999
I didn't realize it happened.

608
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,042
Oh, really?

609
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,673
I was like, "That doesn't look okay."

610
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,092
- No, you were right.
- "You need to put some cream on it."

611
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,387
And that's another thing. Even though
I kept saying that I felt fine,

612
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,556
you kept asking about it. Yeah.

613
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,599
It's those kinds of things that made me

614
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,396
- want to find out more about you.
- Mmm.

615
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,565
Yeah. Yeah.

616
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,441
- I feel the same.
- Great.

617
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,112
There's something I've been
wondering about you.

618
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,656
- Yes?
- What type of person are you normally?

619
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,366
- Normally?
- Mmm-hmm.

620
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,870
You mean me as a person
or as a girlfriend?

621
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,164
- As a girlfriend.
- As a girlfriend?

622
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,460
I'm definitely more affectionate
towards my partner.

623
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,299
Ah, interesting. You're affectionate.
Noted.

624
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,720
Guys have described me before
as someone who's bright and bubbly.

625
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,848
- Yeah.
- Wow. I'm so curious to know more.

626
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,352
[chuckles]

627
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,607
[Sung-Min] Oh!

628
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,568
Oh! I'll join you.

629
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,278
Was someone else boring you?

630
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,241
I'm gonna have to break this up.

631
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,951
- [Hyeon-woo] No, you can't.
- I'm kidding.

632
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,503
Did you have a good talk?

633
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,510
[Go-eun chuckling]

634
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,437
So, Hyeon-woo, have your feelings
changed at all after the chat?

635
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,605
- Me?
- Yeah.

636
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,981
No, it solidified things.

637
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,775
Oh, you're more certain now? Ah!

638
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,776
Wow.

639
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,030
Ugh, this really isn't easy.

640
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,531
Seriously, this is not easy.

641
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,699
[Go-eun chuckles]

642
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,166
Okay, so let me get this straight.

643
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,795
The person you've been wanting to talk
to this entire time was Go-eun?

644
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,297
Mmm-hmm.

645
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,468
Should I leave?

646
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,221
[Sung-Min] No, why?
Of course you should stay.

647
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,848
- [Da-hee] He's intimidating.
- It's like a standoff.

648
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,184
[Jin-young] When's the last time
we see two guys do that?

649
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,435
It's been a while.

650
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,775
Do you guys still have a lot more
that you need to talk about?

651
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,778
- No, it's fine. Be my guest.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

652
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:12,532
- So finish up by the time I get back.
- Oh! Understood.

653
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,950
[Sung-Min chuckles]

654
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,952
If we can. Not sure though.

655
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,373
Why not just set a timer? Or set an alarm?
Do you even have one?

656
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,208
- Take as long as you can.
- I'll be back.

657
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,211
- You can come back tomorrow if you want.
- [Go-eun chuckles]

658
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,131
- Hyeon-woo's not backing down.
- [Hanhae] Like a game of chicken.

659
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,718
No physical punches were thrown
but their words had the same effect.

660
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,720
They threw punches with words.

661
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,847
[chuckles]

662
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,931
Wow.

663
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,392
Gosh, I can't breathe.

664
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,443
So I had a question I wanted to ask you,
but I forgot it when he came.

665
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,903
- Oh, because of him?
- Yeah.

666
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,906
It was on the tip of my tongue.

667
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,954
Anyway, if we get a chance,
let's go there.

668
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,623
- So we can really talk.
- To Paradise?

669
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,083
Sure, I'd really like that.

670
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,300
What's so funny?

671
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,426
No, it's…

672
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,472
It's been a really long time
since I felt this way.

673
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,723
[Go-eun] Mmm.

674
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,019
[Hyeon-woo] <i>My heart</i>
<i>couldn't control itself.</i>

675
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:27,106
<i>It just kept on racing, the way she was</i>
<i>looking into my eyes and smiling at me.</i>

676
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,567
I couldn't think straight.

677
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,404
It was amazing. Yeah, it was amazing.

678
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,242
- This guy's completely lost his mind.
- He has.

679
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,453
It originally felt like
Sung Min and Go-eun

680
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,455
were the closest out of all of them
so far.

681
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,373
But after today,
since the camp fire,

682
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:48,044
a clear love triangle has formed
between Hyeon-woo, Sung-min and Go-eun.

683
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,384
[Hyeon-woo] I can finally breathe.

684
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,304
Oh, yeah? You feel like
you can breathe better now?

685
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,931
- Yeah.
- Lucky you.

686
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,475
[Hyeon-woo] Let's slow down.
No point getting exhausted.

687
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,476
[Min-gee] Sure.

688
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,562
Did you sleep well?

689
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,606
[Hyeon-woo] No, kept waking up early
this morning.

690
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,566
I opened my eyes
and looked at the alarm clock.

691
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,027
- Really?
- It was 4:54.

692
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,071
Then 6:07.

693
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,452
So, yeah.
Because my heart kept on fluttering.

694
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,956
I couldn't sleep. Yeah, I really couldn't.

695
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,542
I just kept on waking up
throughout the night.

696
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,377
I kept waking up every so often.

697
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,796
The second time it happened,
I remembered

698
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,257
<i>in my half asleep state</i>
<i>what it was about Go-eun</i>

699
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,925
<i>that got me so intrigued about her.</i>

700
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,010
<i>I wanted to make sure I never forgot it,</i>

701
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,512
<i>so I wrote it down.</i>

702
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,849
For someone to wake up in the middle
of night to write that, that's true love.

703
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,560
- [Hanhae] Yeah.
- Seriously, this is love.

704
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,356
[Mina Sue] Yesterday,
I had a lot of conversations.

705
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,650
I actually had a chat
with Seung-il that went well.

706
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:56,445
And then I went to go see Su-been
and have a chat with him.

707
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:00,032
But I found him in the guy's makeup room
already talking with Hee-sun.

708
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,660
- Oh, really?
- So it was a bit like, "Oh, okay,"

709
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:06,247
because that's what I was struggling with
in the first place, you know.

710
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,292
Because when Su-been went
to hang out with Hee-sun,

711
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,086
I naturally assumed
he was no longer interested in me.

712
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,047
But since we made plans to talk
in the makeup room anyway,

713
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,216
I went and explained everything to him.

714
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,095
- The things that happened that evening--
- Yeah, it was definitely necessary.

715
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,723
Exactly. Fortunately, we cleared up
the misunderstanding.

716
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,975
- You cleared it up?
- And it was really nice.

717
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,730
And then we decided that
if after getting to know other people,

718
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,524
if he still likes me,
then we'll talk again.

719
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,692
Everyone's out there.

720
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,860
- [Mina Sue] Oh, really?
- Yeah.

721
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,279
[Mina Sue] Shall we go out there
and join them then?

722
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,406
Good morning.

723
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,657
Good morning.

724
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,534
Good morning.

725
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,869
[Mina Sue] Good morning.

726
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,162
Did everyone sleep well?

727
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,831
I hope so.

728
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,999
Hello.

729
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,709
Good morning.

730
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,005
Did you sleep well?

731
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,757
[Joo-young] Yeah, I did. Did you?

732
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,849
[Sung-Min] Let's go one by one.

733
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,811
- [Go-eun] Hello.
- [Min-gee] Hello.

734
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,396
[Sung-Min] Did you sleep well?

735
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,940
[Seung-il] Do I look fancy?

736
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,945
[Kyuhyun] Oh!

737
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,197
Su-been's expression
has gotten really cold.

738
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,408
- [Hanhae] Doesn't wanna put up with her.
- Is that like being left on read?

739
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,660
- Yeah, it is.
- [Kyuhyun] Really?

740
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,827
That's what it's like.

741
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,828
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

742
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,256
What are you all up to?

743
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:43,761
Hello.

744
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,932
What's everyone doing?

745
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,183
What are you all up to?

746
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,936
How's my hoodie?

747
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,565
You seem to like wearing it.

748
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,323
[all exclaiming]

749
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,992
She's so jealous. Look at her.

750
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,535
[Hanhae] Yeah, she really is.

751
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,084
Oh.

752
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,670
Yeah, she was cold yesterday.

753
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,630
[Sung-Min] So you gave her your hoodie?

754
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,841
Oh, okay. I was just curious.

755
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,853
See? You should have done better,
Mina Sue.

756
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,023
I think it's kind of cute that her face
gives everything away like that.

757
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,816
Yeah, she can't hide her feelings.

758
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,194
[Ye-jin] Come on, let's eat.

759
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,115
- I'm actually really not good with knives.
- I've got it, then.

760
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,408
You sure?

761
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,452
I'm sure I can cut up some apples.

762
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,871
- [Jae-jin] Is that how you hold a knife?
- Yeah.

763
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,252
- You're good.
- Of course I am.

764
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,587
Can I get you anything?

765
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:04,383
Looks like you're working hard.
Did you bring this over here on purpose?

766
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,929
- Good idea.
- [Go-eun] In case it was too far.

767
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:09,930
Oh, I see.

768
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,226
- [Go-eun] Should I not have?
- [Ye-jin] What's what here?

769
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,645
Seems like enough.

770
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,733
- Six, eight, 10, 12.
- Go-eun.

771
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,610
- Go-eun.
- Twelve.

772
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,488
Thank you.

773
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,041
Is that everything then?

774
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,834
[chuckles]

775
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,294
Why is he being so awkward?

776
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,546
- It's cute.
- He's so smitten with her.

777
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,341
He thinks she might be watching him
when he's putting it down.

778
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,177
So he's just doing random stuff,
touching things for no reason.

779
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,762
Like, "What's going on here?"

780
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,515
- "Is the table all set?"
- [Da-hee] There's nothing there.

781
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,934
Touching things for absolutely no reason.

782
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,188
Is that everything then?

783
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,983
This is an absolute disaster.

784
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:03,984
It is.

785
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,197
- A disaster.
- [all laughing]

786
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,032
- He's so…
- He's so awkward.

787
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,826
- Yeah.
- What a genuine reaction.

788
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,536
It is. Poor guy.

789
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,496
I just didn't know what to do with myself.

790
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,165
I felt so awkward.
I just couldn't stop thinking to myself,

791
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,292
"What the heck is wrong with me?"

792
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:24,130
<i>I'm fully aware that I was acting weird</i>
<i>and cringing right in front of her.</i>

793
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,631
<i>I just couldn't stop myself.</i>

794
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,717
I was trying so hard to hide it
but then I caught her looking

795
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:32,388
and she smiled at me
and I was like, "Ugh. This is rough.

796
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,431
"This is so rough."

797
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,474
He knows it, too.

798
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,810
[Kyuhyun] Yeah, he's like,
"What's wrong with me?"

799
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,814
- [Kyuhyun] It's all over for him.
- Seriously.

800
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,858
- He's got it bad.
- She's his endgame.

801
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,902
- [Ye-jin] Bon appetit, everyone.
- [Jae-jin] Enjoy your meal.

802
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:47,903
[Min-gee] Bon appetit.

803
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,822
Don't take too much. They haven't had any.

804
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,408
- Yeah, seriously.
- [Seung-il] I'll head over later.

805
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,956
- [Hee-sun] Is it good?
- Is there no cereal left?

806
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,207
There's not any cereal.

807
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,710
- Do we not have enough?
- No. I don't think we have.

808
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,171
Do you like cereal?
You want to have some?

809
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,842
[Hee-sun] Do you like it?

810
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,260
Not particularly.

811
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,137
- Not particularly?
- Mmm-mmm.

812
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,681
I'll just have an apple.

813
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,516
I'll have one, too. Here, take one.

814
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,729
Thank you.

815
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,649
- Anyone not had cereal yet?
- [Hyun-jae] Would you like some of mine?

816
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,650
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

817
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,819
- Would you like some?
- [Su-been] I don't eat cereal.

818
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,362
I'm just gonna have an apple.

819
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,324
Enjoy your meal.

820
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,700
- Yeah, enjoy.
- Enjoy your meal.

821
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,701
Thank you.

822
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,329
[Seung-il] You drink milk, right?

823
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,622
[Jae-jin] That's plenty.

824
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,425
You feeling okay?

825
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,302
No, I think I'm a bit tired.

826
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,060
You can tell that a lot
has changed since yesterday.

827
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,896
The Truth Game has proven
to be crucially important.

828
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,439
A definitive turning point.

829
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,484
The resolute version of Su-been
that I imagined has emerged.

830
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,903
- [Jin-kyung] Yeah.
- Kind of like he's put up an iron wall

831
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:14,698
between himself and Mina Sue while being
incredibly caring toward Hee-sun.

832
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,452
What I want to know is
whether Su-been's behavior right now

833
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,789
is because there's some lingering
resentment toward Sue or not.

834
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,332
I really want to unpack that.

835
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,043
So do you mean it's not so much
that he likes Hee-sun

836
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,587
but more that he's trying to settle
the score with Mina Sue

837
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,090
because he's upset with her,
like petty revenge?

00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,635
- Choi…
- Choi Mina Sue.

1004
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,763
- Yeah, four characters.
- Mina Sue.

1005
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,015
- You can call me Mina.
- Oh.

1006
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,103
- Was it fun?
- Yeah, it was really fun.

1007
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,439
I've come straight from swimming, so…

1008
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:10,650
- My hat. It's pretty, right?
- It's pretty.

1009
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,568
Yeah.

1010
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,991
So what's your ideal type, then?
Like, your ideal girl?

1011
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,160
The kind of person you want to meet here?

1012
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,037
Well…

1013
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,248
- I like refined and demure women.
- Really?

1014
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,209
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

1015
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,795
But the ones I've dated seem to be
the complete opposite.

1016
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,671
There's someone here
who's refined and demure.

1017
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,925
First of all, it's not me.
I am not demure.

1018
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,635
Setting the record straight?

1019
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,847
Well, you're the one who said
your ideal type was refined and demure,

1020
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,351
and it's obvious that I'm not that,
suddenly putting a hat on and laughing.

1021
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,689
- You think you're not refined and demure?
- No, no, I'm not.

1022
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,942
- Oh, really? Then what are you like?
- Me?

1023
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:56,112
- Well, I think I'm cute.
- Oh, cute?

1024
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,407
- I'm cute and laid back.
- Okay, so what makes you cute?

1025
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,410
I don't know. I think having a personality
that's in contrast to my looks

1026
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,787
gives me a certain charm.

1027
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,540
I'm trying to smile
while you say these things to me,

1028
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,874
but the sun keeps blinding me.

1029
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,460
Oh, hang on. Would you like to wear this?

1030
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,004
- Yeah, can I for a while?
- Yes. Yeah, go ahead.

1031
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,050
- My eyes feel so much better now.
- But…

1032
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,302
- It doesn't suit me?
- You're not wearing it right.

1033
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,971
Come here, let me fix it for you.

1034
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,181
But I'm worried
about messing up your hair,

1035
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:26,101
- especially since it's your first day.
- Don't worry, it's already ruined.

1036
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:29,521
- Oh, really? Then this is a bit…
- But if I wear it like this…

1037
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,149
Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose
of wearing it?

1038
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,569
Yeah, you're right.
I think it's a bit small for you.

1039
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,530
Here, I'll just… Yeah.

1040
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,491
I gave it to you to make you laugh.

1041
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,662
Hang on, I-geon.

1042
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,540
We can't have any more guys
involved with Mina Sue.

1043
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,000
I don't think there's any attraction.

1044
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,793
I don't know.
I feel like he'll get hooked too.

1045
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,378
- Let's see what happens.
- Yeah.

1046
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,560
- Hello.
- So classy.

1047
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,103
So predictable.

1048
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,188
Look. I think he's wearing a tank top.

1049
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,316
- [Jin-young] <i>Is he?</i>
- [Kyuhyun] <i>Looks like a tank top.</i>

1050
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,317
[Hanhae] What'd I miss?

1051
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,110
- What a tank top.
- I mean…

1052
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,946
- Hello, hello.
- Hello.

1053
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,781
- I'm Lee Sung-hun.
- Oh, my name is Lee Ha-eun.

1054
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,491
- Yes, hello, hello.
- Hello.

1055
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:27,704
- So, did you just get here?
- Yeah, I did, actually.

1056
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,956
- I just arrived, and I have…
- You must feel so overwhelmed.

1057
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,752
- A little. You got a tan, huh?
- Oh, yeah, I have gotten a pretty tan.

1058
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,337
- Is it hot?
- Yeah, it's a lot hotter here

1059
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,547
than you'd think.
I take it seriously.

1060
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,091
Don't forget to spray your sunscreen.
Better safe than sorry.

1061
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,760
Yeah, I've already put a lot on, actually.

1062
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,261
Oh, really? Well done, then.

1063
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,513
Up top.
If you don't, you'll end up like me.

1064
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,682
- You ended up like this 'cause you did it?
- Yeah.

1065
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,393
- You don't speak English, right?
- No, I don't.

1066
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,729
- Okay.
- Oh, wait. Do you speak English?

1067
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,273
- Yeah, I do.
- So cool.

1068
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,191
[laughs]

1069
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,235
Right, well, once we get to know
each other, I can…

1070
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,820
- Oh, later on?
- Yeah, later.

1071
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,324
JO I-GEON & HAM YE-JIN

1072
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,701
- We were so surprised about this.
- Why?

1073
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,412
Because you just appeared out of nowhere.

1074
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,831
So were you all able to see me
from over there?

1075
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,460
Just your silhouette. Are you nerv--

1076
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,629
- No, you don't look nervous at all.
- I am.

1077
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,923
- Really nervous.
- Well, you look very relaxed right now.

1078
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,841
- I'm really nervous.
- Really?

1079
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,011
Really, really.
You're the sunbae, so help me out here.

1080
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:29,057
Who, me?
And what can I possibly help you with?

1081
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,517
[laughs]

1082
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:35,146
What's your ideal type?
Oh, wait, actually, what's your name?

1083
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:39,359
[gasps] Oh, that's right. I'm Ham Ye-jin.

1084
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,903
- I'm Jo I-geon.
- Got it.

1085
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,114
I-geon. I-geon.

1086
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,075
- Yes, yeah.
- I-geon.

1087
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,160
Yeah, but you can call me Guns Akimbo.

1088
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,161
Ah. [laughs]

1089
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,039
JO I-GEON & LEE JOO-YOUNG

1090
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,917
- What's your ideal type?
- My ideal type?

1091
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,420
My ideal type…
Do you want to take a guess?

1092
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,757
Mmm, cute girls?

1093
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,426
Cute girls?
You mean cute and affectionate?

1094
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:07,429
Cute looking? Ah, interesting.

1095
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,889
Then tell me, what type do you think
you are, in your opinion?

1096
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,141
What do you think?

1097
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,393
- Um…
- First impression.

1098
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:18,732
- Just pretty. Yeah, you're pretty.
- But besides that…

1099
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,025
You're cute.

1100
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,484
Cute.

1101
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,237
- You're cute, but…
- I am cute, yeah.

1102
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,114
Yeah, you are.
I get the feeling that you're young.

1103
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,699
- You think so?
- Yeah, I think you're young.

1104
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,950
JO I-GEON & KIM GO-EUN

1105
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,327
Nice to meet you. You look really
comfortable sitting like that.

1106
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,164
Yeah, honestly,
this is really uncomfortable.

1107
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,332
I mean, it's just so slanted,
it's really hard to sit here.

1108
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,333
Uh-huh.

1109
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,586
[laughs]

1110
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,087
It's good for your core, I guess.

1111
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,090
Yeah, my core's getting
an intense workout right now.

1112
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,842
Looks like you're struggling already.

1113
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,055
- It's been tough.
- So tell me, what's your type?

1114
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,725
- You've said it six times now.
- Yeah.

1115
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,313
Well…

1116
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,858
Honestly, I just like pretty girls.

1117
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,861
But what's your type?

1118
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,907
A guy who's manly but warm, you know?

1119
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,242
A guy who's manly but warm?

1120
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,455
There's no sun here. It's so overcast.

1121
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,748
- No.
- But it feels really hot

1122
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,793
- because the humidity is so high.
- Oh, are you really hot?

1123
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,712
- Yeah, aren't you hot?
- I don't get hot easily.

1124
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:23,713
Mmm.

1125
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,883
- Oh, no.
- Or could it be because I'm embarrassed?

1126
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,094
- Are you really?
- Isn't my face really red right now?

1127
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,637
- No.
- Oh, it isn't?

1128
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,388
No, I didn't notice that at all.

1129
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,349
- Oh, really? That's a relief.
- Yeah.

1130
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,226
- Because I've been worrying about it.
- Oh, really?

1131
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,435
You don't need to worry.

1132
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,854
I've been worried this whole time
that you'd think I was feeling

1133
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,064
self-conscious in front of you.

1134
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,941
- You thought I'd get the wrong idea?
- Exactly.

1135
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,692
- I was making you shy?
- That would hurt my ego.

1136
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:45,985
Ah.

1137
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,822
- So you have a bit of an ego, then.
- Yeah, I have an ego.

1138
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,115
[chuckles]

1139
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:54,994
- Also, I think I might know you, actually.
- I think I know you, too.

1140
00:56:56,287 --> 00:57:00,166
Ah, okay. What have I been doing
all this time then? Man.

1141
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:04,087
We do have some
mutual acquaintances, actually,

1142
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,464
so I've heard his name mentioned
a few times before,

1143
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:09,592
but this was honestly my first time
seeing him in person.

1144
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,971
Oh, so they have acquaintances in common.

1145
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,764
Oh.

1146
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:15,723
LEE HA-EUN & LIM SU-BEEN

1147
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,934
- What's your ideal type?
- I just like being with someone

1148
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:21,604
who's proactive and very funny.

1149
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,857
Oh, there's someone
who's really funny here.

1150
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,650
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1151
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,277
I look forward to it.

1152
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,696
I call him the funny man.

1153
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,699
- Yeah, I really like his sense of humor.
- Mmm.

1154
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,825
LEE HA-EUN & SHIN HYEON-WOO

1155
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:38,538
So I hear there's a funny man among you.
Someone really funny.

1156
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,082
Consider that a challenge
you have to beat while you're here.

1157
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,417
Oh, really?

1158
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,254
Are you funny?
In your opinion, would you say…

1159
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,882
I think I'm pretty funny.
Yeah, I'd say I'm really funny.

1160
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,508
- Are you the funny man?
- He's not funny.

1161
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,051
- Not at all.
- That's not Hyun-jae.

1162
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,596
She really cares about
who the funny man is.

1163
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,597
LEE HA-EUN & WOO SUNG-MIN

1164
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,015
I hear there's a funny man among you.

1165
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,683
- A funny man?
- Yeah, who could it be?

1166
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,768
- You'll know right away.
- Is it him?

1167
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,187
[laughs]

1168
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,735
- Here's the funny man.
- The real comedian's here.

1169
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,237
- Here's the master of comedy.
- Yeah.

1170
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,823
- He's hilarious. He always is.
- The more you see him,

1171
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,241
the more he grows on you.

1172
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:21,289
- Must be tiring.
- Must be tiring?

1173
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,749
Where did that come from?

1174
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,919
I assume you keep having
to introduce yourself.

1175
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,087
Wow, you know,
it's funny that you mention that.

1176
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,756
- Yeah?
- Because there's a line everyone uses

1177
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,007
as soon as they get here.

1178
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,302
Oh, then I guess you have to answer
the same way each time?

1179
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,095
- Yeah.
- You must have phoned it in eventually.

1180
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,263
- No.
- No?

1181
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,306
- No.
- You enjoy it?

1182
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,517
- I do. I like meeting new people.
- What's your ideal type?

1183
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,185
[laughs]

1184
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,020
Okay, my ideal type.

1185
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:48,274
I would like someone who has
a similar sense of humor to me.

1186
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:52,028
- And I would like someone who is fun.
- Hmm.

1187
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,321
Someone fun.

1188
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,784
Well, if you want someone fun,
you're looking at him.

1189
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,661
[laughs]

1190
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,625
Is there anyone that
you're interested in right now?

1191
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:11,089
Me? Uh, there is someone here
who I think is the best fit for me.

1192
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:15,510
- Mmm, that sounds promising.
- There are some perks to being here.

1193
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,305
Situations you can't experience
anywhere else, like…

1194
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,724
- That's true.
- Dating multiple people at once.

1195
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,351
[laughs]

1196
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,520
- That's not morally acceptable.
- You're right, it's not.

1197
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,064
It does cause internal struggles.

1198
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,568
- You're really mesmerizing.
- I am?

1199
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,361
Kind of, yeah. I find myself…

1200
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,865
- Focusing on you like this.
- For real?

1201
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:41,411
- Because he's the master.
- I think he's got her hooked.

1202
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:51,004
[Master] <i>We will now begin matching</i>
<i>the couples together who will go on a date</i>

1203
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:55,091
<i>to Paradise with the newcomers</i>
<i>Lee Ha-eun and Jo I-geon.</i>

1204
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,096
Based off first impressions
in a single conversation.

1205
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,935
[Master] <i>First up, Jo I-geon.</i>

1206
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,688
<i>You may now go ahead and select</i>

1207
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,400
<i>the two girls you would like</i>
<i>to take to Paradise.</i>

1208
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,693
- Wow.
- Gosh.

1209
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,321
- This is just driving me insane.
- [Jae-jin] That's crazy.

1210
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:20,074
Two on one. That's outrageous.
How's two on one going to work?

1211
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,160
It's hard to imagine.

1212
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,664
- Should we take a guess?
- [Kyuhyun] Yeah, let's try and guess.

1213
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,791
I'm going to go with Go-eun and Joo-young.

1214
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,001
Oh, me too, honey.

1215
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,128
I definitely think it's going to be
one of the two.

1216
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,005
I'm absolutely sure of it.

1217
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,299
- Yep, Go-eun and Joo-young.
- [Jin-kyung] What about you?

1218
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,427
I think he'll choose Go-eun because
he's comfortable with her

1219
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,345
and maybe Mina Sue.

1220
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,889
- I kind of think it'll be Mina Sue too.
- Oh, really?

1221
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,892
Yeah, because he may claim that
he likes refined and demure girls,

1222
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,269
but you always end up dating the opposite.

1223
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,521
So there is a possibility.

1224
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:55,777
When he was talking about his ideal type,
he said firmly that he liked refined,

1225
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,987
demure, and feminine girls the most.

1226
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,740
- So he said then…
- I don't think it's me.

1227
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,909
He told me that I look exotic.

1228
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,537
The refined and demure ones
are you guys, I think.

1229
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,916
Apart from you and me,
everyone here is refined and demure.

1230
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,751
Every single person except for us.

1231
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,088
- Am I refined and demure?
- [Go-eun] Yeah, you are.

1232
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,299
I wouldn't say that my personality
is very demure, though.

1233
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,804
I definitely think Ye-jin will go.

1234
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,598
- I think it'll be her.
- I think Joo-young will go.

1235
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,933
- [Sung-min] Who?
- Joo-young.

1236
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,810
Yeah, Joo-young.

1237
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:29,977
[Sung-hun] Joo-young.

1238
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,689
I kind of think Mina will go.

1239
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,649
[Sung-hun] Mina?

1240
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:35,775
I mean, Mina Sue.

1241
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,447
The first girl I would like to go
to Paradise with is…

1242
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,828
[Master] <i>The first girl to be selected</i>
<i>by Jo I-geon is…</i>

1243
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,509
<i>Ham Ye-jin.</i>

1244
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:04,220
- [Joo-young] I knew it! I knew it!
- Oh!

1245
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,890
- Oh, wow, this could be…
- Refined and demure.

1246
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,517
- She really is his type.
- Refined and demure

1247
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,144
- is definitely Ye-jin.
- That's good for her.

1248
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,271
- It all worked out.
- Yeah, Ye-jin does really well

1249
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,106
- with first impressions.
- [Kyuhyun] Yeah.

1250
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:19,235
[Master] <i>Ham Ye-jin.</i>
<i>Ham Ye-jin, please make your way outside.</i>

1251
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,112
- [Min-gee] Knew it.
- [Ye-jin] No way.

1252
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,114
- Hope you have a good trip.
- [Min-gee] I knew it.

1253
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,034
Yes, Lady Ye-jin.

1254
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,494
Demure and refined…

1255
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,622
- [Joo-young] She is demure and pretty…
- [Mina Sue] …and pretty and feminine.

1256
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,475
I only got to have a five-minute
conversation with each of them

1257
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:51,809
before I had to pick.

1258
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,771
But based on first impressions,

1259
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:58,316
Ye-jin is definitely the closest
to my ideal type out of the six.

1260
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,360
- Who do you think's next?
- [Sung-min] Joo-young.

1261
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,820
- [Jae-jin] Joo-young?
- Yeah, for sure.

1262
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,071
Oh, then I'll just go with them.

1263
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,408
- [Seung-il] Just get on the chopper.
- [Sung-min] Jump in next to her.

1264
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,119
- [Hyun-jae] Take me, too.
- I think Go-eun could go, too.

1265
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,497
- [Hyun-jae] That would be better.
- [Seung-il] Hee-sun, as well.

1266
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,334
[Master] <i>The second girl to be selected</i>
<i>by Jo I-geon is…</i>

1267
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:20,922
[exclaims]

1268
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,008
<i>- Kim Go-eun.</i>
- Of course, as expected.

1269
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:27,386
<i>- Kim Go-eun, please make your way outside.</i>
- [Hee-sun] Just as we thought.

1270
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,889
- [Joo-young] Surprise, surprise.
- [Min-gee] I hope you have fun.

1271
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,933
- [Joo-young] See you later.
- [Mina Sue] See you later.

1272
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,142
[Master] <i>Kim Go-eun.</i>

1273
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,143
Whoa.

1274
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,312
[Master] <i>Kim Go-eun,</i>
<i>please make your way outside.</i>

1275
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:48,074
Because she's pretty.
I think she's pretty.

1276
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:51,452
She's pretty.

1277
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:56,749
Look, earlier he didn't mention to Go-eun
that he liked refined and demure girls.

1278
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,710
He told her that he liked pretty girls.
I think that's clearly the case.

1279
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,629
- Oh, you're right.
- Yeah.

1280
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:02,922
He just finds her pretty.

1281
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:04,841
Hello.

1282
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:12,640
- Oh, well, this feels good.
- [both laugh]

1283
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,688
Not too upset, Hyeon-woo?

1284
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,690
Well, there's nothing I can do about it.

1285
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:29,240
[Master] <i>Lee Ha-eun, please go ahead</i>

1286
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:32,451
<i>and select the two guys</i>
<i>you would like to take to Paradise.</i>

1287
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,580
I'm dying to know who will go.

1288
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,583
I'm just hoping that Su-been's not going.

1289
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,294
[person clapping]

1290
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,008
Look at Park Hee-sun.

1291
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:49,468
I just hope that Su-been's not going.

1292
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:58,769
But if he does, it is what it is.
But a girl can hope.

1293
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:07,069
- Yeah, I'm hoping…
- We know.

1294
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,072
- No, he can go.
- Oh, why?

1295
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:13,034
No, I feel the same way here.
He can go. Just leave.

1296
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,160
[Mina Sue] Get out of here.

1297
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,703
[Joo-young] That's really how you feel?

1298
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,163
No, come on. Don't be like that.

1299
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:19,957
I asked her if there was anyone memorable.

1300
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,125
[Sung-min] You asked her that?

1301
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,669
And she told me, yeah,
the one who speaks English.

1302
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:24,629
Oh, really?

1303
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:31,344
Let's try and guess the two gentlemen
Ha-eun will take to Paradise, shall we?

1304
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:36,265
Didn't she say funny man in English?
So I think it'll be Sung-hun.

1305
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,600
- [Kyuhyun] Right.
- And Jae-jin.

1306
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:40,519
- I think it's those two.
- I think Jae-jin is an absolute given.

1307
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,105
Because Ha-eun kept asking,
"Who's the funny one here?

1308
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,400
- Who's the funny guy?"
- She was really focusing on him.

1309
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,737
- Jae-jin's an absolute guarantee.
- Come on, Sung-hun.

1310
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,323
I'm dying to know what kind
of a person Sung-hun is.

1311
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:54,367
- I don't know anything about Sung-hun.
- Right, right.

1312
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,368
I really want to know.

1313
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,956
Wait, guys, let's think about who makes
a good first impression.

1314
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,874
- Be honest.
- Our first impressions?

1315
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,043
Seung-il makes a good first impression.

1316
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,464
Honestly, he does.

1317
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:10,925
- [laughs]
- I'm scared.

1318
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,718
I'm going to step out for a moment.

1319
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:17,098
- Oh, no, no, no. No.
- [Mina Sue] His first impression is…

1320
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:19,308
- You really think he does?
- [Mina Sue] Solely based on that.

1321
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,311
Jae-jin and Su-been as well.

1322
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:25,022
Su-been's first impression
isn't the best either.

1323
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,692
It's more like as you get to know him,
he gets better,

1324
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,944
- once you talk to him.
- [Joo-young] Once you get to know him.

1325
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:32,446
- Really? I like this first impression.
- [Joo-young] Yeah, totally.

1326
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:35,491
Really? Oh, I liked him more
once I talked to him

1327
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:36,993
and got to know him better.

1328
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,369
[Min-gee] I said "You're so manly."

1329
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:43,749
The first guy I would like to go
to Paradise with is…

1330
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:53,134
[Master] <i>The first guy to be selected</i>
<i>by Lee Ha-eun is…</i>

1331
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:58,889
<i>- Woo Sung-min. Woo Sung-min.</i>
- Me?

1332
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,057
Me?

1333
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,517
[all exclaim in surprise]

1334
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,646
- He's like the prince of Paradise.
- This is seriously…

1335
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,606
[Master] <i>Please make your way outside.</i>

1336
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:11,986
That's crazy.
This is his third time in a row.

1337
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:16,032
He just has that look to him, you know?
It gets him into Paradise every time.

1338
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,617
That's cool.

1339
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,494
There's something fishy going on here.

1340
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:22,621
How do you do it?

1341
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:25,332
- [Hyun-jae] Unbelievable.
- [Sung-hun] See you later.

1342
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,420
- See you tomorrow.
- The conversation with Sung-min

1343
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:32,173
just felt like it had the best vibe
because we found out that we had

1344
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:33,340
a lot in common.

1345
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:34,675
Is there any food you don't eat?

1346
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,635
Oh, well, I actually
don't eat sushi at all.

1347
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,262
Oh, I don't eat seafood.

1348
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,600
Nice. I also think inner strength
is really important.

1349
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,518
- Like, seriously.
- I like someone who is passionate

1350
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,519
about their work.

1351
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,064
This is crazy. Me too.

1352
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:50,399
Oh, they seem to have a lot in common.

1353
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:54,361
Sung-min seems to be good at holding
a conversation in an awkward situation.

1354
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:01,827
The second guy I would like
to take to Paradise is…

1355
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,123
Seung-il's not going today
unless he flirted with her.

1356
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:08,375
I hope he didn't flirt with her.

1357
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:13,130
It could be Su-been, right?
Don't you think they're a bit similar?

1358
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,468
I hate it.

1359
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,763
But I think he's going.

1360
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,934
[Master] <i>The second guy to be selected</i>
<i>by Lee Ha-eun is…</i>

1361
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,025
<i>Kim Jae-jin.</i>

1362
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:36,278
<i>Kim Jae-jin, please make your way outside.</i>

1363
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:39,949
- Wow, these two.
- [Sung-hun] I mean, what's your secret?

1364
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:43,452
These guys have irresistible charm, right?
Man, seriously.

1365
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,704
Why is it always…

1366
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,791
Oh my gosh, this is crazy.

1367
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,627
They have a Paradise membership.

1368
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,838
These two really nail it when
it comes to first impressions.

1369
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,381
I know, these two.

1370
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:59,426
I chose him because Jae-jin's
one of the guys who intrigued me the most.

1371
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:03,639
Honestly, because I can't figure him out.
I can't figure him out at all.

1372
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:07,518
And there's just something about him
that draws you in wanting more.

1373
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,326
[both laugh]

1374
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,413
Wait, there's been a mistake.

1375
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,500
[laughs]

1376
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:34,587
This is so funny.

1377
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,048
[hums]

1378
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,133
[Ha-eun] Hello.

1379
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,261
- [Sung-min] Hello.
- Hey.

1380
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,432
You okay? How you feeling?

1381
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:52,563
Well, you know,
it doesn't feel great, to be honest.

1382
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:56,567
Not gonna lie, I'd be really annoyed
if it were me. Honestly.

1383
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:57,484
[Joo-young] For sure.

1384
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:01,030
Oh, I'm so happy.

1385
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,450
This is your time.

1386
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,493
This really is my day, huh?

1387
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,956
- Guess this is Paradise.
- Feels like Paradise to me.

1388
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,252
Today really is my day.

1389
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,964
- Hyun-jae's in Paradise.
- This is really great for him.

1390
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,341
[Hanhae] This is amazing, yeah.

1391
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,718
Hyun-jae really needs to lock in now.
It's time.

1392
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:25,054
- [Da-hee] That's right.
- Also, I'm extremely curious to see

1393
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:28,015
if Mina Sue will be working her magic
on Su-been today.

1394
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:29,683
I'm so interested to see
how that would go.

1395
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,854
Will she keep trying?

1396
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,023
Will she be faced with Su-been's
iron wall,

1397
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:39,068
or will Su-been eventually just
give in to her charm?

1398
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:40,819
- Ah.
- That's the question.

1399
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,989
But I don't think Hee-sun will just
sit back and watch anymore.

1400
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,201
I think she's going to fight for herself
or be more proactive,

1401
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:48,869
now that she has a sense of how he feels.

1402
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,288
- She has to fight for this.
- [Jin-young] For the guy she wants.

1403
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:57,169
PARADISE
JO I-GEON & KIM GO-EUN

1404
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,147
Hello.

1405
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,483
Hello.

1406
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,279
- Good to see you.
- You too.

1407
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,620
- Looks good, right?
- Yeah.

1408
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,791
When did you last eat then?

1409
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,337
I don't remember exactly.
I think it was around 12:00.

1410
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,341
Go ahead.

1411
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,475
- Um, what would you like first?
- Sorry?

1412
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,186
- What will you start with?
- This one?

1413
01:11:58,105 --> 01:11:59,106
- Go for it.
- All right.

1414
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:00,774
- It's closer to you.
- Okay.

1415
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:03,902
This is funny.

1416
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,489
- Shall we? Yeah.
- Bon appetit.

1417
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:11,952
Is that good?

1418
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:16,373
Mmm.

1419
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,086
- Is it good?
- It's chewy.

1420
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,129
It's…

1421
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,717
You're very blunt, aren't you?

1422
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:37,811
Okay, so here, we're, uh, allowed
to reveal our age and job.

1423
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:38,812
- That's right.
- Right?

1424
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:42,149
- Yep.
- So, how do you know me exactly?

1425
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:43,609
What have you heard about me?

1426
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:47,112
Uh, through a mutual acquaintance.

1427
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:51,658
- Who though?
- Well, how do you know me?

1428
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,578
- Through a mutual acquaintance.
- Right.

1429
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:58,665
- Oh, that asshole?
- Gosh. [laughs]

1430
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:01,877
- Ah, I-geon.
- [Jin-young] Ah, I-geon.

1431
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,296
- That word choice was a bit…
- Saying asshole.

1432
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,132
- [Kyuhyun] Yeah, saying that is just…
- On a first date, it's a bit…

1433
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,802
- Oh, that asshole?
- [laughs]

1434
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:18,102
But you know, if you really like someone
and they say something like that,

1435
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:20,646
you might find it humorous
and be fine with it.

1436
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:23,357
- And that's totally okay.
- It shows his composure and that

1437
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,692
he's not self-conscious
in front of a camera,

1438
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:28,070
- which could make him more attractive.
- [Da-hee]That's true.

1439
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:35,077
You know, I've actually watched
one of your shows before.

1440
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,330
- You have?
- Yeah.

1441
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:40,749
And I've really enjoyed it.

1442
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,422
[I-geon] <i>I am a professional actor.</i>

1443
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:51,510
<i>I officially made my television debut</i>

JO I-GEON
ACTOR

1449
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:13,991
So how old are you?
I don't actually know your age.

1450
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,744
- I was born in '92.
- Really?

1451
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:19,913
Mmm.

1452
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,499
You're actually older
than I thought you'd be.

1453
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,168
How old are you?

1454
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,505
- I was born in 2000.
- What?

1455
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,007
- Were you really?
- Yeah.

1456
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:30,924
Oh.

1457
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:33,594
Mmm.

1458
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:36,430
- You're still very young.
- Yeah.

1459
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:37,890
Did you not think I was?

1460
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:43,312
- So what's your view on age gaps then?
- It's not important.

1461
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,066
[both laugh]

1462
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:51,403
- I think you're the eldest guy here.
- Mmm.

1463
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,530
Well, you've seen all the girls now.

1464
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:56,533
- Yeah.
- What did you think?

1465
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:01,455
Well, that was my first time meeting six
of the most beautiful girls in a row,

1466
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:03,582
it was nice.

1467
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,545
So why did you choose me?

1468
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,757
Mmm.

1469
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:24,978
Honestly, I just found you the most
attractive, but I guess I need to explain

1470
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,481
why I found you the most
attractive, right?

1471
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:29,858
- Or no?
- No, you don't have to

1472
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:30,817
if it's too difficult.

1473
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,654
- I think it's just a feeling.
- Mmm.

1474
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:40,953
- I didn't think you were going to pick me.
- Really?

1475
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:42,746
You had no idea at all?

1476
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:47,417
No. Because I had heard from the others
that your type is refined and demure.

1477
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,670
Oh, okay, I see.
And you thought that's not you?

1478
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:52,297
Exactly. I thought,
"Guess it won't be me then."

1479
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:58,220
You're very… calm and collected.

1480
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:01,723
- Yeah. Is this how you usually are?
- Yeah, it is.

1481
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,434
- Yeah?
- That's how you seem, at least.

1482
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:07,354
But I can be livelier
and more excited too.

1483
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:08,564
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1484
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,315
Hmm.

1485
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:14,403
I'm just a little bit nervous right now.

1486
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,907
You're nervous?

1487
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:25,247
- It would be hard not to be nervous.
- Yeah?

1488
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:27,124
So this is you nervous?

1489
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,961
I think I'm a bit more reserved
whenever I'm nervous.

1490
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:32,254
Oh, really?

1491
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,552
So, I'm gonna be honest with you.

1492
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:41,096
Your personality is really close
to my ideal type.

1493
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:44,808
Like, what I've always had in mind.
Someone who is very calm,

1494
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:47,978
very collected, and restrained.
I would say that's it, yeah.

1495
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:50,522
For sure.

1496
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:55,193
[chuckles]

1497
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,452
Can I ask as well?
Why did you pick Ye-jin?

1498
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:09,041
Ye-jin is, I would say,

1499
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:14,212
she's kind of like my usual ideal type
that I go after.

1500
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,130
Oh.

1501
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,636
While you, on the other hand,
are more like the girls

1502
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,180
that I've been attracted to in the past.

1503
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:25,599
- You know what I mean?
- Oh. Mmm-hmm.

1504
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:27,225
Mmm.

1505
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,286
Would you say I'm similar
to the girls you've dated so far,

1506
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,454
appearance-wise?

1507
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:51,041
Whoa, you're really hot.
I'm being serious.

1508
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,418
[laughs]

1509
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:59,216
I used to go for hot girls.
I'd chase after them in the past, yeah.

1510
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:07,683
I really had no idea that Go-eun
was so demure, calm, and collected.

1511
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,309
I honestly didn't have a clue.

1512
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,395
Just based on her appearance,
she doesn't look cat-like.

1513
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:13,313
She has a fox vibe because
she looks a bit cat-like.

1514
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:14,648
I thought the claws would come out.

1515
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:15,691
That's the vibe she gives.

1516
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:17,651
But sitting like that with her hair tied
back neatly.

1517
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,027
- She's calm and collected.
- Totally.

1518
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:21,446
And she really looks like
a woman in love right now.

1519
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,240
- I mean, just look at those eyes.
- Yeah.

1520
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:31,748
But your personality is totally different
from what I expected it would be.

1521
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:34,126
Me? In what way exactly?

1522
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,129
You look hot, but you're very modest.

1523
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:42,050
I think this is the first time
anyone here has called me hot.

1524
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:46,680
[both laugh]

1525
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:49,891
- Yeah, you're extremely hot.
- Thank you.

1526
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:53,979
You should brag about it to everyone.
Like, "I'm hot, right?"

1527
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,689
- I can't do that.
- I bet they'll all agree.

1528
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:58,859
- Can you do it for me?
- What should I say?

1529
01:18:58,942 --> 01:18:59,943
She's so hot, right?

1530
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:03,947
- I think she's pretty hot.
- [both laugh]

1531
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:09,619
Things like that really make me cringe.

1532
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,873
Would you say that you're a bit silly?

1533
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:17,085
Mmm, nah, I actually try not to goof
around too much.

1534
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:20,046
You just let it bubble up inside you?

1535
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,507
Because I kind of want to
come across as a cool guy.

1536
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:26,928
Seriously?
Why does every guy want to act cool?

1537
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:31,391
I saw you almost fall over earlier.
You were about to fall over like this.

1538
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,351
- When I was walking up?
- Yeah, yeah.

1539
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,731
[all exclaiming]

1540
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:42,652
- What did he just do?
- Oh, wait, he goes pretty cute.

1541
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,822
That's an old hip-hop move that used
to be all the rage, called the dab.

1542
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:46,740
- Dab.
- Dab.

1543
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:49,117
- Dab.
- Dab.

1544
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:50,869
[Kyuhyun] I-geon's so cute.

1545
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:54,956
[Joo-young] Oh, he almost fell.

1546
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,666
- [Min-gee] Slick.
- [laughs]

1547
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,962
Did anyone else see that besides you?

1548
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,297
[laughs]

1549
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:06,635
I tried so hard to look serious
as I was walking.

1550
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,512
- Why serious, though?
- Like…

1551
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,097
- Why did you walk in like that?
- Yes.

1552
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:14,392
I guess I wanted to look tough.

1553
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:17,270
Oh. [laughs]

1554
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:22,734
[Kyuhyun] They look so good together.

1555
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,237
[Jin-young] They do look
really good together, don't they?

1556
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:27,155
What's your dating style, then?

1557
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:32,369
- I'd say that I'm quite easygoing.
- Easygoing?

1558
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:34,955
That's so surprising.

1559
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:38,124
Because you look so hot.

1560
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:43,672
So you wouldn't complain
if you didn't hear back right away?

1561
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:48,426
I wouldn't say that it doesn't bother me,
but I try my best to be understanding.

1562
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:00,689
When it comes to archetypes,
I wish I were more like a fox.

1563
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:03,024
But I get told a lot that
I'm more like a bear.

1564
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,276
It's upsetting.

1565
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:09,990
That's so fascinating. The more we talk,
the more I'm surprised by you.

1566
01:21:10,073 --> 01:21:12,450
- You find me interesting?
- Yeah, you're very interesting.

1567
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:15,704
And the reason you're so interesting
to me is because your personality

1568
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:18,331
is so different from what
I originally expected.

1569
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:20,458
[giggles]

1570
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:28,341
- Am I funny?
- Mmm.

1571
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,552
Mmm.

1572
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:35,140
- Yeah, you're very charming.
- Yeah?

1573
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,349
Mmm.

1574
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:43,106
You're really different from
the other guys here.

1575
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:44,482
In what way?

1576
01:21:45,942 --> 01:21:50,238
The other guys
are all very soft and gentle.

1577
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:52,365
Cute and boyish.

1578
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:56,912
- Are they a bit stiff?
- Yeah, they can be a bit uptight.

1579
01:21:57,495 --> 01:21:59,289
I'd say that you're more…

1580
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:02,626
Like a wolf.

1581
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,381
- Is that a good thing?
- Of course it is.

1582
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:09,549
Is it really?

1583
01:22:11,968 --> 01:22:14,346
You definitely have
a completely different vibe.

1584
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,604
I'm gonna have to keep my eye on you.

1585
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:26,483
- Okay then.
- Yeah.

1586
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:33,490
- I'll keep my eye on you too.
- Okay.

1587
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:37,118
That way I'll be able to tell
if you're a fox or a bear.

1588
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:41,414
- Or whatever else you could be.
- Please tell me.

1589
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:44,668
Well, you might be neither
of them, you know?

1590
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:47,003
- You might be a fool.
- I could be a fool.

1591
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,089
- Possibly. Do you get that a lot?
- Yeah.

1592
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:51,925
Yeah, just a little bit, though.
I can see that being the case.

1593
01:22:52,008 --> 01:22:54,052
Yeah, I get called a fool pretty often.

1594
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:55,971
[both laugh]

1595
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:01,685
And I'm even more of a fool
when I'm in a relationship.

1596
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:06,564
- I don't have a problem with that. Mmm.
- Really? [laughs]

1597
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,246
- Wow.
- [Jin-young] Wow.

1598
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:24,708
I think this was the most romantic meal
in Paradise so far out of all the couples.

1599
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:26,960
Did you see the looks between them?

1600
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:29,462
This should be a standard question
when we first start dating.

1601
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:33,383
We should ask, what's your dating style?
Are you a fox, a bear, or a fool?

1602
01:23:33,466 --> 01:23:37,012
Those are the only three options.
Seriously, right?

1603
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:40,348
- Didn't they have great chemistry?
- Yeah, their chemistry was really good.

1604
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:43,226
And just from their gazes, I could tell
their hearts were fluttering too.

1605
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:45,937
- Totally. I got so immersed in it.
- It was like a movie.

1606
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,356
Watching this date made me think, ah,

1607
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,734
there really is someone meant
for you out there.

1608
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:53,695
I think this was the first time Go-eun
felt such a spark

1609
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:55,113
and was able to fully be herself.

1610
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:58,491
What makes her and I-geon such
a good match is that looks-wise,

1611
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:01,119
she's the hot girl type
he's always gone for,

1612
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,204
but her personality
and behavior are so demure.

1613
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:04,998
It's different enough
to make him interested.

1614
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:06,624
- That's right.
- It seems like she has both.

1615
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:07,542
So true.

1616
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:10,503
She's different than when
she's with Hyeon-woo or Sung-min.

1617
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:18,887
[upbeat music playing]

1618
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:27,687
Wow.

1619
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:32,734
It's pretty.

1620
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:38,198
[Go-eun] Yeah, it's pretty here.

1621
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:49,250
What did you say
your ideal type was again?

1622
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,419
I'm so sorry. I was so out of it earlier.

1623
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:53,088
Oh, no, it's totally fine.

1624
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:56,841
- I like someone who's warm but manly.
- Ah, that's right.

1625
01:24:58,134 --> 01:25:02,097
Okay, and by warm do you mean,
like, for example, um…

1626
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,431
What could you mean by that?

1627
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:07,852
Maybe, well, is it a guy going buckle up
and helping you like this?

1628
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,355
- Um, no, not that exactly.
- Oh.

1629
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,775
There's just an inherent warmth
that comes through,

1630
01:25:13,858 --> 01:25:15,193
like, in the way they speak.

1631
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:17,612
Oh, really?

1632
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:19,614
Some kind of warmth.

1633
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,243
And I kind of pay a lot
of attention to hands.

1634
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:25,161
- Hmm? Hands?
- Hands.

1635
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:26,913
- Yeah.
- What about the hands?

1636
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:29,624
- Like in what way?
- Because I have large hands.

1637
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:32,460
- What should they look like?
- I like manly hands.

1638
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,420
- I don't like pretty hands.
- Ah.

1639
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,506
Yeah, kind of…

1640
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:43,429
- Are mine rough?
- They're rough. [laughs]

1641
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:47,392
- Rustic, right?
- Very rustic.

1642
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,981
My hands are just really long
and they're so large.

1643
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:56,192
Do this, this way.
No, show me the back of your hands.

1644
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:57,485
Wow, yours are…

1645
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,948
They're pretty.
And yeah, they're very long.

1646
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:04,033
- They are.
- They're really long.

1647
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:09,539
You're just long all over, aren't you?
You've got nice long legs, long arms.

1648
01:26:09,622 --> 01:26:11,749
- Yeah, my arms are long too.
- So is your neck.

1649
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,460
Is it really? Well, um, I--

1650
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,087
You look the tallest out of all the girls.

1651
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,173
No, they're all 172, 173.

1652
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:21,801
Oh, you just look the tallest to me.
But I guess I was mistaken.

1653
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:25,471
How could I have looked tall
compared to them?

1654
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:28,016
You look taller because your proportions
are so great.

1655
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:30,643
That's what you want to hear, right?
That's why you keep bringing it up?

1656
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:31,603
- For sure.
- I thought so.

1657
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,855
You should have led
with that from the start.

1658
01:26:33,938 --> 01:26:37,275
- I was debating whether I should or not.
- You should have said it sooner.

1659
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,986
- But I have a rebellious streak.
- Oh, right.

1660
01:26:40,069 --> 01:26:43,198
[both laugh]

1661
01:26:43,948 --> 01:26:44,782
Oh.

1662
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:49,579
But it's true, like…

1663
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,291
No, but seriously,
I'm being dead serious right now.

1664
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:55,126
I didn't realize it at first.

1665
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:58,129
- But the more we talk with each other…
- Yeah?

1666
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,466
- I look more like a fool?
- Uh-huh.

1667
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:06,304
Oh no, are you serious?
No, this is terrible.

1668
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,181
Actually, calling you a fool
was a bit harsh.

1669
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:10,350
I don't think you're a fool at all
in any way.

1670
01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:11,935
- How should--
- Change it to something else.

1671
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:14,854
Yeah, fool isn't quite right.
It doesn't describe you fully.

1672
01:27:15,438 --> 01:27:17,440
I need a word that's in between fool
and cute for you.

1673
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:19,609
- Oh, did you mean cute when you said fool?
- Yeah, for sure.

1674
01:27:19,692 --> 01:27:21,986
- There's cuteness mixed in.
- I didn't know that.

1675
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:27,742
I didn't realize you meant cute.
I thought I was just a fool.

1676
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:33,289
Seriously, the more we talk,
the more different you seem.

1677
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:35,541
- And the more I'm drawn in.
- Really?

1678
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,213
- In a good way, right?
- Definitely in a good way.

1679
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:42,257
For sure. Totally.

1680
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:47,136
And you're also more charming
when you're joking around.

1681
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:50,181
A little different from when we first met.
I like you better like that.

1682
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,683
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1683
01:27:55,561 --> 01:27:57,230
I'm really liking
how this is going, though.

1684
01:27:57,313 --> 01:27:59,774
Oh. Okay, okay.

1685
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:11,035
[Go-eun] I hope you have
a good conversation with Ye-jin, too.

1686
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:14,205
- [I-geon] Oh, Jinny?
- [Go-eun] Jin, jin. [laughs]

1687
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:19,961
Ah, well, I think Ye-jin might as well
just head on back to Inferno.

1688
01:28:20,044 --> 01:28:21,963
No, don't say that.
Ye-jin hasn't even had a chance.

1689
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,465
Yeah, but just look at these two.
They're really vibing.

1690
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:26,718
I don't think it could get any better
than this.

1691
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:30,263
Because you can tell that
he's so smitten with Go-eun now.

1692
01:28:30,346 --> 01:28:32,849
And Go-eun evidently likes him too.

1693
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:34,809
Yeah, I think he's totally hooked on
her already.

1694
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:38,229
They're so into each other right now.
There's just no room for anyone else.

1695
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,148
Really feels like we're flies
on the wall right now.

1696
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:41,858
- Yeah, that's so true.
- You never know.

1697
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:43,735
We have to wait and see.
Yes, let's keep watching.

1698
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:44,986
Will he be spending with Ye-jin?

1699
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:47,697
I'm sure Ye-jin has a few techniques
of her own that'll get him.

1700
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:50,158
- That's right.
- [Jin-young] Techniques? [laughs]

1701
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:55,121
INFERNO

1702
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:58,124
- [Mina Sue] Hi, single friends.
- [Joo-young] Hi.

1703
01:28:58,207 --> 01:28:59,459
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello.

1704
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:00,960
[Mina Sue] Another day of being single.

1705
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:03,296
[Joo-young] Of being single.

1706
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:07,884
- Were you hoping to go to Paradise, Mina?
- No.

1707
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,594
Oh.

1708
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:13,139
- What'd you think of her then?
- Tell us, how was the new girl?

1709
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:18,394
She looks like a pop idol.
You'll get it when you see her.

1710
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:20,646
- Oh.
- She really looks like one.

1711
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,440
- [Sung-hun] Cute.
- [Mina Sue] Cute?

1712
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:23,399
- Cute.
- [Joo-young] Okay.

1713
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:25,360
- [Sung-hun] Outgoing.
- Oh, don't you guys think

1714
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:30,114
that Mina Sue and the new girl
are kind of similar in a way?

1715
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:32,408
[Joo-young] You think so?
Are they similar?

1716
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:34,327
- [Min-gee] Is she cheerful?
- [Hyeon-woo] I think so

1717
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:37,830
- She's cheerful. Really happy.
- Personality-wise and…

1718
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:40,583
But in a slightly different way,
I think, yeah.

1719
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:44,128
Oh, so you think that
there's some overlap between us?

1720
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:45,880
She's very cheerful.

1721
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:48,508
There's like an effervescent quality
to her.

1722
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:50,968
I'm not just cheerful
all the time, you guys.

1723
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:54,180
It may seem that way since
there's a big group of us,

1724
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:57,350
- but I have a pretty serious side, right?
- [Hyun-jae] That's pretty true, actually.

1725
01:29:58,601 --> 01:30:03,064
- Why are you asking me?
- Whoa, wait, can we watch that again?

1726
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:05,858
- Why are you asking me?
- [all exclaiming]

1727
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:08,611
But I have a pretty serious side, right?

1728
01:30:10,446 --> 01:30:11,989
Why are you asking me?

1729
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:15,284
Because you're the only one here
who knows me well enough.

1730
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:16,911
[Su-been] Why are you asking me?

1731
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:20,206
Because you're the only one here
who knows me well enough.

1732
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:22,125
[Hyeon-woo] Uh-oh, mom didn't like that.

1733
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,918
[Min-gee] Like, you're just calling
her mom now?

1734
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,173
- [gasps]
- [Su-been] <i>Did you have a serious side?</i>

1735
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:32,426
Wow, Su-been's definitely
got a bold side, right?

1736
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:35,263
- He sure does. He's gentle but fun.
- Yeah, both at the same time.

1737
01:30:35,346 --> 01:30:36,764
Su-been's strong in a classy way.

1738
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:40,101
But wow, he's totally put up
an iron wall in front of her.

1739
01:30:42,061 --> 01:30:43,521
I wish they weren't coming back.

1740
01:30:44,438 --> 01:30:46,440
- Who?
- [Hyun-jae] Sorry?

1741
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:47,775
The ones who are in Paradise.

1742
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,903
- The ones over there.
- [Mina Sue] What? Why is that?

1743
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:54,240
- Because I'm just so happy.
- Why?

1744
01:30:54,907 --> 01:30:58,035
- Because Joo-young's here.
- Oh, what's wrong with you?

1745
01:30:58,119 --> 01:31:00,037
- Oh, what's wrong with you?
- Wow.

1746
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:03,207
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh.

1747
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:04,917
That was uncalled for.

1748
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:09,130
The flirting was just so obvious
that as a third party,

1749
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,757
I felt a little uncomfortable by it.

1750
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,385
How do you feel?

1751
01:31:14,927 --> 01:31:18,014
I actually liked it,
and I'm glad we'll get some time to talk.

1752
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:29,066
[groans]

1753
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,778
[Min-gee] How are you feeling, Mina Sue?
Are you upset?

1754
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:33,738
Mmm.

1755
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:40,119
There's a new person I'm curious about.
But just a little bit curious.

1756
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,830
- Oh.
- [Jin-kyung] Another?

1757
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:44,957
- What could it be?
- Okay, who is it this time?

1758
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:47,543
- I mean, that can happen.
- I'm on the edge of my seat.

1759
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:50,504
There's a new person I'm curious about.

1760
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:53,799
But just a little bit curious.

1761
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:57,011
- Seriously? But earlier you…
- Oh, I know.

1762
01:31:57,094 --> 01:31:58,554
Oh, you really can't make up your mind.

1763
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:00,223
When I'm here,
I don't know what happens…

1764
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:01,140
Who is it then?

1765
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:02,683
…my heart can't decide.
I'm being fickle.

1766
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:06,020
How come your heart keeps changing
like that? You're so easily swayed.

1767
01:32:06,103 --> 01:32:08,314
Come on. Come on, seriously?

1768
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:11,525
Hee-sun's permanently walking around
in Su-been's hoodie now.

1769
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:14,612
So am I just supposed to say,
"Aw, Su-been's so cute?"

1770
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:18,324
I mean, is that bullshit or what?
Come on, of course it's bullshit.

1771
01:32:18,407 --> 01:32:20,534
Don't you know who I am?
I'm Choi Mina Sue.

1772
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:22,620
- I'm not gonna take that.
- [Min-gee] You're not?

1773
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:25,331
No. I'm gonna get to know someone else.
Another one.

1774
01:32:25,414 --> 01:32:27,375
- [Min-gee] Just move down the line.
- Who though?

1775
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:30,711
The new person I'm super curious about
is Hyeon-woo.

1776
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:31,754
[Min-gee] Wow.
