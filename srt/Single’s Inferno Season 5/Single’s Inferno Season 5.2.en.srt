1
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,276
- Oh, my.
- What's going on?

2
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,403
We're getting new contestants now?

3
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,321
- What is this?
- What's going on?

4
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,240
What kind of format is this?

5
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,965
I guess we have another male contestant.

6
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,175
What?

7
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,134
Or maybe not.

8
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,689
<i>I thought, "This is mind-blowing."</i>

9
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,860
The show's full of twists and turns.

10
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,737
I appreciate it, though.

11
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,031
This means I have more options to explore.

12
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,868
<i>I thought, "That can't be."</i>

13
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,869
<i>But I was right.</i>

14
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,164
I was so startled
to see more people join us

15
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,459
and relieved to learn
I wasn't out of the game.

16
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,797
I'm relieved that we have new people.

17
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,681
<i>Hello, my name is Lim Su-been.</i>

18
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,811
I've never experienced
love at first sight.

19
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:46,356
I hoped to find someone
who would steal my heart instantly,

20
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,982
so I applied to be on the show.

21
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,443
Many have told me I'm mature.

22
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,488
I've often been told
that I have golden retriever energy.

23
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:57,075
I get told that I look sexy
when I work out.

24
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,579
- He's got a toned body.
- Hot damn.

25
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,289
- Insane!
- How are they so fit?

26
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,210
<i>I'm good with all kinds</i>
<i>of athletic activities.</i>

27
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,670
<i>I go to the gym every day,</i>

28
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,089
<i>and I also enjoy swimming</i>
<i>and playing baseball.</i>

29
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,385
My ideal type is a tall woman.

30
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,888
I'd like to meet someone
with the same allure as Ms. Lee Da-hee.

31
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,770
- Da-hee!
- Da-hee.

32
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,813
What's this?

33
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,773
Perhaps over a team dinner…

34
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,901
See? We need one.

35
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,737
- Let's do it.
- Let's fix a date.

36
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,739
- He picked you out right away.
- Da-hee.

37
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,867
He's playing a whole different game.

38
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:45,582
<i>I want to meet someone in Inferno</i>
<i>and make our relationship public.</i>

39
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,960
- He's good-looking.
- Doesn't he resemble Song Joong-ki?

40
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,628
- Yes, I can see that.
- Right?

41
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,630
- He's like a movie star.
- He's so fine.

42
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,843
- Hello.
- Hello.

43
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,802
Hello.

44
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,220
Hello.

45
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,878
<i>Su-been</i>

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,633
is pretty close to my ideal type,
when it comes to looks.

47
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,345
I'm not sure how to explain it.

48
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,098
I guess you could say I like what I see.

49
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,947
- Wait.
- There's another guy?

50
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,199
- We have seven men, then.
- Really?

51
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,784
This is wild.

52
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,953
- This is even better.
- They're all confused.

53
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,707
- I see another guy.
- It's a man again.

54
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,917
Yes, it's a guy again.

55
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,710
It's a man again.

56
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,212
What's going on?

57
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,546
Seven men…

58
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,388
<i>Hello, I'm Lee Sung-hun.</i>

59
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,140
I currently live in New York.

60
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,478
People tell me I sound cute
when I speak Korean.

61
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,648
I guess I come across as sharper
when I speak English

62
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,858
because I can express myself more clearly.

63
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:46,160
I think my warmth, competence,
and hidden charm are what attract people.

64
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,955
I'm the best in my field of expertise.

65
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,056
He feels so different.

66
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,599
He's so cool.

67
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,101
He's so unique.

68
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,523
- Hello.
- Hello.

69
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,607
Hello.

70
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,571
Hello.

71
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,287
Hello.

72
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,627
So, we only have two women.

73
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,467
- Did he just…
- He did say he was straightforward.

74
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,887
That's the worst way to break the ice.

75
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,307
- He could be serious.
- He's hilarious.

76
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,017
- It's a terrible line.
- Definitely.

77
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,477
"We only have two women."

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,020
He didn't mean anything bad.

79
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,105
- He's disappointed.
- But it's an awful line.

80
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,566
- He's disappointed.
- Disappointed, all right.

81
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,902
So, we only have two women.

82
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,488
Well, yes. For now.

83
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,490
Why are there only two?

84
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,619
- It's a woman.
- It is.

85
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,079
Here comes another woman.

86
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,707
I'm relieved.

87
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,834
If it were another man…

88
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,923
My gosh.

89
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,382
Come on, Sung-hun.

90
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,468
- He's hilarious.
- He's just awkward.

91
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,688
- Hello.
- Hello.

92
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,273
- Hello.
- Hello.

93
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,158
Hello.

94
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,246
<i>Hello, my name is Lee Joo-young.</i>

95
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,958
I've been popular
since the day I was born.

96
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,336
This isn't our first rodeo.

97
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,672
I swear our writers
didn't feed her that line.

98
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,258
- I guess she was a popular infant.
- "A popular infant."

99
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,553
When I was a teenager,
I was nicknamed the school's goddess.

100
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:12,431
I had guys fighting over me
in the men's room.

101
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,686
I'm often told I'm like a ray of sunshine.

102
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,399
I may look calm and elegant,
but I have a bubbly personality.

103
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,362
People often call me a smart cookie.

104
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:31,200
True to my nickname, I'll be smart
and find my love on <i>Single's Inferno.</i>

105
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,203
I love her dimples.

106
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,330
- She's striking.
- Yes.

107
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,471
Among the newcomers,

108
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,640
Joo-young had the most memorable
first impression.

109
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,851
She has such a bright smile,

110
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,686
and that stood out to me.

111
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,814
We won't get more contestants, right?

112
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,484
I see someone coming.

113
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,405
- There's more?
- More people?

114
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,866
She looks really tall.

115
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,747
<i>Hello, my name is Choi Mina Sue.</i>

116
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,834
I can be rather self-centered
in a relationship.

117
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,712
What can I say? I like myself the most.

118
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:29,091
I can't help but prioritize myself
even when I'm in a relationship.

119
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,594
I don't think that's a bad thing, though.

120
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:37,683
I'm not that big on all-out, fancy dates.

121
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,478
A date over chicken feet
sounds perfect to me.

122
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,482
In terms of physique,

123
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,361
I like guys with full lips
and broad shoulders.

124
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,614
I, too, have broad shoulders,
so I want a guy who can cuddle me.

125
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,118
I'm a ball of fire,

126
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,371
so I enjoy high-energy sports.

127
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,748
I especially love scuba diving.

128
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,459
It gives me peace of mind.

129
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,588
What is my resolve going in?

130
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,340
Are you all ready to fall for me?

131
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,388
She's so graceful.

132
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,056
- Totally.
- Yes.

133
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,933
- She's a charmer.
- She really is.

134
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,727
She'll put the other ladies on edge.

135
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,648
Hello.

136
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,278
Hello.

137
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,742
Hello.

138
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,748
Hello.

139
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,753
I'll take a seat here.

140
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,533
The smile on Hee-sun's face
has been wiped away.

141
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,951
- Gosh, Hee-sun.
- Finally.

142
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,411
- Oh, no.
- What do we do?

143
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,581
- She must feel threatened.
- She really is a strong contender.

144
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,671
Yellow looks great on you.

145
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,383
Really? I was rather worried
it might not look good on me.

146
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,764
What's your name?

147
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,184
I'm Choi Mina Sue.

148
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,144
- Four syllables.
- Choi Mina Sue? Okay.

149
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,562
I'm Lee Sung-hun.

150
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,578

00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,157
<i>Greetings, newly joined singles.</i>

165
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:49,375
<i>Today's Paradise-bound</i>
<i>couple matching is over.</i>

166
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,796
What does that mean?

167
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,632
- We did it earlier.
- Really?

168
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,009
I don't get it.

169
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,595
Does Mina Sue know?

170
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,973
- Mina…
- Mina…

171
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,935
"Does Mina Sue know?"

172
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,146
Goodness. He's too much.

173
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,607
Sung-hun is hilarious.

174
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,069
The four of you are the newcomers.

175
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,696
- Really?
- Yes.

176
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,576
- Have the others already left?
- Yes.

177
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,622
Oh, man. That must mean
we can't go to Paradise today.

178
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,540
Not today, no.

179
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,584
But I'm starving right now.

180
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,628
You can go tomorrow.

181
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,843
I didn't even get to see the others.

182
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,928
That was rather disappointing.

183
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,097
I look forward to seeing the others go,

184
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,057
"Hey, there's a new face."

185
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,934
I can't wait to see their reaction.

186
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,020
Did I sound overly confident?

187
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,564
Gosh, she's so gorgeous.

188
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,066
She has that natural grace.

189
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,984
- Yes.
- It's like…

190
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,652
- It's not forced.
- It's genuine.

191
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,070
She's hard to beat.

192
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,990
Today's Paradise-bound
couple matching is over.

193
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,867
- But we have four newcomers.
- Right.

194
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,244
The newcomers
have a whole new set of charms.

195
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,205
- They are no joke.
- I totally agree.

196
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,751
Out of the new contestants,
who do you think will be most popular?

197
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,337
Choi Mina Sue by a landslide.

198
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,338
- Same here.
- Right?

199
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,965
She's the type the guys will fall for.

200
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,468
She seems so sincere.

201
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,053
- Guileless, even.
- I agree.

202
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,430
She gives off a natural and fresh vibe.

203
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,640
I agree.

204
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,807
She has elegance.

205
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,808
- She does.
- Exactly.

206
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,019
She's got a face you'd never get bored of.

207
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,521
She's beautiful and elegant,

208
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,105
but I think younger men

209
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,816
may find it hard to approach her first.

210
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,944
- She has that aura.
- She does.

211
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,278
She has a certain vibe.

212
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,991
- As for Su-been, he's the serious type.
- Yes.

213
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,952
A guy like him is typically popular.

214
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,620
- He's Mr. Popular.
- Spot on.

215
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,665
Don't you find a guy like that
somewhat unapproachable?

216
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,334
I think the women
might feel that way about Su-been.

217
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,795
- What do you think about Su-been?
- Well…

218
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,839
I think it depends on
how he carries conversations.

219
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,008
Are you picturing yourself talking to him?

220
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,554
She's not joking.

221
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,222
I was being dead serious.

222
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,690
- It's dinner time.
- Okay, let's get it.

223
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,317
- I can't wait.
- I hope we'll get some rice.

224
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,361
- What if we get carrots again?
- Carrots?

225
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,612
I love carrots.

226
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,365
- We've had enough, haven't we?
- We did.

227
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,992
- You've already had some.
- Yes.

228
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,330
- What is it?
- I wonder what it is.

229
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,623
Hey, I'm getting chills.

230
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,166
Shall we open them?

231
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,585
- It's a map.
- A map.

232
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,587
What's this? A treasure hunt?

233
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,677
The canned food is in the pool.

234
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:48,971
This is seriously…

235
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,140
My gosh, in the pool?

236
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,434
- That's water.
- Water.

237
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,352
- I see chickens, too.
- Oh, for eggs?

238
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,938
- There are vegetables.
- We'll have to harvest them.

239
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,607
They have to work for their food.

240
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,693
- They have to go get it.
- They have to earn their food.

241
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,695
Do we have to go harvest food?

242
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,905
- Yes.
- I see.

243
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,239
Are you good at digging?

244
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,288
Then, can you two go harvest them?

245
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,582
You mean us?
Okay, we'll go get them, then.

246
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,459
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

247
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,755
How about we go collect the eggs?

248
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,089
I'll go get water, then.

249
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,050
Shouldn't we send two guys to get water?

250
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,134
I'll join you.

251
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,802
- Okay. Let's go together.
- Yes.

252
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,970
- Off we go.
- Let's go.

253
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,263
See you later.

254
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,181
Good luck.

255
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,515
Let's do this.

256
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,145
Which way do we go?

257
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:44,276
- So, you speak English?
- Yes, English is more comfortable for me.

258
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,740
- I can tell.
- What? No way. My Korean is excellent.

259
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,867
- Your Rs give you away.
- Really?

260
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,286
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

261
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,581
Hold on. Where are we going?

262
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,291
Is it that, over there?

263
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,796
KITCHEN GARDEN

264
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,218
What even is a kimchi garden?

265
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,928
"Kimchi garden."

266
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,305
- "Kimchi garden"?
- Is he actually from abroad?

267
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,848
Kimchi garden…

268
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,226
- It must be because of the cursive.
- Oh, sure.

269
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,813
- Shouldn't it be easier for him?
- Why would that give him any trouble?

270
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,359
Having someone here who speaks English

271
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,569
- makes me feel at ease.
- Same here.

272
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,864
Are you familiar with the Korean phrase
"subjective intimacy?"

273
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,492
- I'm not great with colloquialisms.
- Really? Well…

274
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,916
- Really?
- Of course.

275
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,216
- He has fallen in love.
- His gaze has gone lovey-dovey.

276
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,468
I think Sung-hun is quick to fall in love.

277
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,725
- What's your ideal type, by the way?
- My type?

278
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,353
- I have a question for you, actually.
- Ask away.

279
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,022
Are you okay with non-English speakers?

280
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,190
Actually, I find it a bit hard.

281
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,191
- Really?
- Yes.

282
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,111
- I'd be your only option, then.
- Honestly, it's difficult.

283
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,155
Oh, well…

284
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,072
I guess?

285
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,824
Or maybe not.

286
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,287
Look over there.

287
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,789
- I can see the chickens.
- Goodness.

288
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,253
CHICKEN COOP

289
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,469
- You can manage, right? I'll stand watch.
- What do you mean?

290
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,845
The eggs are inside.

291
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,638
What do we do?

292
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,223
- Can you do it?
- No way.

293
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,434
- Really?
- Can we actually go in?

294
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,062
- Don't you want eggs?
- Of course I do.

295
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,730
Why is everything so difficult?

296
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,775
- Gosh, their wings…
- They've come to greet us.

297
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,026
How many should we get?

298
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,570
- Two.
- Two?

299
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,030
Hey, guys.

300
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,865
Excuse me. Coming through.

301
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,576
What's the name of the guy
who walked into the coop?

302
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,286
- That's Seung-il.
- He's Seung-il.

303
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,996
- He's Seung-il?
- Your favorite.

304
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,748
- Oh, was he?
- Yes.

305
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,832
- "Was he?"
- I forgot.

306
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,792
He's an old fling.

307
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,627
- He's my ex.
- "My ex."

308
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,882
Hey, guys.

309
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,717
Excuse me. Coming through.

310
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,805
- They're not flying.
- Come on in. They don't fly.

311
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,849
Sorry, guys. Let me get these eggs.

312
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,103
Take one, Go-eun.

313
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,688
Are these all?

314
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,150
One, two, three, four, five. Let's go.

315
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,529
- I'll get going, guys.
- Thanks. We'll enjoy them. Sorry.

316
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,364
- Watch your steps.
- Got it.

317
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,076
They might follow us out. Oh, no.

318
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,994
No, wait.

319
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,538
Gosh, what do I do?

320
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,874
He's mischievous.

321
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,460
No, wait.

322
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,170
Gosh, what do I do?

323
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,465
What do we do?

324
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,844
What do we do? Get back in.

325
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,181
- Hey.
- Hold on.

326
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,517
Hey.

327
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,812
Come on. This way.

328
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,897
Hey.

329
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,858
There we go. Get in there.

330
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,442
- Come here.
- Follow her lead.

331
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,111
Great job.

332
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,573
- Oh, dear.
- You should've let me out, not the hen.

333
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,743
- Gosh.
- Easy-peasy.

334
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,331
What on earth?

335
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,751
- Are they pranking us?
- Seriously. What do we do?

336
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,924
Do we have to get that?

337
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,134
Wait, the food…

338
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,636
Are they actually in there?

339
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,892
I thought we'd find a small pond here.

340
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,894
- Me too.
- What's all this?

341
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,939
- Can you do it?
- I'll see what I can do.

342
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,191
CHALLENGE AREA

343
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,984
I'll stay here you can throw it.

344
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,613
- He might fall.
- What if he falls?

345
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,239
- It'd be humiliating.
- Exactly.

346
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,241
- It'd be a nightmare.
- Oh, no.

347
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,747
- I see Hee-sun's pair over there.
- Yes.

348
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,292
My gosh, he's actually doing it?

349
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,636
- Isn't that very challenging?
- You bet it is.

350
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,055
- How is he doing it?
- Showcase your charm.

351
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,644
- It looks like he'll fall.
- No, he'd never fall.

352
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,482
That's cool.

353
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,746
My gosh.

354
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,625
Gosh, it fell.

355
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,919
- Oh, dear.
- What now?

356
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:54,836
Poor guy.

357
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,467
He could've just shaken the rope
to drop the sack and collect it.

358
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,386
Yes, if it was going to fall anyway.

359
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,388
Gosh, it fell.

360
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,266
Hold on.

361
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,643
What do we do?

362
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,938
- We chose well.
- I would've dived in.

363
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,356
We've made a wise choice.

364
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,108
Hey, it's coming my way.

365
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:18,777
Come here.

366
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,905
Are you okay?

367
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,116
Are you okay?

368
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,033
Is it…

369
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,329
I mean,

370
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,873
he should've just gone in earlier.

371
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,294
Both the sack and Hyun-jae
ended up falling into the pond.

372
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,255
- It's a shame because he was so close.
- Yes, so close.

373
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,465
- It didn't even look cool.
- I know.

374
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,053
- Shall we start the fire, then?
- Sounds good.

375
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,558
- Be careful.
- That should get the fire going.

376
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,065
It looks like something's
going on between them.

377
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,275
- Right?
- You bet.

378
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,652
Is there anything going on between us?

379
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,323
- Nothing, don't you think?
- Really?

380
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,199
- There's nothing?
- But good vibes.

381
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,874
What can we make with potatoes?

382
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,960
- Can we just…
- I wonder what the food team will bring.

383
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,337
How's this?

384
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,256
We could stir-fry the potatoes.
What do you think?

385
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,508
- Good idea.
- Right?

386
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,426
In that case…

387
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,512
- I think that's <i>ssamjang.</i>
- We've got <i>ssamjang?</i>

388
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,099
- Do we have a strainer?
- You can find one over there.

389
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,309
In here.

390
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,811
- This one?
- I'll take that, Go-eun.

391
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,146
Pass me the washed potatoes.

392
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,439
- Got it.
- I'll peel them.

393
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,609
How can I help, Mina?

394
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,611
Let me think.

395
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:45,781
What else is left?

396
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,117
- Why don't I--
- Can you set the table?

397
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,369
- Set the table?
- No?

398
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,873
- She's sending him away.
- It means "Go over there."

399
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,000
"Go over there"?

400
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,753
I can do that later.

401
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:00,670
I'll do it then.

402
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,257
- Oh, no. I'll do it then.
- We can do it together.

403
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,759
Hey, that's a good idea.

404
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,681
I'm sorry, but what's your name?

405
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,767
- I'm Go-eun.
- Oh, you're Kim Go-eun?

406
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,268
- That's right.
- Okay.

407
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,190
- How was harvesting the potatoes?
- It wasn't bad, actually.

408
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,149
Really?

409
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,485
- Are you done with them?
- Yes, just a second.

410
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,948
We've made it back. Good work.

411
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,699
- You too.
- Are you okay?

412
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,742
- Yes
- Yes.

413
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,701
Are you sure?

414
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,453
I saw you doing something cool.

415
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,331
- This sack was up there--
- What's inside the sack?

416
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,458
- Canned tuna.
- The whole lot?

417
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,128
Then, let's mix the tuna with <i>gochujang.</i>

418
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,838
- For spicy tuna?
- For spicy tuna?

419
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,755
Sounds good.

420
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,133
What's it called…

421
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,592
- Do we have spatulas?
- Spatulas?

422
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,845
- Do we need some?
- They're inside, I think.

423
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,304
Where are they?

424
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,642
Do we have spatulas?

425
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,270
- A tool to mix stuff?
- To mix stuff?

426
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,439
- I'll wash one for you.
- Oh, here it is.

427
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,694
- Something like this?
- I think so.

428
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,663
Hee-sun is right next to Su-been.

429
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,957
- Remember what she said?
- That he's her type.

430
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,208
- She likes him.
- That's why.

431
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,751
I get it now.

432
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,879
How are you feeling?

433
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,506
- I'm a bit hungry.
- Right?

434
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,550
But I'll be fine once we eat.

435
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,846
- You must be hungry, too.
- Yes, I'm starving.

436
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,728
Thank you.

437
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,737
- Shall I pour it in?
- Yes.

438
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,155
- This is scary.
- Go ahead.

439
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,573
What are we having?

440
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,574
Scrambled eggs.

441
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,577
It wasn't hot enough,
but there's no going back.

442
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,163
- Hey, we're done for.
- No, we're not.

443
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,876
- We can wait a bit…
- Wait for it.

444
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,586
It's not over till it's over.

445
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,546
- Understood. Yes.
- Okay?

446
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,715
I'll cook it nicely.

447
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,678
Am I doing it right?

448
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,390
We'll probably get
a softer texture this way.

449
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,017
- I agree.
- It's cooking slowly.

450
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,352
Like an omelet, you know.

451
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,520
I think it'll taste amazing.

452
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,943
Was the yellow dress your first choice?

453
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,111
No, I actually had two options.

454
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,947
I wanted to wear white, actually.

455
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,076
If you think about it, only a few people
can pull off a yellow outfit.

456
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:36,993
Did I look okay?

457
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,537
All I could see was you.

458
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,705
- Really?
- Yes.

459
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,423
Seung-il and Jae-jin are so charming,
but in different ways.

460
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,926
- But both are--
- Jae-jin?

461
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:53,843
Yes.

462
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,679
Jae-jin wasn't even in the footage.

463
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,847
- You keep--
- They are her favorites.

464
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,266
She's comparing her favorites.

465
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,268
- That startled me.
- The way I see it,

466
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,478
Go-eun is interested in Seung-il.

467
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,854
Go-eun is into Seung-il?

468
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,940
Yes, remember how Seung-il and Mina Sue

469
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,652
tried their best to send
Go-eun and Sung-hun to set the table?

470
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,863
- But she kept returning to the sink.
- I see.

471
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,532
- To go back to Seung-il?
- Right.

472
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,118
- She did that?
- You've gotten so sharp.

473
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,454
- I'm amazed you caught that detail.
- I hope you're wrong, though.

474
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,414
How come?

475
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,959
I seriously hope it turns out
you misinterpreted things big time.

476
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,544
Because of her great track record?

477
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,630
- You're so confident.
- I'd like to see you get it wrong.

478
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,966
I'm hesitant
because I got everything wrong.

479
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,427
- Enjoy.
- Let's enjoy the meal.

480
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:36,845
Enjoy.

481
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,097
Thank you.

482
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,182
Thank you.

483
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,393
You're quick.

484
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,020
Okay. Then…

485
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,483
Dig in. You two can go ahead.

486
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,153
Take some.

487
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,738
Go ahead.

488
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,159
What happened to your hand?

489
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,120
- My gosh.
- What's wrong?

490
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,747
- When did you get hurt?
- I don't know.

491
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,457
Maybe when we got the water?

492
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,416
- I see.
- Oh, no.

493
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,751
- You're bleeding.
- It's nothing.

494
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,421
- It is a big deal.
- Not at all. Enjoy your meal.

495
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,015
Shouldn't we apply some salve now?

496
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,600
It's all right.

497
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,603
Would you like some potatoes?

498
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,562
Yes please.

499
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,363
Isn't it good?

500
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,741
- Can I have some potatoes too?
- Me too.

501
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,077
- Do we have some more left?
- Sure.

502
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,661
Potatoes saved the day.

503
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,829
- Here.
- Potatoes.

504
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:45,747
Thank you.

505
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,510
How's your hand?

506
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,764
- It's fine. Don't worry about it.
- Are you hurt?

507
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,891
I didn't realize, but yes.

508
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,351
Really?

509
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:18,029
- I'd say Go-eun is pretty into Hyeon-woo.
- Right, I think so too.

510
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,989
- I think she's just playing the game.
- Pardon?

511
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,408
- She's leading him on.
- Really?

512
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,993
- Are you set on going against me?
- What? No.

513
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,662
I just think she's baiting him.

514
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,746
At first,

515
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,042
Go-eun seemed the type
to enchant all the guys.

516
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,378
- I thought so, too.
- I don't think it'll work.

517
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,213
It won't go according to her plans?

518
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,678
- I wish we had time to talk with them.
- Totally.

519
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,972
We've only had group activities so far.

520
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:44,889
Yes.

521
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,809
What do you look for in a man?

522
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,687
I like manly guys,

523
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,066
but I want them to have
a cute side and composure.

524
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,526
What about you, Go-eun?

525
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,944
I'm into left-handed guys.

526
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,112
- Why?
- Really?

527
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,490
I don't know why,
but they always get me interested.

528
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,701
That's interesting.

529
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,287
We actually have a lefty.

530
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,206
She must've noticed.

531
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,250
- Could it be Hyeon-woo?
- How did she…

532
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,711
- Did you see one earlier?
- Yes.

533
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,212
Who is the lefty?

534
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,256
Hyeon-woo is left-handed.

535
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,764
- See? That explains things.
- Yes.

536
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,975
- That's why she felt drawn to him.
- I'm surprised she saw that.

537
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,355
<i>You'll now choose the person</i>
<i>you are interested in.</i>

538
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,273
What?

539
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,153
What do we do?

540
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,781
- My gosh.
- I've got goose bumps.

541
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,326
<i>Please find a postcard in your lodging</i>

542
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,412
<i>and write a candid note</i>
<i>to the person you're interested in.</i>

543
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,542
<i>Then, slide the card into the mailbox</i>
<i>with their name on it.</i>

544
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,005
It's the moment of truth.

545
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:02,008
Let's make predictions
about who'd write to whom.

546
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,302
I think Mina Sue
will receive multiple cards.

547
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,470
- Me too.
- Same here.

548
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,808
I think Seung-il
is definitely interested in Mina Sue.

549
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,644
- The same goes for Sung-hun.
- Exactly.

550
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,522
But I don't think Mina Sue
is that into Sung-hun.

551
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,439
- Agreed.
- Really?

552
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,149
- She's not interested.
- Right.

553
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,860
If she liked him,
she wouldn't have sent him away.

554
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:25,156
In Hee-sun's case,
she's practically smitten with Su-been.

555
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,367
- I saw her tend to him over the meal.
- Yes.

556
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,120
- Hee-sun and Su-been.
- But Su-been hasn't shown any interest.

557
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,831
- Right.
- I'm not sure about him.

558
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,626
MEN'S MAILBOXES

559
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,970
That guy's hilarious.
What's his name again?

560
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:47,887
Sam…

561
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,514
He's really funny.

562
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,892
Even when I don't want to laugh,
he makes me burst into laughter.

563
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,435
Something happened.

564
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,145
- He made her laugh.
- I think so.

565
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,731
- Sung-hun has his charms.
- With his sense of humor.

566
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,375
LEE SUNG-HUN: 0 VOTES

567
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,295
- She got our hopes up for nothing.
- Seriously.

568
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,088
Poor guy.

569
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:30,847
Things are rough.

570
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,474
- Are you putting on an act?
- Sorry?

571
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,727
- You're acting, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

572
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,896
- Did you receive five cards?
- No way.

573
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,231
- You're acting out of pity for us.
- Never.

574
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,401
It's tough here in Inferno.

575
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,195
<i>I didn't get any postcards.</i>

576
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,083
<i>It's Su-been.</i>

577
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,712
<i>- He'll get one vote at least.</i>
<i>- That's guaranteed.</i>

578
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:06,883
<i>- He's got one.</i>
<i>- He does.</i>

579
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,845
<i>"You're my ideal type."</i>

580
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,389
<i>How cute is that?</i>

581
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,433
I'LL START A CONVERSATION!
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT

582
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,769
- You can tell who wrote it from the tone.
- Yes.

583
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,439
LIM SU-BEEN: 1 VOTE

584
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,901
<i>It said that I was her ideal type.</i>

585
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,739
I think Hee-sun wrote it.

586
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:35,703
<i>I could be wrong, but it felt like</i>
<i>she was glancing my way.</i>

587
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,997
- I'm a bit hungry.
- Right?

588
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,042
- It'd be hard to not notice.
- I know.

589
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,128
- He's shameless for playing dumb.
- She's merely inches away.

590
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,505
Gosh, you startled me.

591
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,593
- She was like this.
- Yes, this is--

592
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:54,180
She had no reason to be standing there.

593
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,556
You could get splashed there.

594
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,059
- To stand there at that angle…
- She's like this.

595
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,018
Exactly.

596
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,243
YOUN HYUN-JAE: 0 VOTES

597
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,202
<i>He's got nothing.</i>

598
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,830
- It's not going well.
- He's having a rough time.

599
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,835
<i>Oh, it's Hyeon-woo.</i>

600
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,008
- We can expect two votes.
- At most.

601
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:30,925
One from Go-eun?

602
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,761
This is difficult.

603
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,770
<i>- There's just one.</i>
<i>- Just one?</i>

604
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,608
<i>"Let's get to know each other better."</i>

605
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,193
<i>"Great work today."</i>

606
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:53,364
SHIN HYEON-WOO: 1 VOTE

607
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,949
- One vote.
- That's from Go-eun.

608
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,409
It's from Go-eun.

609
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,387
<i>- Seung-il got two votes.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

610
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,015
SONG SEUNG-IL: 2 VOTES

611
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,601
I'd say those votes
came from Go-eun and Mina Sue.

612
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,478
- Come on, not Go-eun.
- But Go-eun…

613
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,147
Don't you think Go-eun chose Hyeon-woo?

614
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,483
No, she's only keeping him on the hook.

615
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,486
Then, who do you think chose Hyeon-woo?

616
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,946
- How would I know?
- He's got a vote--

617
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,657
I'm not an actual fortune teller, am I?

618
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,001
Hey, hold on. That must be from Mina Sue.

619
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,756
- Of course. They scrambled eggs together.
- Yes. Didn't I say she'd vote for him?

620
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,258
The other one might not be from Go-eun.

621
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,094
- Let's see what the other one says.
- Yes.

622
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,261
Right, let's see.

623
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,266
<i>"The meal was great.</i>
<i>Next time, let's eat alone."</i>

624
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,270
- What?
- That's just…

625
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,564
That's not enough for us to guess on.

626
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,483
There's not much to go on.

627
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,151
This is hard.

628
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,487
I received two postcards.

629
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,823
I honestly didn't think I'd get any,

630
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,660
so I felt grateful to find two postcards.

631
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:24,455
I also think that the ladies
might welcome it if I took the initiative.

632
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:30,503

- Off you go.
- Bye.

635
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,885
I hope I'll get at least one vote.

636
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,014
- I have a terrible poker face.
- Same here.

<i>- Joo-young.</i>

638

- I agree.

639
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:53,943
Or maybe not.

LEE JOO-YOUNG: 1 VOTE

644
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,762
It was something of a declaration.

645
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,724
I kept wondering,
"Who had I not talked to today?"

646
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,268
I kept going over that question.

647
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,354
Why am I so nervous?

648
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,106
I'm so nervous.

649
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,525
We've decided not to say anything.

650
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,777
- You have to come in with a long face.
- Yes.

651
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,162
So they're not going to let it show?

652
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,664
But Joo-young's face
is radiating with happiness.

653
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,499
How can she not feel happy?

654
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,087
<i>Is that Hee-sun?</i>

655
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,506
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Hee-sun.</i>

656
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,967
<i>- I'm worried about Hee-sun.</i>
<i>- She must be nervous.</i>

657
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,052
<i>I hope she gets one.</i>

658
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,511
<i>I think she got one.</i>

659
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,971
<i>- I hope she got one.</i>
<i>- Did she?</i>

660
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,723
<i>- She's got one.</i>
<i>- Has she?</i>

661
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,022
- How could they?
- She didn't get any?

662
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,982
I'm heartbroken.

663
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,401
That means Su-been
didn't give her his vote.

664
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,361
- Yes.
- Right?

665
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,613
But she's gone this far
to make her interest obvious.

666
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,032
- How could he not?
- He likes someone else.

667
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,533
- He voted for someone else.
- Really?

You look so tired, Hee-sun.

671
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,820
You're spot on. I'm worn out.

672
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,161
I didn't get any postcards.

673
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,916
It saddened me not to receive any.

674
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,096
<i>- My gosh.</i>
<i>- How many are there?</i>

675
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,863
<i>- Oh, man.</i>
<i>- She received three votes?</i>

676
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,908
- I knew it.
- She's very likable.

677
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,285
- Totally.
- She's genuine.

678
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,911
- She's relaxed.
- Right.

679
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,456
- I guess we all get the same vibes.
- Right.

680
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,043
- She must be over the moon.
- Oh, my. What is she going to do?

681
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,636
<i>"The yellow dress looked great on you.</i>
<i>It suits your personality."</i>

682
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,472
<i>"I want to get to know you better."</i>

683
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,099
- That's from Seung-il for sure.
- Of course.

684
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,726
He's sending a clear message.

685
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,103
- Totally.
- He's practically saying it's him.

686
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:31,452
<i>"It's a shame we didn't get to chat much.</i>
<i>You looked amazing in that yellow dress."</i>

687
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,579
The yellow dress got mentioned again.

688
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,584
But he said he didn't get to talk to her,
so it must be Su-been.

689
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,502
- Su-been?
- Oh, him.

690
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,337
- It must be.
- I think it's him.

691
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:52,181
<i>"Thanks for cooking today.</i>
<i>Let's get to know each other better."</i>

692
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,184
- That's from Sung-hun.
- It's from Sung-hun.

693
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,978
- The handwriting gave him away.
- It has to be from him.

694
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:07,279
CHOI MINA SUE: 3 VOTES

695
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,995
I was scared out of my mind
because of the bugs out there.

696
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,590
It felt amazing.

697
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,052
But when I returned to our shared room,

698
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,388
I tried my best not to show it.

699
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,723
I don't think anyone caught on.

700
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,609
- I'm guessing Hyeon-woo wrote to her.
- Me too.

701
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,499
<i>"Let's get better acquainted.</i>
<i>It was nice meeting you today."</i>

702
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:05,129
KIM GO-EUN: 1 VOTE

703
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,885
I want to see it again.

704
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,854
The anonymous note said,
"I hope we get to know each other better."

705
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:26,442
Seung-il was the one
I got to talk to the most.

706
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,902
What?

707
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,112
- What was that?
- Who did she say just now?

708
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:35,534
<i>We went to the chicken coop together,</i>
<i>so I'm guessing Seung-il wrote that note.</i>

709
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,662
I gave my postcard to Seung-il.

710
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,877
See? All my predictions
are turning out to be correct.

711
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,087
Why did Go-eun show concern for Hyeon-woo?

712
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,759
I wrote a letter to Mina Sue.

713
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,596
I wanted her to know that I wrote it,

714
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,475
so I mentioned that I thought
the yellow dress suited her.

715
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,435
She was someone

716
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,104
I felt most drawn to
when we first met as a group.

717
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:08,526
I wanted to talk to her more over dinner,

718
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,403
but I didn't get to do that
because we sat too far apart.

719
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,321
It was a shame.

720
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:19,745
The person I addressed
my card to on the first day was Seung-il.

721
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,996
Well…

722
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:27,628
We prepared the scrambled eggs together,
and that gave us a chance to chat a bit.

723
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,090
I found him charming then,

724
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:35,511
so I wrote "egg" on my postcard
and slid it into Seung-il's mailbox.

725
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,014
I wrote to Mina.

726
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,559
Mina and I worked
in the Kitchen Garden,

727
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,477
and I had a lovely time with her.

728
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,107
In my card to Mina Sue,
I complimented her on her dress

729
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,235
and added that I'd like
to get to know her better.

730
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,778
Even if Hee-sun voted for me,

731
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,824
I still want to focus my energy
on Mina Sue.

732
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,910
So it won't change my mind.

733
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,122
I wrote my postcard to Su-been.

734
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,208
I straight out stated that he was my type.

735
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,213
The person I addressed
my anonymous postcard to last night

736
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,715
was Go-eun.

737
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,801
I thought that we had
something of a strong bond…

738
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,761
How's your hand?

739
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,515
- Oh, it's fine. Don't worry about it.
- Are you hurt?

740
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,891
I didn't realize, but yes.

741
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:28,939
I'm hoping Go-eun is the one
who sent me the postcard.

742
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,819
I addressed my postcard to Hyeon-woo.

743
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,488
I only met everyone yesterday,

744
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:40,784
and he caught my eye
when I first walked in.

745
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:41,994
So, I wrote to him.

746
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,249
I addressed my postcard to Joo-young.

747
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,545
I have a thing for ladies
with a beautiful smile,

748
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,297
and she had such a lovely smile.

749
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,133
So, I wrote my postcard to Joo-young.

750
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,636
I thought I should start
expressing my interest

751
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,305
in Joo-young more from tomorrow.

752
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:05,184
This is pretty complicated,
so let me check one thing.

753
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,227
Are any of them into each other?

754
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,688
- Yes. Mina Sue and Seung-il.
- Mina Sue and Seung-il.

755
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,357
Other than those two,

756
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,525
- it's all gone haywire, right?
- Yes.

757
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,943
Joo-young wrote to Hyeon-woo,

758
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,945
but Hyeon-woo wrote to Go-eun.

759
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,199
Go-eun wrote to Seung-il. This is just…

760
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:24,411
But the couples in Paradise
aren't particularly into their partner.

761
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,080
It's rather awkward there, too.

762
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,333
Things are bound to get spiced up
when they return the next day.

763
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,001
Jae-jin will be back tomorrow.

764
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,795
- Oh, yes.
- Jae-jin…

765
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,631
- You remembered him.
- It should be fun.

766
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,883
It's almost like the calm
before the storm.

767
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,803
I feel a whirlwind of emotions coming.

768
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,596
- Of course.
- I'm sure of it.

769
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,019
- Let's eat breakfast.
- Sounds good.

770
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,523
There's hot water. Are we having <i>ramyeon?</i>

771
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,732
We have apples.

772
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,900
Apples.

773
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,194
What's this?

774
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,113
- I'm guessing it's oatmeal.
- Oatmeal.

775
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,366
How do you eat oatmeal?

776
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,993
- You pour hot water--
- And soak the oatmeal.

777
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,830
Shall we prep the oatmeal, then?

778
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,207
- Yes. Let's do that.
- Let's go.

779
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,710
I guess we're in charge of the apples.

780
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,880
Where did everyone go?

781
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,925
How was last night for you?

782
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:21,760
- Last night?
- Yes.

783
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,222
Do you mean after checking the letters?

784
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:28,684
Yes.

785
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,353
All the men said things were rough here.

786
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,355
- How come?
- I'm not sure.

787
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:36,608
Did you get any?

788
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,991
I'd say things were slightly rough for me.

789
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,409
Really?

790
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,202
I wonder why.

791
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,709
I'm not saying I didn't get any.

792
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,673
- Hee-sun wrote to him, didn't she?
- Yes.

793
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,719
Let's go check out the oatmeal.

794
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,057
I've been wanting to talk to you.

795
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,186
I've been wanting to talk to you.

796
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,687
- Really?
- Yes.

797
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,983
Come on.
She's practically trailing after him.

798
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,694
She's like a puppy.

799
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,530
Didn't you realize?

800
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,157
Oh, I mean…

801
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,284
Are we allowed to be open about it?

802
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,037
I don't think I've said anything.

803
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,963
All we need to do is slightly…

804
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,717
He still went over to where everyone was.

805
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,511
- I know.
- When she wanted to chat.

806
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,513
He said he's interested in Mina Sue.

807
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,057
- He said he wanted to get to know her.
- Right.

808
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,684
- Shall we dig in, then?
- Yes.

809
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,603
- I'm starving.
- It looks delicious.

810
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,188
Can I take a seat here?

811
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,105
Of course.

812
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,400
- Did you prepare this?
- Yes, it's oatmeal.

813
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,527
It looks incredible.

814
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,911
- Is this too much?
- I'll try my best.

815
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,791
When will the ones in Paradise return?

816
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,043
Pretty soon, probably.

817
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:23,090
I hear one of the ladies
won the popularity votes.

818
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,216
- Yes.
- That's right.

819
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,634
Can you tell me why?

820
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,304
I guess I just felt drawn to her.

821
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,515
She has that easygoing vibe.

822
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,601
- Come again?
- She seems very down-to-earth.

823
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,563
Did you just vote without getting to talk?

824
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,566
Yes, we were just sitting here.

825
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,525
- Right here?
- Yes.

826
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:44,945
We were eating canned food
when we were told to cast our votes.

827
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,530
- My gosh.
- It was over carrots.

828
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,409
So basically,

829
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,787
she seemed easygoing
while eating carrots and chicken breast,

830
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:55,872
so you voted for her?

831
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,749
She was sitting to my right.

832
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,004
A casual conversation can tell you
if the other person is easygoing or not.

833
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,381
We didn't have enough time
to talk properly.

834
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,263
Why did that upset her?

835
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,682
- Because she's interested in him.
- Yes, but…

836
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,226
But is it such a big deal
for her to be that upset?

837
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,894
So that's how guys think.

838
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,731
Also, I think Seung-il
just spoke on behalf of the guys.

839
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,149
Totally.

840
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:26,111
But Mina Sue seems
to have misinterpreted it

841
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,487
as his own point of view.

842
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,865
That's probably why she's more upset.

843
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,743
Judging by Mina Sue's expression,
she likes him a lot.

844
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,869
- Totally.
- I know.

845
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,912
I didn't think she liked him that much.

846
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,376
- I suppose they're all waiting for us.
- Right?

847
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,878
Hey, they're coming back.

848
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,087
They're here.

849
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,466
- I can see them.
- What?

850
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,010
They're here.

851
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,803
No way. Really? Where are they?

852
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:52,721
They're here.

853
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,807
- I see some new people.
- Latecomers.

854
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,226
- Are they latecomers?
- I see more people.

855
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:00,896
I'm curious.

856
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,024
They must be startled, too.

857
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,777
I guess,
because four more people are here.

858
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,404
- Did they come yesterday?
- What's this?

859
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,322
My gosh.

860
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,991
- How many came?
- What's going on?

861
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,496
You said she's easygoing,
so I can't wait to meet her.

862
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,084
Hello.

863
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,378
- Hello.
- Hello.

864
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,712
- Hello.
- Hello.

865
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,630
Welcome back.

866
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,137
- Hello.
- Hello.

867
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,555
- Hello.
- Hello.

868
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,640
We're back.

869
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:43,230
- Hey, they're having a nice meal.
- At least they have a decent meal today.

870
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,201
- Did you have breakfast?
- Yes, sort of.

871
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,495
- Didn't you have fancy meals?
- Not at all.

872
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,624
<i>Seung-il gave me</i>
<i>a brief introduction of Min-gee.</i>

873
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,835
He described her as an easygoing person,

874
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,670
and I could tell who it was right away.

875
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:12,968
I am rather interested in Seung-il,
so I can't help but be bothered by her.

876
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:17,973
Hey, so we're all rooming together.

877
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:19,975
We're home.

878
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,309
- Hello.
- Hello.

879
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,478
Sweet dreams, guys.

880
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,314
I didn't get any sleep.

881
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,567
- I guess you couldn't have.
- I want a nap.

882
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,068
I'd like to know

883
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,738
if you chose your partner
or if you were chosen.

884
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,991
- She won the most votes…
- Wow.

885
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,287
And so, she chose Sung-min.

886
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,997
What are the guys like?

887
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,750
Sung-min is the calm type.

888
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,667
- Really?
- He's quiet.

889
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,877
But he seems…

890
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,420
- Right? He seems lively.
- Yes.

891
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,172
- He seems lively.
- But he's calm.

892
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,424
- Seriously?
- He's unflappable.

893
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,633
That's how he is.

894
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,970
- That's him being the most expressive.
- I guess he's very calm.

895
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,055
He's being as communicative as he can.

896
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:06,730
He was more quiet
and calmer than I thought.

897
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,732
Want a bite?

898
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,862
But seriously you look so cute.

899
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,574
That cuteness is your weapon.

900
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,285
You're holding onto dynamite.

901
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,539
- No comment, please.
- Sure.

902
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,836
He's really avoiding eye contact.

903
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,423
I wonder what the others are doing.

904
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:35,884
- Me too.
- Yes.

905
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:39,012
I wonder if they feel at ease like us.

906
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,556
- You're feeling at ease?
- Yes.

907
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,475
- There's no excitement?
- We're chill.

908
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,520
I mean, there's an easygoing vibe
under the excitement.

909
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,730
Isn't it the other way around?

910
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,982
- Aren't they basically the same?
- I get it.

911
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,819
- So you're not excited.
- My heart does flutter.

912
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,947
- Oh, sure.
- Yes, it really does.

913
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,948
I hear you.

914
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,783
- You must be excited.
- Yes.

915
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,662
- He doesn't look excited at all.
- No.

916
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:06,665
- It's over for them.
- Yes, it is.

917
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,125
What's Jae-jin like?

918
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,503
Can't you just picture it?

919
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,338
Is he a tough guy?

920
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,841
- Does he seem that way to you?
- Isn't he?

921
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,301
He does look like a tough guy.

922
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,136
He's very calm.

923
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,596
- He's calm too?
- Really?

924
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,473
- They're both calm?
- Really?

925
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,269
As we kept on chatting,

926
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,813
I couldn't help but notice
where we didn't click.

927
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,732
That's the only thing for us to look at.

928
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,402
What do you think it is?

929
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,612
- Balloons.
- Balloons?

930
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:38,530
Bean sprouts.

931
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,447
Bean sprouts?

932
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,157
The end.

933
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,327
Do you want to know what Type N sees?

934
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,121
Yes. I'm intrigued.

935
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:50,250
Answers don't mean much to Type Ns.
We keep on imagining things.

936
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:55,797
"Why do we have a tree-shaped figure
adorned with balloon-shaped ovals?"

937
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,090
I don't think I want to know.

938
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:59,718
They are shaped like branches, right?

939
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,513
- That's true. With--
- One trunk and many others branching out.

940
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,474
Try imagining just a bit more.

941
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,644
- Over that sculpture?
- Yes, now I'm curious.

942
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,771
Well…

943
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,316
They probably put it there
to prevent it from looking empty.

944
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,027
Right? Imagine it not being there.

945
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:23,742
His sense of humor
and mine weren't exactly compatible.

946
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,076
Look what we have here.

947
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,666
Don't you think putting it on your mouth
would make it hard to breathe?

948
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,586
- This is new.
- I know.

949
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,964
That left me on edge,

950
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,593
thinking and second-guessing
what I should do and how I should react.

951
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,970
I must've run 50 simulations at a time.

952
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,889
That wore me out.

953
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,684
While this is upsetting to admit,

954
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,771
I doubt I'd ever feel drawn to him.

955
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:57,692
Ye-jin must not have felt
a spark between them either.

956
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,110
The Paradise dates matter.

957
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,697
Is it too early to discuss
who we're interested in?

958
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,493
Is there anyone
you are interested in, or not?

959
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,787
- I can't say yet.
- Not yet?

960
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,331
Mina seems to have someone in mind.

961
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,459
I keep going back and forth,
so I'm not so sure.

962
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,586
Yeah…

963
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,966
I think Mina Sue
would be the most popular.

964
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:26,388
First of all,
she radiates this wholesome energy.

965
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,474
I think her charms
are pretty similar to mine.

966
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,018
She's always confident.

967
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,396
I think she's very charming.

968
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:36,982
That scared me!

969
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,986
<i>In a few moments, you will play a game</i>
<i>to win a special treat.</i>

970
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,031
<i>Please get changed</i>
<i>and gather at the beach.</i>

971
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,157
For goodness' sake…

972
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,159
This is wild.

973
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,536
Here we go.

974
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,789
- It's about time they played one.
<i>- Single's Inferno.</i>

975
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:18,314
- Are we playing dodgeball?
- Looks like we'll be drawing balls.

976
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:25,071
<i>Today's game is Couple Dodgeball.</i>

977
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,906
- I knew it.
- It's as we expected.

978
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,409
- I was right, wasn't I?
- Yes, you were.

979
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,745
Are we defending the women?

980
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,706
<i>Once the game begins,</i>

981
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:38,793
<i>the women must stand</i>
<i>behind the men they're partnered with.</i>

982
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,921
<i>Only men can make offensive moves,</i>

983
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,008
<i>and the couple must maintain</i>
<i>physical contact at all times.</i>

984
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,636
<i>A couple is eliminated</i>
<i>if they lose contact</i>

985
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,766
<i>or if the woman is hit by the ball</i>
<i>thrown by an opposing team's player.</i>

986
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,351
So women can't throw the ball.

987
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,312
- We need to dodge well.
- Right.

988
00:55:58,855 --> 00:55:59,689
What a bummer.

989
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,488
<i>The last surviving couple's team</i>
<i>will be declared the winners.</i>

990
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,239
It's a team competition.

991
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,326
<i>The final winners will receive</i>

992
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,828
<i>an Iced Americano and watermelon slices</i>
<i>as a special treat.</i>

993
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,038
Americano!

994
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,918
- I'd kill for that coffee.
- Me too.

995
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:23,088
- I'm going to win no matter what.
- I want them.

996
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:26,925
<i>We will now begin the draw.</i>

997
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:30,887
<i>However, the male contestant</i>
<i>who picks the pink ball</i>

998
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,515
<i>will not be able to participate</i>
<i>in the game.</i>

999
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,308
That's so cruel.

1000
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,814
- Please…
- I want that cold drink.

1001
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:44,400
<i>- Kim Min-gee, please draw a ball.</i>
- Yes. Okay.

1002
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,196
It's a gray ball.

1003
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,118
KIM GO-EUN, BLUE BALL

1004
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:54,828
I got a red ball.

1005
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,373
LEE JOO-YOUNG, BLACK BALL

1006
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,416
I got the yellow one.

1007
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,712
CHOI MINA SUE, WHITE BALL

1008
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,218
Why do I feel I'll pick pink?

1009
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,595
I got a flash of the future.

1010
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,682
Same here.
I think I'll end up with the pink ball.

1011
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,810
<i>Youn Hyun-jae, please draw a ball.</i>

1012
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,815
<i>Gray. Kim Min-gee and Youn Hyun-jae.</i>

1013
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,776
Let's take first place. Great.

1014
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,528
I swear I'll make you the winner.

1015
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,196
- I promise.
- Great.

1016
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,032
I'll dodge the ball like crazy.

1017
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:38,788
Wow.

1018
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,331
LEE SUNG-HUN, PINK BALL

1019
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,128
- He can't seem to catch a break.
- Tell me about it.

1020
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,297
Wow.

1021
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,722
Oh, no.

1022
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,682
<i>It was the worst.</i>

1023
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,976
I was so disappointed
to be barred from the game.

1024
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,522
I wanted to get to know Mina,
so I wanted to be paired up with her.

1025
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,983
- He must've wanted to play.
- I feel bad for him.

1026
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,319
He drew the pink ball.

1027
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:13,031
LEE SUNG-HUN CANNOT PARTICIPATE

1028
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:17,118
<i>Blue. Kim Go-eun and Woo Sung-min.</i>

1029
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:22,123
<i>I marveled at my good luck.</i>

1030
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,710
I initially chose Go-eun
during the first impression pick.

1031
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,420
YESTERDAY

1032
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,964
The person I'd like to go to Paradise with

1033
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,299
is Go-eun.

1034
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:32,884
Because I was attracted

1035
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,052
to her vibes.

1036
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,304
I made my decision
based on her first impression

1037
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:39,140
and the energy I got from her
when we first met.

1038
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,021
<i>Red. Ham Ye-jin and Song Seung-il.</i>

1039
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:50,109
<i>- Yellow. Park Hee-sun and Shin Hyeon-woo.</i>
- Yellow.

1040
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,490
- Black.
<i>- Black. Lee Joo-young and Kim Jae-jin.</i>

1041
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,202
Hey, the white ball was picked last.

1042
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,829
<i>White. Choi Mina Sue and Lim Su-been.</i>

1043
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,167
<i>I was paired up with Mina Sue</i>
<i>just as I had hoped.</i>

1044
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,878
I thought this was my shot.

1045
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,005
Even before the game was announced,

1046
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,091
Mina Sue mentioned she wanted coffee,

1047
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,677
so I thought I had to win at all costs.

1048
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,222
<i>You will be divided into two teams</i>

1049
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:22,350
<i>based on whether your ball</i>
<i>is in an achromatic or chromatic color.</i>

1050
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,980
<i>Please enter the court with your team.</i>

1051
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,108
<i>Please start when the whistle blows.</i>

1052
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,818
<i>Get ready!</i>

1053
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,778
- You have to stick together.
- Okay.

1054
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,822
- Hold onto me.
- Sure.

1055
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,116
- Good luck.
- We've got this.

1056
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,079
Bring it on!

1057
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,456
Bring it on!

1058
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,005
- Take three quick steps to the right.
- Okay.

1059
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,889
Su-been.

1060
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:13,901
Why do you--

1061
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,570
Why do you keep targeting me?

1062
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:16,821
Put more force into it.

1063
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,699
Hey, that packed a punch.

1064
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,035
- You're doing great, Su-been.
- Keep it going.

1065
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,831
- Are you sure Go-eun wasn't hit?
- She wasn't.

1066
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,916
Okay. Throw it right away.

1067
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,294
Oh, no.

1068
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,212
I'll keep holding onto you.

1069
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:44,432
<i>Su-been was incredible during the game.</i>

1070
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,519
<i>He had broad shoulders,</i>
<i>and how he played impressed me.</i>

1071
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:52,273
I don't think he's that talkative.

1072
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:58,029
But he showed a completely different side,
and I found that charismatic.

1073
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,238
That was hot.

1074
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,199
My heart did skip a beat.

1075
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,330
Sung-hun is just standing there.

1076
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,874
- Is he the referee or what?
- I know. Poor guy.

1077
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,959
He's just standing there.

1078
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,879
- I think we should go out.
- You think so?

1079
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,382
That way,
the team can keep hold of the ball.

1080
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,926
All right, Ms. Leader. I trust you.

1081
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,261
Just a second.

1082
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,686
Stay hidden.

1083
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,062
Stay hidden.

1084
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,647
Get it. Quick.

1085
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,316
<i>Kim Min-gee's pair is eliminated.</i>

1086
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:38,903
Get that ball.

1087
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,030
- Get that ball.
- Good job.

1088
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,824
Well done.

1089
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:43,741
What is this?

1090
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,244
<i>- Ham Ye-jin's pair is eliminated.</i>
- See you later.

1091
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:47,995
- Sorry, Ye-jin.
- It's fine.

1092
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,664
- It's fine.
- We got carried away.

1093
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,669
Hey, wait.

1094
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:57,588
Hey, wait.

1095
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,008
- We're out.
<i>- Choi Mina Sue's pair is eliminated.</i>

1096
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,262
My hand slipped.

1097
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,013
<i>Kim Go-eun's pair is eliminated.</i>

1098
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,307
What do we do?

1099
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,976
We can't lose.

1100
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,272
Make sure to stay together.

1101
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,776
I'll guard your hands.

1102
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:21,779
I'll guard your hands.

1103
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:29,245
<i>I had my hands on Jae-jin's waist,</i>
<i>and he covered my hands with his.</i>

1104
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:33,875
That was pretty memorable.

1105
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:39,213
That's when I realized
he was doing his best to take care of me.

1106
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,007
- This way.
- Pass the ball right away.

1107
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,258
- Okay.
- To those guys.

1108
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,718
Okay. I'll pass right away.

1109
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:45,428
Right away!

1110
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,054
Oh, no.

1111
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,556
- Okay.
- Pass the ball around.

1112
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:49,640
- Okay.
- Move forward.

1113
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,976
- I've got this.
- Pass the ball to the back.

1114
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:04,155
Joo-young and Jae-jin
got pretty touchy-feely during the game,

1115
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,449
and it bothered me.

1116
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,118
Still, we were on the same team,

1117
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:15,082
so my goal was to win no matter what
and get Joo-young the special treat.

1118
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,252
Great job.

1119
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,726
<i>Lee Joo-young's pair is eliminated.</i>

1120
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,607
Good job.

1121
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,192
- Seung-il.
- Well done.

1122
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,070
<i>- Team Chromatic Color wins.</i>
- That was so freaking cool.

1123
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,363
Great job, everyone.

1124
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:46,614
He's sweating so much.

1125
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,493
Joo-young seemed pretty disappointed.

1126
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:53,538
I wish I could've gotten her that coffee.

1127
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,665
I really do. I feel bad.

1128
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,001
<i>Moreover,</i>

1129
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:05,216
<i>the couples who played the game together</i>
<i>will have a one-on-one lunch date today.</i>

1130
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,854
Where does that leave Sung-hun?

1131
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,565
Really?

1132
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,775
- Poor guy.
- Blame it on his bad luck.

1133
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,295
Hello.

1134
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,382
- Hello.
- Hello.

1135
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,929
- I'm glad you can join me.
- The feeling's mutual.

1136
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,473
- We finally got a chance to chat.
- I know, right?

1137
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,309
Thank you.

1138
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,227
- Shall we?
- Cheers.

1139
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,442
How's the coffee?

1140
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:05,860
It's great.

1141
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:07,278
- Do you like coffee?
- I do.

1142
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:09,447
I enjoy coffee.

1143
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,618
I only heard after we returned here.

1144
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,954
Did the four contestants
join right after we left?

1145
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:18,581
What was it like?

1146
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:20,625
I cheered silently.

1147
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,252
Why did you cheer?

1148
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:27,423
I mean, you guys left us behind,
and we had some new company.

1149
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,135
I thought,
"I should get to know them better."

1150
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,721
- Of course.
- Yes.

1151
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,389
Tell me this, then.

1152
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:38,142
Do you have someone you'd like to talk to?

1153
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:40,811
I mean, do you have someone in mind?

1154
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,026
I've been wanting to talk to you.

1155
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:51,697
At the moment…

1156
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:54,241
- I'd like to talk to Seung-il, too.
- Seung-il?

1157
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,577
- Why?
- Just because.

1158
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:59,163
- I was curious.
- I see.

1159
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:03,626
What factors did you consider
when deciding who you wanted to talk to?

1160
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,631
I chose guys

1161
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:12,426
I talked to the most
or made the most eye contact with.

1162
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,386
I see.

1163
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,764
Who did you vote for yesterday?

1164
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,391
Someone entirely different.

1165
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,395
I ended up changing my mind afterwards.

1166
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:25,648
- I voted for you.
- Really?

1167
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,400
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1168
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,027
- Really.
- Oh, my.

1169
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:31,988
- Really?
- Yes.

1170
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:37,576
- Go-eun softens up when she talks.
- She does.

1171
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:41,706
She may not be as feisty
as I initially thought her to be.

1172
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,582
- She's shy.
- Yes.

1173
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,751
- Really?
- Yes.

1174
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:47,712
I voted for you.

1175
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:50,423
You voted for me,
but I didn't get to go to Paradise.

1176
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:52,508
It's such a shame.

1177
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:54,635
What's your ideal type?

1178
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,847
I like someone

1179
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,933
who is kind yet manly.

1180
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:04,478
- You'll have to keep talking to the guys.
- That's true.

1181
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,397
That's the only way
you'll know if they are.

1182
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,356
Exactly.

1183
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:10,151
From our short chat,

1184
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:11,652
I can sense

1185
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:14,196
your gentleness.

1186
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,406
You seem sweet.

1187
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:16,323
- Me?
- Yes.

1188
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:17,742
Thank you.

1189
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:24,206
- It's nice talking to you.
- Likewise.

1190
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,917
- I've been wanting to do this.
- Same.

1191
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:36,761
Why do I feel so nervous?

1192
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:39,847
Hello.

1193
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,558
Hello.

1194
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:46,896
My gosh.

1195
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,315
Those are my favorites.

1196
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,318
I saw the winners enjoying coffee

1197
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,528
- and watermelon. I'm so jealous.
- Me too.

1198
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,240
I remember you saying
how you wanted coffee earlier.

1199
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:02,870
- Yes, it's a shame we didn't win.
- I think my enthusiasm got in the way.

1200
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,248
But you rocked. I mean it.

1201
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,209
You were so cool.

1202
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,420
I even told everyone how cool you were.

1203
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,841
Can I ask about your type?

1204
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,593
What kind of girl do you like?

1205
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:19,678
Well…

1206
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:21,430
For me…

1207
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:27,895
In terms of physique, I prefer tall women.

1208
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,648
How tall are you?

1209
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:32,608
- I'm not sure…
- I'm 172cm tall.

1210
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,110
You're 172cm tall?

1211
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,408
- She's tall.
- She said, "That's me."

1212
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,002
And personality-wise,

1213
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,005
I like frank and open people.

1214
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,425
You seem frank, too.

1215
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:05,015
- What's this?
- I look forward to seeing them together.

1216
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:07,143
What about you?

1217
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:13,399
I think I prioritize
personality over physique.

1218
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,776
- I see.
- I'm pretty chatty.

1219
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,154
I'm pretty talkative, you see.

1220
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:22,658
So I like people
who find my chattering funny

1221
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:23,909
rather than being annoyed.

1222
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,328
A sense of humor must be important to you.

1223
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:30,499
That's true. But my partner
doesn't have to be funny.

1224
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,796
I'm not a fan of flirty people.

1225
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:37,840
I mean,

1226
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:42,136
if the guy who's attentive to me
acts the same way to other women…

1227
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,806
That's rather off-putting.

1228
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,767
- I mean, it's hard to miss.
- I get what you mean.

1229
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:56,066
- Did anyone catch your eye?
- Well…

1230
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,196
How about you?

1231
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,701
One woman did catch my eye.

1232
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,746
Is she tall?

1233
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:14,543
I suppose so. She's on the tall side.

1234
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:23,802
What's this?

1235
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,764
- What's wrong?
- Even I'm getting butterflies.

1236
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:30,226
- Yes, they're hitting it off.
- Indeed.

1237
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,190
Are you shy around strangers?

1238
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,151
- How do I seem?
- I'd say a bit?

1239
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:42,154
- I think I am.
- I thought so, too.

1240
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,406
I think I know
your Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.

1241
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:47,826
You seem like an INTJ.

1242
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,662
- You think I'm an INTJ?
- Yes.

1243
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,170
I'll tell you on our Paradise date.

1244
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,881
I'd love to join you.

1245
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:02,591
- Sorry?
- Take me there.

1246
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,470
- My gosh.
- He's keeping her intrigued.

1247
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:08,264
She asked him to take her out.

1248
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,394
I'll have to win the next game.

1249
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,899
- I can't wait for the next game.
- Do you think you can win?

1250
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,986
I'm sure I won't lose.

1251
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,155
I guess you'll win then.

1252
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:29,952
Their conversation was lovely, wasn't it?

1253
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,328
- My heart fluttered.
- I loved it.

1254
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:33,706
- For sure.
- It's what we've been waiting for, right?

1255
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,000
- A budding romance.
- Exactly.

1256
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,584
No cryptic comments.

1257
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,128
- No one's being evasive.
- Exactly.

1258
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:42,089
- They weren't being overly direct either.
- Right.

1259
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,383
- It was almost poetic.
- Totally.

1260
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,302
They took a poetic approach.

1261
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:47,469
Everything was meaningful.

1262
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:49,138
Rather than saying, "I like you,"

1263
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:50,931
they spoke their minds in an indirect way.

1264
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,392
He was so smooth
saying he'd tell her in Paradise.

1265
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,061
- He's saying, "Let's go to Paradise."
- Exactly.

1266
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,316
<i>Singles.</i>

1267
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,610
<i>Today, there will be another</i>
<i>Paradise-bound couple matching.</i>

1268
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,112
That's wild.

1269
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,702
<i>The matching will take place in an hour.</i>

1270
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,749
Good luck.

1271
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,503
<i>Please converse</i>
<i>with your fellow contestants freely.</i>

1272
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:25,382
- This is all too much.
- "Freely"?

1273
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:28,635
What's with the watermelon?

1274
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:31,138
- Let's go steal a bite.
- Okay.

1275
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:34,641
Go grab them. Let's go get them.

1276
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,268
Bring us the watermelon.

1277
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,478
Can I have a bite?

1278
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:38,604
- Here, Hyun-jae.
- Just one.

1279
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,230
- Take the whole slice.
- Here you go.

1280
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,315
- Thank you.
- Have it all.

1281
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:46,153
- Can I steal you for a bit, Seung-il?
- I suppose.

1282
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:49,031
- You can have it all.
- Really? Did you have enough?

1283
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:50,407
Not really. I couldn't enjoy it.

1284
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:51,325
It was too hot.

1285
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:53,577
- Hey, you had quite a bit.
- I did.

1286
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:56,663
- What's your ideal type?
- Well…

1287
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:58,540
Someone I can click with.

1288
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:00,834
- So…
- A good sense of humor?

1289
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,503
Yes, someone I can banter with.

1290
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:05,297
I want my partner
to also be my best friend.

1291
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,883
- So those are what I value.
- We have a lot in common.

1292
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:11,470
For me, as long as we hit it off,
everything else is fine.

1293
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:13,222
I mean it.

1294
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,516
If you think about it,
you spent two days in Paradise…

1295
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:16,517
Wait, I meant Inferno.

1296
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,768
I'm sorry.

1297
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:19,186
- I'm sorry.
- Keep going.

1298
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:21,188
- You've been here in Inferno.
- Right.

1299
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:24,483
Has someone grown on you,
or has anyone intrigued you?

1300
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:25,776
You, Min-gee.

1301
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,905
- You're so honest.
- Yes, you're one of them.

1302
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:31,782
I've had my eye on only two women.

1303
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:33,075
- You and--
- Is it Go-eun?

1304
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:34,034
Not her.

1305
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,078
Mary Sue.

1306
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:38,122
- What? She's Mina Sue.
- Right, Mina Sue.

1307
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,832
- "Mary Sue."
- "Mary Sue"?

1308
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,542
"Mary Sue."

1309
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:44,253
I knew someone would slip up like that.

1310
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,547
- I knew it.
- "Mary Sue."

1311
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,800
- "Mary Sue"? It suddenly feels sacred.
- "Mary Sue."

1312
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,386
I've had my eye on only two women.

1313
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:53,679
- You and…
- Is it Go-eun?

1314
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:54,596
Not her.

1315
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:56,682
Mary Sue.

1316
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,767
- What? She's Mina Sue.
- Right, Mina Sue.

1317
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,561
- So, you like women like us.
- Yes, you two.

1318
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:02,271
- Yes, I have a clear preference.
- I see.

1319
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:20,581
Still, it was really funny
how you got the pink one.

1320
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:26,295
You were already so funny
and when I saw that pink ball…

1321
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:28,338
- I cracked up big time.
- No, don't.

1322
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,507
- It was so funny.
- Don't say that.

1323
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,593
When I drew that pink ball…

1324
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,812
This is random, but…

1325
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:46,440
can I speak casually?

1326
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,609
- Yes, let's do that.
- Okay.

1327
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:50,527
I feel so at ease when I'm with you.

1328
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:51,570
- Really?
- Yes.

1329
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,780
It's almost like I'm with a family member.

1330
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,470
- The yellow dress?
- Yeah, and that you're glamorous.

1331
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:18,931
- Really?
- Yes. It was a great first impression.

1332
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,143
Hello.

1333
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,606
Hello.

1334
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,666
- What's your type physically?
- Physically?

1335
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,710
I guess someone with full lips?

1336
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,097
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1337
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,313
- Goodness.
- He does have full lips.

1338
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,691
I love his character.

1339
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:15,362
I think we'd have fun
if we went to Paradise.

1340
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,166
- Can we have a chat, Min-gee?
- Yes? Let's go.

1341
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:32,963
- You're very chill.
- Oh, yes.

1342
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,090
- I like it here.
- This is my spot.

1343
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,429
So did you get to talk with everyone?

1344
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:43,473
Yes, I think I did.

1345
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:46,518
I just followed my heart.

1346
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:50,314
- The end.
- Already?

1347
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:54,359
<i>Now, we're going to match the couples</i>
<i>who will go on a date in Paradise.</i>

1348
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,032
- Let's talk some more later.
- Okay.

1349
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:02,826
Really? He was just about to talk to her.

1350
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:03,994
Hyeon-woo.

1351
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:05,495
He can't catch a break.

1352
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:08,290
Just when we think Hyeon-woo
finally gets his chance to shine,

1353
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:10,417
the ill-fated timing takes his shot away.

1354
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,335
Sadly.

1355
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:19,760
<i>Now, we're going to match the couples</i>
<i>who will go on a date in Paradise.</i>

1356
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:24,723
<i>The men have already chosen</i>

1357
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:28,560
<i>the woman they'd like to go</i>
<i>to Paradise with.</i>

1358
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:36,151
This is wild.

1359
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:42,240
<i>Kim Go-eun.</i>

1360
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:45,077
- Oh, no.
<i>- Please step outside your lodging.</i>

1361
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,579
- Have fun.
- See you.

1362
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,497
Oh, come on.

1363
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:53,210
- Enjoy your date. See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

1364
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:55,837
When you get to Paradise
after being stuck here,

1365
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:57,964
I bet you'll be flooded with emotions.

1366
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:00,258
I have a feeling she'll go to Paradise.

1367
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:16,608
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1368
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:21,905
<i>Kim Go-eun has matched with…</i>

1369
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,961
I think she'll leave with Sung-min.

1370
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:38,505
- I don't think so.
- Really?

1371
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:42,217
- Sung-min is her safe choice.
- If she plays safe, she'll pick him.

1372
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:45,804
<i>Go-eun has matched with…</i>

1373
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:48,223
<i>Woo Sung-min.</i>

1374
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:50,142
- Me?
- Sung-min.

1375
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,436
<i>Woo Sung-min, please step outside.</i>

1376
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:55,939
He's a Paradise regular.

1377
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,526
- Didn't they play the game together?
- That's how you catch feelings.

1378
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:00,610
How interesting.

1379
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:13,290
I think their chemistry will take off
when they arrive in Paradise.

1380
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:14,833
You never know what'll happen there.

1381
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,793
After a few glasses of wine.

1382
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,422
- Are your bags heavy? Shall I carry them?
- Just this one.

1383
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:23,175
You should've offered sooner.

1384
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,262
I was almost crushed by the weight.

1385
01:19:28,388 --> 01:19:31,558
- What did you bring?
- A woman needs a lot of things.

1386
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:35,103
I'll dig into every little detail
once we get to Paradise.

1387
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:36,313
- Me?
- Of course.

1388
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:37,981
Who else would I look into?

1389
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:42,277
So I'm your target? It won't be so easy.

1390
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:44,780
- We'll see.
- Okay.

1391
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:53,789
The person I'd like
to go to Paradise with is…

1392
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:01,463
<i>I chose Joo-young</i>
<i>without a moment of hesitation.</i>

1393
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:07,511
I didn't feel drawn to Joo-young
all throughout the dodgeball game.

1394
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:13,517
But as we talked after that,
I felt relaxed around her.

1395
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,727
When you use cornstarch for deep-frying,

1396
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:18,021
it doesn't turn brown.

1397
01:20:18,104 --> 01:20:19,356
You get snowy crisps.

1398
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,066
Really?

1399
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,195
It's like I'm listening to the radio.

1400
01:20:25,862 --> 01:20:27,906
You're very generous
to laugh at my boring tales.

1401
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,994
I tend to laugh a lot.

1402
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:40,043
So, I wanted to talk to her some more.

1403
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,214
I can't tell at all.

1404
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,801
I chose Joo-young.

1405
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:51,304
I didn't consider any other women.

1406
01:20:52,722 --> 01:20:55,767
I've wanted to talk
to you the most, Joo-young.

1407
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,060
Oh, really?

1408
01:20:57,143 --> 01:21:00,897
When we were eating,
I saw you smile and thought,

1409
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:04,150
"I'll have to write her name
if we vote today."

1410
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:10,657
- We have this in common.
- The dimples.

1411
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,325
- So you noticed.
- Yes, the dimples.

1412
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:13,702
You noticed.

1413
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:15,996
- Maybe they drew me in.
- You saw them.

1414
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,043
I think this is the first time

1415
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:25,547
we're seeing Hyun-jae
look at someone else directly.

1416
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:26,798
The close-up shot, I mean.

1417
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,925
- He's so attractive.
- Agreed.

1418
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:32,304
He has such an intense gaze.

1419
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:36,141
I think you'd be very popular here.

1420
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:37,684
You think so?

1421
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,561
- Really?
- I'm sure of it.

1422
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:43,273
But I'm not worried.

1423
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:46,359
I'll find a fair and square way
to win your heart.

1424
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:49,988
I'll do my best.

1425
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:58,163
<i>Joo-young has matched with…</i>

1426
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:07,047
I can't wait to find out who she chose.

1427
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:09,299
- Jae-jin's chance seems pretty good.
- Jae-jin?

1428
01:22:09,382 --> 01:22:11,009
- Won't it be Hyun-jae?
- I think so.

1429
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:12,969
He's a sure bet.

1430
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:17,182
<i>Joo-young has matched with…</i>

1431
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:20,268
<i>Kim Jae-jin.</i>

1432
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,938
<i>Kim Jae-jin, please step outside.</i>

1433
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,565
<i>…Kim Jae-jin.</i>

1434
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,943
<i>Kim Jae-jin, please step outside.</i>

1435
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:31,321
Seriously, these two
are becoming regulars.

1436
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:33,573
- Congrats.
- I'll get on my way.

1437
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:35,492
Have fun!

1438
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:37,535
See you.

1439
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,162
Those two are trouble.

1440
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,831
Do they have something special we don't?

1441
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:47,504
Where else could we see
someone like Hyun-jae looking so dejected?

1442
01:22:47,587 --> 01:22:48,505
- Good point.
- Right?

1443
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:49,756
It's a rare sight indeed.

1444
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:53,551
He's like a character
out of romance comics.

1445
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:58,848
- Hello.
- Hello.

1446
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,353
Shall we go?

1447
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:06,398
Yes.

1448
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:10,819
- Was it a tough decision for you?
- For me?

1449
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:12,821
Not at all.

1450
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:15,824
Same here.

1451
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:19,327
Let's have fun.

1452
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:25,333
- Yes, ma'am!
- It took you too long. Try again.

1453
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:27,919
Let's spend quality time together.

1454
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:30,630
Let's spend quality time together.

1455
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,132
Let's share what's on our hearts.

1456
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:34,050
Sounds good.

1457
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:47,856
<i>When I pondered on</i>
<i>who to go to Paradise with…</i>

1458
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:49,774
Since Sung-hun

1459
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,278
is such a pleasant person to talk to
and has a comforting presence,

1460
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:56,906
I thought a Paradise date
with him would be really enjoyable.

1461
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:04,122
I got to know Su-been better
during the game and saw his charms.

1462
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:05,999
He was really incredible.

1463
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:11,004
When he threw the ball,
all his muscles here rippled.

1464
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:13,590
Seeing him in action blew my mind.

1465
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,801
Then, there's Seung-il.

1466
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:21,431
I don't think I got to have
a one-on-one conversation.

1467
01:24:21,514 --> 01:24:25,185
We didn't get to go on a date,
so I'd like to talk to him a bit more.

1468
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,566
The person I'd like
to go to Paradise with is…

1469
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:35,779
Who did she hit it off with?

1470
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:38,364
- Probably Su-been.
- Yes, Su-been.

1471
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,241
Wait, could it be Seung-il?

1472
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,538
The person I'd like
to go to Paradise with is…

1473
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:13,608
I'm so curious who her choice will be.

1474
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:14,526
Seung-il?

1475
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:16,903
- Su-been.
- Su-been?

1476
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:17,862
Su-been.

1477
