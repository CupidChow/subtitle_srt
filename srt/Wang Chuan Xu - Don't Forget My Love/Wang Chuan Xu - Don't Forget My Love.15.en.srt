Your Highness,

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,920
Prime Minister Yun had a wife

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,120
before he entered the palace.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
But then, she disappeared

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,200
as if she had vanished into thin air.

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,980
(Yu Wan'er, courtesy name, Yunyuan)

18
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,360
(Liu Nianjiao,
sister of Noble Consort Liu)

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,080
Consort Wan?

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,320
Consort Wan?

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,160
But why would it be her?

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:27,960
Hadn't she...

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,680
Hadn't she died
of illness a long time ago?

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,200
Consort Wan...

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,440
When did she enter the palace,

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,760
and when did she pass away?

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
According to the records,

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,880
Consort Wan

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,720
entered the palace
as a concubine 18 years ago.

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,000
Then, she passed away in the Cold Palace

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,080
two years later.

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Eighteen years ago?

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
Eighteen years ago.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,200
Oh, right.

35
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,160
Prime Minister Yun was appointed
18 years ago as well.

36
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,240
Could it be

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,240
that before Consort Wan
entered the palace,

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,520
she was already
with Prime Minister Yun...

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,280
It's no wonder she wasn't favoured

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,160
and

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,520
died in the Cold Palace in the end.

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,040
But if my father didn't like her,

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,000
why would he

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,720
look at her portrait every day?

45
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,960
This is father's...

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,000
Who is this?

47
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,200
I've never seen her in the palace.

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,200
His Majesty has arrived.

49
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,960
At the same time,

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,040
Consort Wan passed away due to illness,

51
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,760
and Prime Minister Yun resigned.

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,120
There must be a connection somehow.

53
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,920
There must be more

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,720
to Prime Minister Yun's death.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,080
Maybe...

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,000
In the end, that vixen
still married the crown prince!

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,920
That's right.

58
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,240
Everyone
in Prime Minister Yun's residence died.

59
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,520
Why didn't she die too?

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,800
(Liu Nianjiao, sister of Noble Consort Liu)
This is the crown prince's palace.

61
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,840
Watch your mouth.

62
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,620
(Qingyun Palace)

63
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,360
Did you hear?

64
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,440
Last night,

65
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,920
His Highness didn't sleep
in the crown princess's quarters.

66
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,840
I heard His Majesty

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,920
- It looks like Lingchuan
- only issued that edict

68
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,320
- doesn't like Yun Qianyu.
- out of consideration

69
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,240
for the late prime minister.

70
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,160
Is that so?

71
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
It's no wonder everyone is saying

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,520
that His Highness only married her

73
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,800
to appease the public.

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,280
Hmph.

75
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Without the support
of the prime minister,

76
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,080
she has nothing she can use
to compete against me.

77
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,840
That's right.

78
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,080
We have Noble Consort Liu
behind our backs.

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,440
I won't need her help

80
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,000
to take on that woman.

81
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,360
Come on.

82
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,600
Let's go and meet the crown princess.

83
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,240
(Why is she going
to the crown princess's room?)

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,880
(Is she...)

85
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,760
Oh, no.

86
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,960
My, my.

87
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,560
Everyone in the prime minister's residence
was slaughtered.

88
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,960
If it were me,

89
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,080
I would've ended my life too.

90
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,920
I wouldn't have
the shamelessness to carry on

91
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,400
and become the crown princess.

92
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,200
Hmph.

93
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,200
All the servants

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,800
are talking and laughing
at you behind your back.

95
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,960
Did you really think

96
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,680
you are the lady of the house now?

97
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,720
Sorry.

98
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,680
Right now,

99
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,400
I am the lady of this palace.

100
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,920
A pitiful final struggle.

101
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,680
When I marry the crown prince,

102
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
I will chase you out of here!

103
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,320
Chase me out of here?

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,280
I'm afraid that won't be likely.

105
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
I am the crown prince's official consort

106
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,600
named and wed by His Majesty
to His Highness.

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,000
Unless His Highness
gives the orders himself,

108
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,400
no one else has the authority to do so.

109
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,600
You...

110
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,480
Oh, right.

111
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,200
If you do like

112
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,080
the crown prince that much

113
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,560
and have no shame,

114
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,640
I suppose I could

115
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,800
keep one eye closed

116
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,040
and allow you to become a maid
that warms his bed.

117
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,880
How about it?

118
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,240
Yun Qianyu, you...

119
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,120
The crown princess
can stand up for herself.

120
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,880
Shh.

121
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,120
You dare slap me?

122
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,080
Let that be a lesson to you.

123
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,160
You came to the crown prince's residence

124
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,200
to provoke me and stir up trouble
during His Highness's wedding.

125
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,600
Is that the upbringing
of the Liu family?

126
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,200
It would be within reason for me

127
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,280
to throw you out of here if I so wish.

128
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,040
And another thing.

129
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,320
You are but a maid.

130
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,480
How dare you

131
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,040
insult me?

132
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,520
Just you wait,

133
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,280
Yun Qianyu!

134
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,080
You won't have it your way for long!

135
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,000
Lingchuan!

136
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,240
I...

137
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,000
Nianjiao,

138
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,120
raise your head.

139
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,720
Let me see you.

140
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,680
(Is Lingchuan going to stand up for me?)

141
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,600
I was right.

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,680
Nianjiao,

143
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,280
your features are too plain.

144
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,480
Heavy makeup doesn't suit you.

145
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,160
Huh?

146
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,960
Ling... Lingchuan,

147
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,600
what do you mean?

148
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,160
Your eyes are too wide apart.

149
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,600
Flat eyebrows make your face look big.

150
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,120
Also,

151
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,760
you're not tall enough,

152
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,440
so don't wear red.

153
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,560
You can't hold it up,

154
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,440
and it makes you
look less imposing instead.

155
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,280
Hmph!

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,520
Young Lady!

157
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,280
I brought you

158
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,040
the new item
from the Pavilion of Delicacy to try.

159
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,560
Liu Nianjiao is trouble.

160
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,920
Her Highness's life
will be even harder now.

161
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,160
Especially
if the noble consort gets involved.

162
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,560
Then, we'll get rid of both of them.

163
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,840
Get rid of both of them?
