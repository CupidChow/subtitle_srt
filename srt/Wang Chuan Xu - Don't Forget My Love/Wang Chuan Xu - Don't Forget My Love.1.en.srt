Imperial Censor Lin,

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,680
a typical fence-sitter.

17
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,320
He's only responsible for
advancing the progress.

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,640
He doesn't care about the result.

we must

22

(Lin Jiuge, imperial censor of The Censorate)
elect a crown prince

by today.

24
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,920
He's fooling around.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,640
Regarding the crown prince's election,

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,760
my loyal subjects,
what do you have in mind?

27
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,960
Chen Ruyi,

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,240
the Minister of Personnel.

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,720
(Chen Ruyi, Minister of Personnel)
the Minister of Personnel.

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,480
(Chen Ruyi, Minister of Personnel)
He was the student

31
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,960
- of Wei Yizhan.
- Your Majesty.

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,320
He only climbed to his rank

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,600
(Mujin, Third Prince's bodyguard)
through Wei Yizhan's recommendation.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,200
In my opinion, First Prince
is a brave and excellent warrior.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,720
And, he had rendered
military merit as well.

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,640
He's the perfect crown prince candidate.

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,320
He's the best aide
he has in the imperial court.

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,200
He follows his every order.

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,120
(Qin Yuan, Minister of Revenue)
Your Majesty,

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,400
(Qin Yuan, Minister of Revenue)
I think First Prince is too fierce

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,280
and not compassionate enough.

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
He slew 30,000 prisoners of war
in the Battle of Fangping.

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,360
- Wei Yizhan,
- He doesn't understand the people...

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,615
(Wei Yizhan, Lord Protector General)
the Lord Protector General...

45
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,000
(Wei Yizhan, Lord Protector General)
And he raids the innocent...

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,640
And the uncle of Jun Lingchi.

47
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,480
He's one of the heroes of our time.

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,760
He wields absolute military power,

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,480
and his students
flood the imperial court.

50
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,360
He's the absolute guardian
of Jun Lingchi.

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,680
Wei,

52
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,880
out of my two sons, who do
you think should be the crown prince?

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,160
Seems like Minister Qin
will be challenged.

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,240
Your Majesty,

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,320
I'm a warrior who has spent
half of my life on the battlefield.

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,800
I've slain countless enemies
in order to protect our empire.

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,960
Minister Qin, could it be

58
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,040
that you think generals like us
should not kill?

59
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,320
What a joke.

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,440
First Prince has rendered
first-class merit by winning the war.

61
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,040
But Minister Qin made it as if
First Prince had sinned instead.

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,440
What exactly is your motive here?

63
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,760
His Highness...

64
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,760
You only arranged Minister Qin
to speak on your behalf.

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,800
Although Minister Qin
has a silver tongue,

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,160
seems like he's at a disadvantage here.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,640
Father did so

68
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,280
to test our guardians and find out
about their backgrounds.

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,720
It has also violated Father's taboo.

70
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,840
(Seems like Lingchi has done a lot in secret.
I've underestimated him.)

71
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,800
Let's go.

72
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,800
We cannot let Minister Qin fight alone.

73
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
The Third Prince has arrived!

74
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,440
Father, I have news to report.

75
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,600
The rebel army of Dongyang
has surrendered.

76
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,240
We sustained no casualties.

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,520
Father, I'm here to request instruction
on how to help them settle down.

78
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,680
The rebel army of Dongyang
was fierce and strong.

79
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,240
I thought the battle would last
for at least a few years.

80
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,640
But we actually defeated them
without sacrificing a single soldier?

81
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,360
- Is this for real?
- Without sacrificing a single soldier?

82
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,400
- Third Prince can lead an army as well?
- First Prince is nothing special then.

83
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,760
You did great.

84
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,200
So, how do you think
we should deal with them?

85
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,280
Your Majesty, according to law,
they've committed treason.

86
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,480
Their clans should be executed.

87
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,400
They deserve to die.

88
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,800
Father,

89
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,200
in my opinion, most of them
were common folks.

90
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,280
They were forced to join the rebel army.

91
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,280
In reality, they didn't do anything
to betray their nation.

92
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,200
Why don't we help them settle down
in Yen Chow?

93
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,120
Although it's a wasteland,

94
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,480
it has plenty of water resources.

95
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,920
It will surely turn into a fertile land
over time.

96
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,440
Let them reclaim the wasteland?

97
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,560
That's a great idea.

98
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,240
Great. The Minister of Revenue
will receive income again.

99
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,800
To rule the nation with benevolence
seems like a better choice.

100
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,000
Although it was a tough situation,
Third Prince resolved it

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,440
without any trouble. He's amazing.

102
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,160
Very good. Since no one
is raising any objections,

103
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,600
just do what you deem fit.

104
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,680
Yes, Father.

105
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,640
(Lingchi is too stubborn.
Lingchuan is a better choice here.)

106
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,400
Your Majesty.

107
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,280
Prime Minister Yun,

108
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,040
what do you think?

109
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,280
In my opinion,

110
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,287
(Yun Haotian, Prime Minister)
First Prince is brave and strong

111
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,240
(Yun Haotian, Prime Minister)
while Third Prince is benevolent and wise.

112
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,080
They're both vital to Dayu Empire.

113
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,560
His daughter will be the crown princess
no matter who the crown prince is.

114
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,640
He's already a winner.
There's no need to pick a side.

115
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
My loyal subjects,

116
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,040
my son, Lingchuan,
is benevolent and filial.

117
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,280
And, he exhibits good governance. He's
the best candidate to lead the empire.

118
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,520
He shall be appointed as
the next crown prince.

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,320
Thank you, Father.

120
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,680
Long live Your Majesty.

121
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,000
(Prime Minister Yun,
he's second only to the emperor.)

122
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,800
He wields all the power in the world.

123
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,480
However, he also exhibits
great forbearance.

124
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
Does he really not care for power?

125
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,160
Or is he...

126
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,940
This is bad!

129
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,520
She's in her room.
