Yan Chi.

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,360
This is for the famine in the northern,

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,360
while this is for the flood
in the southern.

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,800
(It turns out she robbed the rich
for the poor.)

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,680
(I've chosen the right Crown Princess.)

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,920
My father said

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,840
that the old codger

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,960
has been a rat in the imperial court

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,800
who accepts bribery.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,840
As such,

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,560
we're doing good deeds on his behalf.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,400
Young Lady,

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,520
what's your next plan?

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,680
No idea.

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,760
We'll figure it out as we go along.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,040
Oh, right.

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,760
Give me a second.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,080
(What's she up to again?)

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,920
Done.

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,960
Yan Chi.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,320
Pass this to Father.

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,320
This...

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,280
It's the safest plan for us.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,640
Think about this.

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,040
That old codger

37
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,520
has simply surrendered

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,240
his treasure to us yesterday.

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,760
There must be something behind this.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,440
Am I right?

41
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,200
Yes.

42
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,480
What if he frames us

43
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,680
and catches us off guard?

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,640
Therefore,

45
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,840
I can't drag my family into this.

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,520
We must run away.

47
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,160
(Father, I intended to achieve
something big.)

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,800
Father.

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,160
I intended to achieve something big.

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,680
However, I failed from the get-go

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,120
as I was captured by the bandits
in Fuyun Mountain.

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Father...

53
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,120
This is ridiculous.

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,640
Chi.

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,280
Follow Young Lady

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,320
and protect her secretly.

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,440
Understood.

58
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,640
But,

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
the capital...

60
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,280
I'm fine and I have plans.

61
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,520
Go ahead.

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,240
Yes.

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,600
Have you got the money?

64
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,480
Here it is.

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,880
It's so little.

66
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,040
(What can they do with that paltry sum?)

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,880
It's fine.

68
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,840
Afterwards,

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,920
we can make a living together.

70
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,040
With this money,

71
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,400
- (Make a living together?)
- we shall survive.

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,160
Yes.

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,320
Chuanling.

74
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,520
We shall bid goodbye now.

75
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,200
Huh?

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,200
It's a serious matter

77
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,640
and I don't wish you to get involved.

78
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,600
Please leave now.

79
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,600
Not so fast.

80
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,600
Suddenly, I think of

81
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,320
the fastest route to leave the city.

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,840
I'll lead you the way tomorrow.

83
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,880
You're reliable.

84
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,360
You flattered me.

for yesterday night.

94
