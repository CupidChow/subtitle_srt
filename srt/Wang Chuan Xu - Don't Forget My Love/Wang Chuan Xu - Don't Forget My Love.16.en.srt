Father,

look.

00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,520
For me?

Yes.

16
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,200
Try one.

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,160
My daughter is all grown up.

18
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,320
Didn't you say these were for me?

19
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,920
I wanted us to share one.

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,840
Is it good?

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,480
It's delicious.

One who has the Tiger Tally

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,440
can command all three armies.

we seize control.

As such,

27
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,880
I need to get inside
the crown prince's residence.

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,640
Chi,

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
I will find a way

30

to get you inside.

(and redress the injustice
the prime minister suffered.)

34
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,040
His Highness has arrived.

35
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you going to keep watching me
from behind there?

36
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,520
Mujin said

37
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,480
you've been busy
with work these few days

38
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,880
and often missed meals.

39
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,840
I brought you some soup

40
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,440
I made.

41
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,440
I don't know if it's to your taste.

42
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,360
Try it.

43
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,280
You made this yourself?

44
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,880
Yes.

45
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,240
It must taste bad.

46
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
Chi used to be the one
who handled these matters.

47
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,880
So

48
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,120
you came

49
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,840
to ask me to summon Yan Chi

50
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,280
to the crown prince's residence.

51
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
Chi

52
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,280
is the only kin I have left
from my residence.

53
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,960
Your only kin?

54
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,880
What about me?

55
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,480
Who am I to you?

56
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,840
He is my kin.

57
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,360
You are my husband.

58
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,160
All right.

59
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,080
Request granted.

60
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Everything is going according to plan.

61
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,240
The crown prince has ordered me

62
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,280
to enter his residence at once.

63
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,480
Good.

64
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,400
Find the Tiger Tally

65
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,400
as soon as possible.

66
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,640
I do not wish to wait a moment longer.

67
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,480
Yes.

68
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,360
Chi,

69
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
do you think

70
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,400
my father is with my mother

71
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,400
in heaven now?

72
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,360
Do you think

73
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,200
they are watching us right now too?

74
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,080
Prime Minister Yun and Madam

75
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,280
will always watch over you, Young Lady.

76
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,840
I will, too.

77
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,440
Your Highness,

78
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,880
have you heard of the saying,

79
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,160
"lead a wolf into one's house"?

80
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,680
Yan Chi is...

81
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,960
I haven't seen her so happy

82
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,720
in a long time.

83
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,040
Oh, right.

84
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,920
You said the crown prince

85
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,400
had the Tiger Tally.

86
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,200
Yes.

87
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,360
But I searched his study.

88
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,000
I didn't find it.

89
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,280
It might be on him.

90
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
This is a secret medicine
from the martial arts world.

91
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,000
Once consumed, it will induce
the subject to speak the truth.

92
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,400
Let him take this

93
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,640
and ask him the whereabouts
of the Tiger Tally.

94
