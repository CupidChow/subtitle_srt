Your Highness,
something bad has happened.

It's really bad.

Why are you panicking?

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,560
What happened?

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,440
Prime Minister Yun

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,400
canceled the wedding
at the royal court.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,000
His Majesty was furious
and was going to punish Prime Minister.

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,280
What did you just say?

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,520
What happened to my dad?

I...

Qianyu.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,200
It was just a rumor.

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,640
Prime Minister Yun is
the highest-ranking official.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,960
His Majesty wouldn't punish him
so easily.

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,480
Allow Mujin to find out
what happened first.

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,480
Then,

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,720
it'll be easier for us
to come up with a solution too.

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,440
I'll go with Mujin.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,600
All right.

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,320
Sure.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,600
Why aren't they back yet?

35
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,200
Chuanling.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,240
Yes.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
I miss my mom.

38
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
When I was younger,

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,040
my mom always told me

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,160
that after my dad retired,

41
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,800
we would buy a house in the countryside
just like this one.

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,560
Then, our family

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,720
would live a peaceful life.

Yes.

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,720

52
