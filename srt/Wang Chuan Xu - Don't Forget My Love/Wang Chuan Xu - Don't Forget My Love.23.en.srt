It's an ambush!

13
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,160
Prime Minister Yun,
it's been a long time.

14
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:12,728
Jun Lingchuan.

15
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,760
Seems like I've underestimated you.

16
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,200
Prime Minister Yun.

17
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,120
I'm sure Consort Wan

18
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,280
didn't want to see this
if she was still alive.

19
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,400
Shut up.

20
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Tonight,

21
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,920
I want the whole Dayu Empire
to perish with Wan'er!

22
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,920
Qianyu.

23
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,360
Son-in-law.

24
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,440
It's still not too late to submit to me.

25
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,760
We have our backs against a wall.

26
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,360
We will never regret it.

27
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,880
The people of Dayu

28
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,520
will never betray the empire.

29
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,440
Wonderful.

30
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,320
Men,

31
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
bring her here.

32
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:19,840
As long as

33
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,480
Your Highness
lets me into the palace tonight,

34
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,160
I will allow both of you to reunite.

35
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,440
When I succeed,

36
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,000
you will still be the prince consort

37
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,320
and enjoy a lavish life.

38
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,640
What do you think?

39
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,800
Prime Minister Yun.

40
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,960
Your plan

41
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,400
is ridiculous.

42
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,600
This girl is ill-mannered

43
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,320
and has been disobedient many times.

44
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,327
She's spoiled, capricious

45
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,400
and arrogant.

46
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,960
I've already requested
to end the engagement.

47
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,200
I didn't expect her
to escape the mansion with her guards.

48
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,520
Since you've retrieved your daughter,

49
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,200
you should educate her

50
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,640
and not take her out

51
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,400
to harm others.

52
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,360
Bah!

53
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Are you saying all that

54
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,760
just to deny your involvement?

55
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,400
Qian.

56
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,440
Do you hear that?

57
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,400
This is the man you've chosen.

58
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,080
Prime Minister Yun.

59
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,160
You've overestimated yourself

60
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,560
and Yun Qianyu.

61
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,400
The marriage is really just a deal.

62
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,720
I've already

63
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,640
gotten annoyed with her.

64
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
Qian.

65
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,000
Your Crown Prince is so cruel.

66
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:25,751
He wants

67
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,320
both of us dead.

68
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,480
In that case,

69
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,600
Qian,

70
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,640
you'll die first.

71
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,960
Your husband is not loyal.

72
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,840
I will definitely

73
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,280
avenge you as your father!

74
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,440
Qian.

75
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,640
Be nice.

76
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,400
It'll be over soon.

77
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,400
It won't hurt.

78
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,720
Stop!

79
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,760
You want to open the palace gates?

80
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,280
Don't you know the Yulin Army
is behind the gates

81
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,440
to defend the palace?

82
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,160
The Yulin Army
is the royal family's guards.

83
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,800
They can't be commanded
by the Tiger Tally.

84
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,680
Why take this risk, Prime Minister Yun?

85
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,400
Why don't I

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,320
exchange myself with Yun Qianyu?

87
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,440
I will become your hostage.

88
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,160
Your Highness.

89
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,680
No!

90
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,120
Hmph.

91
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,200
Your Highness!

92
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,840
Back off.

93
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,880
You...

94
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,240
It's a good deal for you,
Prime Minister.

95
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,720
Fine.

96
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,560
You are the smartest one

97
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,800
among Jun Heng's sons.

98
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,160
What a pity.

99
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,240
You also have a weakness now.
