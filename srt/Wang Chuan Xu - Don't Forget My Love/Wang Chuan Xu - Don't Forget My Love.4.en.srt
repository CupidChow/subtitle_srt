It's better to avoid
a femme fatale like her.

I...

I gave it to someone else.

give it to?

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,800
I gave it

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
to my future consort,
the crown princess.

31
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,960
What is this?

32
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,520
Tell me.

33
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,560
How did he escape from you?

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,320
Tell me. Why did you fail?

35
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,600
Please pardon me for my ineptitude.

36
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,360
You failed due to your ineptitude, huh?

37
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,760
Who is it?

38
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,200
Chi, it's me.

39
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,320
This is rare.

40
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,760
It's the first time you couldn't
tell that I was coming.

41
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,800
Young Lady, what do you need?

42
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Chi,

43
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,000
did you sleep well last night?

44
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,280
I fell into a dreamless slumber.

45
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,840
But last night, you were...

46
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,600
Forget it.

47
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,280
I'm glad he didn't find out.

48
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,440
Chi, you can rest.

49
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,880
I'll return to my room now.

50

(Two Days Later)

51

all you want.

52
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,200
I won't get married to him.

53
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,960
Young Lady, this is bad.

54
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,040
The matron of rites
are on their way here!

55
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
Stop them! Hurry!

56
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,920
My future depends on you guys now.

57
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
You guys are my only ticket out of this.

58

59
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,440
Today's weather is pretty good, huh?

60
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,800
Huh?

61
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,680
It's windy and sandy today.

62
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,520
Oops.

63
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,000
I think some sand got into my eyes.

64
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,640
(Old Man, once everything settles down,)

65
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,800
(I'll buy anything you like for you.)

66
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Your Highness, I thought His Majesty
already issued an imperial edict?

67
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,080
For some reason, I just wish to see her.

68
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,280
I cannot afford to wait any longer.

69
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,280
Who's there?

70
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,160
You!

71
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,760
Hold this for me.

72
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,520
Thanks.

73
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,400
It's you?

74
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,160
What are you doing here?

75
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,920
Miss, you're...

76
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,280
Isn't it obvious? Of course I'm...

77
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,520
Why should I explain myself to you?

78
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,960
By the way, why were you hurt
when we were in the bamboo forest?

79
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,320
I...

80
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,040
And,

81
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,720
you actually left without saying goodbye
even though I rescued you.

82
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,360
Actually, I...

83
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,080
Forget it.

84
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,160
It has nothing to do with me.

85
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,880
So, can you hold this for me?

86
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,320
Thanks.

87
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,840
Let's go.

88
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,720
You're escaping from your marriage?

89
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,760
That's right.

90
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,040
You're escaping from it even though
it was His Majesty's order?

91
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,520
Goodness.

92
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
What's the matter?

93
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,880
I'm at the peak of my youth now.

94
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,320
Besides, I haven't even seen
the crown prince before.

95
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,800
What if he's a stinky old man?

96
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,840
I heard

97
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,960
that the crown prince

98
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,720
is dashing and handsome.

99
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,800
Girls have to queue up all the way to
our neighboring nation just to see him.

100
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,080
That's right.

101
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,800
I've heard about him as well.

102
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,000
You guys should marry him
if you like him that much.

103
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,400
Miss, do you have
any place in mind then?

104
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,240
I don't.

105
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,880
Miss, you're the next crown princess
after all.

106
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,760
I'm afraid it's inappropriate for you
to wander alone.

107
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,680
If you wander outside for too long,

108
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,000
people might criticize you.

109
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,560
Why don't we...

110
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,960
Criticize me?

111
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,480
That's a great idea.

112
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,880
Why didn't I think of that?

113
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,520
Are you sure Young Lady
went to take a walk?

114
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,520
Yes. Young Lady said she was
going to catch a song performance.

115
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,520
That was close.

116

Keep a close eye on her.

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,560
Don't let her cause any trouble outside.
