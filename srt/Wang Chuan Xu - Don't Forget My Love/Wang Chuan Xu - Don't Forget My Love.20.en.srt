12
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,640
Where's Xulin?

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,480
He hasn't returned since last night.

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
Send someone to inquire about
his whereabouts.

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,360
Yes, Your Highness.

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,480
The crown prince has arrived.

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,080
Noble Consort Liu, I'd heard that
you and Xulin were childhood friends.

18
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,200
Now that I look at it,

19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,920
your relationship with him
is different indeed.

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,560
Your Highness, please mind your words.
Do not try to malign me.

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,920
Malign you?

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,200
What did I say?

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,840
Besides,

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,960
I heard that Xulin was your hometown
friend before he entered the palace.

25
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,240
It's a fact that you two
were childhood friends.

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,840
As for your relationship with him,

27
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,320
I didn't explicitly state that
it was love between men and women.

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,840
Noble Consort Liu, seems like

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,280
you've gotten the wrong idea.

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,280
His Majesty has arrived.

31
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,880
Father.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,040
(How did he know about that?
Don't tell me Xulin is already...)

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,040
Chuan, why do you say so?

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,600
Your Majesty, I don't know
how I've offended the crown prince.

35
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,880
He's actually slandering me.

36
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,680
Your Highness, you must
uphold justice for me.

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,280
I'm slandering you,

38
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,880
huh?

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,320
Father, I found out that Xulin

40
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,360
bribed a servant who was good
at holding his breath underwater

41
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,240
when Noble Consort Liu was pregnant.

42
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,440
He hid underwater

43
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,400
and installed a hidden panel.

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,880
After that, he spread fish food
all over the water,

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,320
causing the carps

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,440
to form a huge "Fu" word,
which means prosperity.

47
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,040
That's why it was said that the carps
presented abundance and prosperity

48
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,520
when Noble Consort Liu
was pregnant with the child.

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,680
Noble Consort Liu,

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
will you be able

51
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,920
to clear your name now?

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,320
At worst, you deceived the emperor.

53
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,200
At best,

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,640
you created a fake heavenly phenomenon.

55
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,520
Are you trying to shake
the nation's foundation

56
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,120
and destroy order?

57
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,840
My love,

58
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,720
is that true?

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,560
Your Majesty, I have no idea.

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,160
However, I can guarantee

61
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,920
that Xulin

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,920
had no such intention!

63
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,080
What's your relationship with Xulin?

64
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,400
Why are you covering up for him?

65
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,440
Your Majesty,

66
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,520
I can swear a vow.

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,920
Xulin was only concerned about me

68
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,360
because he was afraid that
I had it rough in the palace,

69
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,040
since we were childhood friends.

70
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,760
Hmph.

71
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,000
Bring Xulin here.

72
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,880
Xulin isn't castrated.

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,000
Someone!

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,760
Execute this beast immediately!

75
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,160
Strip Lady Liu of all her titles

76
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,880
and banish her into the Cold Palace!

77
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,760
Your Majesty!

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,520
Your Majesty! Please believe in me!

80
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,800
Take her away!

81
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,480
- Your Majesty!
- Take her away!

82
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,560
Your Majesty!

83
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,680
Your Majesty!

84
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,320
You are not to leave the Cold Palace
without my order!

85
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,840
Chuan,

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
is this the show you wanted to show me?

87
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,800
Father,

88
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,840
I've prepared a show for you.

89
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,040
Please join me.

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,320
Chuan,

91
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,640
you've changed.

92
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,920
I'm just trying to protect the person
I want to protect.

93
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm getting rid of all the dangers
around her.

94
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,960
I hope you will never
regret your decisions.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,720
I will never regret it.

96
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,080
The dart was coated with
Shihe Snake Poison,

97
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,920
a potent poison from
the Western Regions.

98
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,360
Luckily, Xie Yu
brought back the antidote

99
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,040
after he visited the Western Regions.

100
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,000
This is the only antidote I found

101
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
after searching through
the Pavilion of Artifacts.

102
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,680
Crown Prince,

103
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,640
please take this immediately.

104
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,720
It can neutralize the poison.

105
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,280
Thank you, Imperial Physician Jiang.

106
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,600
The crown princess
has returned to the palace.

107
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,480
Yan Chi is poisoned.

108
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,880
He was struck with Shihe Snake Poison.

109
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,680
I heard that Xie Yu, the envoy of Dayu,

110
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,960
brought back the antidote
after he visited the Western Regions.

111
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,560
You're the crown prince.

112
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
You can surely find the antidote here.

113
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Why must I save him?

114
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,040
Who is he?

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,200
What has that got to do with me?

116
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,680
Now, he's my only kin in the world.

117
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,240
Moreover,

118
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
he was poisoned

119
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,120
because of me...

120
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,840
Yun Qianyu,

121
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,560
do you care about him that much?

122
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,600
So, to you,

123
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,440
his life is everything, huh?

124
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,560
What do you mean by that?

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
You don't wish to save him?

126
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,040
No, I don't.

127
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,760
You...

128
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,160
You're the crown prince.

129
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,960
You just need to lift a finger
to get the antidote for him.

130
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,440
If you're willing to save him,

131
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,080
I'll stay in the Eastern Palace forever.

132
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,480
I'll become a sensible

133
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,440
and subservient crown princess.

134
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,800
I will obey your every word.

135
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,320
I'll do anything

136
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,560
you say.

137
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,720
Yun Qianyu,

138
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,120
you're still as gullible as always.

139
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,040
I married you

140
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,960
in order to shut the people up.

141
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,760
Now, I've achieved my goal.

142
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,840
What makes you think that you have
the right to negotiate a deal with me?

143
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,760
Jun Lingchuan,

144
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,440
you're a scoundrel!

145
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,040
You failed your duty
as the crown princess.

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,440
Not just that, but you also
mingle with other men.

147
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,800
Now that he's injured,

148
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
you want me to save him?

149
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,320
Do you truly think that my benevolence
knows no bound?

150
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,400
That's not it!

151
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,520
You said this before.

152
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,240
You...

153
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,360
Yun Qianyu.

154
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,520
Did you truly think that I fell for you?

155
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,440
Don't tell me you think that
your sugar-coated words

156
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,560
can conquer the heart
of the crown prince of Dayu

157
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,680
and manipulate him however you want?

158
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,720
Yun Qianyu,

159
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
your naivety is through the roof.

160
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,440
Has it never occurred to you

161
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,800
that you were the pawn here?

162
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,960
Stop it!

163
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,120
Stop it!

164
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,520
Stop it!

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,440
What's wrong?

166
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,640
Stop it!

167
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,720
Did you fall for me?

168
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,840
I...

169
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,200
I...

170
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,320
It's best if you didn't fall for me.

171

You can only blame yourself

for being too gullible.

173
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,760
You never change no matter

174
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,560
how much I deceive you.

175
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,680
Now,

176
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,280
I have other things to fret about.

177
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,400
I no longer wish to entertain you.

178
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,240
Leave.

179
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,920

your wound is...

181
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,280
Imperial Physician Jiang already
examined me. I'm fine.

182
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,960
Put this in Yan Chi's medicine
in secret.

183
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,880
Go now.

184
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,000
Your Highness,

185
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,000
he's your rival. Why are you saving him?

186
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,760
