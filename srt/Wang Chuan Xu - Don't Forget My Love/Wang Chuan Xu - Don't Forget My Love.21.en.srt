I have no choice but to bring you here
in advance.

Father, what's going on here?

50
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,320
The entire Prime Minister Yun's
Residence was wiped out.

51

I...

52
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,080

Where did you send him?

56
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,840
He has his mission to complete.

57
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,240
From this moment onward,

58
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,400
do not ask any questions.

59
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,840
Just stay here like
the good girl you are.

60
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,800
If so...

61
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,960
If so, tell me about

62
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,680
the truth behind the massacre.

63
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,400
The body looked just like you.

64
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,040
Was it just an illusion?

65
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,400
And Yan Chi,

66
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,920
he kept telling me to acquire the Tiger
Tally that can command the three armies.

67
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,320
Could it be

68
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
that it was all part of your plan?

69
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,880
I didn't expect you

70
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,360
to become this scheming and overbearing

71
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,760
after spending some time
with Jun Lingchuan.

72
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,880
Father,

73
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,640
just tell me the reason.

74
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,520
What are you guys up to?

75
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,680
Fine.
