It's my first time hearing about

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,360
Your Highness's ability

to make up something

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,240
out of nothing.

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,000
This is such an eye-opener.

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,280
Crown Prince, you flatter me.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,600
I was just

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,640
joking around with the crown princess,

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,520
right?

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,280
You joked around with her life?

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,280
Have you lost all decency

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,560
and propriety as a noble consort?

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,120
This is the Eastern Palace.

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,800
It isn't the imperial harem where
Father allows you to do as you please.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
You're getting ahead

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,520
of yourself here.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,960
But of course,

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
I don't mind

exposing your ugly deeds to the public

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,600
when I'm in the mood for it.

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,680
Someone,

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,880
send the noble consort
back to her palace.

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,760
I can return by myself.

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,520
Someone,

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,280
arrest Yan Chi.

37
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,880
Wait!

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,760
Why are you arresting him?

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,960
As the bodyguard of the crown princess,

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,160
he allowed the crown princess
to be in danger.

41
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,200
That's a crime.

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,920
Arrest him.

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,640
You!

44
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,280
Yan Chi!

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,520
Yun Qianyu,

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,360
seems like you've forgotten about
your own status.

47
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,240
Let me give you a reminder then.

48
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,360
What are you doing?

49
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,240
Move out of the way.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,760
I want to see Yan Chi.

51
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,520
Crown Princess,

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,560
please stay.

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,920
You are not allowed to enter

54
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,000
without His Highness's permission.

55
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,560
Your Highness,

56
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,640
I wish to return to
Prime Minister Yun's Residence.

57
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,200
His memorial ceremony is nearing.

58
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,840
You're permitted to leave.

59
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Is there anything else you need?

60
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,640
Yan Chi,

61
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,720
I want him to join me.

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,080
Bring Yan Chi here.

63
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,800
Yes, Your Highness.

64
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,920
Yan Chi.

65
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

66
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,640
I shall take my leave.

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,920
Your Highness,

68
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,520
you...

69
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,720
You're letting them leave?

70
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,800
If a person wishes to leave,

71
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,640
no one can make her stay.

72
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,280
But...

73
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,680
Mujin,

74
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,720
send someone to protect her in secret.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,520
Huh?

76
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm afraid Lady Liu

77
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,960
won't let her off this easily.

78
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,240
Yes, Your Highness.

79
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,440
Regarding Yun Qianyu's and
the crown prince's marriage,

80
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,560
His Majesty intended to rescind
his imperial edict back then.

81
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,000
But now,

82
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,680
the crown prince has taken a liking
to Yun Qianyu.

83
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,440
If she dies,

84
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,920
the crown prince will be disoriented.

85
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
By then,

86
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,400
if he makes any careless decisions

87
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,240
about the state affairs,

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,160
his title as the crown prince

89
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,400
will be threatened.

90
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,440
By then,

91
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,760
First Prince can use that
to his advantage

92
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,440
and become the crown prince.

93
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,520
So,

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,160
Your Highness, you mean...

95
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,080
Being His Majesty's favorite consort
in the imperial harem won't do.

96
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,760
If I desire a stable life,

97
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,520
I still have to depend on
people in the imperial court.

98
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,120
Although my family has power,

99
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
there's no one working for
the imperial court.

100
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,160
And now,

101
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,360
I'm at war against the crown prince
at his faction.

102
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,600
I should find another way out.

103
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:24,920
Yes.

104
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,480
Xulin,

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,360
I hope that you can deliver

106
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,440
a proof of allegiance
to the first prince.

107
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,240
Are you willing

108
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,360
to assist me?

109
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Your Highness, I will surely

110
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,920
fulfill your wish.

111
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,480
Please wait for my good news.

112
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,960

Yes, Your Highness.

115
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
You must stay safe

116
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,800
when you're out there.

117
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,680
