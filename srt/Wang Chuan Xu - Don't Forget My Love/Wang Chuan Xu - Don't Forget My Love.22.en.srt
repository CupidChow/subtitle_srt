12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,680
I want to take back the things
that were supposed to belong to me.

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,920
I'm going to kill the person
who caused all of these to happen.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,080
Few people know

15
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,960
that before I was granted the title
of prime minister by the stupid emperor,

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,760
I was Dayu's God of War.

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,440
My first wife, Wan'er and I
were living in seclusion.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
However,

19
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,880
the peaceful days didn't last long.

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,400
Dayu was attacked.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,760
I had no choice
but to put on my armour again

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,120
and separate with Wan'er.

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,480
Haotian.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,600
Wan'er.

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,240
We are the people of Dayu Empire.

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,400
We need to fight for Dayu Empire.

27
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,160
Haotian.

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,720
Sure.

29
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,120
I will wait for you.

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,640
However, my achievements
shocked my master.

31
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,040
I kept winning in battles

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,840
and made contributions
by reclaiming lost territories

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,520
so the people loved me.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,680
I was feared by the emperor
who just ascended the throne,

35
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,720
the brother whom I trusted most.

36
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,520
He pinned the crime of treason on me.

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,160
Wan'er.

38
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,040
What's wrong?

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,920
Aren't you already...

40
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,960
I'm a concubine of the palace.

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,520
Wan'er.

42
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,240
Did they force you?

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,520
Don't be afraid.

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,080
Even if I die,

45
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,760
I will protect you.

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,760
Wan'er!

47
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,680
Yun Haotian.

48
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,640
Won't you believe

49
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,840
that I'm doing this on my own will?

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,880
Wan'er.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,720
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Yun Haotian.

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,800
You should address me as

54
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,800
Your Highness.

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,600
I came here to advise you

56
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,920
because of our relationship in the past.

57
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,680
Yun Haotian.

58
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,920
Let go of the past

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,200
and serve His Majesty well.

60
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,480
Perhaps His Majesty can still spare you

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,960
and grant you a lavish life.

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,040
If you resist stubbornly,

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,000
you will only suffer in the end.

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,800
I still believe Wan'er made the decision
against her own will.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
To protect her,

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,440
I handed over my command of the army.

67
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,720
From that day onwards,

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,440
I had no longer seen her.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
A month later,

70
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,440
His Majesty issued an imperial edict
and appointed me as the prime minister.

71
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,320
Another imperial edict was
granting His Majesty's sister to me.

72
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,480
I endured the pain

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,200
and accepted the edict

74
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,920
as long as I can protect Wan'er.

75
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,520
Even if I can only look at her
from far away,

76
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
it will be fine
if we can live our lives in peace.

77
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,200
The night you were born

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,760
was supposed to be my happiest moment
as a first-time father.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
But that was also the night

80
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,160
when I felt the pain
of losing my true love.

81
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,880
Wan'er died.

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,840
She died in the cold palace.

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
General.

84
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,120
See you in the next life.

85
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,800
I only knew that Wan'er had always

86
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,520
been faithful

87
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,400
when she died.

88
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,280
Every compromise she made

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,720
was to exchange for my safety.

90
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,960
From that day onwards,

91
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,919
I swore an oath silently.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,040
I want the whole Dayu empire
to perish with her.

93
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,320
Are you trying to

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,560
usurp the throne?

95
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:38,072
He made me lose
the thing I cherished most in my life.

96
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,120
I want him
to experience the same loss as me.

97
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,080
He loves power

98
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,480
so I'm going to steal it away.

99
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,160
I want to take away his empire

100
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,440
and also his life!

101
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,440
I want to avenge Wan'er.

102
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,840
Usurping the throne

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,520
is a crime punishable by death.

104
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,960
His Majesty will never forgive you.

105
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,720
I don't want to see you die, Father.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,440
Father.

107
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,360
Father.

108
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,360
Father!

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,240
Death?

110
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,680
Do you think I'm afraid of death?

111
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,520
Father.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,800
From the moment Wan'er died,

113
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,080
I have died as well.

114
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,400
If I can't take revenge,

115
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,480
my existence will be meaningless.

116
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Qianyu.

117
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,360
Give the Tiger Tally to me.

118
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Qianyu.

119
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,680
Father.

120
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
Give it to me!

121
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,120
Father.

122
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,840
Your Highness.

123
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,720
It's as you expected.

124
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,480
Mujin.

125
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,120
Prepare for battle.

126
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,280
Well...

127
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,400
What about Crown Princess?

128
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,120
There are some things

129
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,920
that she shouldn't find out.

130
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,080
As long as I'm alive,

131
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
I'll protect her.

132
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,280
If it succeeds,

133
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,600
she will have peace for life.

134
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,560
If it fails,

135
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:38,288
the men at Tianji Pavilion of Dayu

136
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,760
will surely protect her forever.

137
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,080
How long can I live if I don't
take the antidote for this poison?

138
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,640
Your Highness, why do you ask?

139
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,960
The antidote...

140
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,240
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

141
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,920
Although this poison
doesn't kill immediately,

142
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,160
when it activates,

143
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,720
it'll be a living hell
