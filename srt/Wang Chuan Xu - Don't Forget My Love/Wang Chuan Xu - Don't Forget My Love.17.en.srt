Aren't you worried

16
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,680
that I might put something in your cup?

Even if you did,

Where is the Tiger Tally?

A long time ago,

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,840
I gave it to Qianyu

27
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,520
as a token of love.

28
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,360
What's this?

29
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,800

Jun Lingchuan,

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,560
answer me.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,280
Did you know about the murder
of my family?

34
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,400
No.

35
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,160
If I had known,

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,440
I would never have let it happen

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,360
and made Qianyu sad.

38
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,520
Why did you marry me?

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
I like

40
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,840

you.

47
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,040
I heard

48
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,000
Yun Qianyu managed
to sleep in the crown prince's quarters

49
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,440
last night!

50
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,840
That wench!

51
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,320
Young Lady!

52
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,880
Sister!

53
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,840
That Yun Qianyu

54
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,960
(Noble Consort Liu)
dares to make little of us.

55
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,200
Sister!

56
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,880
All right, all right.

57
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,800
Stop crying.

58
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,520
You will be

59
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,760
the crown princess.

60
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,880
Xulin.

61
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,200
Yes.

62
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,120
Where is the crown prince right now?

63
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,280
The crown prince is having a meeting
with His Majesty.

64
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,320
I see.

65
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,920
All right.

66
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,880
Let us pay a visit

67
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,480
to this crown princess, then.

68
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,080
Really?

69
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,680
Be careful now.

70
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,360
Noble Consort Liu is here.

71
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,080
Noble Consort Liu is here,

72
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,960
yet,
the crown princess didn't bow to her.

73
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
How disrespectful and unmannered of you!

74
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,960
I didn't see you greet me either.

75
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,200
I...

76
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,760
Sister,

77
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,400
look at her!

78
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
What a sharp-tongued girl.

79
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,120
It's no wonder Nianjiao

80
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,040
was bullied.

81
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,600
Your Highness,

82
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,720
you jest.

83
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,080
When one beats a dog,
one must answer to its master.

84
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,240
Especially since she is your sister.

85
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,840
Who are you calling a dog, Yun Qianyu?

86
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,680
Yun Qianyu,

87
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,800
a loose tongue spells trouble.

88
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,840
Sometimes,

89
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,160
a wrong action and a wrong decision

90
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
can cost you your life in this palace.

91
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,040
Do you intend to take my life

92
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,240
as you do to the other concubines
in the harem

93
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,080
by finding an excuse
and pinning the blame on me

94
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,360
to sentence me to death?

95
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,880
Who would turn an eye

96
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,600
to the death of one woman
in this massive palace?

97
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,840
Of course,

98
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,280
the crown princess won't die.

99
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,560
But you,

100
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,800
Yun Qianyu,

101
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,400
must die.

102
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,000
Xulin.

103
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,920
Yes.

104
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,120
(Noble Consort Liu came prepared today.)

105
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,880
Stop!

106
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,680
I won't let anyone
lay a hand on Her Highness!

107
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,040
I didn't do anything.

108
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,720
Restless, the crown princess

109
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,320
took a walk in the imperial garden.

110
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,600
But who knew?

111
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,120
An assassin infiltrated
the crown prince's palace

112
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,920
and killed her.

113
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,080
Then, the assassin

114
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,440
entered the outer palace

115
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,720
and was killed on the spot
by the imperial guards.

116
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,800
Crown Princess,

117
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,960

118
