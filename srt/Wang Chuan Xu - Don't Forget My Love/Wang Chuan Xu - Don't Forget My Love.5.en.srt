00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,120
Let me introduce myself.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,080
I'm Yun Qianyu. What's your name?

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,520
My name is Chuanling.

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,680
I'm Mujin.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,120
- Let's drink.
- Let's drink.

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,000
By the way, you don't look
like the locals.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,280
Have you found a place to stay?

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,640
Our Young Master...

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,680
It's our first time coming here.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,240
And we failed to find our relatives.

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,560
So, you came here
to look for your relatives.

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,040
No worries.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,320
I'm familiar with this place.

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,480
Pop in Muyun Inn if you need my help.

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,120
Muyun Inn.

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,040
What a coincidence.

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,480
We're staying there for the time being.

29
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,400
Young Master.

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,880
Don't we stay in...

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,200
How fortuitous.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,240
- Come on.
- Let's drink.

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,680
Eat up.

34
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,720
Retreat.

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,000
Qianyu.

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,640
Your dress is kind of...

37
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,800
I tell you what,

38
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,360
with this dress,

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,400
I, the Crown Princess,
can draw the public's attention.

40
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,920
Think about it.

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,520
Since I can't reject
the imperial decree,

42
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,560
I want the Crown Prince
to know more about me.

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,920
Are you planning...

44
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,280
I want the entire capital to know

45
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,160
that I, Yun Qianyu

46
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,280
am an unsophisticated and sassy girl.

47
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,240
I'm not presentable

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,520
let alone

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,040
being the Crown Princess.

50
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,560
(So, she intends to break off
the marriage.)

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
(She's indeed trying so hard.)

52
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,320
Let's go and get down to business.

53
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,800
Don't look.

54
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,160
Are you dressing up

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,560
to invite me to a meal?

56
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,640
Not really. I invited Mr. Yu too.

57
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,880
Mr. Yu?

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,760
Who's that?

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,520
I heard that the distinguished Miss Yun
is here.

60
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,880
Mr. Yu, cut the crap.

61
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,200
Let's get down to business.

62
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,400
I heard that Yugui Brothel

63
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,920
has unparalleled beautiful lads.

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,800
Beautiful lads?

65
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,960
Get me the two prettiest men
to drink with me.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,640
I'll act according to your order,
Your Highness.

67
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,120
I'll reward you handsomely.

68
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Sure, please give me a moment.

69
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,960
Qianyu, you...

70
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,760
I've asked around.

71
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,600
This Mr. Yu has a loose tongue.

72
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,160
Once he heard of
any dignitaries and rich

73
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,840
coming here,

74
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,000
the entire capital would know about it
the second day.

75
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,880
(She's indeed racking her brain
to ruin the marriage.)

76
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,480
I didn't expect you though.

77
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,680
Me too.

78
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,240
This way, please.

79
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,760
Hmph!

80
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,880
What brings you here?

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,880
I wouldn't have come
if I knew you'd come.

82
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
Are you blaming me?

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
Please don't hold grudges against me.

84
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,160
I'll feel bad then.

85
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,320
These pretty lads

86
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
are too

87
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,840
unrivalled.

88
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,840
I didn't know the standard
of beautiful lads of Dayu

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,360
is so extreme.

90
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,400
Is this industry not competitive enough?

91
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,920
Qianyu, if you intend
to look for beautiful lads,

92
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,560
what about me?

93
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,400
You?

94
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,040
Yes.

95
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,520
This liquor
is too strong for you.

96
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,680
Please try apricot flower brew
next time.

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,440
How much do you charge per day?

98
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,360
The customer has changed her mind.

100
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,560
You may go back now.

101
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Hurry up.

102
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,480
I won't charge you.

103
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,960
No way, you must.

104
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,120
Charge as high as you want.

105
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,360
The Crown Prince
will pay for the bill.

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,440
We must intimidate him.
