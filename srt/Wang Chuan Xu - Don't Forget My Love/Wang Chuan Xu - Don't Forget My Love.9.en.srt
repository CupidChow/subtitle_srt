I should...

Oh, no, Young Master.
You're being wanted.

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,920
Something bad has happened.

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,120
It's really bad.

This sketch looks...

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,040
Mujin.

Look at this sketch.

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,840
(Wanted Order)
Look at the fan in his hand.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,720
(Wanted Order)
Yes, it's me.

29

That's right.

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,320
Take a closer look at this.

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,320
Look at his poise.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,760
What a brave and valiant man.

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,560
Look at this.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,800
The sharp gaze.

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,480
His poise is unparalleled.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,560
This is obviously

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,880
our Young Master.

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,120
This sketch looks really cute.

Where's the wanted order I asked for?

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
You wanted me
to forge a wanted order

41

with the Crown Price as the fugitive.

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,960
- I'll get my whole family killed.
- He robbed the imperial censor.

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,560
- Although it does look a bit abstract...
- If anyone runs into this man,

(This is a sketch of the man who's being
wanted for robbing the Imperial Censor.)

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,480
(Wanted Order)
you'll be given permission to kill him on the spot.

46
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,440
Hmph!

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Do they really have to do this?

48
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,840
After all, an important official
of the royal court has been humiliated.

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,080
What about Chi and me?

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,720
They probably targeted me
because I'm powerless.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,600
This is not good.

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,080
Young Master.

53
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,600
We'll surely be done for.

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,640
We'll be done for.

55
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,040
What do we do now?

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,280
Don't worry.

57
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,520
You shall continue your journey.

58
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,400
Don't worry about me.

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,360
But...

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,560
My life is worth nothing.

61
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,120
I can handle this on my own.

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,880
But...

63
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,640
But...

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,560
Let me handle this on my own.

65
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
Young Master.

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
Please don't die.

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,560
Your parents are still around,

68
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,240
and you haven't had any children yet.

69
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,600
You can get up now.

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,760
Get up.

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,720
Yan Chi.

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,960
Chuanling.

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,240
If that's the case,

74
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,400
and if you don't mind...

75
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,560
Of course, I don't.

76
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,640
I like the idea.

77
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,480
You can keep these banknotes.

78
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,440
Keep it.

79
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,720
Find a place in the countryside.

80
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,280
It's more than enough for you
to live on.

81
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,880
Chi, you're really generous.

82
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,760
Chuanling.

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,760
Take good care of yourself.

84
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,920
Take good care of yourself.

85
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,760
Young Master...

86
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,160
Take good care of yourself.

87
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,520
Have a safe journey ahead.

88
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,000
Your Highness.

89
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,600
Do you have any better ideas?

90
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,560
Are we really going to leave
just like this?

91
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,280
Brother.

92
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,280
It's another day with no business.

93
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,280
That's right.

94
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,520
The guy still has
Princess Consort with him.

95
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,240
Which guy?

96
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
I dare you to repeat it.

97
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,200
Brother.

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,840
That's our chance.

99
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,480
This looks like a great deal.

100
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,800
Judging from his look,
he's obviously from a wealthy family.

101
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
We will get to have some nice food
once we get all his money.

102
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,040
Brothers.

103
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Do you want my money?

104
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,320
Let's talk this over.

105
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,400
Yan Chi.

106
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,400
Why don't you take off your mask?

107
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,960
You look really conspicuous in this.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,880
I got it.

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,040
Chuanling, you...

110
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,720
Guys.

111
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,280
I was very unlucky

112
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,240
as I ran into a few bandits just now.

113
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,120
Not only that,

114
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,680
I couldn't find Mujin too.

115
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,120
Then...

116
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,320
Did they...

117
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,040
No, they didn't.

118
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,880
I'm still an innocent man.

119
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,480
A very innocent man.

120
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,280
That's good to hear.

121
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,360
Have a seat.

122
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,120
Take your time
and tell us what happened.

123
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,400
Brother.

124
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,480
This is

125
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,920
such an easy deal.

126
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,680
Exactly.

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,120
Although we weren't attacked physically,

128
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,960
we were deeply insulted.

129
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,400
It was a first

130
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,320
for me too.

131
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,040
Let's get some wine.

132
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,840
Let's go.

133
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,760
Have some water.

134
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,480
You must be terrified now.

135
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,760
I could only blame myself
for my lack of experience.

136
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,360
I'm afraid

137
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,200
that I'll have to keep burdening you.

138
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,880
How could you call yourself a burden?

139
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,840
We're all in the same boat.

140
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,280
By the way,

141
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,320
I own a small hut somewhere nearby.

142
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,000
(This unscrupulous man
is doing everything he can.)

143
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,640
(Since he brought himself to us,)

144
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,600
(it'll be easier for me
to keep an eye on him candidly too.)

145
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Although it's a shabby place,

146
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,840
it's a good hiding spot.

147
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,920
Why don't we

148
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,360
take shelter there temporarily?

149
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,360
Then,

150
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,960
we can also take care of each other.

151
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,560
Chuanling.

152
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
You've been through so much.

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,560
Yet, you still worry about us.

154
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,160
That's nothing.

155
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,080
We're in the same boat, right?

156
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,640
We can only count on our friends

157
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
when we're not at home.

158
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,200
Yes.

159
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,840
Fine.

160
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,920
Hurry up.

161
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,520
Move the chairs and the lamps inside.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,880
What do you think about the flowers?

163
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,800
Bring this in

164
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,720
and place it by the window.

165
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,800
For the ambiance.

166
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,600
Get it?

167
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,920
Hurry up.

168
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,680
Bring both vases in.
