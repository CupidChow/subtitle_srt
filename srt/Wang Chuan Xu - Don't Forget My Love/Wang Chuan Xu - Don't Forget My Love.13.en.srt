00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,160
please rescind the order.

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,560
I will marry Yun Qianyu

no matter what.

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,480
Insolence!

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,080
It was Prime Minister Yun
who wanted to call the marriage off.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,400
He has humiliated me!

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,960
Father,

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,160
rumours are spreading among the people

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,280
that

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,640
the fall of the Prime Minister's family

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,000
is the deed of the imperial family.

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,160
I intend

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,200
to marry her

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,280
to silence those rumours.

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,200
Your Highness,

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,640
you gave me a scare!

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,280
I can't believe

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,760
you dared
to oppose His Majesty in court.

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,880
I once thought

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,360
that no matter

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,480
who I chose to marry,

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
it would only be a mutual agreement

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,640
to serve both of our needs.

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,880
But now,

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,480
I actually find myself partial

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,360
to marrying her.

39
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,520
Daughter of Yun Haotian,
Yun Qianyu, receive the imperial edict.

40
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,880
An imperial decree from His Majesty.

41
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,840
His Majesty is deeply saddened
by the murder of Prime Minister Yun's family.

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,680
The Yulin Army has been tasked
to investigate the matter

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,960
and apprehend the culprit

44
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,440
to console
the prime minister's soul in heaven.

45
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,560
Yun Haotian made great contributions
and shall be given

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,960
the posthumous title
of Grace Defender Duke.

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,320
His daughter, Yun Qianyu,

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,040
is good-natured and well-educated.

49
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,760
She will hereby be named Crown Princess.

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,040
As she is currently in mourning,
the date of her moving

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,760
into the Crown Prince's palace
may be postponed.

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,080
That is all.

53
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,640
There is no need

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,400
to postpone the date.

55
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,100
(Qingyun Palace)

56
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,760
In Dayu, it is customary to comb
the hair of the bride before she is wed.

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,800
His Highness sent me

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,320
to comb Your Highness's hair.

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,800
May the crown prince and crown princess
be together for life.

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,680
May you be blessed

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,560
with prosperity and abundance.

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,240
May your marriage

63
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,520
be blessed with harmony.

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,440
May your hearts

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,600
be forever tied as one.

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,880
It's His Highness's wedding day.

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,600
Be quick and efficient.

68
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
Mistakes

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,560
will not be tolerated.

70
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,840
Wait.

71
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,200
His Highness has ordered

72
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
all of these
to be changed to jelly cakes.

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,120
It's Her Highness's favourite.

74
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,640
Yes.

75
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,280
Go on.

76
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,000
(You look beautiful, Young Lady.)

77
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,520
Anyone

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,840
would be captivated by your beauty.

79

Tao,

80
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
you are getting cheekier.

81
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,840
I am telling the truth.

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,680
I wonder who will have the fortune
of marrying our young lady.

83
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,520
(I am certain you will look stunning
in your wedding gown.)

84

89

Prime Minister Yun's belongings.
