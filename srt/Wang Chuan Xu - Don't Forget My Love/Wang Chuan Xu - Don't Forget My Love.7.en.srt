Qian...

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,800
Young Lady.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,400
Why are you here?

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,240
How come you can find me every time?

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,800
It's not fun.

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,280
Young Lady, you left without
informing anyone

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
and Master is worried about you.

20
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,520
So, he summoned me to find you.

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,640
I know.

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,840
But,

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,320
my parents' marriage
was ordered by His Majesty.

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,120
Hence, my mother
isn't living a happy life.

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,360
I don't want to be like her.

26

Young Lady.

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,520
It's the imperial decree,

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,600
I'm afraid...

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,440
That's why

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,800
I left home secretly

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,480
because I don't wish
to lead trouble to Father.

32

Young Lady,

33

how can I help you?

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,880
Come here.

He's trying to steal my girl.

Have you heard of

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,000
any rumours about me lately?

39
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,880
Rumours?

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Never.

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Huh?

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,960
It's impossible.

43
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,120
Chi.

44
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,320
What's the date today?

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,360
The eighth of the month.

46
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,160
I must make a scene

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,920
and place a bigger bet.

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,240
Young Lady.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,040
You can't do this.

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,520
Why not?

51
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,280
No matter where Qianyu wants to go,

52
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,560
I'll accompany her.

53
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,560
You're my loyal friend.

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,560
But, you're not brave enough.

55
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,600
You can keep watch for me.

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,920
I'm good at this.

57
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,960
If so, I'll go with you.

58
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,880
Gallop.

59
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,960
Gallop.

60
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Gallop.

61
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,120
Later, the man who's going
to pass by here

62
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,720
is an important official,
Imperial Censor Lin.

63
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,200
I'm going to stop him halfway.

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm sure this old codger

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,760
will file a complaint against me
with other officials.

66
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,400
By then, my title

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,600
will be removed.

68
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,600
Brilliant plan.

69

Chuanling.

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,920
Keep watch over them.

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,840
Sure.

Yes.

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,960
You defend me.

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,240
Let's go.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,880
Young Lady

77
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
doesn't need your help.

78
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,760
What if I insist?

79
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,080
Whoa.

80
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,440
This is my territory.

81
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,640
If you want to pass by here,
surrender your money.

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,280
Get lost, thief.

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,480
Do you know who's on the carriage?

84
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,920
I don't care who is it.

85
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,760
I'm the future Crown Princess.

86
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,960
Surrender the money right now.

87
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,240
Crown Princess?

88
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,640
Nonsense.

89

Are you courting your death?

90
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,840
Who are you, brat?

91

Brat?

Official Lin, please look carefully.

94
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,200
She's not a brat,

95
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,800
but the future Crown Princess.

Kneel down.
