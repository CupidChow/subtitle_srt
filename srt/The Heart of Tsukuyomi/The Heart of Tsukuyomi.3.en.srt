1
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,166
This jacket is one I often wear

2
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:40,958
Should fit you

3
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,250
I forgot

4
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,000
You're still just a mushroom

5
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:56,541
Come here

6
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,166
Nice

7
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,416
Come on

8
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:19,375
That's it

9
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,041
Not bad

10
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,791
Cigarette smell?

11
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,166
Try this

12
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,750
My fiancée made it herself

13
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,166
Is this her scent?

14
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,125
This is

15
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,750
the scent of Shanghai osmanthus

16
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,666
Want to try?

17
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,375
You don't know how to smoke

18
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,666
You like this smell?

19
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,041
Your nails are so long

20
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,916
When he passed

21
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,958
were you by his side?

22
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,333
Being poisoned by Tsukuyomi

23
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,208
was it painful?

24
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,041
Tsukuyomi

25
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,625
numbs the nerves

26
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,000
There's no pain

27
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,375
What were his last words?

28
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,875
He

29
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,958
called your name at the end
