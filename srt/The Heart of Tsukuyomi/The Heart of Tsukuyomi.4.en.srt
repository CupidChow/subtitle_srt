1
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,750
When are you coming back?

2
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:19,083
I need a bit more time

3
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,083
I'm really curious

4
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,541
How did you take this ring off?

5
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,250
I've worn this ring for 7 years

6
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,208
Never been able to take it off

7
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,791
This is too strange

8
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,750
This isn't the ring you're familiar with

9
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,333
It's another one I gave you

10
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,583
This ring

11
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,458
was custom-made abroad by Yezi

12
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,833
There's only one in the world

13
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,416
Did you use some trick?

14
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,666
Magic?

15
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:33,833
Sorcery?

16
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,791
This one

17
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,875
is your ring

18
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,833
Right?

19
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,500
This one

20
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,291
is another one I gave you

21
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,208
Looks like

22
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,666
it's not my eyes that have a problem

23
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,208
but your head that's messed up

24
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,458
Father said

25
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,041
Only when you truly step outside

26
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,625
can you see the truth

27
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,208
What is this?

28
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,250
Father said

29
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,666
This is the Heart of Tsukuyomi

30
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,750
Inside is

31
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,041
Tsukuyomi powder

32
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,833
It's his gift for you

33
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,458
No need

34
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,083
The gift he left me

35
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,583
I've already received it

36
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,583
He's finally become one with Tsukuyomi

37
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,666
This must be his best resting place

38
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,041
Tsukuyomi has a short growth cycle

39
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,250
After July

40
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,750
They'll all die

41
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,250
Come back to my hometown with me

42
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,000
That's where you belong

43
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,583
Want some?
