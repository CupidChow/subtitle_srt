1
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,166
The ring?

2
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,041
It's gone

3
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,541
You're Gushan Qiyue, right?

4
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,041
What happened to you?

5
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,291
You look so different from the photo

6
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:30,666
This is mine

7
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:51,250
You...

8
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,708
This child is Gushan Qiyue

9
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,916
I found his photo

10
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,333
behind father's portrait

11
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,833
This Gushan Qiyue, who exactly is...

12
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,291
Your father's adopted son

13
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,125
After your father passed away

14
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,625
He disappeared

15
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,916
Couldn't find him for a long time

16
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,083
I didn't expect

17
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,333
he'd still be here

18
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,916
He's been hiding in the storage room

19
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,708
Do you think

20
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,458
there's something wrong with him here?

21
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,708
No

22
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,458
Gushan's mind is normal

23
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:14,875
It's just

24
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,333
his personality is a bit strange

25
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,208
Strange?

26
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:24,000
It seems in his world there's only his father

27
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,916
Now that his father is gone

28
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,958
He can't accept it for a while

29
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,791
So he doesn't want to see people

30
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,333
Seems he's been having a fever these days

31
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,208
That mushroom

32
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,833
is called Tsukuyomi

33
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,291
It's poisonous

34
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,750
Long exposure will make you sick

35
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,791
Tsukuyomi?

36
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:59,500
A new species your father cultivated. Highly toxic

37
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,666
If you accidentally inhale its spores

38
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,541
You'll get a fever

39
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,291
Mr. Rong died from this poison

40
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:16,416
This child knew it was poisonous but still...

41
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,083
He must be really suffering

42
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,250
Well, I'll take my leave now

43
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,166
Sorry to trouble you again, Mr. Hirasai

44
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,125
Call me if you need anything

45
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,041
Let me see you out

46
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:34,833
No

47
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,208
That's alright

48
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,208
Take good care of Gushan

49
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,375
He's a pitiful child

50
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:17,875
Eat

51
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,708
Did father ever mention me to you?

52
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,041
I'm quite curious

53
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,000
How he would introduce me

54
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,041
A biological son

55
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,666
Or a memory left behind in his hometown

56
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,625
He spent his whole life studying mushrooms

57
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,250
And in the end, died from mushroom poison

58
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,458
Ironic

59
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,458
Well, that's good

60
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,916
When these mushrooms all rot away

61
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,083
No one will remember him anymore

62
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,958
Not going to talk?

63
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:51,958
If you don't speak

64
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,041
I'll kick you out of this house

65
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,416
And set fire to

66
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,166
burn all these mushrooms

67
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,416
Can people

68
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,750
die quietly

69
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,875
like mushrooms?

70
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,750
I think

71
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,208
People

72
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,250
should first live hard

73
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,333
like mushrooms

74
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,791
Should

75
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,875
grow bigger and bigger

76
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,583
grow more and more
