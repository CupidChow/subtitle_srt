1
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,625
I have a biological father

2
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,625
When I was one and a half

3
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,708
He went to Japan to search for

4
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:18,875
a fungus he'd never seen before

5
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,000
Until recently

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,333
His friend

7
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,416
asked me to come to Japan to claim my inheritance

8
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:28,083
Your hair was way too long before

9
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,291
No one to cut it for you

10
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,833
It looks much better now

11
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,333
This journey about inheritance

12
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,250
seems like a dream

13
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,041
Real

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,541
or a dream that doesn't exist at all

15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,333
I still can't figure it out

16
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,416
You're Rong Yuewen?

17
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,333
Mr. Rong often spoke of you

18
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,416
He showed me your photos too

19
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,250
Nice to meet you, please take care

20
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,666
Oh, I almost forgot

21
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,791
Many people have been viewing the house lately

22
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,916
So I temporarily put these away

23
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,166
How rude of me

24
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,375
Though life has passed

25
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,791
Love and memories live on forever

26
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,833
I haven't seen him for over ten years

27
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,250
I hope he still remembers me

28
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,208
He left this house to you

29
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,458
I believe he must have loved you

30
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,083
I want to sell the house as soon as possible

31
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,458
and return to my hometown inland

32
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:08,958
Yes

33
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,916
I'll handle it as quickly as possible

34
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,333
Gushan Qiyue

35
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,208
Who are you?

36
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,666
Why are you here?

37
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,458
You're Gushan Qiyue, aren't you?

38
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,833
So it's you

39
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,416
who's been haunting this house
