13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,120
It's ... not that bad?

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,520
Just kinda bland.

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,780
That's because you didn't warn me.

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,800
I didn't know you'll place an order.

17
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
But you said that if I like someone,

18
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,660
I should get them some tasty food.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,360
That's right, but ...

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,460
What was that?

21
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,660
I said.

22
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,140
You said that if I like someone,

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,759
I should get them some tasty food.

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,020
Do you ...?

25
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,840
Yes, I do.

26
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,060
[Your heart rate rose higher than normal while you're resting]

27
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,080
Are you alright?

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,100
Well, it seems like...

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,400
Recently, my heart rate has been unusual.

30
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,660
I should see a cardiologist someday.

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,720
Shall I accompany you?

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,640
Uh.

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,980
Never mind.

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,980
Er.

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,100
P'Jade.

36
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,660
So ...

37
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,140
About what I just said ...

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,840
The thing is ...

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,660
You have to be consistent.

40
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,360
Try to be nice and take good care of them.

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,360
And one more thing.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,660
Don't be too direct in courting them.

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,380
Don't be too direct in courting them.

44
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,220
Nothing.

45
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,180
Are we going back?

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,580
Um.

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,100
Er.

48
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,440
I'm starting to have a grr grr pain.

49
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,420
A grr grr pain? What's that?

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,660
Ah.

51
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,520
Restroom is calling me. Mai.

52
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,740
Okay.

53
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,920
Argh!

54
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,300
Are you alright?
Aw! Aw!

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,700
It spilled all over!

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,010
Yes.

57
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,900
We can buy a new one later.

58
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,020
Forget it.

59
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,690
It's a waste of money.

60
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,110
But...

61
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,839
Let me help.

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,530
What a coincidence!

63
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,400
Jade.

64
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,960
Nong Mai.

65
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,970
What coincidence? We're in front of the office.

66
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,740
Wait.

67
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,130
Is this Mai's crush?

68
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,150
It's not Gus for real?

69
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,390
P'Jade.

70
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,470
Huh?

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,030
What is it, Mai?

72
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,050
Mai, you're available, right?

73
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,280
Jade, can I borrow him?

74
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,500
E-Excuse me.

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
I have a project with P'Jade.

76
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,520
Right?

77
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,100
Er... let's go.

78
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,520
Or we won't make it in time.

79
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,130
Never mind. Let's go.

80
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:21,840
Ha?

81
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,130
P' Sompong, hello.

82
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,930
Hello.

83
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,170
Hello, Jade, Mai.

84
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:34,620
Yes.

85
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,900
Are you sending it to P'Nok from HR department?

86
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,800
Yes.

87
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,650
May I help you?

88
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,700
It's alright , Mai.

89
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,350
I have to go.

90
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,040
Thank you.

91
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,830
Yes.

92
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,159
Don't forget to eat breakfast.

93
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,290
Hello, Aunt Su.
- Hello.

94
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,420
You arrived early as always.

95
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,800
Uh. Hold on.

96
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,110
This is for you.

97
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,740
I went to countryside home last weekend, so I bought it for you.

98
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,780
Thank you.

99
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,780
You're always kind to me.

100
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,720
Then...

101
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,610
Let me put it away.

102
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:12,970
Sure.

103
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,340
Thanks.

104
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,810
Mai.

105
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,480
You've only been here for a few months.

106
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,780
Do you already know every employee in the company?

107
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,630
Not to that extent.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,540
You're friendly, and many people like you.

109
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,710
How about I make a popular award sash for you?

110
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,090
I'll design and print it out right away!

111
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,250
Isn't it great?

112
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,730
P'Jade, you're so cute.

113
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,180
Ah?

114
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,340
What did you say?

115
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,800
Oh. Er.

116
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,380
Making sash wastes paper.

117
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,470
Isn't HR just promoting an eco-friendly campaign?

118
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,000
That's true.

119
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,370
Hey.

120
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,000
I can make it a digital sash.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,880
Digital.

122
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,070
So you can use it as a profile pic.

123
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,250
How is it?

124
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,240
Okay.

125
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,970
Let's go.

126
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,170
P'Jade, slow down.

127
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,980
Yes!

128
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,690
What is it, Gun?

129
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,920
I successfully booked a flight to Japan during Songkran.

130
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,480
This is the best price.

131
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,300
It should be a leftover.

132
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,210
You're just a filler.

133
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,990
It's fine anyway.

134
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,700
I got it at a low price.

135
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,880
Your trip with P'Uea will surely cost more than mine.

136
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,740
Jade.

137
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,159
Are you going somewhere this year?

138
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,540
P'Jade.

139
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,910
Huh?
- P'Uea is talking to you.

140
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,960
Are you?

141
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,050
What's up?

142
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,550
Nothing.

143
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,210
I'm asking if you're going anywhere this Songkran.

144
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,400
I don't think so.

145
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,860
I might have a family meal with my parents.

146
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,290
If there's nothing to do.

147
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,680
Hmm.

148
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,090
You're gonna miss Songkran celebration, then.

149
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:25,790
Nah.

150
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,860
It's the same every year.

151
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,700
Um ... then

152
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,080
Do you want me to get you anything?

153
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,679
Just enjoy your trip.

154
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,360
And bring me some tasty food.

155
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,220
Hehe.

156
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,940
P'Jade.

157
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,170
Are you free on Songkran festival?

158
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,830
Let's play with water together.

159
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,400
No, it's too hot.

160
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,570
I'm planning to stay in my room

161
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,440
and read comic books that I haven't read.

162
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:29,780
Oh.

163
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,780
The elevator is here.

164
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,790
Mai.

165
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,580
Aren't you coming?

166
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,520
Yes.

167
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,240
Is he being more quiet than usual?

168
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,310
Did I offend him?

169
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,950
Does he want a friend to accompany him on Songkran?

170
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,920
Holy sh*t.

171
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,490
Hey Gun. Did you see Uea?

172
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,790
Umm.

173
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,410
I think he went to the meeting.

174
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,980
I just saw that P'Bas took him away a moment ago.

175
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,030
Aw. Why still much work to do?

176
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,060
Yeah. Since you and I are going to leave for a week,
No doubt if we still have much work.

177
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,880
Er. Can I ask when are you leaving for vacation?

178
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,640
Yes, we're going off next week and coming back the day after Songkran.

179
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,790
Alright.

180
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,260
Tong.

181
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,180
You don't need to worry.

182
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,250
If you find any work you can't do,
you can wait til we come back to solve it.

183
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,790
Okay.

184
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,250
Tong, you know what?
When I started working here,

185
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,530
there were many things I couldn't do too.

186
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,330
Don't worry, okay?

187
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,800
You may take a break.

188
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,010
Thank you.

189
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,170
P'King.

190
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,740
I saw he listened to you but

191
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,530
I don't think he believes in your words.
- Hey, what did you just say? Gun.

192
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,980
Come on. I'm just kidding.

193
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,450
He seems to be a very hard-working guy.

194
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,770
It's better to let him help get our work done.

195
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,790
Otherwise, he might be feeling bored.

196
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,190
That's right.

197
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,190
He's working hard.

198
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,510
Not like you.

199
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,310
Hang on.

200
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,110
Did you just pick at me?

201
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,090
No, I didn't.

202
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,630
I just criticized you directly.

203
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,780
I can't tolerate you anymore. You better stop saying that to me.

204
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,460
Or do you want to have a fighting match with me?

205
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,370
Huh?

206
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,850
No. You better get back to work.

207
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,090
Huh?
- Get back, Gun.

208
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,790
I said get back.

209
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,740
Okay.

210
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,870
Ah. You come here to have a coffee, don't you?

211
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,970
Um.

212
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,250
The graphic team is so long still on the meeting.

213
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,360
I'm not part of that project, so I'm alone here.

214
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
Um.

215
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,210
It seems like we share the same mind.

216
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,390
You make your unfriendly face again. You know?

217
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,030
Smile, please?

218
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,700
come on.

219
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,950
Like this.

220
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,270
There you go.

221
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,220
You enough?

222
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,210
You always scold me, like ...

223
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,930
Like? Like what?

224
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,260
Where are you going?

225
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,780
Tong.

226
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,400
Are you blushing? For real?

227
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,050
[Have you ever felt this way?]
You're crazy. A man of few words and unfriendly.

228
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:08,050
[That you aren't tall, white, and attractive like others]
So hard to appease, but I like it.

229
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:18,260
[Have you ever felt this way? That you aren't rich, or stylish, but rather ordinary]

230
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,290
[I'm just an average man]

231
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,710
[But you came and change me]

232
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,930
[When I'm with you, my life becomes wonderful]

233
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,660
[And I began to fantasize]

234
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,640
Did I make you blush so you walked away from me?

235
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,670
Not at all.

236
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,800
Do you plan to go anywhere during Songkran?

237
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,180
No.

238
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,080
No one to bring with?

239
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,750
So, how about me?

240
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,970
No. I just don't want to go anywhere.

241
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,000
Why?

242
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,180
You don't like playing with water?

243
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,310
Um, how about...

244
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,650
Let's watch a movie.
- Gus.

245
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,100
Huh?

246
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,430
Has anyone told you that you speak too much?

247
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,010
If none, let me tell you about it.

248
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,120
Tong.

249
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,320
Tong.

250
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,850
Do you plan to go anywhere during Songkran?

251
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,670
Err. Gus.

252
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,880
I'd like to talk to you about something.

253
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Can you meet me after this?

254
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,930
Yes.

255
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,870
Tong.

256
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:41,980
Yes?

257
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,800
I just heard what you said to Gus earlier.

258
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,980
And I think you can give him a better answer.

259
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,910
I've seen this for many times too.

260
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,910
When using words, you better think of the listener's feeling too.

261
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,450
So, just think carefully all for your own.

262
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,830
The weather is so good, isn't it?

263
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,690
Yes.

264
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,150
Mai.

265
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,340
I've changed my mind.

266
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,940
Can you go play water with me during Songkran?

267
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,220
Yes.

268
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,220
My final decision is that...

269
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,030
I'll go play water during Songkarn this year if you join me.
- Yes.

270
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,220
I'd like to join you, P'Jade.

271
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:17,420
Err. However, I think I'm not ready cause it's been such a long time for me playing with water.

272
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,370
Mai, do you know what I should prepare for it?

273
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,490
Water gun, dipper, outfit, and one more thing ...

274
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,070
Money. My short of money and the monthly salary is still on a long way to come.

275
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,580
[Playing with my heart, you crazy]

276
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,380
[That caught me off guard]

277
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,570
[How did you fall for me? Tell me how]

278
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,810
[I can't figure this out]

279
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,100
[You changed me with the great power of love]

280
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,750
[For a middleman]

281
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,490
[You made me a man]

282
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,090
[In the middle of your heart]

283
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,360
Mai.

284
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,670
How do I look?

285
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,230
I'm not feeling ready.

286
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,400
You look so cute.

287
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,090
Do I?

288
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,050
So ... Can you take a picture of me? I'll send it to my mom.

289
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,950
Sure I can.

290
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,070
Okay.

291
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,450
One, two, three.

292
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,570
Well ... Let's take a picture together.

293
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,710
Okay.

294
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,670
Are you ready?

295
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,130
One, two, three.

296
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,180
Done.

297
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,770
Thank you.

298
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,190
How is it? Do I look funny?

299
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,990
Aargh! Mai!

300
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,110
Why do I look so funny?

301
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,810
But I think you look very adorable.

302
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,370
Are you sure?

303
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,980
Send me the picture.

304
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,930
Okay. I will send it via LINE.

305
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,230
Thank you so much, Mai.

306
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,050
Family group chat

307
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,010
Mom: Please be careful when playing.

308
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,310
Jan: Only do the old go out and play so early. Teens are going in the evening.

309
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,210
Jade: Are you making fun of me!?

310
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:45,170
Jan: No, I'm not. Have fun!

311
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,350
P'Jade.

312
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,430
Huh?

313
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,350
Do you know I have never celebrated Songkran before?

314
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,250
Wait. Is this why he looks sad somehow?

315
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,120
Mai, don't worry.

316
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,890
Just follow my lead!

317
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,550
P'Jade. Thank you for coming to celebrate the festival with me today.

318
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,030
Just the two of us.

319
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,270
It's nothing, Mai.

320
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:22,090
P'Jade will take good care of you during Songkran this year!

321
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,550
Are you ready to get splashed?

322
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,670
I couldn't be more ready.

323
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,790
So let's go!

324
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,010
Hey! We arrived all at once!

325
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,030
Boo! I thought only P'Jade and Mai are coming.

326
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,120
Bro.

327
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,720
The more the merrier!

328
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
If we're ready ...

329
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,720
Let's get started!

330
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,990
Mai, are you ready?

331
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,750
Yes.

332
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,110
Two bottles of water, please.

333
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,200
Sure.

334
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,430
Mai, we have to buy it for Gus and Tong as well.

335
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,430
Can I have two more, please?

336
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,570
Thanks.

337
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,830
Er ...

338
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,030
Can I have ...
- Gus

339
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,510
Two sets of fried pork and two sticky rice, please.

340
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,220
I'm here to accompany you.

341
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,810
Today you're ... quieter than normal.

342
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,010
What's wrong?

343
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,610
Are you upset about what I said that day?

344
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,370
Had I known you'd come,

345
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,830
I wouldn't have come today.

346
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,890
But the reason I came ...

347
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,140
is because you're here.

348
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,070
Your order is ready.

349
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,480
How much is it?

350
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,130
50 baht.

351
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,900
Stay away.

352
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,790
Why?

353
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,630
I'm gonna treat you to a meal.

354
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,800
Can you forgive me now?

355
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,240
No.

356
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,240
Buy it if you want.

357
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,700
Do you want some water?

358
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,550
Hm.

359
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,890
Mai.

360
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,780
I'll help you remove it.

361
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,330
Um.

362
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,620
Eh? Gus?

363
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,290
Oh.

364
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,620
Gus!

365
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,770
They applied powder to Mai and me until we can't see!

366
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,570
Boo.

367
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,690
P'Jade.

368
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,550
I know just by looking at your face.

369
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,660
But Mai ...

370
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,910
You look good covered in powder.

371
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,280
Haha.

372
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,460
What do we do now?

373
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,730
Are you tired?

374
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
Shall we call it a day?

375
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,830
I'm getting tired.

376
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,830
Today's weather is too hot.

377
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,540
I second that!

378
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,710
It's as if we're in hell.

379
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,830
So ..

380
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,880
Let's go home, then?

381
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,160
Good, i want to go home.

382
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,050
Because I've got a little headache.

383
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,700
Do you have a fever?

384
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,240
It must be heat stroke.

385
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,650
I've never told you that ...

386
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,390
I like you, Gus.

387
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,660
Why are you telling me now?

388
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,710
Then.

389
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,470
Do you want me to send you home?

390
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,050
Wait.

391
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,050
Do you want Mai to send you home?

392
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,610
Er.

393
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,300
I mean ...

394
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,480
both of us will send you home.

395
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,420
You two can continue splashing water.

396
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,370
I'll send him home.

397
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,700
Come on.

398
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,070
I can walk by myself.

399
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,900
I'm leaving.

400
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,490
Good bye, P'Jade.

401
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,520
Bye, Mai.

402
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,750
See ya.

403
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,780
Bye bye.

404
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,210
Take care of him, Tong.

405
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,910
Bye bye.

406
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,400
Whoo.

407
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,420
Gus.

408
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,790
Wait here. I'll call a cab for you.

409
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,670
It's fine.

410
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,090
Why are you following me?

411
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,910
To apologize.

412
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,930
I was foul-mouthed.

413
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,930
I shouldn't say that.

414
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,840
Some words ...

415
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,060
Speaker doesn't pay attention,

416
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,800
but listener never forgets.

417
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,520
[Playing with my heart, you crazy]

418
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,240
[That caught me off guard]

419
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,590
[How did you fall for me? Tell me how]

420
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,390
[I can't figure this out]

421
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,230
Mai, I'm so tired.

422
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,150
And so hungry.

423
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,010
But I'm so happy, Mai.

424
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,500
I don't really know how long I've not been playing with water like this.

425
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,590
You eat as much as you want, okay?

426
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,790
I'll pay for you this time. Mai.

427
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,460
No. P'Jade. Let me pay for you.

428
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,140
Since you joined me this time.

429
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,940
Come on, Mai. It's not a big deal.

430
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,370
You also drive me to work everyday. I'm more supposed to pay for you.

431
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,590
For 25 baht omelet with rice, this is definitely my time to pay him.

432
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,050
Alright. Thank you for your kindness.

433
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,460
Um.

434
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,620
If we can have dinner together ...

435
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,490
like this everyday, it's gonna be so good.

436
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,770
Does he wants me pay for him everyday?

437
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,620
I mean ... having dinner after work and before going back to condo.

438
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,380
Err.

439
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,590
Like everyday?

440
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,580
I think it's a bit too often. Don't you think so?

441
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,580
No. Not everyday. Just anytime you're free.

442
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,330
How can I find money to pay him everyday?

443
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,180
Mai. I might not have much money.

444
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,970
I'm just a salary man who make ends meet.

445
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,540
If I pay for your food everyday, I'll have no money for paying mine.

446
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,810
You pay me for food?

447
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,500
P'Jade. You don't need to do that.

448
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,740
I mean.

449
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,300
I want us to spend time eating together.

450
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,980
Oh yeah. Mai. I get you now.

451
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,850
No problem. We just have a dinner together.

452
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,260
Since you seemed so considerate, I just thought that.

453
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,150
Err. Let's skip it.

454
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:30,260
Mai, this sounds like you're alone and want to have a dinning partner. You know?

455
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,179
Do you like Songkran this year? Funny?

456
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,730
I like it.

457
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,360
Very much.

458
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,590
Good. Are you a person who like to do activities?

459
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,380
Um.

460
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:02,310
After Songkran in every year, our office will host the Sports Day.

461
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,060
You're gonna love it for sure.

462
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,860
Especially if we're in the same team, it's gonna be so fun.

463
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,690
Really? The Sports Day?
Yes.

464
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:16,430
It sounds so fun. Wish I could be in the same team with you.

465
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,620
You wanna stay close to a mentor like me, right?

466
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:25,130
Other trainees might be feeling hurt for sure.

467
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,220
Mai.

468
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,950
Can I ask you one thing?

469
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,630
You must tell me the truth, okay?

470
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:45,070
Do you fell in love with Gus?

471
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Hmm.

472
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:55,410
No, I don't have anything with Gus.
Hold on. You seem blushed now, don't you?

473
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,070
You're blushed and can't tell me the truth, right?

474
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,860
Don't be blushed. Mai. You can talk to me.

475
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:07,930
I can see when both of you look at each other.

476
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,570
Wait. Just a second.

477
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:18,500
What's up? Jan.
P'Jade. I need your help.

478
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,620
Jan. Why are you crying?
P'Jade. Can you help me?

479
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,460
Who made you cry?

480
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,980
Um. I'll be there in a hurry.

481
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,630
What's wrong? Girls.
What did you do to my friend?

482
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,810
Nothing.
Nothing? You don't admit that you're wrong.

483
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:01,700
I didn't do anything. My hand just accidentally touched it. Don't be serious.
But I saw it.

484
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,790
It's not a big deal.
Jan.

485
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,110
P'Jade. Help me please.

486
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,740
This man just

487
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,090
Just what? Watch your month.
Hold on.

488
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,980
He grabbed my breast.

489
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,650
You did it to my sister? Huh?
What are you doing you four-eyes?

490
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:23,580
I didn't do anything. You want me to sue you? Anyway, is she your sister?

491
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,660
Is this your front or back?
You nosy.

492
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,330
So nosy.

493
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,300
You all come fight me. Come on.
Stop. Don't have any fight here.

494
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,460
Hey. Don't fight.

495
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,810
Tell me what happened.

496
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,810
This guy insulted my sister.
Hey. Watch your month. I did nothing.

497
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,350
Your sister?
It's me, policeman.

498
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,710
This guy grabbed my breast.
You're slandering me.

499
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,420
I'm not slandering you.

500
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:59,620
Let me explain to you. Among crowded people. I just walked usually like this.

501
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:05,490
He lies. I saw him filming by his phone also. Policeman, you can ask him to show.

502
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,170
Show us now. Let's see it here.

503
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,940
So. Can you show me your phone?

504
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:17,250
Yes. Just see my phone, right?
You just show it to him.

505
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,450
Yes, just open it.

506
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,380
For you.

507
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,940
I see nothing. It must be some misunderstanding here.

508
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:32,140
How come for nothing? All of us exactly saw he did it.
I really see nothing.

509
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:40,420
How is it possible?
I don't really know.

510
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:57,700
Filming on the phone but nothing found. How is it possible?

511
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,110
How could we do next?

512
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:06,830
CCTV. Anyway, for these areas...

513
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:14,860
How about this way? Admit your guilty now so you take minor offense.

514
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,090
No, there must be a proof somewhere.

515
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,150
Think again, Jade Niphat. Where's the proof?

516
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:37,540
If no proof, I can't do anything. So, it's considered misunderstanding for both parties.

517
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,490
Very good judgment, policeman. Can I leave now?
Hold on.

518
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,140
I don't think you have just one phone, don't you?
What are you talking about?

519
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:52,570
Yeah. That's right. Policeman, can you search more on his body?

520
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,380
You have other one?
I have only one phone.

521
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,780
If you're innocent, you just let him search.

522
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,070
Let's go, policeman.

523
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,850
Hey. Jan.

524
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,620
Weapon on the ground. Lay it down.

525
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,750
I'm going.
Mai. Be careful.

526
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,830
Leave me. I didn't do anything wrong.

527
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,370
Here it is.
Hmm.

528
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,570
Here it is.
You go to the police station now.

529
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:32,460
Go for it. P'Jade.
This time, policeman just arrested. Otherwise, you'll see.

530
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:42,710
I'm alright, P'Jade. Thank you, Mai. If you don't help us, we would not be able to revenge him for sure.

531
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:48,610
Never mind, P'Jan. I just wanted to help you all.

532
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:54,240
Correct. If you don't come with me today, I have no idea how this issue will end.

533
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,910
I would probably not be able to protect you, Jan.

534
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:05,230
Oh P'Jade, don't worry. Mai. You're really good.

535
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,530
Awesome.

536
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:13,440
When he took the knife out, I had my heart in my mouth.

537
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,640
I was like.

538
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,820
Ouch.

539
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,750
Good, you helped me first.

540
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,840
I used to study some courses for self-defense.

541
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:36,320
You were still so great, Mai. How did you know that this bad guy has two phones with him?

542
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:41,610
Actually, I didn't know. I was just guessing.

543
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,340
Mai is the real detective. Me, a useless uncle.

544
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:49,460
Anyway. I thank you again, Mai.

545
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,260
I owe you a lot.

546
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,630
Don't think like that, P'Jade.

547
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,250
For you,

548
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,670
I'm willing to help.

549
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,200
Mai, can I talk to P'Jade for just a moment?

550
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,120
Why?
Come here.

551
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,520
We can talk in front of Mai.
No, we can't.

552
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,220
Is there anything between you and Mai?

553
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,180
He's an intern.

554
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,640
An intern?
Yes.

555
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,530
Wow. I don't believe you.

556
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:39,340
Even I handstand and see, I know right away that you two are in love each other.

557
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,870
Are you crazy?
No, I'm not.

558
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,810
There's nothing like that. Stop thinking too much nonsensically.
Hey. I'm not nonsensical.

559
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:53,910
You better go back home. Let me drive you.
No, thank you. P'Jade. I can stay with my friends.

560
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,040
And please don't talk about this issue to mom.

561
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,610
So, I'm leaving now.

562
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,610
Okay.
Bye.

563
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,790
Bye. Mai.
Take care.

564
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,820
Yes, sir. Bye.

565
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,290
Yes.
Let's go home.

566
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,460
Are you okay?

567
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,810
I'm okay.

568
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,160
It's such a desolated way. Keep your phone inside you.

569
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,060
You may keep it inside your pants pocket.
Yes, sir.

570
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,610
Are you really alright?

571
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:49,050
I'm okay. Will we go back home now?

572
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,930
Let's come home.

573
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,500
You don't hurt, right?

574
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,440
Thank you so much, P'Jade.

575
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:00,680
Exhausted?

576
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,630
I don't really know that Songkran is so much fun.

577
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,680
Thank you too for coming with me today.

578
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,280
Err.

579
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,850
So.

580
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,200
I'm going.

581
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,420
Okay.

582
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,460
When you arrive, go take shower. Otherwise, you might be sick.

583
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,700
Okay. You too.

584
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,060
Yes.

585
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,470
See you tomorrow.

586
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,940
Mai.

587
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,050
Why don't you tell me about wounds here?

588
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,480
Err. I'm alright. P'Jade.

589
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:45,540
Mai.

590
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,410
Come here.

591
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,010
P'Jade.

592
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,070
Err.

593
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:01,210
Get well soon. Mai.

594
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,180
P'Jade.

595
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,490
I didn't really know about this. I didn't want to lie you.

596
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,530
So, are you hurt?

597
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,820
I'm okay with it.

598
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:22,220
Not a big deal.

599
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,270
Fortunately, it was me standing there.

600
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,350
No.

601
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,390
No one should have this bad experience.

602
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,040
It was supposed to be me instead.
No.

603
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,610
It should be me but not you.

604
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:41,590
Mai. You're too kind again.

605
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,070
So that I'm so much considerate of you.

606
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,510
There must be many people who love you, right?

607
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,970
I don't really know.

608
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,510
I don't care everyone.

609
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:01,050
I care just someone. For now,

610
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,090
I care just only you. P'Jade.

611
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,440
Even you say like this,

612
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,780
Don't think that I'll give you extra evaluation points.

613
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,940
P'Jade. You know what?

614
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,400
I like you and the way you are.

615
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,820
Stop wondering a person whom I like.

616
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,230
The person I like is...

617
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,010
You, P'Jade.

618
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:46,540
[Playing with my heart, you crazy]

619
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:50,190
[That caught me off guard]

620
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,050
[How did you fall for me? Tell me how]

621
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,540
[I can't figure this out]

Directed by Thanamin Wongskulphat

623
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,540
Why is everything in pink color?

624
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,440
Maybe it's because I fell for you.

625
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,100
The feelings ...

626
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,360
that I have for you is real.

627
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:13,250
Can you give me a chance?

628
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,230
You might be misinterpreting your feelings.

629
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,010
What's the matter?

630
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,920
I need your opinion on something.
