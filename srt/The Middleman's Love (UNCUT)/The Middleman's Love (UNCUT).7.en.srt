4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,910
Hey.

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,250
No.

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,670
I don't.

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,860
Stop talking nonsense.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,960
We agreed to be just brothers.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,870
Stop talking nonsense and trying to be a matchmaker.

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,800
Really?

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,060
Yeah.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,820
Mai.

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,960
Mai.

14
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,830
P'Jade.

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,240
I went to find this for you.

16
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,520
Sorry for disturbing you last Saturday.

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,039
Did you...

18
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,520
Let me get back to work.

19
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,740
You must really like him then.

20
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,600
I don't.

21
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,440
Stop talking nonsense.

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Uea.

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,990
Don't you even think of making up with me?

24
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,810
I asked you to hang out.

25
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,470
Not for you to sit still.

26
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,950
Aren't you gonna talk?

27
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,290
How am I supposed to help you, then?

28
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,300
Can you really help me?

29
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,310
You've already heard that...

30
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,520
P'Jade only wants me to be his brother.

31
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,200
Are you giving up?

32
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,060
I've been helping you all this time.

33
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,510
I'm not giving up.

34
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,510
I just...

35
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:50,010
don't see a way to win his heart.

36
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,480
What are you gonna do next?

37
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,180
Are you feeling hopeless?

38
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,560
I thought you were better than this.

39
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,100
Mai. Mai.

40
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,790
What should we have for dinner?

41
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,050
A buffet?

42
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,380
Or duck noodles?

43
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,690
Uh.

44
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,300
Do you wanna eat something else?

45
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,480
Mai.

46
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,290
Are you alright?

47
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,670
Can you stop messing with me?

48
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,320
From now on, let's stop hanging out together

49
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,650
and keep some distance.

50
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,630
Mai... why?

51
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,980
Isn't this what you want?

52
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,990
No, I don't...
- I don't want to hear anything else.

53
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,900
I don't wanna like someone like you anymore.

Let's eat. Things get better after you eat.

65

Wherever I go, I see Mai.

66
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,780
It expires tomorrow.

67
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,070
Mai haven't replied to my messages. What do I do?

68
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,710
What should I do?

69
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,180
Hello, Mai.

70
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,530
Hello, Jade.

71
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,370
Er.

72
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,850
What's up, King?

73
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,799
I'm fighting with Uea.

74
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,800
It's serious this time.

75
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,790
I...

76
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,470
I can't be a man Uea wants me to be.

77
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,000
What is this about?

78
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,860
I don't wanna talk about it right now.

79
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,800
You don't need to know.

80
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,050
I'm hanging up. Take care of Uea for me.

81
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,640
What? King?

82
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,570
King is still upset about Mr. Boom.

83
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,140
What are you arguing about?

84
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,270
It's really nothing.

85
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,090
I just greeted him as usual.

86
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,750
But King overthinked.

87
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,120
I've already explained

88
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
so I don't know why he's jealous.

89
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,620
Isn't King always that type of person?

90
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,580
But jealousy...

91
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,110
is a sensitive matter.

92
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,870
Hm.

93
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,080
I know.

94
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,140
Was your fight serious this time?

95
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,140
Not really.

96
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,800
He's just sulky.

97
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,270
He'll be better soon.

98
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,760
Forget it.

99
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,190
Um.

100
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,840
Let's talk about you.

101
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,480
Me?

102
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,640
Um?

103
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,820
What about me?

104
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,780
How are things going between you and Mai?

105
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,350
The atmosphere has been tensed for a week.

106
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,520
I just...

107
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,730
What?

108
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,280
Just what?

109
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,940
I told King...

110
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,700
that Mai and I are just brothers.

111
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,980
And Mai overheard it.

112
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,780
I was being honest, though.

113
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,400
I think I'm not suitable for him.

114
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,480
What's the criteria for that?

115
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,980
Are you sure you want things to turn out this way?

116
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,870
Think about it carefully.

117
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,670
Are you happy?

118
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,690
You aren't deluding yourself out of fear, right?

119
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,430
I was also afraid of love.

120
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,890
You know that love hurt me so many times.

121
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,670
Um.

122
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,120
But if you don't try to fall in love,

123
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,630
and always hide from it,

124
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,530
you will lose him for real.

125
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,360
Answer him.

126
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,060
Or else he'll go crazy.

127
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,990
Where are you?

128
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,430
Are you interested?

129
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,880
You aren't coming back anyway.

130
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,380
Aren't you gonna try to please me even just a little?

131
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,130
Fine. I'll do it.

132
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,060
Uea, my dear. Please come back home.

133
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,710
Please?

134
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,530
Pretty please?

135
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,090
How could I sleep without you in my arms?

136
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,970
Mhm.

137
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,310
I'll be back.

138
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,400
That's it.

139
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,430
Are you going back right away?

140
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,430
Mhm.

141
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,890
I... don't want to be alone.

142
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,660
Uea.

143
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,510
Huh?

144
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,090
Don't tell King yet that I ask you for love advice.

145
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,490
Jade.

146
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,830
Do you really think others can't tell?

147
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,530
I was also afraid of love.

148
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,250
You know that love hurt me so many times.

149
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,500
But if you don't try to fall in love,

150
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,890
and always hide from it,

151
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,780
you will lose him for real.

152
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,350
(Pleasant memories with my intern.)

153
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,420
(Interview x 3)
(First meeting!!!)

154
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,750
Of course, we will welcome you! Nong Phakin!

155
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,980
Thanks!

156
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,050
(Mai came up with a name "Jade, the middleman" for me. I love it!)

157
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,089
Jade, the middleman?

158
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,270
I like it!

159
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,920
Did you say you like me?

160
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,930
Yes! I like this name so much!

161
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,320
(I introduced Mai to Sakoo. Sakoo was very happy.)

162
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,230
Think about it carefully. Are you happy?

163
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,140
You aren't deluding yourself out of fear, right?

164
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,660
Jade.

165
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,710
Why are your eyes so puffy?

166
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,180
Uea.

167
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,350
About what you told me to consider...

168
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,070
I thought about it.

169
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,380
I...

170
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,520
I don't want to let him go.

171
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,830
I know I'm stupid.

172
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,560
Easy.

173
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,710
I think Mai hates me.

174
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,740
What should I do?

175
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,630
So...

176
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,950
Why don't you try approaching him first?

177
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,590
How?

178
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,950
Well.

179
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,470
Remember all the things he had done for you?

180
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,410
Try to do the same for him.

181
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,090
What if it doesn't work?

182
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,950
You only live once, Jade.

183
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,040
I'm scared.

184
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,780
Are you afraid of getting rejected?

185
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,070
Are you even more afraid of losing him?

186
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,190
You don't have to answer me right now.

187
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,830
Just think about it.

188
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,310
Keep fighting!

189
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,350
Keep fighting.

190
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,070
Mai, I made you a cup of coffee.

191
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,990
A Latte?

192
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,490
Yes!

193
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,710
I don't like coffee with milk.

194
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,210
Er.

195
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,610
No problem.

196
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,110
I'll drink it.

197
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,510
This is for you.

198
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,080
[Playing with my heart, you crazy?]

199
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,800
[That caught me off guard]

200
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,400
[How did you fall for me? Tell me how]

201
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,230
[I can’t figure this out]

202
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,620
[You changed me with the great power of love]

203
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,980
[For a middleman]

204
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,080
[Drop me off, pick me up, never complain]

205
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,030
[Nobody can resist that]

206
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:11,070
[Because of your relentless loveliness, I love you with all my heart]

207
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,670
Mai.

208
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,930
Here.

209
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:20,360
[But how much longer do I have to wait?]

210
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,790
[My heart surrenders]

211
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,120
Mai, are you free this evening?

212
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,120
Can we go...

213
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,090
I'm not available today.

214
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,140
How about tomorrow?

215
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,880
I have something to do tomorrow.

216
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,870
I'm sorry.

217
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,920
Um.

218
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,320
If you're done,

219
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,830
shall we leave?

220
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,500
Mhm, sure.

221
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,980
(Director's pork buffet
Open every day on 4 p.m. - 10 p.m.)

222
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,070
Hm.

223
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,210
P'Jade.

224
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,590
P'Jade.

225
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,450
Bwaaaah.

226
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,750
P'Jade.

227
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,610
No more please!

228
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,030
Can I sit with you?

229
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,370
Excuse me,

230
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,930
I'd like to order.

231
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,370
What would you like?

232
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,890
I'd like one pork hot pot please.

233
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,850
Yes.

234
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,610
Anything else?

235
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,210
No.

236
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,930
Please wait a minute.

237
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,610
Did you follow me here?

238
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,990
No.

239
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,710
How could I know where you at?

240
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,050
This.

241
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,320
Why don't you eat with your favorite style?

242
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,390
Where you boil the pork one by one.

243
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,480
I'm lazy.

244
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,640
Then, I'll do it for you.

245
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,160
Huh?

246
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,020
Bring it here, I'll do it.

247
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,960
I'll do what you like.

248
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,840
Why are you doing this?

249
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:12,020
My mom told me you can sweeten the soup by putting the veggies in.

250
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,200
Like this.

251
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,700
My mom likes hot pot,

252
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,420
like this.

253
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,780
What's wrong?

254
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,680
Since you mentioned your mom,

255
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,580
I miss my mom too.

256
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,660
If you want to eat hot pot in a more delicious way, you have to put veggies inside first.

257
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,480
Like this.

258
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,520
Put the veggies in.

259
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,020
For the pork,

260
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,460
you have to cover it with egg. It'll taste better.

261
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,640
See?

262
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,920
Well, this boy.

263
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,520
Aren't you gonna talk to your mom?

264
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,900
Well, I'm...

265
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,480
You're lazy to talk.

266
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,720
I knew.

267
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,960
It's ready to eat.

268
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,000
Eat this, I've already put the sauce on it.

269
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,780
How was it? Was it good?

270
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,500
It's normal.

271
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,740
Normal again?

272
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,200
You've never said what you like or don't like

273
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,360
or even said you love me.

274
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,080
Thank you.

275
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,820
Gus.

276
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,540
You have to talk more.

277
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:49,260
If you don't talk, people won't know what you think.

278
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,920
Yes.

279
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,540
I love you.

280
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,179
Why don't you wait to hear "I love you" from me?

281
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,780
That's why you say you aren't a talkative person, right?

282
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,020
I'm...

283
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,300
sorry.

284
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,620
I'm sorry about your mom.

285
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,080
It's okay.

286
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,960
When I think about her,

287
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,860
I want to become a person she wanted me to be.

288
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So, I try to talk more.

289
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,620
Are you happy with

290
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,260
changing yourself like this?

291
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,080
I'm not sad.

292
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,080
Gus.

293
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,800
I think

294
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,540
you can be what you want to be,

295
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,660
be who you are.

296
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,780
It's the best.

297
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,460
Why did you follow me?

298
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,180
I'm taking you home.

299
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,520
Being nice to me like this would make me surmise that you like me.

300
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,740
I don't wanna give myself a hope,

301
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,980
if you don't like me.

302
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,640
I've never said I don't like you.

303
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,420
Umm, I know you don't like me.

304
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,460
Huh?

305
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,020
What did you say?

306
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,000
About that day,

307
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,580
that I told you to think about it

308
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,500
You mean...

309
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,340
dating?

310
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,860
Yeah.

311
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,340
You have never annoyed me.

312
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,580
I'm just

313
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,980
a foul-mouthed person.

314
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,340
I'm really sorry.

315
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,380
I promise I'll be a nicer person.

316
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,140
Please wait for me.

317
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,300
You're smiling.

318
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,450
So you know how to smile?

319
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,760
Yes, I do.

320
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,620
You're smiling too.

321
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,100
I like when you smile.

322
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,180
I like it more than your sad face.

323
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,720
Tong.

324
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,200
If you aren't ready,

325
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,400
I'll stop.

326
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,100
I'm ready.

327
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,940
I'm ready since I first met you.

328
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,500
Then, I'll do it.

329
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,260
Go ahead.

330
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,780
You have my consent.

331
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,740
Please stop bothering me.

332
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,260
Isn't this what you want?

333
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,020
No! I'm not..

334
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,680
I don't want to hear anything.

335
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,400
I don't want to like you anymore.

336
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,100
Ouch! It's hot.

337
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,360
What brings you home?

338
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,860
I'm bored.

339
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,960
Unfortunately, Jet isn't here to have lunch together.

340
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,420
I called him, he said he's coming.

341
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,100
Really?

342
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,800
That's good, I made him his favorite.

343
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,060
What about my fried chicken?

344
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,500
We can save it for dinner.

345
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,420
Hey, let's have lunch.

346
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,540
Wow, fried fish.

347
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:07,900
Your favorite.

348
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,320
You said you were gonna make fried chicken for me at lunch time.

349
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,300
Just wait at a dinner time.

350
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,460
Jan.

351
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,720
Give her more.

352
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,500
More.

353
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,460
Here is tofu.

354
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,300
Why is there no chili sauce with fried fish?

355
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,400
Here you are.

356
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,160
Why don't you eat, P'Jade?

357
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,880
I'm not hungry.

358
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,140
Are you not feeling well?

359
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,160
You've never refused to eat.

360
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,160
You seem strange today.

361
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,080
Normally, you can eat anything,

362
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,360
no matter whose favorite dish we have.

363
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,760
Yeah, that's right.

364
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,640
You've become more selective with food now, huh?

365
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,280
About the fried chicken, I'll...

366
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,580
Jan, papa, mama!

367
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,720
I can eat anything doesn't mean I don't have any favorite dishes.

368
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,000
When I have a bad time, I just want to eat what I like,

369
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,340
do what I want.

370
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:36,680
I always play along doesn't mean I don't want anything.

371
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,700
Why is no one understand me?

372
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,820
Hey, Jade!

373
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,460
What is this all about?

374
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,040
What is this?

375
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,100
Papa, mama, I bought...

376
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,140
What?

377
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,440
P'Jade.

378
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,480
P'Jade.

379
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,600
Jan.

380
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,660
I'm sorry.

381
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,300
I'm not mad at you.

382
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,600
Papa, mama,

383
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,640
and me,

384
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,900
we care about you.

385
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,500
Umm, I know.

386
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,100
P'Jade.

387
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,060
Did you know

388
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,100
I'm so grateful

389
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,460
to have a brother like you and P'Jet?

390
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,340
I like when you spoil me.

391
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,160
I like when you play with me.

392
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:16,480
I know you surrender to me and P'Jet

393
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,680
because you want to be fair for us.

394
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:29,500
I'm sorry if I make you feel bad.

395
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,280
I know that is not about food, right?

396
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,940
I'm...I'm not

397
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,380
It's my fault.

398
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,620
I'm...

399
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:12,160
There's a lot going on in my mind so I said something bad like that.

400
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,180
It's not bad at all.

401
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,660
I'm glad you said it out.

402
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,160
You aren't mad at me, right?

403
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,260
I'm not.

404
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:35,280
I want you to know that we care about you.

405
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,100
Yes, Jade.

406
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,820
Everybody cares about you.

407
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,440
P'Jet.

408
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,440
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

409
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,500
You did nothing wrong.

410
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,820
Why you have to say sorry?

411
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,060
Yes.

412
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:09,480
I'm...

413
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,840
You can tell us anything.

414
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:18,380
If it's about work, I might not be able to say anything much.

415
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,460
But if it's about love, you can talk to me.

416
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,400
I'm...

417
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,140
Let's talk about that later.

418
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,060
Let Jade eat first.

419
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,000
When you're full, you can tell us.

420
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,880
Let's go, papa and mama are waiting.

421
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,660
I bought fried chicken for you.

422
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,660
Did you buy me fried chicken?

423
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,920
Yes, I'm about to tell you but you ran away.

424
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,000
Let's eat.

425
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,300
Let's go.

426
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,280
Let's go.

427
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,280
I'm hungry.

428
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,720
Papa, Mama, I'm sorry.

429
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,420
It's my fault.

430
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,060
I should say sorry to you.

431
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,600
It's my fault.

432
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,600
I always force you.

433
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,680
You don't complain so it makes me think you're ok.

434
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,680
I want you to know that I love you

435
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,480
and care about you as much as Jet and Jan.

436
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,160
I know.

437
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:17,060
If you want anything, you have to say it.

438
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:19,060
Don't keep it to yourself.

439
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,360
About the fried chicken,

440
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,240
I didn't forget.

441
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,900
I marinated it for dinner.

442
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,540
Yes, mama.

443
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,960
I'm sorry.

444
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,360
I'm sorry papa.

445
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,300
I'm not mad at you.

446
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,960
I'm worried about you.

447
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:58,580
If you're stressed about thing at work, you can tell me and your mom

448
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,660
or tell Jet and Jan.

449
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,400
Don't keep it to yourself.

450
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,820
Yes, papa.

451
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,540
There are a lot of things I have to think about.

452
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,560
Papa and mama aren't mad at me, right?

453
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,340
We're not.

454
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,140
Come on, group hug.

455
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,540
Let's eat fried chicken.

456
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,380
Let's eat.

457
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,500
Love oh love makes a man goofed up.

458
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,200
Jan.

459
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,380
What?

460
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,380
You wanna tell me now?

461
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,540
Umm.

462
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,020
Well...

463
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,520
I have a crush on someone.

464
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:37,780
Umm.

465
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,400
Mai, right?

466
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:42,400
Yes.

467
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,160
Hey!

468
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,680
How did you know?!

469
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,020
Who told you? Tell me!

470
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,440
Why you play with your saliva?

471
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,880
Why did you shout so loud?

472
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,200
Anyone can tell.

473
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,380
Mai seems to like you too.

474
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,500
What's the problem?

475
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,240
Well...

476
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,260
I'm...

477
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,160
Don't tell me that

478
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,600
Umm.

479
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,240
Yes.

480
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,040
I said something bad, I rejected him.

481
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,140
What should I do?

482
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,700
So what?

483
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,340
You rejected him and then miss him.

484
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,260
It's so cliche.

485
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:39,960
Jan.

486
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,020
Why you know so well?

487
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,220
I've seen a lot.

488
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,320
Go make up with him. Have you done that?

489
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,420
Yes, I have.

490
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,940
I tried every way but he ignored me.

491
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,400
Here.

492
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,500
Look, he doesn't reply my text.

493
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,240
It's clear.

494
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,060
It's obvious.

495
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,620
What?

496
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:23,980
Have you heard that when people we like don't reply our text, there's only one reason?

497
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,820
What is it?

498
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,680
They want you to meet you in person.

499
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,860
You should go.

500
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,860
Are you crazy?

501
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,280
You're talking nonsense.

502
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,120
Crazy.

503
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,640
Go meet him.

504
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,880
He doesn't even reply my text.

505
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,760
Yes, P'Jade.

506
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,760
Er...Mai.

507
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,960
I'm in front of your place.

508
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,320
Can you come see me?

509
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,880
I can't.

510
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:38,540
I'm sorry for bothering you.

511
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,850
Hang on, P'Jade!

512
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:42,660
You're not a bother.

513
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:46,020
I'm in Kanchanaburi, so I can't meet you.

514
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,260
Are you free tomorrow?

515
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,430
Can we meet up?

516
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:53,460
What do you think?

517
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,910
Yes! Yes! I'm free!

518
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,500
See you tomorrow, Mai.

519
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,020
Yes.

520
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,320
See you tomorrow.

521
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:07,980
Yes!

522
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:08,790
Hooray!

523
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,790
Your warm milk is ready.

524
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:13,970
Hahaha. What are you so excited about?

525
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,970
Mom!
- Hahaha.

526
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,940
Mom, it's P'Jade!

527
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:18,470
What?

528
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:22,010
He said he's at my condo! He wants to see me!

529
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:25,340
You're gonna rush back to Bangkok tomorrow, aren't you?

530
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,830
Yes, we've agreed to meet up.

531
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:29,830
Whoa.

532
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,110
Congratulations!

533
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:34,450
Everything I did was worth it.

534
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,300
Hehe.

535
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:40,670
Are you giving up?

536
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,700
I'm not.

537
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,340
I'll continue to flirt with P'Jade.

538
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,950
And try to let him know...

539
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,800
that I really like him.

540
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,120
Well said! That's the spirit!

541
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:04,700
Let me tell you something, then.

542
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,130
When you turned and left,

543
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:10,130
Jade almost cried.

544
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,730
Does that mean...?

545
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,800
He must like you very much as well.

546
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,980
Then, why was he...

547
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,610
He might be afraid.

548
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:26,190
Jade haven't been in many relationships,

549
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,910
so he doesn't know how to handle it.

550
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,140
If your way of approach doesn't work...

551
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,400
Do you wanna try it my way?

552
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:42,800
What is it?

553
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,280
Keep some distance.

554
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,180
Stop doing things that you normally do.

555
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:55,700
Sometimes, people don't realize what is important...

556
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,600
until they are losing it.

557
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:07,900
What if P'Jade gets angry?

558
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:12,210
I'm worried that he'll feel bad.

559
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,170
He won't.

560
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:19,000
He'll know what he truly desires.

561
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:27,100
I'm just giving advice.

562
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:31,000
Putting it into action or not is up to you.

563
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,350
Mai.

564
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,380
Hehe.

565
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:55,090
It looks like we have a theme.

566
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,490
Yeah?

567
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,600
P'Jade.

568
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,580
I'm sorry I didn't come to see you yesterday.

569
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,070
No.

570
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:13,960
It's my fault not telling you beforehand.

571
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:22,160
My mom was worried, so I had to go home.

572
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:25,460
She's worried?

573
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,350
With a son like you, why was she worried?

574
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:34,800
I don't know.

575
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,960
Maybe I'm still a little boy in her eyes.

576
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,590
How about you?

577
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,970
Do I look like a boy in your eyes?

578
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:04,970
Yes.

579
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,540
But a grown up one.

580
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:16,320
You're excellent at your job.

581
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,980
You're reliable.

582
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,800
And...

583
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,120
you're very charming.

584
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,060
Mai.
- P'Jade.

585
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:38,820
You go first.

586
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:41,940
P'Jade.

587
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,090
(Stomach growling)

588
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:48,530
Ah, why does it have to growl now?

589
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,570
Are you hungry?

590
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,260
A little.

591
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:02,000
Do you want to eat something at my room?

592
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:10,330
[Have you ever felt this way? That you aren't tall, white, and attractive like others]

593
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:11,830
Wait for me!

594
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:13,330
Hurry up!

595
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:25,050
[Have you ever felt this way? That you aren't rich, or stylish, but rather ordinary]

596
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:29,610
[I'm just an average man, who's not special]

597
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:34,210
[But you came and change me]

598
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:39,660
[When I'm with you, my life becomes wonderful]

599
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:43,500
[And I began to fantasize]

600
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:57,080
Do wanna eat anything other than fried chicken?

601
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,510
Anything is fine.

602
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:02,380
Let me help you.

603
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,660
Mai.

604
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,070
Yes?

605
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,640
I apologize for what I said that day.

606
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,520
P'Jade.

607
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:40,990
Um.

608
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:44,380
I'm sorry for rejecting you.

609
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,140
I...

610
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:49,100
I...

611
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,710
am afraid.

612
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,230
But.

613
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:00,660
Actually,

614
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:05,860
I like you.

615
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,910
I like you so much.

616
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:15,270
[Playing with my heart, you crazy?]

617
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:18,939
[That caught me off guard]

618
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:25,819
[How did you fall for me? I can’t figure this out]

619
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:37,200
P'Jade.

620
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:43,260
P'Jade.

621
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:47,960
Look at me please.

622
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:56,290
I'm never mad at you.

623
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,870
Really.

624
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:06,330
Really?

625
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:09,270
Yes.

626
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:12,460
Then why did you ignore me?

627
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:22,510
Well... it's just a strategy.

628
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:27,890
Oh? Mai.

629
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,890
A strategy?

630
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:31,700
Just a strategy!?

631
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:33,430
Right?

632
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:34,250
Yes.

633
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:37,910
That strategy made me depressed for a while.

634
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:42,779
I'm not upset.

635
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:47,540
But...

636
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:50,930
Can I punch you just once?

637
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,859
But I'll get hurt.

638
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:57,460
Just a tiny bit. It won't hurt that much.

639
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:59,780
Hmph!

640
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:09,860
Mai.

641
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,620
Can we start over?

642
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:23,700
No, we can't.

643
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,990
Didn't I tell you?

644
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,540
I'm never mad at you.

645
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,430
I also never give up on our relationship.

646
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:50,190
So what's the need to start over?

647
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,480
I really like you a lot.

648
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,590
Let's try it out together, shall we?

649
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,720
I want to be someone you love.

650
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,940
Someone you will miss.

651
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:23,610
[But you came and change me]

652
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,380
I want to be your happiness.

653
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:29,000
[When I'm with you, my life becomes wonderful]

654
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,660
Is it possible?

655
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,280
[And I began to fantasize]

656
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:34,420
Hm.

657
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,440
You don't have to give an answer right now.

658
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:50,100
You can sleep on it.

659
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:51,700
No.

660
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,180
I mean...

661
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:58,900
No need to think .

662
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:00,760
Mai.

663
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,890
Will you be my boyfriend?

664
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:11,620
[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

665
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:21,650
[Please don't give me false hope, then leave my side]

666
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:26,160
[After I seriously think about it,]

667
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,780
[I realize this is really all I can do]

668
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:34,290
[I'll just be the middleman for you two]

669
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:46,330
[Giving you my all even if you have no clue]

Directed by Thanamin Wongskulphat

671
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:51,520
I can't believe I got to be your boyfriend.

672
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:57,610
It seems like Phakin's heart belongs to Jadeniphat.

673
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:00,970
I want to let you know about my habit.

674
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:04,520
Can we talk it out? Don't keep it to yourself.

675
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,960
I didn't have time to do the laundry.

676
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,670
Can I borrow yours?

677
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:17,230
