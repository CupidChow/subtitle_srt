Yes, I do.

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,360
Jade.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,470
Why didn't you answer my call?

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,970
Please let go of him.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,650
Hey.

9
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,700
And who are you?

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,580
Why do I have to let him go?

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,730
I'm his intern.

12
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,780
Oh, just an intern.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:01,970
Hah.

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,550
Well, I hope I could be more than that.

15
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,010
Jade.

16
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,920
You choose.

17
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,270
Are you going with me... or him?

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,240
Jade.

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,780
Mai.

20
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,090
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,660
I choose him.

22
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:39,590
Jade.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,810
Please don't do this.

24
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,380
Mai.

25
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,000
Let me go.

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,100
Jade.

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,820
Mai, I'm serious.

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,560
Come here, Jade.

29
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,080
Back off!

30
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,560
Mai?

31
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,280
Mai.

32
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,860
This is Jett, my brother.

33
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,250
And this is...

34
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,800
Mai, my intern.

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,740
Hello.

36
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,020
Hello.

37
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,130
Are you coming to sleep over?

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,940
No.

39
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,720
I just gave him a ride.

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,329
Why don't you just sleep with him?

41
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:42,329
You work in the same place after all.

42
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,140
But you better not.

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,870
Jade likes to toss and turn in his sleep.

44
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,280
He also talks in his sleep.

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,030
And always kicks this and that.

46
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,140
Jett, that's enough.

47
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,030
Don't say anymore.

48
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,810
Quit it. Now he knows everything!

49
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,900
Don't stay over.

50
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,400
His condo is just across the street.

51
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,010
I see.

52
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,430
That's why Mai always drives me home.

53
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,740
Huh?

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,520
So, who's taking care of who?

55
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,560
Huh?

56
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,400
We take care of each other.

57
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,540
Am I right?

58
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,120
Yes.

59
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,730
Well...

60
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,370
What did you bring?

61
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:25,540
Ah.

62
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,690
Mom asked me to give you food.

63
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,990
Hm.

64
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,180
Stir-fried Chicken with Ginger.

65
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,340
Spicy prawn soup.

66
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,540
And green salad.

67
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,090
Thank you.

68
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,490
Didn't Jay come with you?

69
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,990
I miss my nephew.

70
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,040
You're too dramatic.

71
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,290
He didn't come.

72
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,490
I'm going to the fitness center.

73
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,370
Oh.

74
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,270
See you later.

75
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,070
Um.

76
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,010
Mai.

77
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,110
Take a good care of him for me.

78
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,180
Yes.

79
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,180
I'll do my best.

80
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,980
Jett.

81
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,500
Hm?

82
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,190
I can take care of myself.

83
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,610
Don't be so bold.

84
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,850
You didn't even answer my call.

85
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,490
Ah.

86
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,690
Next time ...

87
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,910
If you can't reach him,

88
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,960
you can contact me.

89
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,829
Are you sure?

90
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,620
Then...

91
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,970
Can I have your Line ID?

92
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,290

93
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,070
Thank you.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,880
I gotta go.

95
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,650
Good bye, Jett.

96
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,250
Good bye.

97
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,920

98

99
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,200
Is it alright?

100
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,670
Consider this...

101
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,690
a thank you for walking me home.

102
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,690
Thanks, Jade.

103
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,280
Now go.

104
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,710
It's time to go home.

105
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,330

106
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,310

Why do you like to eat junk food?

142
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,820
You've been eating non-nutritious food after moving out.

143
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,450
It's not good for your health.

Why did you shower at such a late hour?

150
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,300

192

Nah.

193
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,950
I'm not sleepy yet.

194
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,240
Then...

195
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,310
Let me keep you company.

196
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:13,960
Fine.

197
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,890
I also wanna talk to someone about ghosts.

198
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,340
Are you alone, Mai?

199
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,400
Are you afraid of ghosts?

200
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,930
I'm alone.

201
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,930
But I'm not afraid.

202
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,200
Ah!

203
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,710
But...

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,510
you will be scared.

205
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,640
Yeah, I'm scared.

206
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,090
Still.

207
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,660
I like ghost stories.

208
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,720
In the past, I had a roommate.

209
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,770
We listened to it together.

210
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,170
But after he got a boyfriend...

211
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,360
Hah.

212
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,430
Thinking about it...

213
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,730
Well, it was fun.

214
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,790
How was it back then?

215
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,100
That time,

216
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,220
Uea...

217
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,370
was so freaking hot!

218
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,620
But after he started dating King,

219
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,220
I felt more at ease.

220
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,890
They look good together.

221
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,180
Here.

222
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,250
I am...

223
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,130
the middleman of those two.

224
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,680
At first, they didn't get along well.

225
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,090
In the end,

226
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,960
they became lovers.

227
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,550
How about you?

228
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:04,630
Me?

229
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,590
I...

230
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,960
What about me?

231
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,760
Are you dating someone?

232
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,990
Not yet.

233
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:45,680
How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?

234
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:54,940
Please don't give me false hope, just leave my side.

235
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,780
Hm.

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,920
Hurry up, Mai.

237
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,490
Yay!

238
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,840
We came in time.

239
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:05,630
Phew.

240
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,290
Oh.

241
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,670
You go first, and I'll follow you in.

242
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,090
Is that okay?

243
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:10,920
Mhm.

244
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,720
I'll wait for you inside.

245
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,220
Um.

246
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,000
Hm?

247
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,400
Let me carry your bag.

248
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,150
Ah.

249
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,930
Er.

250
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,700
Thank you, Mai.

251
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,160
Please try again.

252
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,060
Please try again.

253
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,470
Jade.

254
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,430
Relax.

255
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,850
Don't be nervous.

256
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,660
-Please try again.
-Hey!

257
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,800
Please try again.

258
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,130
Please... Please try again.

259
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,550
Hey! I'm Jade! Don't you know me?

260
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,500
Damn it.

261
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,920
-Jade, can I go first?
-Stop. Let me in first!

262
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,150
Successfully recorded.

263
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,040
Right on time.

264
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,420
Hold on, Gun!

265
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,040
I came first.

266
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,650
Please try again.

267
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,170
What?

268
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,400
-Successfully recorded.
-Yes!

269
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,610
I'm going first, Jade.

270
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,370
You, you...

271
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,660
Shit! It's 8:30 already.

272
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,370
Please believe in me.

273
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,820
Successfully recorded.

274
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,250
Whoa! Yes!

275
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,770
Hey.

276
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,530
Eight...

277
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,560
thirty one.

278
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,580
Gah.

279
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm late for one minute.

280
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,250
My salary will be deducted for sure.

281
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,660
Boo. This is my bad hair day.

282
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,810
Whoa, Jade.

283
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,750
Even the fingerprint scanner didn't go my way.

284
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,280
I didn't win the lottery.

285
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,790
And I have no luck today.

286
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,720
There's nothing good in my life.

287
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,770
Hah. I'm so sad.

288
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,930
Can someone like me...

289
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,780
be counted as a good thing in your life?

290
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,320
Just kidding.

291
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,380
Don't be discouraged. It's not your fault.

292
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,850
The scanner was broken.

293
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,280
And we arrived later than usual today.

294
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,610
For you.

295
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:40,940
Huh?

296
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,490
How did you know I want some fresh drink?

297
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,470
Whoa.

298
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,530
It smells good as always.

299
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,680
Hm.

300
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,480
Thanks a lot, Mai.

301
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,500
I feel much better now.

302
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,210
There's no need to thank me.

303
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,730
Actually, I should say I'm sorry.

304
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,569
Why would you?

305
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,030
I'm the one who should say that.

306
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,440
I shouldn't have talked to you until late night.

307
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,750
I enjoy talking with you.

308
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,360
I wanna say that, too.

309
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,360
I can't believe that

310
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,550
a chatty person like you is still single!

311
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,510
What single?

312
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,540
I'm also single and talkative.

313
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,800
You won't be single for long.

314
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,130
What are you talking about?

315
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,770
There's a rumor that in our office...

316
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,680
someone was haunted by a ghost.

317
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,480
Do you believe it, Uea?

318
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,590
Nope.

319
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,970
I didn't believe it at first.

320
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,510
But...

321
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,890
When I was in the restroom...

322
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,960
I heard someone knocking on a wall.

323
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,800
Knock, knock, knock.

324
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,320
Hey.

325
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,540
Argh!

326
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,440
Hey, it's real.

327
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,370
Let's go back!

328
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,920
Wait.

329
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,930
We all hear it. You still want more proof?

330
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,470
Yes.

331
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,550
Come on.

332
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,480
Argh!

333
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,000
Where are you going?

334
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,980
You guys go ahead. I can't take it.

335
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,540
Whoa!

336
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,640
It's me!

337
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,130
Mai? Why did you touch my arm?

338
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,130
Boo.

339
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,030
Hah.

340
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,960
What do we do now?

341
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,240
Just try it out.

342
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,800
Try to knock.

343
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,080
Jade.

344
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,130
-Go, Jade.
-Go!

345
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,290
Shit.

346
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,890
Hurry up and do it, so we can go back.

347
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,120
Then...

348
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,120
the restroom's lights are...

349
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,760
-What are you doing?
-Whoa!!

350
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,590
Oho.

351
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,680
King!

352
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,160
You spend too much time listening to ghost stories.

353
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,770
No, you don't understand.

354
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,710
Who on earth would turn off the lights while I'm still there.

355
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,190
Am I right, Uea?

356
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,540
You were standing outside.

357
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,700
Did you see anyone?

358
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,510
I saw no one.

359
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,310
Maybe it's just a power outage.

360
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,970
I don't think so.

361
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,480
I think it's a ghost.

362
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,610
The girls downstairs also said that

363
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,240
our building is haunted.

364
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,730
Get back to work, Gun.

365
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,380
King.

366
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,850
I'm being serious.

367
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,800
If you don't believe me,

368
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,020
you can ask Jan and Nuch.

369
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,540
Are you telling me to ruin my love life?

370
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,540
Go away.

371
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,100
Jade.

372
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,170
Have you heard about that story?

373
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,520
What story?

374
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,080
The office workers downstairs told me that

375
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,310
after 8 p.m.

376
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,200
people who worked overtime always faced something strange.

377
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,520
Especially those who take an elevator alone.

378
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,920
They say ...

379
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,970
the elevator likes to stop at the sixth floor.

380
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,560
When they came out to look around, no one's there.

381
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,260
Some said they heard heavy footsteps.

382
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,550
However, no one is currently renting the sixth floor.

383
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,990
Rumor has it that... someone died on that floor!

384
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,840
Argh!

385
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,610
Hey! Whoa!

386
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,250
Jade, I'm scared.

387
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,030
Gun.

388
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,040
You made me afraid of going to the restroom alone.

389
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,610
I know, right? Me too!

390
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,830
It's all because of you, Gun.

391
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,610
What should we do?

392
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,360
Damn.

393
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,620
Do you guys...

394
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,500
smell something weird?

395
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,380
Like a stench.

396
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,750
Shit!

397
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,080
Are we facing with the real deal?

398
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Ah!

399
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,080
Oh.

400
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,680
It's my fart.

401
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,910
Bruh.

402
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,690
Gun.

403
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,680
Get out.

404
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,290
Here you go.

405
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,900
It's nice to order delivery from time to time.

406
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,260
You just don't want to take the elevator, right?

407
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:52,550
Hey.

408
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,810
What? Hey!

409
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,880
I knew it.

410
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,000
You're afraid, aren't you?

411
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,390
No, it's not like that!

412
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,390
I'm not afraid of anything.

413
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,770
Whoa.

414
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,930
We'll eat lunch in the canteen.

415
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,340
Is there anything you want?

416
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,710
Can I have a glass of bubble tea?

417
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,210
Sure.

418
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,950
Hey, Gun.

419
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,050
I'm getting hungry. Let's go together.

420
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:16,610
Okay.

421
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,950
-Hey!
-Ah!

422
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,430
Mai.

423
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,380
Can you go to the restroom with me?

424
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,000
Why?

425
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,370
Is it because...

426
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,290
you're afraid of ghosts as well?

427
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,710
What? Who's afraid?

428
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm not.

429
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,230
Why would you raise your voice, then?

430
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,900
I can use a deep voice if you want.

431
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,370
Go with me, please?

432
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,030
Please?

433
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,700
You're a mess, naughty boy.

434
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,170
Mai and Gun look so good together.

435
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,300
Hehe.

436
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,930
How adorable.

437
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,690
What was that, Jade?

438
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,600
Did I say something?

439
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,930
Oh.

440
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,930
It's nothing. Forget it.

441
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,950
Hey, Tong.

442
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,410
Where are you going?

443
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,200
The restroom.

444
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,710
I'll go with you. Wait for me!

445
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,350
Mai.

446
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,100
You have feelings for Gus, right?

447
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,850
Don't be embarrassed.

448
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,790
So...

449
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,790
Let me help you.

450
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,110
No biggie.

451
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,230
No.

452
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,350
I don't have feelings for Gus.

453
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,340
I've a crush on someone else.

454
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,540
My instinct has gone wrong?

455
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,790
Shoot!

456
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,260
Why do I have to work overtime today?

457
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,280
Work-life balance isn't real!

458
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,010
Mai.

459
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,130
If you apply for a job,

460
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,010
and the company claims you're only required to do simple tasks,

461
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,570
don't trust them!

462
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,060
It's not true!

463
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,800
Why are you still here, Mai?

464
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,410
Uh...

465
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,150
Our houses are on the same way.

466
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,340
Hm.

467
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,440
So I stay to support him, then we'll go back together.

468
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,310
I see.

469
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:54,810
Oh, right.

470
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,960
I'll take you guys out to karaoke tomorrow night.

471
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,160
Has Mongkol told you yet?

472
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,050
No!

473
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:05,900
He haven't.

474
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,830
Is that so?

475
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,590
Maybe he forgot.

476
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:10,890
So.

477
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,060
You'll join us, right?

478
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,350
Yes.

479
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,040
Okay. I have to go.

480
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,920
-Good bye.
-Good bye.

481
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,460
Bas?

482
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,790
Bas.

483
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,080
What's wrong?

484
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,440
I'm good.

485
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,580
Hurry up and head home.

486
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,190
Well.

487
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,060
If something is bothering you,

488
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,450
you can tell me about it.

489
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,740
Even if it's about love,

490
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,600
work, or personal matters.

491
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,090
You can vent it all with me.

492
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,650
I'm a great consultant for everyone.

493
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,350
Except for one thing ...

494
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,160
Financial problems.

495
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,290
Because I also don't have money.

496
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,630
Thanks, Jade.

497
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:15,780
No problem.

498
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,570
I'm alright.

499
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,140
Then ...

500
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,570
Take care of him, and hurry home.

501
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,280
I will.

502
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,360
Jade.

503
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,830
Are you thinking about Bas?

504
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,260
No.

505
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,260
It's not about him.

506
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,700
I'm thinking...

507
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,760
what songs should I sing in the karaoke?

508
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,900
♪ If you ever loved someone, you would ♪

509
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,550
Karaoke is my cup of tea!

510
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,870
Haha.

511
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,580
I love karaoke. I'm going to have so much fun!

512
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,980
♪ Fish nuggets, fish nuggets ♪

513
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,320
Yippee!

514
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,450
Just the thought of it excites me.

515
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,830
♪ Fish nuggets, fish nuggets ♪

516
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,670
Hehe.

517
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,850
♪ If you ever loved someone, you would understand these stories ♪

518
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,970
Are you almost done?

519
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,220
Yeah, just a little more.

520
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,150
Then, I'm going to the restroom.

521
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,070
Um.

522
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,520
Hooray!

523
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,400
My fish nuggets are done!

524
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,520
Mai?

525
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,230
Mai?

526
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,080
Huh!?

527
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,510
Oh, shit!

528
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,840
Ahem.

529
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,750
Ah, damn it.

530
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,420
Bloody hell!

531
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,670
Dad!

532
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,660
Jett. Jett!

533
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,240
Nong Jan!

534
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,750
Jett! Nong Jan!

535
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,690
Mai! Mai!

536
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,220
Argh!

537
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,130
-Jade.
-Ah!

538
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,220
Argh!

539
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,210
Ow!

540
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,150
Jade.

541
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,150
-Oh.
-Ouch!

542
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,200
Mai.

543
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,760
I'm so sorry.

544
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,910
Are you alright?

545
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,150
I'm fine.

546
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,870
Jade.

547
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,170
K...

548
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,110
Kiss...

549
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,920
Are you okay, Jade?

550
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,760
No.

551
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,100
I'm not okay.

552
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,010
Let's quickly get outta here!

553
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,010
Mai!

554
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,010
Come on!

555
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,700
We can't stay here anymore.

556
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,000
-Oh.
-Ouch!

557
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,370
What?

558
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,920
Are you okay, Jade?

559
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,290
Are you asleep?

560
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,870
Five minutes left.

561
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,350
Three.

562
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,440
Two.

563
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,370
One.

564
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,179
Here.

565
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,469
I've made an Americano for you.

566
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,219
No need.

567
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,139
But I made it exactly the way you like.

568
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,540
Hey.

569
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,600
Why are you so cold to me?

570
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,150
Don't you realize that I like you?

571
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,239
Mhm.

572
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,570
I won't give up.

573
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,130
You're literally my type.

574
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,440
I like someone who doesn't like me.

575
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,630
It's challenging.

576
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,020
You're beyond help.

577
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,540
Ew.

578
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,890
So bitter.

579
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,730
What's so good about this?

580
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,510
Oh, shit!

581
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,360
Oh.

582
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,580
Jade, I'm sorry!

583
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,180
Ow.

584
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,310
Are you alright?

585
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:32,750
Uh.

586
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,250
It's not a big deal.

587
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,450
I didn't think about it.

588
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,800
Huh?

589
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,470
Uh...

590
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,920
Nothing! I'm perfectly fine.

591
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,280
Jade.

592
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,000
And...

593
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,860
Aren't you going to make a coffee?

594
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,440
I got it already.

595
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,540
That?

596
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,240
Huh?

597
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,220
This office is full of weirdos.

598
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,790
I'm working here... am I also one of them?

599
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,370
Put it out of your mind!

600
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,800
Act normal, Jade.

601
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,730
Hah. Act stupid.

602
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,470
He's even more abnormal than me.

603
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,350
Bas.

604
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,480
Ah.

605
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,870
Hey, Jade.

606
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,730
Why are you sitting here alone?

607
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:48,960
It's nothing.

608
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,450
Is something wrong?

609
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,530
So...

610
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,010
It's about my family.

611
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,940
That's a sensitive topic.

612
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,490
I feel you, Bas.

613
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,840
I'm at a loss on what to do.

614
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,550
Um.

615
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,110
If you ever need my help,

616
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,080
I will be a good listener.

617
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,330
You can talk to me about it.

618
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,950
So my girlfriend...

619
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,780
is acting strange lately.

620
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:40,910
She has a hot temper

621
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,600
and is paranoid.

622
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,170
She thought I'm seeing someone else.

623
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,140
Well...

624
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,140
In your case,

625
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,790
she loves you so much.

626
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,360
So, it's normal to be jealous.

627
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,730
Maybe...

628
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,390
Your girlfriend is struggling with something.

629
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,790
Just try to reason with her.

630
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,810
Good idea.

631
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,800
Anyway,

632
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,320
You do know a lot about love, Jade.

633
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,180
Yeah?

634
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,670
I...

635
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,470
I learned it from a life coach.

636
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,340
-Really?
-Yes.

637
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,490
Haha.

638
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,490
Thank you, Jade.

639
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,160
Um.

640
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,000
So.

641
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,840
I kind of envy you, Jade.

642
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:44,730
I want to be carefree like you.

643
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,540
When you're stressed

644
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,650
or faced with problems

645
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,900
you don't let them distract you.

646
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,140
Hm.

647
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,410
Well.

648
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,950
Everyone has their own problems.

649
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,650
I just like to avoid overthinking for now.

650
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,750
If you put it like that, then...

651
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,550
Is something troubling you as well?

652
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:11,650
Um.

653
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,120
A little.

654
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,580
But...

655
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,470
If I get to sing karaoke tonight

656
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,350
it'd be great help!

657
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,450
Then.

658
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,450
Why are we still here?

659
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,150
Let's go out to sing karaoke.

660
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,160
Roger!

661
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,260
I hope you have fun tonight.

662
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,120
Sure.

663
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,120
My dear karaoke, Jade is here!

664
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,400
Whoa!

665
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,350
Welcome all interns...

666
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,970
to our department's party!

667
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,150
You can order whatever you like.

668
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,420
Because we have our president with us.

669
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,450
What do you wanna eat, Tong?

670
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,960
I don't know.

671
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,860
Anything.

672
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,350
Something delicious.

673
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,520
You should have me, then.

674
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,750
I'm the tastiest thing right here.

675
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,610
Excuse me. We're ready to order.

676
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,690
Mai, do you drink?

677
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,450
I need Jade's permission first.

678
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,670
Huh?

679
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,210
Why?

680
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:03,990
Ah.

681
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,990
Because I'm the one who drives.

682
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,390
Oh?

683
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,550
Ask Jett to drive for you.

684
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,850
Tonight is for you guys.

685
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,520
Just have fun.

686
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,000
He's right!

687
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,430
Just drink!

688
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:22,120
I'll look after you, don't worry.

689
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,700
Alright, so...

690
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,870
Enjoy yourself to the fullest.

691
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,400
Consider this a welcoming party for the interns.

692
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,730
And thank you for your hard work all this time.

693
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,230
Thank you.

694
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,130
One more thing, I want to say that...

695
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,790
I really appreciate Jade's help.

696
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,260
Thanks for being my love counselor.

697
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,740
Hah.

698
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,780
Jade as a love counselor?

699
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:54,660
Hah?

700
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,640
Why? Choose your words carefully, Gun.

701
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,440
What's your problem!?

702
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,320
Jade.

703
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,580
Sit down.

704
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,760
Before helping others, you better help yourself first.

705
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,080
Ow.

706
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,270
Darling, it hurts.

707
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,970
Uea, keep an eye on your boyfriend.

708
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,020
Let me show you my beautiful voice.

709
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,020

If you're worried you won't be able to drive.,

719
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,290
I'll take you home.

720
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,250
You'll take me home even if I don't drink.

721
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,800
Hey! Why the heck are you flirting here?

722
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,110
Hey, King. Come out and sing something.

723
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,680

727
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,630
Mai!

728
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,310
Sing a song.

729
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,340
I'm bad at singing.

730
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,700
No worries.

731
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,180
This isn't a contest. Just do it for fun.

732
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,680
C'mon. Just once.

733
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,670
Jade.

734
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,580
Please, Mai.

735
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,150

Do you think... Mai is singing this song for someone?

749
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,520
Did you notice?

750
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,400
Yes!

751
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:00,850
Who for?

752
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:01,530
Hey.

753
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,840
Remember what I told you?

754
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,750
Who is it?

755
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:05,740
Bruh.

756
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,740
For Gus, of course!

757
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,160
Are you sure you're on the right track?

758
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,190
I'm certain!

759
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:19,140
I asked Mai once, and he refused.

760
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,740
I think he was just embarrassed.

761
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,920
They're very close to each other.

762
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,590
I don't think so.

763
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,440
How was it, Jade?

764
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,590
You were amazing!

765
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,800
I thought we hired a professional singer.

766
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,270
Yeah, Mai.

767
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,440
Quit being a graphic designer, and pursue singing.

768
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,660
You've got a bright future.

769
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,160
Bruh, Gun.

770
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,890
Don't be exaggerating. You should listen to my voice first.

771
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,380
Come on here. I'm a much better singer.

772
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,420
Oh.

773
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,810
If Mongkol has the mic,

774
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:00,810
he'll keep it for a long time.

775
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:03,970
I'm going to the restroom.

776
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,160
Uh, Jade.

777
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,270
I'll go with you.

778
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:09,370
Alright.

779
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,770
We've got to sing only a few songs.

780
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:19,380
Mai.

781
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,350
Are you drunk? Your face is so red.

782
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,010
No, I'm still good.

783
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:52,010
Stop whenever you want.

784
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,710
Don't listen to King too much.

785
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:55,900
Let's go.

786
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,580
Oh?

787
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,560
Can I talk to Mai for a moment?

788
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,930
What's the matter?

789
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:06,530
Mai.

790
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,090
Did you annoy Uea?

791
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,050
No, he didn't.

792
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,270
Mai's shoes look so cool

793
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,550
so I wanna ask where he got it.

794
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:20,610
You're right.

795
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,520
Well.

796
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,950
Jade.

797
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,800
Yeah?

798
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,460
Aren't you going to the restroom?

799
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,700
Oh.

800
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,120
Thanks for the reminder.

801
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,250
It's not about the shoes, isn't it?

802
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:47,660
Do you really like Jade?

803
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,430
Yes, I like him.

804
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,170
Can you give me some reasons?

805
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,010
I like Jade the way he is.

806
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,080
And I like myself when I'm with him.

807
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,310
I want to be a better person for him.

808
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:29,090
I want to make him happy.

809
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:35,330
Jade had been in a relationship only once.

810
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,850
I'm speaking as someone close to him.

811
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,780
Whatever you want to do...

812
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,900
Think carefully.

813
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,190
I've thought it through.

814
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:59,890
I'm not going to stop you, Mai.

815
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,570
I just want you to give it a lot of thoughts.

816
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:07,950
Jade is your internship mentor right now.

817
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,460
You're working as a team.

818
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:16,040
If you two have any disagreements,

819
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,820
it will be awkward.

820
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,240
I got it, Uea.

821
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,900
I'm also worried.

822
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,660
Because I'm just an intern.

823
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:37,140
But... I know that I can't let him go.

824
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,490
I really like him.

825
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,340
Flirting with Jade won't be easy.

826
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,350
I'm well aware of it.

827
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:03,400
If you have any questions,

828
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,150
or want some help,

829
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,640
just tell me.

830
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:10,610
Thank you, Uea.

831
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:12,700
Alright.

832
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,540
Go use the restroom, so he won't be suspicious.

833
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,000
Hey.

834
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,610
Where did you go?

835
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:32,370
Here.

836
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,070
I poured it for you.

837
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,150
Hm?

838
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,060
Are you okay, Mai.?

839
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:56,960
Yes.

840
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:00,810
It's fine, Darling.

841
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,070
We only drink on occasion.

842
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,700
Jade will drive you home, don't worry.

843
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,240
Mai.

844
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,280
Don't force yourself.

845
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,880
I can go on, Jade.

846
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,080
I don't get drunk easily.

847
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,140
Hm.

848
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,750
Cheers.

849
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,220
Cheers.

850
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,620
You good? C'mon.

851
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,960
I'm alright, darling.

852
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,760
Hey, Mai!?

853
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:47,920
Mai?

854
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,550
What a shame.

855
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,400
He said he won't get drunk.

856
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,230
It's all because of you.

857
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,820
Has he reached his limit?

858
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,220
Take care of him. I'm gonna go home.

859
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,410
Okay.

860
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:18,570
Good bye.

862

I'm coming!

Eh?

864
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,590
Bas and Mongkol has left.

865
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:37,740
Haha.

866
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,020
Good thing I asked for his credit card

867
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,950
or else we'll have to pay with labor.

868
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:43,660
That was a close call.

869
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,850
It's quite late.

870
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:48,150
Let's call it a day.

00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:54,010
Sure.

00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,420
Are you okay?

877
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,120
Of course! I didn't drink.

878
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,120
Alright, then.

879
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,680
Uea and I will take the others home.

880
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,340
Okay, cool.

881
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,850
King, please take me home, too.

882
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,400

You're living together, right?

I mean in the same place.

Yes.

You guys can leave first.

892

I'll take care of the bill.
