Mai, do you drink?

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,630
I need P'Jade's permission first.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,730
Do you really like Jade?

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,750
I like P'Jade the way he is.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,350
And I like myself when I'm with him.

8
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,040
Hey.

9
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,220
Are you good?

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,730
Yeah.

11
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,080
You've quite a high tolerance.

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,390
P'King and P'Uea are kinda nice.

13
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,840
Working here as an intern is enjoyable.

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,500
Don't you agree?

15
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,400
P'Uea is very kind.

16
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,030
He taught me many things.

17
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,360
How about P'King?

18
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,360
Hey.

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,990
Is P'King good to you as well?

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,570
He's fine.

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,979
Just fine? That's it?

22
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,590
Uhm.

23
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,890
So ...

24
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,890
you don't like talking, do you?

25
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,890
Listening to you alone is enough.

26
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,790
Aren't you tired?

27
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,210
Nope.

28
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,360
Hey.

29
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,610
There's a hot pot restaurant at the street's entrance.

30
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,320
Gus.

31
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,360
I wanna walk in silence.

32
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,520
Don't be harsh on me.

33
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,850
Are you always this talkative?

34
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,280
Nah.

35
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,740
Normally I ...
- I think you were born this way.

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,150
If I don't say it,

37
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,540
how will others know what I'm thinking?

38
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,450
[Have you ever felt this way?]

39
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,210
Let's go home.

40
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,160
[That you aren't tall, white, and attractive like others]

41
00:02:51,160 --> 00:03:01,470
[Have you ever felt this way? That you aren't rich, or stylish, but rather ordinary]

42
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,890
[I'm just an average man, who's not special]

43
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,610
[But you came and change me]

44
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,700
[When I'm with you, my life becomes wonderful]

45
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,550
[And I began to fantasize]

46
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,650
Whoa.

47
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,380
Ah.

48
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,380
Mom.

49
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,930
I'm sleeping.

50
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,610
I'm not your mom, I'm Jade.

51
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,040
Almost done, Mai.

52
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,570
I ...

53
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,060
I can take care of my crush, mom.

54
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,150
Move up a little.

55
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,600
I really like him.

56
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,710
C'mon.

57
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,720
P'Jade? Is it you?

58
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,610
Who else could it be?

59
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,120
Yeah, it's me.

60
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Get some sleep.

61
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,910
Ah!?

62
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,640
How much do I like him?

63
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,659
Mai?

64
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,940
Mai.

65
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,490
Who's your crush?

66
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,450
Hm.

67
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,930
Tell me first. Who is it?

68
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,730
Hm.

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,330
Sleep at me, huh?

70
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,910
Whoa, Mai!

71
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,910
Hey!

72
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,390
It's so hot.
- Don't take it off!

73
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,010
[I'm just an average man, who's not special]

74
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,910
[But you came and change me]

75
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:34,060

[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

Argh!

90
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,140
So who exactly is Mai's crush?

91
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,120
Do you want to know that badly?

92
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,940
Hey, Mai!

93
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,050
Who exactly is your crush?

94
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,830
Why don't you try to figure it out?

95
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,030
Oh, Uea!

96
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,020
You have an idea about Mai's crush, right?

97
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,240
Like King said ... it's so clear no one would miss it.

98
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,650
Who is it, Uea?

99
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,670
Mai's crush?

100
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,550
It's someone who likes eating donuts.

101
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,050
Huh? Where did it come from!?

102
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,530
Hey, King!

103
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,050
What's up, my dear Jadeniphat?

104
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,220
You also know who Mai fancies, don't you?

105
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,780
The one with the yellow id card.

106
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,830
Huh?

107
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,270
Whoa!

108
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,930
Man, isn't your information too broad!

109
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,030
Santi.

110
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,070
[Understood, master.]

111
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,160
Understood what? I haven't asked anything.

112
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,340
[No information found. Please request again.]

113
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,140
Will I ... be able to find out today?

114
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,260
What you're curious about ...

115
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,290
isn't hard to figure out.

116
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,190
Tong!

117
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,840
What does that mean?

118
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,570
There is only one truth!

119
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,130
Mai's crush should be ... Gus!

120
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,020
[Negative.]

121
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,490
What's the meaning of this?

122
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,890
Mai doesn't fancy me.

123
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,330
Keep searching for the truth, P'Jade.

124
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,570
So who exactly is Mai's crush?

125
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,420
You all have already left? Can't you enlighten me?

126
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,350
Mai, could you tell me who you like?

127
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,140
Eh? Yellow id card? Donut?

128
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,260
Who the heck is it?

129
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,600
P'Jade.

130
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,320
Hey! Ow!

131
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,040
Huh?

132
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,820
Eh, Mai?

133
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,430
D-Does it hurt? My bad.

134
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,870
Not much.

135
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,940
Has he seen me drooling?

136
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,150
I might also have bad breath.

137
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,270
P'Jade.

138
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,120
I apologize for being a burden.

139
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,470
Um.

140
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,050
Don't mention it.

141
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,080
You were drunk.

142
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
And I don't know your place.

143
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,080
So I brought you here.

144
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,780
Do you have a hangover?

145
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,110
Urm.

146
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,110
I've got a little headache.

147
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,500
It shouldn't be a little headache.

148
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Since I bumped my head into yours.

149
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,790
I'll prepare a warm meal for you

150
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,380
to help you get over your hangover.

151
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,180
Wait.

152
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Never mind.

153
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,520
Let me do it.

154
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,880
B-But.

155
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,080
May I use your kitchen?

156
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,370
Um, alright.

157
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,920
Just go shower first.

158
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,880
Okay.

159
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,890
P'Jade.

160
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,750
Huh?

161
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,190
Are you upset that I was drunk?

162
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,190
Not at all.

163
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,210
I'm sorry if I make you feel uncomfortable.

164
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,550
Hey.

165
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,270
I'm completely alright.

166
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,090
Don't overthink it.

167
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,910
Go take a shower.

168
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,370
Yes.

169
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,000
Mai.

170
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,620
I thought you were funny being drunk.

171
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,690
But you're even funnier today.

172
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,690
Hurry and go shower.

173
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,340
Here.

174
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,080
That's not it.

175
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,780
Morning!

176
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,490
Oh.

177
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,640
Er.

178
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,370
Take a shower.

179
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,030
Errr.

180
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,910
You can use everything in the bathroom.

181
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,280
Including the towel. It's a new one.

182
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,040
Yes.

183
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:14,880
[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

184
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:24,860
[Please don't give me false hope, then leave my side]

185
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,350
Ah!

186
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,070
P'Jade.

187
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,010
What's wrong?

188
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,470
Er, no, nothing.

189
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,330
Mai! Why did you do this to me!?

190
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,290
P'Jade, please calm down!

191
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,410
How could you?

192
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,300
Please don't.

193
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,670
I'll do whatever I want!

194
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,680
Don't do this! The towel will fall off!

195
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,820
Please, P'Jade. It's falling off!

196
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,250
Please let me go.

197
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,940
Woo woo.

198
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,570
P'Jade!

199
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,820
P'Jade?

200
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,960
Ouch!

201
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,420
Oh, f*ck.

202
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,140
I feel him now.

203
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,330
Urm, Mai.

204
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,330
Why did you shower so fast?

205
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,860
I'm afraid of troubling you.
- Wait.

206
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,150
Er.

207
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,750
Do you have any spare cloths for me?

208
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:45,960
Ah.

209
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,560
Yes, I do.

210
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,500
Um.

211
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,350
Haha.

212
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,119
So...

213
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,930
Will it bother him if I tell him about the towel?

214
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,170
He's already regarded himself as a burden.

215
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,859
Er.

216
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,599
Is something wrong?

217
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,700
Haha.

218
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,020
T-The towel.

219
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:22,920
Yes?

220
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,790
Hah.

221
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,880
I took it from the pile you showed me.

222
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,480
Haha.

223
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,770
The Conan towel.

224
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,730
The Conan towel in the bathroom...

225
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,210
is a new one I haven't used

226
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,800
because I hanged it just for show.

227
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,100
Oh my god, I'm sorry!

228
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,900
I ... I will pay the price.

229
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,790
Forget it, Mai. It's okay.

230
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,280
No, I will do everything to find it.

231
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,260
Oh ... my boy.

232
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,930
Oh no!

233
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,500
Quit bowing.

234
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,710
Hehe.

235
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,340
There there.

236
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,870
Mai.

237
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,900
Mai.

238
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,010
Mai.

239
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,350
Mai.

240
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,380
Mai.

241
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,980
Mai.

242
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,460
Mai.

243
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,000
Mai.

244
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,970
Mai.

245
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,100
Aah!

246
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,710
Eeek! Mai, what are you going to do?

247
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,100
P'Jade, what were you saying?

248
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,370
Mai.

249
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,740
Oh!

250
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,260
I'm so sorry.

251
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,920
Well ... it's nothing.

252
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,300
You are still having a hangover, aren't you?

253
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,940
I'm fine now.

254
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,030
Well ...

255
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,470
P'Jade.

256
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,310
I'm very sorry.

257
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,510
Uh ... for that towel?

258
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,030
I meant both towel and that thing just now.

259
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,230
Never mind.

260
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:51,100
For that towel, I found it better when it's spread out.

261
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,680
And ... what are you doing?

262
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,800
There's no ingredient to cook in my room.

263
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,440
There is some.

264
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,530
Sorry for picking your stuff in the fridge without telling you.

265
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:14,230
Well ... my mom usually stores food in the fridge for me.

266
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,860
Mom. What single man cooks at home?

267
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,040
So ... we can't cook with this, can we?

268
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,390
It is enough for us, I believe.

269
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,140
Mai, why do you throw my little heart-shaped cake away like this?

270
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,010
Oh it's expired already.

271
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,260
It's still edible.

272
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,330
But it's expired.

273
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,390
Everything in the fridge can be eaten.

274
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,820
Hey!

275
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,460
P'Jade!

276
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,610
Please don't.

277
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,170
I will buy you a new one.

278
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,470
Could you sit and wait for a second?

279
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,400
I'll make you something nice to eat.

280
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,790
Please walk.

281
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,340
Please try this.

282
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,220
Blow on it first. It's hot.

283
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,870
Wow this looks great!

284
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,700
I'm trying it now.

285
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,280
Hmm you are really a perfect man.

286
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,630
You are good at everything.

287
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,750
I'm just an ordinary guy.

288
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,530
You make the best porridge ever.

289
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,820
Mai, you're something else.

290
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,020
Please eat a lot if you like it.

291
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,340
There is still some in the pot.

292
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,230
Next time, let me make it for you again.

293
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,450
Of course. You are such a good person.

294
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:27,070
If I'm at home, I can't just sit still and wait to eat like this.

295
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,860
In my family, everyone has their own duty.

296
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:37,370
As a middle child, I need to set a table for my family.

297
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,780
Jan, things are all ready.

298
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,190
You can bring the food now.

299
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,180
Okay.

300
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,380
There are more dishes coming.

301
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,180
Okay.

302
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,360
Jan, I will come and help.

303
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,170
Okay.

304
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,110
Wow.

305
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,830
What are we going to eat today?

306
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:22,900
Today we have clear soup, stir-fried mixed vegetables, stir-fried chicken with ginger, and boiled egg chili paste.

307
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,200
Wow.
(Clapping)

308
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,900
And today I made stir-fried chicken with ginger by myself.

309
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,350
Wow. That's why it looks super good.

310
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,490
Let me try it.

311
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,650
Go ahead.

312
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,360
Mom.

313
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,060
Yes?
Where is my deep fried chicken?

314
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,030
But we have many dishes today. Can it be tomorrow?

315
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,270
Okay. Let's eat or the food will get cold.

316
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,910
Jan, give me your plate.

317
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,570
Thank you, dad.

318
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,800
How much do you want?

319
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,090
Just one scoop please.

320
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,250
Half scoop is enough.

321
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,310
Huh? Half scoop?

322
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,830
You are skinny now.

323
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:01,990
Thank you dad.

324
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,150
So the rest is mine.

325
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,320
Hahaha.

326
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,090
Eat vegetables a lot. It's your favorite.

327
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,670
You too, Jade.

328
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,470
Eat greens also. You always go for deep fried chicken and never get bored.

329
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,230
I will never get bored of chickens.

330
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,740
Thank you for taking care of me when I was drunk.

331
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,070
You also let me stay overnight at your place.

332
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,300
It's nothing.

333
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:38,730
By the way, I didn't do anything to your car. It is perfectly fine.

334
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,280
See you.

335
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:56,750
P'Jade.

336
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,660
My room number is 1505.

337
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,620
1505?

338
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,450
1505 ... 1505.

339
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,400
Please go back to your room.

340
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,190
Get home safe, Mai.

341
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,830
So... see you soon.

342
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,400
Why did he tell me his room number?

343
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,560
1505, 1505, I better note it down, 1505...

344
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,630
Mom: Mai, what are you doing?

345
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,830
Mom: You haven't replied my messages.

346
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,800
2 Missed Calls from Mom (Friday, 9:00PM)

347
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,930
Mom: Are you in the party?

348
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,370
5 Missed Calls from Mom (10:19PM)

349
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,400
Mom: Answer my text. I'm worried about you.

350
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:28,410
(Calling)

351
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,660
Hello mom.

352
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:35,050
Mai, where have you been? Why didn't you pick up my calls? I was so worried about you.

353
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:39,010
But I already told you that I would have an office party.

354
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,460
But you did not answer my phone. You also turned off your phone.

355
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,670
I am so sorry. My phone was out of battery.

356
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,260
I just checked it just now.

357
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,770
I was so worried that I would be going to Bangkok.

358
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,850
It's good you called me in time.

359
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,450
Were you drunk? Who took care of you last night?

360
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,380
Mom, please calm down. I'm perfectly fine.

361
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,470
Also, P'Jade took good care of me.

362
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,320
Did he?

363
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,190
Yes, he did. Please don't worry.

364
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,950
I can't help worrying about you even if you have told me a million times.

365
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,830
Mom... I am mature...

366
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,080
I know that you've become mature now.

367
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,220
But you are my youngest son. It's normal that I have to worry about your safety.

368
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,500
Do you want me to stay with you?

369
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,760
No, we have discussed this before.

370
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,990
But I...

371
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,040
If you keep doing as you please, I will do the same way as you do.

372
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,780
So, I will go home next week.

373
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,930
Okay.

374
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,400
I miss you two, mom and dad.

375
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,690
I'm hanging up now.

376
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,880
(Sigh)

377
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,130
Lazy dinner=Instant noodles

378
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,670
Mai: What did you have for dinner?

379
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,430
P'Jade: Instant noodles

380
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,570
Next time let me make you stir-fried instant noodles.

381
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,970
Wow. I become hungry just imagining how it tastes.

382
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,540
Achoo!

383
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,670
Who is gossiping about me?

384
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,370
I should have eaten more so I wouldn't have been hungry at late night like this.

385
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,900
You can drink this unless it is after midnight on January 29th, 2023.

386
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:32,720
[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

387
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:41,490
[Please don't give me false hope then leave me]

388
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,870
You can drink this unless it is after midnight on January 29th, 2023.

389
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,430
It has been in the fridge so it is eatable!

390
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,630
It's normal he has to be nice to his mentor.

391
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,210
It looks so good, Mai!

392
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,020
You're very good at cooking.

393
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,440
It reminds me of the day you cooked for me.

394
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,540
Then I'll cook for you more.

395
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,240
This one and this one.

396
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,410
Hm.

397
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,120
It's really tasty.

398
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,490
Whoever gets to be with you is truly lucky.

399
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,460
I also want to start dating.

400
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,770
But I don't know if my crush will like me back.

401
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,610
Hm.

402
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,360
Can you be honest with me?

403
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,300
Who is your crush, Mai?

404
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,920
It's someone in our office. isn't it?

405
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,290
Tell me now.

406
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,170
Yes.

407
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,250
It is.

408
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,990
Haha. I knew it!

409
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,430
I was so sure it's someone here.

410
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,380
You know what? I dreamed about it every day!

411
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,280
You dreamed about this?

412
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,710
Of course! I'm so curious.

413
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,460
Oops.

414
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,380
Will he think I'm nosy?

415
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,320
You want to know who my crush is?

416
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,150
No, forget it.

417
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,440
I do wanna know, but it's your private matter.

418
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,860
Never mind.

419
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,610
Well.

420
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,840
Can you tell me what should I do with my crush?

421
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,230
You want my advice?

422
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,330
With someone you like ...

423
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,890
You have to approach them gently.

424
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,390
Got it?

425
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,600
What if they're taken aback?

426
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,860
If they're taken aback?

427
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,469
Let me give you some tips, Mai.

428
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,909
The thing is ...

429
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,600
You have to be consistent.

430
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,530
Try to be nice and take good care of them.

431
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,909
And one more thing.

432
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,310
Don't be too direct in courting them.

433
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,020
Okay?

434
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,850
I'll keep that in mind.

435
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,060
Let's eat, Mai.

436
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,090
P'Jade.

437
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,260
P'Jade.

438
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:41,620
What did you say?

439
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,449
Let's. Eat. Mai.

440
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,300
P'Jade.
Hm?

441
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,880
Can I join you?

442
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,330
You can't, Mai.

443
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,350
You made it only for me.

444
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,770
So I should be the only one eating it.

445
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,710
No way.

446
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,240
Please let me eat it too.

447
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,590
Just one bite, please.

448
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,840
Oh. Ah.

449
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,780
Even the sauce is delicious!

450
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,320
(Yawn)

451
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,130
What's wrong, Jade? Why the long face?

452
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,080
Oh.

453
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,510
Valentine's day is coming.

454
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,230
So what?

455
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,920
What's wrong with that?

456
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,740
It's not for a poor single dog like me!

457
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,430
Haha.

458
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,840
There, there.

459
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
It gave you a job, though.

460
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,010
That's good.

461
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,080
You can say that because you aren't on the Valentine project.

462
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,780
Keep fighting, bro.

463
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,840
You're good at this.

464
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,860
Do you want to switch assignment with mine?

465
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,660
It's fine, I can do it.

466
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,390
We agreed on it in the meeting any way.

467
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,630
P'Jade.

468
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,480
I've finished the work you assigned.

469
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,030
Whoa.

470
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,400
Excellent work, Mai.

471
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,920
You're such a fast learner.

472
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,770
Thank you, P'Jade.

473
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,580
But I have no more work for you.

474
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,000
There's only this Valentine project left.

475
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,800
Then, may I help you?

476
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,550
Are you sure?

477
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,120
Um.

478
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,980
I'll let you do this part.

479
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,480
Jade.

480
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,030
What's up, King?

481
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,310
Can we talk outside?

482
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,030
Why?

483
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,160
Keep it down!

484
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,930
Fine.

485
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,290
In the rest area?

486
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,930
Fine.

487
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,810
Okay.

488
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,100
Deal.

489
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,260
He's being weird again.

490
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,060
We can do it! Fighting!
Keep working! (Self-hypnosis)

491
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,710
This is like a national level mission.

492
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,710
Kind of.

493
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,800
What is it? I'm dying to know.

494
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,080
I'm gonna give Uea a surprise on Valentine's Day.

495
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,160
Just that?

496
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,460
Bruh. King.

497
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,390
I know.

498
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,480
And I wanna play it big.

499
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,830
You're gonna make me lie to Uea again?

500
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,430
You know in your heart we'll surely be caught.

501
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,310
Trust me.

502
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,960
He won't catch us this time.

503
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,530
No, I don't wanna lie to him.

504
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,530
Hey.

505
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,530
I need to you in this plan.

506
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,530
Hmph, nope.

507
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,190
Jade!

508
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,370
Help me.

509
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,540
I'll treat you to a buffet.

510
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,750
Which restaurant?

511
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,500
You have the right to choose.

512
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,620
(Gulp)

513
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,460
What do you want me to do?

514
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,040
Come here.

515
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,790
Why are you hiding?
- Oh.

516
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,630
Eh?

517
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,990
Because you asked me to surprise-

518
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,360
Shh.

519
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,360
I'm pissed.

520
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,820
Let me go!

521
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,250
Sit properly.

522
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,540
Help me choose the flower design.

523
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,390
Just choose it yourself.

524
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:49,950
This.

525
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,140
Look at this one.
- This?

526
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,620
How about the other one?

527
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,770
What are you doing?
- Huh? Mai!

528
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,780
Damn.

529
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,300
Did I scare you?

530
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,200
Of course!

531
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,690
Why don't you make a sound?

532
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,750
C'mon, King.

533
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,410
Which one?

534
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,250
I think the first one look good.

535
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,830
Do you think it's too much?

536
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:12,830
This one?

537
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,460
Yeah.

538
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,870
Yes, it is. Uea won't like it.

539
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,980
The first one?

540
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,110
Both.

541
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,320
King.

542
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,330
I know you're rich.

543
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,850
But it's too flamboyant.

544
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,590
I'm rich, and I wanna spoil my boyfriend.

545
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,270
Why?

546
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,780
Are you envious?

547
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:33,950
What?

548
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,740
I'm not.

549
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,610
It's just too extravagant, you see?

550
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,520
Idiot. You are not useful.

551
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:44,840
Mai.

552
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:45,900
"Idiot."

553
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,870
Can you help me decide?

554
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,650
"Idiot. You are not useful."

555
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,400
Believe it or not.

556
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,060
I think this one is pretty.

557
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,340
Are you ordering it for P'Uea?

558
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,270
Yes, I'm ordering it for Uea.
- Who's ordering what for me?

559
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,160
Argh!!

560
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,530
Something is on your lashes.

561
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,360
Uea!

562
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,530
It's nothing, the thing is ...

563
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,590
Mai just asked me what he should buy on Valentine's day

564
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,370
Right?

565
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,380
Exactly.

566
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,670
What did you say you're gonna buy?

567
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,980
The Valentine's day present, remember?

568
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,130
What is it again?

569
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,060
What?

570
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,890
Urm ... that thing ... what is it?

571
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,110
Is it a doll?

572
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,910
Yeah, a yellow one, right?

573
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,210
A doll.

574
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,780
Ah, yes.

575
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,830
Haha.

576
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,630
Take it.

577
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,830
Thanks, darling.

578
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,170
Mai, shall we go to the kitchen?

579
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,380
I wanna make a cup of coffee.

580
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,300
Give me a sec.

581
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,520
I like the second style.

582
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,420
Don't smile.

583
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,830
You, too!

584
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,370
P'Jade.

585
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:22,650
Huh?

586
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,110
What are you doing?

587
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:25,820
Shh.

588
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,590
Be quiet.

589
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,800
King is gonna surprise Uea.

590
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,290
We have to coorperate.

591
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,850
How can I help you?

592
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,310
When it's time to go home,

593
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,410
we'll pretend to leave slowly.

594
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,450
Will P'Uea really be unaware?

595
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,950
He won't realize.

596
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,980
Okay?

597
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,890
Ah.

598
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,370
Are our interns not going back to celebrate Valentine's day?

599
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,710
Brothers, I'm going.

600
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,300
Good bye.

601
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,940
He really left at will.

602
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,070
I'm leaving, too.

603
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:21,490
Okay.

604
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:22,830
Good bye, guys.

605
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,590
Happy Valentine's day.

606
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,080
Hm.

607
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,560
Mai.

608
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,950
Let's go home.

609
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,950
Maybe you can celebrate Valentine's day.

610
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,670
Valentine's day celebration?

611
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,160
Mhm.

612
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,310
You might wanna follow someone out?

613
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,370
I'm ready.

614
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,350
Hehe.

615
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,630
Uea.

616
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,200
Hm?

617
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,920
I'm going home.

618
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,610
Um.

619
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,220
(Sigh)

620
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,620
I thought I'm too late.

621
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,680
P'Bas!

622
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,520
Uea.

623
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:11,950
Yes?

624
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,090
There's some work that needs to be fixed.

625
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,240
You can't, P'Bas.

626
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,970
Why can't I?

627
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,350
When is he coming?

628
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,620
Hm?
- Er ...

629
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,610
King, you're so late.

630
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,210
He even brought chocolates like I said.

631
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,100
My friend is really cute.

632
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,660
Happy Valentine's day, darling.

633
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,330
What are you up to?

634
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,830
I want to surprise you.

635
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,530
What surprise?

636
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,910
I'm working.

637
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,930
Don't play around.

638
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:06,840
Uea.

639
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,610
Yes?

640
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,370
Can you help me edit some work?

641
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,490
Oh.

642
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,540
You can tell me which part needs to be fixed.

643
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:13,850
Err.

644
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:14,820
I'll do it.

645
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,190
No need.

646
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,190
You should go.

647
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,420
But ...

648
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:20,730
Oh, Uea.

649
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,070
It's better to accept Jade' help.

650
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:27,900
Because there's quite a lot of work to be fixed.

651
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,710
Haha. A lot?

652
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,000
Just go.

653
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,370
This is your first Valentine's day.

654
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,640
Go spend your time together.

655
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,010
Leave the rest to me.

656
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,610
I've got your back.

657
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,330
Thanks.

658
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:49,900
P'Bas, tell me whatever you want me to do.

659
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,920
Alright, so ...

660
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,650
Ahem.

661
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,050
Yes, sir.
- It's not to hard to handle.

662
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,220
There's no need to surprise.

663
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,740
I've known for a while.

664
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,580
You noticed?

665
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,590
Um.

666
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,220
I know that you love me.

667
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,370
I love you, too.

668
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,940
Your present is on the car.

669
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,620
Shall we get down?

670
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,110
Sure.

671
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:27,910
Eh.

672
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,330
P'Bas, good bye.

673
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,510
Good bye.
Good bye.

674
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,130
Enjoy your time.

675
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,470
Good bye.

676
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,920
Wait for me, darling!

677
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,130
Is that okay?
- Ah, yes.

678
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,610
Do like I briefed
- Yes.

679
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,480
Okay.

680
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,560
Can you finish it before noon tomorrow?

681
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,410
I will, P'Bas.

682
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,920
Good, I'm going.

683
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,460
Good bye.
Good bye.

684
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,820
Oh, wow.

685
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,620
For my friend. I'll do it.

686
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,990
Do you need help?

687
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,830
Erm, oh.

688
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,740
You go back first, I'll work on it.

689
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,800
No problem.

690
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,390
I'm not in a rush.

691
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,460
I prefer going back with you.

692
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,850
Oh.

693
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,250
Fighting!

694
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:45,610
[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

695
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,620
Fighting!
[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

696
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,630
[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

697
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:58,680
[Please don't give me false hope, then leave my side]

698
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,250
[After I seriously think about it,]

699
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,950
[I realize this is really all I can do]

700
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:11,730
[I'll just be the middleman for you two]

701
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:16,180
[Giving my all even if you have no clue]

702
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,640
Wanna go on a date? I'm at April bar.

703
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,800
Waiting for your reply. Happy Valentine's day.

704
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,450
Hello, how many people?

705
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:37,080
Er ... one, please.

706
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:42,260
All tables are full. Could you please wait?

707
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,690
Brother, I know someone there.

708
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,690
Please have a seat, then.

709
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,450
Can I sit with you? The tables are full.

710
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,700
You've already sat down.

711
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,400
Hm.

712
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,530
I'm glad.

713
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,180
It's as if we're on a date.

714
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,870
Like we're celebrating Valentine's day.

715
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,080
If you want to sit with me, be quiet.

716
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,270
Excuse me.

717
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,270
Yes.

718
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,690
Here is your water.

719
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,620
Can I have one pork hot pot, please?

720
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,630
One pork hot pot.

721
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,700
And one crab papaya salad. Not spicy.

722
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,000
Two dishes, right?

723
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,970
Aren't you out on a date?

724
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,040
What do you see?

725
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,510
For real?

726
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,930
It's not your business.

727
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,630
Okay, fine.

728
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,040
Hey!

729
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,810
You're supposed to eat piece by piece.

730
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:22,890
Will eating like that be enjoyable?

731
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,890
I don't wanna be enjoyable.

732
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,400
I wanna eat.

733
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,260
Hm.

734
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:31,460
Hah.

735
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:33,900
This makes me want to know you more.

736
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,510
I like you.

737
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:39,440
This is your papaya salad.

738
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,290
Thanks.
- Yes, thank you.

739
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,350
See?

740
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,800
This is how you eat hot pot.

741
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,030
Will you eat it in the next life?

742
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,370
But it tastes better this way.

743
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,160
Try it out.

744
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,100
Um.

745
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,100
Hm.

746
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,750
Hot pot is so good.

747
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,140
Papaya salad is also good.

748
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,700
The man before me is good as well.

749
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,910
Nobody wants us.

750
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,430
That's why we're here.

751
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,340
So harsh.

752
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,650
It's not like no one wants me.

753
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:56,330
It's me who doesn't want others.

754
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:57,700
Why?

755
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,080
Because I want a certain someone.

756
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,260
Normally, on Valentine's day.

757
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:36,550
I'll always be alone.

758
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,170
This year is different.

759
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,170
I'm happy to have you.

760
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,270
Pew pew pew.

761
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,350
Are you really happy to have me?

762
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,300
Mhm.

763
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:55,870
It's awesome!

764
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,070
I'm not lonely being with you.

765
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,120
You know?

766
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:13,610
I had to sit and eat alone

767
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,170
on every Valentine's day.

768
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,410
I appreciate your help with my work

769
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:22,490
and for supporting King.

770
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,460
Yes.

771
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:30,860
P'King and P'Uea are so cute.

772
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,550
Uhm.

773
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,580
They're at odds before reaching this point.

774
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,400
P'Jade.

775
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:46,980
Huh?

776
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,030
Are you going to eat alone like in previous years?

777
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:58,910
Um.

778
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:01,840
Mhm.

779
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:09,930
No!

780
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,890
This meal is on me, Mai.

781
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,890
Let's have dinner together!

782
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:18,920
Hm?

783
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:20,050
Yes.

784
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,620
Yay!

785
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,360
Hehe.

786
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,130
[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

787
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:38,650
[Please don't give me false hope, then leave my side]

788
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:57,520
Hong Kong duck noodles.

789
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,310
Hong Kong duck noodles. M size 40 baht.

790
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,180
Two rice noodles, please.

791
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,470
Roger that.

792
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,340
What about you?

793
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:12,970
Er.

794
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,680
Same as you.

795
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:16,380
Please make it three.

796
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,170
You ordered a lot today.

797
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,740
Because it's delicious.

798
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,160
I know it's irresistible.

799
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:24,300
Isn't it hot?

800
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,060
No.

801
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:31,890
Let's go get water.

802
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:36,990
Let me help you.

803
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:58,910
Little duck said, "Quack, quack, quack."

804
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:00,350
Here.

805
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,050
La la
- Thank you.

806
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:03,720
La la la.

807
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:05,650
Um.

808
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:07,750
Here.

809
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,620
Thanks, bro.

810
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,350
Yeah.

811
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,930
Enjoy eating,

812
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:14,270
The seasoning is here.

813
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:14,660
Yep.

814
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,480
Don't use too much. There's not much left.

815
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,030
But you can take as much basil as you want.

816
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,790
Are you hungry?

817
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:22,380
Ah.

818
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,070
Yes.

819
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:26,720
I'm gonna start.

820
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:32,650
Eat slowly, P'Jade.

821
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,980
Or it'll stuck in your throat.

822
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,310
Go on. It's so good.

823
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,160
Eat when it's still warm.

824
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:39,860
Alright.

825
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,710
This is the best.

826
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,900
Duck leg!

827
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,250
P'Jade.

828
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,040
Hm?

829
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,440
This is Valentine's day.

830
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,440
Aren't you going on a date?

831
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:03,680
Um.

832
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,080
Nah.

833
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,860
For me...

834
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,160
eating tasty food is enough.

835
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:28,030
You're so cute, P'Jade.

836
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,220
What's so cute about me eating duck leg?

837
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,730
You're nice.

838
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,400
I've never met someone like you.

839
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,100
Er.

840
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:48,890
You didn't mean it negatively, right?

841
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,330
No.

842
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,760
That's not what I mean.

843
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:53,870
I mean...

844
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,690
P'Jade is a spe-
(Buzzz)

845
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,440
Huh? I'm being strange?

846
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,460
I'm sorry!

847
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,820
I mean...

848
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:05,020
You wanna sit, but don't have money!?
- Special! You're special.

849
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,020
What was that? I can't hear you.

850
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,210
Bruh.

851
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,420
Can you say that again?

852
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,730
I said...

853
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,870
you're special to me.

854
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:23,730
Er.

855
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,540
I'm just a normal mentor.

856
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,340
Not someone special.

857
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,490
With someone you like ...

858
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,330
Don't be too direct in courting them.

859
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,250
I understand.

860
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,040
Can I get one more L size dish?

861
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,150
You want more?

862
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,620
But this restaurant gives so much food.

863
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:49,310
Are you sure you can finish the L size?

864
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,610
Why are you laughing?

865
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,210
I feel you. The food here is very tasty.

866
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,090
Indeed.

867
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:03,120
But.

868
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,120
I don't think I can eat it all.

869
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,380
I'd better not place any more orders.

870
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:10,510
Um.

871
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:14,700
Eating tasty food can make people happy.

872
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,370
If you like someone, get them some tasty food.

873
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:24,460
Excuse me.

874
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,210
Can I have one shaved ice?

875
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:29,550
What flavor is good?

876
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:31,960
You want to eat dessert?

877
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,440
I'm ordering it for you.

878
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,790
What would you like to order?

879
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,450
Give me a moment.
- What do you want to eat?

880
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,500
Mai ... The dessert here doesn't taste good.

881
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,100
What do you want?

882
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:44,960
Ah.

883
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,530
One shaved ice with condensed milk, please.

884
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:49,620
Make it two, please.

885
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:50,570
Oh.

886
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,470
Just one. We'll eat it together.

887
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:54,630
One shaved ice?

888
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:55,910
We'll eat it together.

889
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,910
Eat it together.

890
00:58:58,980 --> 00:58:59,780
Got it.

891
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:08,220
It's ... not that bad?

892
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,760
Just kinda bland.

893
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,060
That's because you didn't warn me.

894
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,770
I didn't know you'll place an order.

895
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,010
But you said that if I like someone,

896
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,740
I should get them some tasty food.

897
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:21,640
That's right, but ...

898
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:23,700
What was that?

899
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:31,800
I said.

900
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,190
You said that if I like someone,

901
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,790
I should get them some tasty food.

902
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:40,270
Um.

903
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:41,470
Do you ...?

904
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:42,650
Yes, I do.

Directed by Thanamin Wongskulphat

906
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,160
P'Jade, I've never play with water on Songran day.

907
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:08,040
Don't worry. Just follow my lead.

908
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,270
Had I known you'd come, I wouldn't have come.

909
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,170
But I came because you're here.
