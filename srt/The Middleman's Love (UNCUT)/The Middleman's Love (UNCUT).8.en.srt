Uh.

4
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,570
I won't do it if you're not ready.

5
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,730
In exchange, can you sleep with me tonight?

6
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,510
Er.

7
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,410
Didn't you say if I'm not ready...

8
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,240
I just want to cuddle with you.

9
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
Nothing else.

10
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,520
Of course!

11
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,300
[Playing with my heart, you crazy?]

12
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,899
[That caught me off guard]

13
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,380
[How did you fall for me?]

14
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,640
Ah. P'Jade.

15
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,640
Hahaha.

16
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,760
P'Jade, hang on a minute.

17
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,650
[You made me a man in the middle of your heart]

18
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,080
Eh. Mai.

19
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,250
Wait.

20
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,070
Let me guess the culprit first.

21
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,220
Wait a minute.

22
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,070
Who do you think is the culprit?

23
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,510
Hm.

24
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,720
I think...

25
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,310
It's...
- Hold on!

26
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,840
Let me guess.

27
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,630
I think...

28
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,960
it's this guy for sure.

29
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,160
This one?

30
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,090
Yeah, he's the most suspicious.

31
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,880
I don't think so.

32
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,960
I think it should be...

33
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,520
that one.

34
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,160
Huh? Oh!

35
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,610
It's possible.

36
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,720
Did i guess wrong?

37
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,710
Why do you like Detective Conan?

38
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,090
Um.

39
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,960
I watched it when I was a kid.

40
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,610
Conan is very smart, and I wanna be like him.

41
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,030
But there is only one truth...

42
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,520
I'm just a normal office worker in real life.

43
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,320
Bwah. My dear Conan.

44
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,720
What a sob story.

45
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,000
You're ordinary, but special to me.

46
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,320
Mai.

47
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,680
Mai.

48
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,490
Mai.

49
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,130
Am I dreaming?

50
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:44,800
Hm?

51
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,070
Do you still think you're dreaming?

52
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,850
Kind of.

53
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,490
How about now?

54
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,040
It still seems like a dream.

55
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,770
Still a dream.

56
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,650
A dream.

57
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,010
Alright, I'm wide awake.

58
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,700
Mai.

59
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,550
I can't believe

60
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,550
I got to be your boyfriend.

61
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,860
Or that a perfect man like you...

62
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,970
will like someone me.

63
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,740
I now love you, P'Jade.

64
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,680
Not just 'like.'

65
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,330
Whoa, Mai.

66
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,720
Sweet talker.

67
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,520
You have your own strength.

68
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,520
Believe in yourself.

69
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,720
[It seems like your heart rate rose higher than normal while resting.]

70
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,930
Are you getting used to it?

71
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,860
It seems like Phakin's heart

72
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,230
belongs to Jadeniphat.

73
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,530
It seems like

74
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,950
Jadeniphat's heart

75
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,770
also belongs to Phakin.

76
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,060
[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

77
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,920
Give it to someone else if you dare.

78
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,770
It only belongs to you, Mai.

79
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,909
Hmm.

80
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:40,000
[Please don't give me false hope, then leave my side]

81
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,280
Hey!

82
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,690
I'm doomed.

83
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,580
What- what did you say, Mai?

84
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,640
You're so cute.

Oh.

97
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,140
You're no longer shy?

98
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,250
I am.

99
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,030
But I wanna be with you, so I forced myself not to be shy.

100
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,670
Well, you in this style is quite...

101
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,480
Is it bad?

102
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,580
Um.

103
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,300
Yes.

104
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,930
Ah!

105
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,630
I- I mean...

106
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,020
You wanted to say that I'm too hot to handle, right?

107
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,460
Hm.

108
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,440
Whose boyfriend is this? You're the best at reading my mind.

109
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,930
It's Jadeniphat's boyfriend.

110
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,800
Mai.

111
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,240
[I like you so much]

112
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,450
Mai's heart.

113
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,620
[Playing with my heart, you crazy?]

114
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,400
[That caught me off guard]

115
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,000
[How did you fall for me? Tell me how]

116
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,740
[I can’t figure this out]

117
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,210
[You changed me with the great power of love]

118
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,660
[For a middleman]

119
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:52,140
[You made me a man in the middle of your heart]

120
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,570
Aren't you gonna release my hand?

121
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,640
I don't want to.

122
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,890
So dramatic.

123
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,780
I had no idea you'd be so passionate.

124
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,050
I wanna hold your hand forever.

125
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,140
Hmm.

126
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,500
What's going on between this pair?

127
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,210
What's up?

128
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,080
Shut up!

129
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,370
Hey!

130
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,110
Where are you taking him?

131
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,300
Can I talk to him for a few seconds?

132
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,710
No.

133
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,610
I won't let you. Where are you taking him?

134
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,380
Jade, give us a moment.

135
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,150
Damn you.

136
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,050
Please let me talk to P'King and P'Uea.

137
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,170
I'd like to thank them.

138
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,750
Thank them?

139
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,410
I might not be able to date you if it weren't for them.

140
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,500
Okay.

141
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,570
This is for helping us out.

142
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,100
Uea.

143
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,110
I didn't get anything when I helped you and King.

144
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,760
The only thing I got is King's curses.

145
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,700
Hey, what are you smiling for?

146
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,260
Mai.

147
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,090
Here you are.

148
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,680
Thanks.

149
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,820
Let me carry yours.

150
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,170
Thank you.

151
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,740
Thank youuu.

152
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,870
Take mine, too.

153
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,770
No way!

154
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,440
Hey! Do me a favor!

155
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,830
Come on!

156
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,310
Please return quickly, Mai.

157
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,620
And you, King. Make it quick!

158
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,330
Be quick.

159
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,620
It amazes me that your advice and mine are the same.

160
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,210
Mai and Jade got to be together.

161
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,080
I really appreciate your help.

162
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,410
Um, take good care of Jade.

163
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,690
Don't take advantage of his kindness.

164
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,500
I'll keep that in mind.

165
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,090
Jade is a very good man.

166
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,090
And he's my friend.

167
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,240
Never ever hurt him, Mai.

168
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,860
I'll do my best and never gonna hurt him.

169
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,030
Remember one thing.

170
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,109
If you upset him,

171
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,569
be prepare, Mai.

172
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,800
I'll come at you.

173
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,010
Why are you threatening him?

174
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,300
You can go. Jade is waiting.

175
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,220
Thank you very much.

176
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,050
Um.

177
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,480
Please don't be mad at me.

178
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,690
Don't you remember last night?

179
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,460
I'm sorry.

180
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,310
I'm deeply in love with you, so I got jealous.

181
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,290
You know that, right?

182
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,210
Hm?

183
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,660
Mhm.

184
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,450
I really love you, too.

185
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,860
Hey.

186
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,950
I never think of seeing anyone else.

187
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,710
Don't you worry.

188
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,470
I just want you to believe in me.

189
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,220
Sorry for being impatient.

190
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,090
I believe you.

191
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,840
P'King!

192
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,390
Huh? Mai?

193
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,060
Where is P'Jade?

194
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,960
Over there.

195
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,730
I'll take it to P'Jade.

196
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,720
Um.

197
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,420
Sakoo, do you miss me?

198
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,420
Your cheeks are so squishy.

199
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,420
Why do you want to meet Sakoo?

200
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,830
I'm afraid I won't be able to see him anymore.

201
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,030
Um.

202
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,960
So I want to come before my internship ends.

203
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,760
Will you miss me, Sakoo?

204
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,850
Will you?

205
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,680
Give me a smile.

206
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,810
Squishy cheeks.

207
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,260
Are you taking a photo of me?

208
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,480
Mhm.

209
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,750
You can save it as a keepsake.

210
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,610
I'll send it to you.

211
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,960
Why don't you take a photo with me?

212
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,060
You think so?

213
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,990
Sakoo, let's take a pic!

214
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,670
Look at the camera.

215
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,520
1, 2, 3!

216
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,570
Mai.

217
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,670
Please send this pic to me.

218
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,100
Sakoo.

219
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,370
Be good, alright?

220
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,480
Be a good boy for P'Na and P'Jade.

221
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,580
Is something wrong?

222
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,580
Nah.

223
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,580
I was thinking that

224
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,010
we won't be seeing each other as often after your internship ends.

225
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,380
You're lovely as always.

226
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,470
I'm lovely?

227
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,180
You're fortunate to have met him, Sakoo.

228
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,090
I, too...

229
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,300
am lucky to be his boyfriend.

230
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,090
He's so nice.

231
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,300
Maybe I'm not that nice.

232
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,010
You might know just one side of me.

233
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,340
Since I've known you,

234
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,130
not a single side of you is bad to me.

235
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,330
That's not true. I'm lazy and dumb.

236
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,110
Sometimes I also can't keep up with others.

237
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,360
I was like that as well.

238
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,360
Does that mean

239
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,500
I'm a bad person?

240
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,500
Eh?

241
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,280
No! You're the best! You're so perfect.

242
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,410
You know what?

243
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,350
I used to feel the pressure from others

244
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,820
who said I'm always perfect.

245
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
But

246
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,740
when it's you who said it,

247
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,090
I'm overjoyed.

248
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,040
Because in my eyes,

249
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,250
you're perfect, too.

250
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:16,740
I love and like you the way you are.

251
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,280
I won't ever get over you if you're like this.

252
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,340
Get ready from now on,

253
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,240
since I'll be crazy in love with you.

254
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,780
P'Jade.

255
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,340
Erm.

256
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,810
Let's go home.

257
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,240
P'Jade.

258
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,690
Can we sleep at my place tonight?

259
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,020
Huh?

260
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,120
I have Conan's new episode.

261
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,170
Fine.

262
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:05,880
[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

263
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:15,900
[Please don't give me false hope, then leave my side]

264
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,410
[After I seriously think about it,]

265
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,160
[I realize this is really all I can do]

266
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:30,880
[I'll just be the middleman for you two]

267
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,760
Sakoo.

268
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,770
P'Jade.

269
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,480
Hm?

270
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,100
Ah!

271
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,160
You can still use everything in the bathroom.

272
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,260
I don't mind.

273
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,610
What I mind is...

274
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,050
you're naked again.

275
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,450
What was that?

276
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,260
What did you say?

277
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,160
Er.

278
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,140
I'm embarrassed.

279
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,540
Holy moly.

280
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,420
Can I change clothes here?

281
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,280
That corner is better.

282
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,450
That way.

283
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,660
Right there!

284
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,820
P'Jade.

285
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,100
Stop! What are you gonna do?

286
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,500
I'm gonna catch you.

287
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,020
Hold on!

288
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,800
Ah.

289
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,020
Mai.

290
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,490
Wait a minute!

291
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,040
Argh!

292
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,990
Tomorrow is your last day.

293
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,340
We won't get to work together

294
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,660
or meet each other every day like this.

295
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,100
I won't let that happen.

296
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,150
I'll drive you to work every day, how is it?

297
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,220
Really?

298
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,010
Yes.

299
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,150
Whoa, but it'll be troublesome for you.

300
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,540
If you always give me a ride, you won't get enough rest.

301
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,100
Right?

302
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,410
Are you worried about me?

303
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,680
Um.

304
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,690
You're my boyfriend, how could I not be worried?

305
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,210
I want you to have a good rest.

306
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,690
Oh.

307
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,490
Mai.

308
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,200
Should I move in with you?

309
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,570
So we can see each other every day?

310
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,440
Do you wanna start packing tomorrow?

311
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,180
Sure!

312
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,010
Let's do it tomorrow!

313
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,880
Here you go.

314
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,520
All the point I gave you isn't bias.

315
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,980
You gain all of it with your own ability.

316
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,150
Thank you.

317
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,880
Hello, everyone.

318
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,880
Hello.

319
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,650
So everyone is present.

320
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,370
We have a farewell party for our interns tonight, remember?

321
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,000
There's no way I can forget it

322
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,050
because I've waited for it for a week.

323
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,690
Did you use up your salary?

324
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,920
P'King, you knew me well.

325
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,330
Alright, then

326
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,240
who'll make the reservation?

327
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Oh, I'll do it.

328
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,440
Take care of it.

329
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Leave it to me.

330
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,250
P'Jade.

331
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,840
What's the matter?

332
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,980
Well,

333
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,700
I just realized that since we have a party tonight,

334
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,660
we can't go to pack my belongings.

335
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,490
We can do it tomorrow.

336
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,660
I'll help you.

337
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,570
Um.

338
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,340
P'Jade, do you remember the restaurant we went last time?

339
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,890
P'Jade.

340
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,080
P'Jade!
- What!?

341
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,730
Why the heck did you yell?

342
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,200
You're busy chatting with Mai, aren't you?

343
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,400
What? No!

344
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,560
I'm not.

345
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,700
You're kinda sus.

346
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,420
How so?

347
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,030
Come on.

348
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,220
Everyone.

349
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,650
Yes?

350
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,720
P'Jade and I...

351
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,970
are currently dating.

352
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:46,450
[Playing with my heart, you crazy?]

353
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,250
[That caught me off guard]

354
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,160
[How did you fall for me?]

355
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,490
This is too much. Can't you be considerate to a single dog?
- I know right?

356
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,830
Congratulations, P'Jade, Mai.

357
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,650
Let's toast to you tonight!

358
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,810
It'll be a bachelor party!

359
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,830
Are you embarrassed?

360
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,750
Of course!

361
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,140
Shall we announce like this too?

362
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
You're kidding me.

363
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,940
Anyway, I'm happy with you.

364
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,660
Our company now has 2 couples.

365
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,730
And the third pair is incoming.

366
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,780
We're fortunate that our boss is open-minded.

367
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,540
Congratulations.

368
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,900
Thank you.

369
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:03,400
[You made me a man in the middle of your heart]

370
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,140
Nong Jade.

371
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,100
Your life is already very sweet, do you need to add more sugar?

372
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,730
Is it relevant?

373
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,940
Yes!

374
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,280
By the way, where's your boyfriend?

375
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,670
Can I call him that?

376
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,410
Bruh.

377
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,510
You think you can stand in others' way since you have a boyfriend?
- I second that, P'King.

378
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,640
It's not related!

379
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,420
Yeah, it's not.

380
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,740
I wanna tease you because you look funny when you're shy.

381
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,400
Bastard!

382
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,140
You're making the world know that Mai and I are together.

383
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,450
Hey! Now they know because you shouted.

384
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,360
Uh.

385
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,020
Shut up!
- Whoa!

386
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,060
Mai!

387
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,070
Hey guys!

388
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,950
We're off work! Yay!

389
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,920
I'll take you to karaoke, alright?

390
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,140
Sounds great! Let's go!

391
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,320
P'King, P'Uea, can I go with you?

392
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,450
Sure.

393
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,300
Gus and Tong are coming with me, aren't you?

394
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,210
Your lover's car is also yours, right?

395
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,660
Ah!

396
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,190
Babe, they're making fun of me!

397
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,190
It's alright, babe.

398
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,880
Aren't you get going?

399
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,040
Fine. Come on, guys.

400
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,630
Let's go, Mai! King is going to bully me!

401
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,560
Bruh. Jade.

402
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,020
Uea. Come on, darling.

403
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,200
Jade! Come here!

404
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,200
(Sigh)

405
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,770
Let's go.

406
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,220
Today is our last day of internship.

407
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,470
I'm sure I'll miss you.

408
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,610
Why?

409
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,850
Huh? Well...

410
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,260
We're lovers.

411
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,940
We can meet up whenever you miss me.

412
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,960
You're too straightforward!

413
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,970
Why?

414
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,970
Did I make you shy?

415
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,000
No, I'm not shy!

416
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,580
Tomorrow,

417
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,350
can I go eat hot pot at my boyfriend's house?

418
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,890
Of course.

419
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,170
Hehe. Let's go!

420
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,290
I can't wait.

421
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,130
I'm excited.

422
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,100
Get in.

423
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,440
Are you anxious? Whoa!

424
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,120
Ah! My tongue twists.

425
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,050
Don't be afraid.

426
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,050
Ah, I'm so panicked!

427
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,810
Calm down, P'Jade.

428
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,520
Well.

429
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,520
I felt shy.

430
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,179
I just wanna tell you that don't be afraid of my parents.

431
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:27,659
They are the kindest couple in the world!

432
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,820
Hmm.

433
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:40,130
I'm not afraid.
- Really?

434
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,850
Oh!

435
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,810
Hm.

436
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,580
Mai, they'll see us!

437
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,080
Are you really not afraid? Hm?

438
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,340
Yeah. You're this lovely.

439
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,800
Your family must be as lovely as you.

440
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,910
Mai.

441
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,200
Well, let's get inside.

442
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,000
It's too hot here.

443
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:22,960
Hey, sunlight, do you know who Mai is!?

444
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,220
Why are you burning him? I'll...

445
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,430
Mai!

446
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,330
Eh.

447
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,680
Mai, they'll see us!

448
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,100
Nobody is watching.

449
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
My parents are waiting inside.

450
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,400
Look, they're here!

451
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,890
Come on!

452
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,290
P'Jade, wait for me.

453
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,610
Stop it, guys!

454
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,810
Why yelling!?

455
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,810
Mama.

456
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:16,680
He'll tense up if you stare at him like that.

457
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
Whoa!

458
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,490
I'm good, P'Jade.

459
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,640
So handsome.

460
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,440
Just as Jan said.

461
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,490
See? I told you.

462
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,910
Am I handsome?

463
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,150
Why are you using sexy voice!?

464
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,440
I wanted to know if I'm handsome.
- Yes, you are!

465
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,120
That's it.

466
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,170
Mai, if you have any problems in your relationship, feel free to consult with us.

467
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,860
Thank you so much.

468
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,880
Papa!

469
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,910
We can be of help if things go wrong.

470
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,990
When I first met you,

471
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:07,010
I also thought the way you look at Jade isn't normal.

472
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,240
How?

473
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,400
Um.

474
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,920
Are you saying that... Mai has been liking me since then?

475
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,240
Hm, yeah?

476
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,260
You knew?

477
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,030
It's pretty obvious.

478
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,790
P'Jade was unaware, though.

479
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,140
That's true.

480
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:33,240
Mai, have you planned to let Jade meet your parents?

481
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,840
Yes.

482
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,520
Mama.

483
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,570
P'Jade, keep it just in case.

484
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,170
Take it.

485
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,980
I'll let you borrow it.

486
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,280
Mutelu. (Superstitious)

487
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,560
Mutelu.

488
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,730
That's enough, guys. Let's eat!

489
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,730
I pity Mai.

490
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,280
Let's eat.

491
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,100
Take care of him, Jade.

492
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,490
P'Jade, here is your fried chicken.

493
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,320
Can you eat pork with yellow curry paste?

494
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,720
Thanks you, Papa.

495
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
This fried chicken is a mouthful.

496
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,840
You copied him. You wanna eat everything he ate?

497
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,340
Yo like to eat only fried chicken before.

498
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,890
Mai.

499
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,980
Do you know that Jade doesn't like doing housework?

500
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,170
Especially washing the dishes.

501
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,860
I have no idea.

502
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,180
But...

503
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,590
I wanna do it for him forever.

504
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,590
Haha.

505
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,370
I always handle most of the housework.

506
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,360
I'm also concerned for Jade.

507
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,700
I just didn't interfere with his life that much.

508
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,680
P'Jade seems to take good care of himself.

509
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,610
I know that.

510
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,790
So I'm not too worried.

511
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,250
What I'm worried is...

512
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,750
Jade is quite self-conscious.

513
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,350
He lacks the courage to speak up or act on what he wants.

514
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,130
I know.

515
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,630
It's because he's a very sensitive person.

516
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,900
He cares about other people's feelings,

517
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,420
until sometimes he overlooks his own.

518
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:14,100
But after this, I will take care of P'Jade and his feelings.

519
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,320
What's you guys talking about?

520
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,700
Ahem.

521
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,000
I told him that you don't like to wash dishes.

522
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,680
- Heh.
- Hahaha.

523
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,300
- P'Jett!
- Hm?

524
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm not that bad. I can wash.

525
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,440
- Can you?
- Ya.

526
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,260
Let's me help.

527
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,640
It's okay.

528
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,500
It's fine, P'Jade.

529
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,860
I got this, you just go rest.

530
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,200
You sure?

531
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,200
Muah.

532
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:49,740
Muah.

533
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,200
Oh?

534
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,280
- Woah
- Woahhhh.

535
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,940
I'm jealous.

536
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,020
Jan, Jett go away.

537
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,320
- Go!
- Why did you kick me?

538
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,780
Go now!

539
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,240
Let's go?

540
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,880
Hey. It's okay.

541
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,900
I got this.

542
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
- Thank you
- Thank you.

543
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,320
Jan!

544
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,380
- Yesss.
- Come help me wash.

545
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,680
Okay.

546
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,080
Is this dish-washing outfit?

547
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,580
Ya.

548
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,440
Let me see?

549
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,200
Mutelu...

550
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,500
Know only this song.

551
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,660
Or you want another song?

552
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,520
Hm hm hm hm Deja yu

553
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,660
Hah.

554
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,260
They sing like this?

555
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:29,960
No.

556
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,200
I will go rest.

557
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,940
Eh? You asked me to come help you.

558
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,940
Hm hm hm Deja yu. Hah Hah.

559
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,780
Ooh!

560
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:23,960
Mai.

561
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,900
How did you feel meeting my family today?

562
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,460
Is it okay?

563
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,180
Everyone is so nice.

564
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,900
Later...

565
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,440
next week you go meet my family?

566
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,140
Yes. Of course.

567
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,980
Well...Mai.

568
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,240
But...

569
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,820
Will your family like me?

570
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,700
Why will they not like you?

571
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,680
[I want to express my love for you]

572
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,820
[But I'm too scared]

573
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,300
[I want to let you know how much I love you]

574
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,780
[I don't dare to say I miss you]

575
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,780
I like you so much.

576
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,960
[But I can always answer]

577
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,920
So my dad, mom, and brother will definitely like you.

578
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,020
[But there's never been a day I could say I love you]

579
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,160
Sweet talk.

580
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,280
So sweet like this, there must be many people who fall for you.

581
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,440
Not that many.

582
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,440
Mai.

583
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:52,900
I...

584
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,280
I want to ask you something.

585
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,740
How many boyfriend did you have?

586
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,660
I've had 2 boyfriends before.

587
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,100
And...

588
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,980
Why did you break up?

589
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,400
The first one moved abroad to study.

590
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,740
Another one has different mindset.

591
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,740
We argued many times,

592
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,600
couldn't understand each other, so we eventually broke up.

593
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,800
What about you?

594
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,660
How many boyfriend did you have?

595
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,600
Only one.

596
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,560
But...

597
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,080
I don't want to recall it.

598
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,320
It's fine. I understand.

599
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,220
Mai.

600
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,150
The things that you argued with your ex
and couldn't reconcile.

601
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,620
That's...

602
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,470
I want you to know something about me.

603
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,770
Well...

604
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:29,770
Actually...

605
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,670
I'm the kind of person that...

606
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,300
unreasonable.

607
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,350
Sometimes I'm sulky,

608
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,300
overthinking,

609
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,720
and...

610
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,720
very jealous.

611
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:51,750
Really?

612
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,650
I want you to be jealous of me.

613
00:45:59,250 --> 00:45:59,770
Mai.

614
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,250
- I'm serious
- Don't worry, P'Jade.

615
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,620
Alright...

616
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,270
Shall we make an agreement?

617
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,020
If either you or me feel uncomfortable,

618
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:17,570
can we talk openly?

619
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,220
Don't keep it.

620
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,570
Is this okay?

621
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,150
Mai.

622
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,850
I have something to show you.

623
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,100
What is it?

624
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,100
Come here.

625
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:49,770
What?

626
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,200
Here you are.

627
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,200
This one...

628
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,850
You open it.

629
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,500
At first...

630
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,870
I intended to make a checklist notebook.

631
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,000
to keep memories between me and the intern.

632
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,770
That's why I didn't tell you.

633
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,900
I intended to draw all these pictures.

634
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,250
I just want you to see.

635
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,370
P'Jade...

636
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:11,800
[Have you ever felt this way?]

637
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:12,340
Mai...

638
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:17,050
[That you aren't tall, white, and attractive like others]

639
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,100
[Have you ever felt this way?]

640
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,770
P'Jade, don't be too cute.

641
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:26,570
[That you aren't rich, or stylish, but rather ordinary]

642
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,150
Er...

643
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:27,500
It's...

644
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,220
[I'm just an average man, who's not special]

645
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,400
Er...I...

646
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,820
Mai, you just read it here.

647
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,120
I...

648
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm going to take a shower.

649
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,050
I...

650
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,720
It's a bit hot, is it?

651
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:50,070
Then, I will be right back.

652
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,000
Just see it right there.

653
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:10,300
[After I seriously think about it]

654
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:14,100
[I realize this is really all I can do]

655
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,700
[I'll just be the middleman for you two]

656
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,250
[Even though the truth is I love you]

657
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,400
[Love you with all my heart,]

658
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,600
[although you've never known]

659
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,000
What do you look at?

660
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,000
Hm?

661
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,150
Because my P'Jade is cute.

662
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,120
What are you saying?

663
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,120
I'm going to sleep.

664
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,050
Tell me if you're hurt.

665
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,150
(moaning)

666
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,820
I'm not scared.

667
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,000
Have you slept?

668
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:36,920
Not yet.

669
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,050
You can continue.

670
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,120
You okay?

671
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,920
It's okay if we don't do tonight.

672
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,920
I'm fine with it.

673
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,920
Actually....

674
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,770
(sigh)

675
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,770
Er...

676
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,300
I...

677
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,400
Well...how should I say.

678
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,070
Let's do?

679
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,070
I want to try.

680
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,870
Hi. Let me help you.

681
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:11,900
Hi. P'Somkit.

682
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,000
P'Jade.

683
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,300
I'm fine.

684
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,870
Let's go.

685
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,920
You don't have to worry, P'Jade.

686
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,950
Just be yourself like when you're with me.

687
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:54,320
But...

688
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,520
They are your parents, Mai.

689
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,000
My parents will love and adore you.

690
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,300
like I do.

691
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,420
But still...

692
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:13,800
Being yourself is the best thing.

693
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:15,800
Be confident.

694
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,950
Love you babe.

695
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,270
I love you too.

696
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:32,220
Let's go.

697
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,870
- Ouch!
- Hey!

698
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:38,870
Hey...

699
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:39,870
Oh.

700
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,750
P'Jade, are you okay?

701
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,500
Lucky that I still got you.

702
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:53,650
The floor is slippery, is it?

703
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:55,650
I faltered.

704
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,350
- Hello
- Hi

705
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,350
Miss you all.

706
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,600
Thank you Jade for taking care of Mai.

707
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:12,600
Your welcome.

708
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,150
Did you travel very far?

709
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,000
No, we didn't.

710
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:21,120
Kanchanaburi is not far from Bangkok.

711
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,750
Mai has talked about you very often.

712
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:27,400
Happy to meet you.

713
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:29,400
Yes.

714
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,870
Before Mai finish an internship,
might need to bother you with many things.

715
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:36,450
No problem.

716
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:39,870
It's me who have to bother Mai Mai.

717
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,570
Bothering 'Mai' with many things.

718
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:50,150
Got someone takes care of him, I'm happy enough.

719
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,200
Anyway, mom.

720
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:57,350
What food have you prepared?

721
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:58,970
Have you prepared the one I told you?

722
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:02,700
Of course, because you did ask me.

723
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,470
Mai said Jade like fried chicken, do you?

724
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,100
Are you hungry?

725
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,170
Yes, I am. Then...

726
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,150
P'Jade, shall we have lunch now?

727
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:19,000
Sure. Let's have lunch now.

728
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,550
Then, Mai and Man go prepare the table with father.

729
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,550
I'm having a talk with Jade for a while.

730
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:27,900
But...

731
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:28,900
A while.

732
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,220
Just go. No worries.

733
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:37,750
Follow me.

734
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,750
- Go.
- OK.

735
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,320
- Just a while.
- Hmmm.

736
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,570
You've grown up until got boyfriend.

737
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,120
Is Jade the first person you brought home?

738
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:53,720
Yes.

739
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:56,400
I'm serious with P'Jade.

740
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:59,670
You are always serious on what you're interested.

741
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,670
What a perfect man.

742
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:08,620
Agree. I thought you believe that you have to be perfect all the time.

743
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,520
Yes.

744
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:15,950
Actually, you don't have to be perfect all the time.

745
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,070
Thank you so much.

746
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:28,600
As I've seen, I think both of you get along very well.

747
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:32,100
I'm happy and glad to see that.

748
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,100
Er...

749
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,550
What about mom? What did she say?

750
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,800
She is fine.

751
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:44,050
She's just worried about you.

752
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:48,170
She's always been like this since you were young,
still don't get used to it?

753
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:50,770
You are the youngest child.

754
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,570
It's normal thing.

755
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,170
Just get used to it.

756
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,900
You dressed up so nice for coming here?

757
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,670
Yes, mom.

758
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:05,850
Can I ask you something?

759
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:06,820
Sure.

760
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,370
Do you have siblings?

761
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,350
Yes, I do.

762
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,500
Older brother and younger sister.

763
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,020
I'm a middle child.

764
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,650
Hm...how old are you?

765
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,650
I'm currently 28 years old.

766
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:22,520
Hm....you're much older than Mai.

767
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:26,770
I guess Mai bothered you a lot, did he?

768
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,020
Not at all, mom.

769
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,020
Can I call you 'mom'?

770
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,770
Yes. Why not?

771
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:40,650
Only just my age that is older than Mai's.

772
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,970
Mai doesn't need me to help him out.

773
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:48,650
It's me who have to bother Mai.

774
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:52,720
He has high responsibility at work.

775
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:57,700
To be honest, he is very mature.

776
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,700
Well.

777
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,820
Oh. Thank you.

778
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:11,570
Mai is my youngest child.

779
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:13,800
I'm worried about him.

780
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,470
But after he's done the internship and been with you,

781
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,120
He made me see that he is much more mature.

782
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:25,600
I thank you a lot for fulfilling Mai.

783
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,480
Your welcome.

784
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:33,660
I don't know how is the future for both of you.

785
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,600
But no matter what happens...

786
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,560
Can you take care of Mai?

787
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,100
You better don't say like that.

788
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,980
It's me who Mai has to take care of.

789
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,040
You guys take care of each others.

790
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,480
Sure.

791
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,200
I will do my best, mom.

792
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,440
Because Mai is my important one as well.

793
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,720
Thank you.

794
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:06,960
Welcome.

795
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,440
Are you hungry?

796
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,560
Shall we? They should finish preparing food.

797
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:12,220
Yes.

798
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,300
Just relax.

799
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,080
Oh?

800
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,640
There they are.

801
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,480
Mai, take him to a seat.

802
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,360
Yep.

803
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,360
Come on.

804
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,360
Come on, P'Jade.

805
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:29,940
Take a seat.

806
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,600
Let's eat before it's cold.

807
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,680
Yes sir.

808
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,580
Let me help get the rice.

809
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,540
Here you are.

810
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,840
- Mine is not too much.
- Got it.

811
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,840
Here.

812
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,060
Okay. Thank you. That's enough.

813
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,000
Mai, you eat more.

814
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,060
Thank you,

815
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:03,500
Alright, Jade, let's eat more.

816
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,960
What's wrong with you?

817
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,320
Im just kidding.

818
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,540
- Give him more rice, Mai.
- Okay.

819
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,760
Take it yourself. You're not a kid.

820
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,280
Welcome Jade to our family.

821
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,000
Thank you, dad.

822
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,380
You can think that here's your second house.

823
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:44,840
You can talk to me on anything.

824
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:48,220
Think of me as another older brother.

825
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,600
Thank you all so much.

826
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,540
If we all are ready then...

827
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,600
Let's eat!

828
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,300
Let's me take it, this one is dad's favorite.

829
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,000
Babe.

830
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,580
The weather is nice, is it?

831
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:35,700
Yes.

832
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,900
Actually...

833
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,180
you can talk with your parents for a while if you want.

834
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,460
It's my mom...

835
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,760
who want me to bring you around,

836
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,500
so that you won't feel lonely.

837
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,320
So cuteeee.

838
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:58,380
After a while, my mom will probably love you more than me.

839
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,540
Really?

840
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,760
Then that's fair!

841
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,800
My mom also loves you so muchhhh.

842
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,400
She said you are so handsome.

843
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,220
Sometimes she ask if anything is wrong with you so that you like me.

844
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,220
- Did she?
-Ya.

845
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:19,440
But it's true...how come you had a crush on me?

846
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,280
I told you before...

847
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,900
Because I saved Sako?

848
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,800
About Sako is just the first impression.

849
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:49,240
After that, I began to love you more and more,

850
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,300
during the time when we were together.

851
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,420
Mai Mai's baby...

852
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,980
is the kindest and most adorable...

853
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,060
in the world.

854
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:16,280
[Have you ever felt this way?]

855
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:21,560
[That you aren't tall, white, and attractive like others]

856
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,380
[Have you ever felt this way?]

857
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:31,520
[That you aren't rich, or stylish, but rather ordinary]

858
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,020
[I'm just an average man, who's not special]

859
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:40,820
[But you came and change me]

860
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:45,780
[When I'm with you, my life becomes wonderful]

861
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,220
[And I began to fantasize]

862
01:07:51,340 --> 01:08:00,740
[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

863
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,439
[Sometimes it burns]

864
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,420
[Sometimes it hurts]

865
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:30,800
[When you say my name]

866
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:35,680
[But are thinking of hers]

867
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,680
[I don't wanna know. Don't want you to go]

868
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:43,580
[And leave me behind, no]

869
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:47,240
[Cause I don't know]

870
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,560
[What you're looking for]

871
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:55,620
[Oh and I don't know]

872
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:59,760
[What to do]

873
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:05,120
[Hold back, let go]

874
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:08,560
[There is nothing more for me to show]

875
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:11,040
[You're hiding to breathe]

876
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,420
[Running from me]

877
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:18,260
[Do you really, wanna be in love?]

878
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:21,479
[Oh baby]

879
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:25,700
[Tell me you need me]

880
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:29,359
[That you can't stand it no more]

881
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:34,279
[That she ain't what you're looking for]

882
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,779
Your hometown's atmosphere is so nice,

883
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,560
So beautiful.

884
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,940
Mai Mai. Turn back your face.

885
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,500
What are you doing?

886
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:26,540
Can I take a look?

887
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,100
It hasn't finished yet.

888
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,680
Please.

889
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:36,760
Please...

890
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,760
Babe, please?

891
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:42,740
Is it diary?

892
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:46,400
Not really.

893
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,360
Do you remember who named me 'Jade, the middleman'?

894
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,740
Yes, I do.

895
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:58,980
Here it is.

896
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:12,910
Who'd have thought that an ordinary and not outstanding man like me...

897
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:18,220
who's mid in his job, wealth, and look,

898
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:21,420
had gotten to be together with Mai,

899
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,750
who gave me the name "Jade, the middleman."

900
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:27,300
Even though my man is so perfect,

901
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:29,690
when we're together

902
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:32,600
he can make me braver than ever.

903
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,910
So this is how good one feels when you're perfect in someone's eyes.

904
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:44,950
Jade, the middleman.
