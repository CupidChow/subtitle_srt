Jade, my cake is gone. Where is it?

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,560
Did you eat it? I can't find it anywhere.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,420
Where is my cake? Where is it?

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,140
King took it.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,100
Huh? Why me?

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,640
Gun!

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,000
It's not me, you idiot!

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,540
-I know it's you! Give it back right now!
-I said it's not me!

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,180
King, give it back to him.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,440
Uea... but I didn't take it, really!

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,000
Wait a minute. Then, who is the real culprit?

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,060
Always determining the one truth...

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,840
with the body of an adult, and the brain of a child.

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,380
Wait... the brain of an adult!

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,900
His name is "The great detective Jadeniphat!"

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,540
Maybe… the culprit is not one of us.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,340
Hey, Santi.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,460
Hey, Santi.

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,420
Hey, Santi!

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,980
Hey, Santi!

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,340
Dang, Santi, you can't be broken, right?

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,780
If you're broken, who's gonna help Jadeniphat?

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,280

I'm not sure I understand.

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,860
-Yay! Santi is still working!
-Hey, Jadeniphat. How can I help?

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,880
Let's find the culprit!

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,660

00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,360
You're done for!

36
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,820
Hello, Jadeniphat.

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,840
Who is he? So handsome!

38
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,700
Come to me.

39
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,240
As you wish, Jade.

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Jade, it's time to interview the intern.

41
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,460
Let me catch the culprit first. He's so handsome, though.

42
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,400
Jade. Is there anything I can help you with?

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,640
Yeah, please help me capture the culprit. But wait! You are the culprit!

44
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,560
Gah!

45
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,240
Jade, go interview your ! How many times do I have to tell you?

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,040
Let me mute you for a moment, Uea. I’m still questioning the culprit.

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,980
Ahem!

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,579
So... who are you?

49
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,140
Woof, woof, woof!

50
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,460
Dog's bark? So this is a dream!

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,220
But I still have no clue about his identity!

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,280
Woof, woof, woof!

53
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,340
Okay, fine!

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,220

Good morning.

81
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,640
Have a seat.

82
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,800
Yes.

83
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,240
Please introduce yourself.

84
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:42,540
Hello.

85
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,600
I'm Phakin Chaowapaphakorn.

86
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,140
You can call me Mai.

87
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,940
I applied to be a graphic design intern.

88
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,240
Hold on. He looks familiar.

89
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,310
Excuse me.

90
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,310
Is there something on my face?

91
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,030
Nope.

92
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,910
What is it?

93
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,050
Oh.

94
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,430
Here you are.

95
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,100
GPA 4.0!

96
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,020
My first intern!

97
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,960
What a great profile!

98
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,580
It's just so-so.

99
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,159
We graduated from the same university.

100
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,840
Why do you want to work here?

101
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,300
Because this company...

102
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,159
has a strong vision,

103
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,720
a wise leader

104
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,120
and a clean profile.

105
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:57,500
He's so handsome and smart.

106
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,220
His voice is also pleasing to the ear.

107
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,220
He's God's favorite, don't you think?

108
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,660
Um, sorry?

109
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,120
You...

110
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,800
I almost screwed up!

111
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,390
That's enough!

112
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,370
Are you done talking?

113
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,160
Next question.

114
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,210
What's the question again?

115
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,670
Tell-- Answer me!

116
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:16,710

Please relax.

120
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,250
Are you nervous?

121
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,830
Argh, the cleaners! I told them to fix the A/C.

122
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,470
It's really freezing here!

123
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,930
I should write them up.

124
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,210
Boo!

125
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,510
When you studied there...

126
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,590
Did our university have Sky Train yet?

127
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,330
I heard there used to be really bad traffic.

128
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,310
So, you see...

129
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,970
When I was studying there, the traffic was freaking terrible.

130
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,010
And they took forever to build the Sky Train.

131
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,070
They claimed it'd be finished in my freshman year.

132
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,800
But all we've got was a construction site.

133
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,820
And if it rained...

134
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,130
There's no doubt.

135
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,270
It was freaking flooded!

136
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
So you skipped class?

137
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,410
Yeah, I skipped like this.

138
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:13,830
Aha!

139
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,120

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,380
I'm here. I was in the bathroom just now.

158
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,200
You're somewhat different today, Jade.

159
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,100
Why don't you use the same voice you used in the interview?

160
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,440
Ahem!

161
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,540
Oh, Nong. Sit down first.

162

Where are you from?

163
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,340
No need to worry.

164
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,260
We're like brothers. Just be yourself.

165
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,780

171
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,100
This is the coffee area.

173
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,560
That is King's intern.

174
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,820
He started working on the programmer team last week.

175
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,000
His name is Tong, or Tong Tong.

176
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,660

177

185
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,110

186
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,130
I see.

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,590
Are you Gus and Mai, the interns on the graphic team?

188
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,890
Is this your first day at work?

189
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:29,730
Yes, it is.

190
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,890
See you later, then.

191
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:37,920
Hey, Tong.

192
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,510
-Hello, Bas
-Hello.

193
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,650
Have you seen King and Gun?

194
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,980
No, I haven't.

195
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,090
But Gun asked me to brew coffee for him.

196
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,800
Never mind.

197
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,370
So, we have a situation.

198
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,290
The customer is confused with the proposed promotion.

199
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,790
And I can't seem to find those two.

200
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,820
Tong.

201
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,310
Are you available right now?

202
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,550
Could you help me with this issue?

203
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,050
Sure.

204
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,740
We only have a few promotions.

205
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,240
So I'm not sure what we should aim for.

206
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,330
You see?

207
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,650
If you don't want more work that keeps you from eating lunch,

208
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,430
Don't ever think of brewing coffee at 11-11.30 p.m.

209
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,150
Trust me.

210
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,510
I started working here before you.

211
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,430
You can come here in the afternoon.

212
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,230
Let's get going.

213
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,950
Poor Tong.

214
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,040
Mai. Mai.

215
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,140
What do you think?

216
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,740
Is this superstition true?

217
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,330
Or just a coincidence?

218
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,410
A coincidence, I guess?

219
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,090
If you really want to know...

220
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,780
why don't you try to do it?

221
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,400
Jade, wait for me, please.

222
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,860
-Will you ever stop?
-Babe, it hurts!

223
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,300
We're like a family here.

224
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:10,350
It really hurts! OK, OK, I'll stop playing with you.

225
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,760
What the heck are you doing?

226
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,210
Ow.

227
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,570
You never listened when I asked nicely.

228
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,340
Jade, you came in time! Help me!

229
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,330
Uea, have mercy.

230
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,740
Darling, I'm hurt.

231
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,330
Uea, stop fighting first.

232
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,210
Stop it, alright?

233
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,590
We have interns today. I'm getting embarrassed.

234
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,720
-Haha. Hello.
-Hello.

235
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,020
Hey, guys.

236
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,720
My name is King.

237
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,230
You're on the Graphic team, so I'm sure you've met Uea.

238
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,410
But I'm warning you.

239
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,570
Don't you dare flirt with him.

240
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,130
He's all mine.

241
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,060
Hm.

242
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,100
Ouch!

243
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,900
Stop pinching him. His ass will be crooked for real.

244
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,700
See? Darling, you're obviously mad at me.

245
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,260
It's obvious that you're ignoring me!

246
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,560
The juniors are here.

247
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,910
Let's drop it for now. We'll talk about this later.

248
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,180
Let me give them a tour, alright?

249
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,460
Don't be the middleman for King again.

250
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,560
No, no, no! Let him be.

251
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,560
Don't worry, this is quite normal.

252
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,930
Yeah, it's like...

253
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,680
Cinderella's family.

254
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,720
Gus.

255
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,000
Hahaha.

256
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,840
No worries! You have me.

257
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,800
I'm Jadeniphat.

258
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,940
I can take care of everything for you!

259
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,680
Jade, the middleman?

260
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,580
I like it!

261
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,820
Did you say you like me?

262
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,840
Yes!

263
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,780
I like this name so much.

264
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,140
Thank you, Mai.

265
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,450
Start calling me "Jade, the middleman" from now on.

266
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,550
Got it?

267
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,050
You, too!

268
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,030
Call me Jade, the middleman.

269
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,190
Mai.

270
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,670
Thank you for giving me this cool name.

271
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,750
Jade.

272
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,910
Wow. Jade, the middleman!

273
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,730
Yeah!

274
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,340
Oh! Ow!

275
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,060
Ah.

276
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,720
Hey.

277
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,490
Are you okay?

278
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,420
Jade?

279
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,780
Jade, are you alright?

280
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,260
Hey, Jade. Can you look after my stuff?

281
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,640
[In high school]

282
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,950
I'm going to buy more paint.

283
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,120
Fine.

284
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,200
I can't leave because King's stuff is also here.

285
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,610
Good.

286
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,150
So hungry.

287
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,090
It wouldn't hurt to take one, right?

288
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,710
Jade.

289
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,410
Ah.

290
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,650
So I...

291
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,450
I didn't steal this bubble tea.

292
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:13,970
Here.

293
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,730
Er... well...

294
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,590
Thank you.

295
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,530
So...

296
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,150
Could you give this chocolate to King?

297
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:37,770
Oh.

298
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:38,970
Sure.

299
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,670
Thanks a lot!

300
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,710
I gotta go.

301
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,510
Don't forget to give it to King.

302
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,310
Ah.

303
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:49,960
Okay.

304
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,830
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

305
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,410
Jade, where is Uea?

306
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,900
[In university]

307
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,240
He's not here yet.

308
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,349
But I think I saw--
-Um...

309
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,770
You should keep it. I don't think he'll like that.

310
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,700
Can I have a talk with Uea?

311
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,720
Can you talk to him for me?

312
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,600
Um...

313
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,260
It'd still be useless.

314
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,660
When Uea makes a decision,

315
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,650
he is not gonna change it easily.

316
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,070
But...

317
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,490
Well, I think you should go back.

318
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,150
If he knows you came to see him at his door,

319
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,070
he will be even angrier.

320
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,460
Uea.

321
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,550
Uea.

322
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,690
He's gone.

323
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,830
Thanks, Jade.

324
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,460
Don't mention it.

325
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,170
You're just back from the Cheerleader contest.

326
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,410
Get some rest.

327
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,090
Go.

328
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,900
-Ah.
-Woah!

329
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,400
Jade, the middleman!

330
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,500
Gosh! It's the best!

331
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,920
I really am "Jade, the middleman."

332
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,010
Thanks again for this name, Mai.

333
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,380
We're glad that you're happy.

334
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,380
Please consider giving us a good assessment score.

335
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,680
Just be a good boy.

336
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,500
Let's go to the meeting room over there.

337
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,960
Okay?

338
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,370
Let's go!

339
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,000
Shall we?

340
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,240
Oh!

341
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,300
He tripped and was saved by a hero.

342
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,000
This must be Mai & Gus for sure.

343
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,900
So I'm gonna be a middleman again, well, you can count on me!

344
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,120
Ah.

345
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,260
Hey, guys.

346
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,760
I'm going first. See you tomorrow.

347
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,040
-Good bye.
-Good bye, guys.

348
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,060
King, Jade, Uea, good bye.

349
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,770
Bye.

350
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,260
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

351
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,070
People are leaving.

352
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,470
Mai!

353
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,610
Let's go home.

354
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,160
Alright, I'll prepare to leave.

355
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,660
Gus.

356
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,940
Leave it for tomorrow.

357
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,920
Let's go.

358
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,420
Yes, Uea.

359
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,480
Darling.

360
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,860
Let's go home, darling.

361
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,690
Hm.

362
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:38,900
Jade!

363
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,290
I'm going home.

364
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,920
Yeah, bye.

365
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,700
I thought you're still being sulky?

366
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,780
Hm?

367
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,020
How could I? Mwah! Mwah!

368
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,850
Shh! Ow!

369
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,570
Ouch!

370
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,810
They're all gone?

371
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,040
Hah, no one waited for me.

372
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,130
It hurts somehow.

373
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:45,690
Yah.

374
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,210
I should get going too.

375
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,630
Yah! One, two... yah!

376
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,300
Ow.

377
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,180
Huh?

378
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,060
Huh?

379
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,110
Eh. The light flickering?

380
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,100
Hey. Hey.

381
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,960
Nothing. Huh?

382
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,020
What?

383
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,680
J-J-Jade.

384
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,620
Run!

385
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,010
Argh!

386
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,710
Argh!

387
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,880
Huh? Mai?

388
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,490
Why are you still here?

389
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,490
Because you told me to go with you.

390
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,690
Mai.

391
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,250
Here you go!

392
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,580
That hurt, Jade.

393
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,280
You have one hell of a scream, though.

394
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,460
You still want to mock me? Come here.

395
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,320
-Ow! It hurts!
-Come on here. Let me hit you.

396
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,760
-Let me hit you!
-Ow! You let out a really loud scream.

397
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,940
Why didn't you go home? This is the price for bullying me!

398
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,040
The elevator is here.

399
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,220
Shall we go?

400
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,940
Hurry in, then!

401
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,300
Hmph!

402
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:28,520
♫Have you ever felt this way? That you aren't tall, white, and attractive like others♫

403
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:38,580
♫Have you ever felt this way? That you aren't rich, or stylish, but rather ordinary♫

404
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,040
♫I'm just an average man, who's not special♫

405
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,420

406
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,240
♫But you came and change me♫

407
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,480
Would you like some grilled pork?

408
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,640
Grilled pork?

409
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,900
I bought it for you.

410
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,180
Thanks.

411
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
You're not gonna eat?

412
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,100
Go ahead, I don't mind the smell.

413
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,200
♫How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?♫

414
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,120
Eat slowly so that you don't choke.

415
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,280
Water?

416
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,540
It tastes so good, Mai.

417
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,080
Yeah, I believe you.

418
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,500
Don't eat too fast.

419
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,140
Let's go! Woah!

420
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,040
♫I realize this is really all I can do♫

00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,100
Sandwiches and milk for you.

423
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,020
Thank you, Mai.

424
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,200
♫I'm not living in Chiangmai, Phuket, Yala or Kamphaeng Phet♫

436

Ow! Jade.

437
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,080
It hurts.

438
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
I'm working.

439
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:05,500
♫Please don't give me false hope, then leave my side♫

442

Since Mai gave me a ride that day, my life has been filled with him.

443
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:23,040
And it's so good that I don't wanna imagine my life without him.

444
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,340
Thank you for giving me a ride from that day up until now.

445
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,100
Anything I can do for you, Jade.

446
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,660
It's my pleasure.

447
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,220
Hm.

448
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,840
Your good deeds won't affect your evaluation, you know?

449
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,860
I'm just happy to help you...

450
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,580
in everything I can.

451
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,900
Your heart rate rose higher than normal while you're resting.

452
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,140
Jade, are you alright?

453
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,880
Nah.

454
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,580
It's nothing.

455
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,860
Your heart rate rose higher than normal. Are you exercising?

456
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,680
Ah.

457
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:06,560
Jade.

458
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,200
Huh?

459
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,560
Are you really alright?

460
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,320
Er.

461
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,160
Um.

462
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,660
I... I...

463
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,040
I'm fine.

464
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,560
Er...

465
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,760
Ah, I'm going.

466
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,240
-Hey, Jade!
-Wah!

467
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,040
This is amazing. What's the program's name? Can you teach me?

468
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,560
When did he come here?

469
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,640
Jade.

470
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,420
Are you...

471
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,260
I'm what?

472
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,340
It's nothing.

473
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,620
I'm good.

474
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,700
I'm not feeling anything.

475
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,040
Um, do you want to learn, Mongkol?

476
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,060
Yes, teach me.

477
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,020
Take this.

478
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,100
-Use this tool.
-Mm-hmm.

479
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,680
Apply it here smoothly.

480
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,300
And slowly drag it like this.

481
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,980
I see. Let me try.

482
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,780
Well, not that hard.

483
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,700
Is it like this, Jade?

484
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,980
Hey, Jade! Am I doing it right?

485
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,340
Yeah. What? No!

486
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,200
Why not? Show me.

487
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,860
Boo. Just do it like this.

488
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,360
I get it now.

489
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,380
Could you please teach me, too?

490
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,460
Hm.

491
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,880
-Jade.
-Huh?

492
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,540
Then...

493
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,100
You teach him. I'm going back to work.

494
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,920
Go easy on him, alright?

495
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,640
Here.

496
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,420
Right here.

497
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,880
That's right.

498
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,680
Move the pen slowly.

499
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,900
What should we eat?

500
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,820
I'm OK with anything.

501
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,660
Anything.

502
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,880
I'll follow you guys.

503
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,020
I'm fine with whatever you'd like.

504
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,700
Jade, I'm tired of a la carte.

505
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,600
How about noodles?

506
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,860
It's too hot.

507
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,660
What? What are we gonna eat, then?

508
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,880
Anything is fine.

509
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,980
Dang! This is the world's biggest mystery!

510
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,560
Ha.

511
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,660
Mai, what do you want to eat?

512
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:05,940
You.

513
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,840
Oh, sorry.

514
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:16,840
Eh?

515
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,720
Curry and rice is the right answer.

516
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,200
Choose whatever you want.

517
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,460
You made quite a quick decision.

518
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,600
There are so many things to choose from.

519
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,440
Hey.

520
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,400
I can't decide.

521
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,400
When it comes to food, trust me, bro.

522
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,200
Choose whatever works for you.

523
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,180
Thank you.

524
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,420
I ordered Kaprao.

525
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:39,980
Huh?

526
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,980
Why did you copy me?

527
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,940
I'm too lazy to decide myself.

528
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,880
Why don't you eat something else?

529
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,240
Just because.

530
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,960
Woah.

531
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,300
Can't we order the same dish?

532
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,440
No, you can't.

533
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,440
Hey, come closer.

534
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Let me tell you something.

535
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,180
The lesson of eating in a food court.

536
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,520
First, order one thing at a time, or else you'll get less food.

537
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,720
Second, don't ask them to remove rice.

538
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,720
You better share it with your friends.

539
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,560
And the last one.

540
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,960
Listen carefully.

541
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,760
You should eat chili paste because it's the best!

542
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760
See? It's this one.

543
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,760
If you're not full yet, eat the chili paste and vegetables to the fullest.

544
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,360
Let me enjoy my lunch.

545
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,740
I'm so hungry.

546
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,640
I'm gonna order mine, too.

547
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,540
I'm going with you.

548
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,720
Jade, wait for me, please.

549
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,900
I'm going, too.

550
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,120
Hey! Jade! Why did you stop?

551
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,880
Look at that.

552
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,920
So what?

553
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,620
C'mon.

554
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,920
There must be something between these two.

555
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,900
Ah, I'm getting shy.

556
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,880
Hm?

557
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,340
What a bold assumption.

558
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,580
What makes you think that way?

559
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Ha! Just take a look at their faces.

560
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,320
They are shy around each other like that. What else could it be?

561
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,060
I won't be clueless this time.

562
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,719
I'm the first to notice!

563
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,840
I'm gonna be the middleman for them, right?

564
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,420
Have you asked them if they want your help, huh?

565
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:59,380
See for yourself. They're literally blushing.

566
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,700
Just like I match-made you two, I'll do the same for them.

567
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,320
Hmph.

568
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,760
You're very consistent, aren't you?

569
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,840
Do you have that much free time to be the middleman?

570
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,800
I'll repay Mai's kindness of giving me the stage name "Jade, the middleman."

571
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,740
Ay.

572
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,040
Middleman's matchmaking operation! Start!

573
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,940
Hehe. Where did they go?

574
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,420
Since Jade match-made us,

575
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,220
shall we spice up our relationship, darling?

576
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,420
Hm?

577
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,860
Ow!

578
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,000
Darling, that hurt.

579
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,700
Ah.

580
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,220
Let's talk in our room.

581
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,860
I've prepared an outfit.

582
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,280
Be ready.

583
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,700
♫How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?♫

584
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,380
Mai.

585
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,240
Yes, Jade?

586
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,940
The client just sent me a brief.

587
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,060
Can you help me with this assignment?

588
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,840
How may I help you?

589
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,700
Is it this one?

590
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,020
It feels good.

591
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,460
No, Jade! You can't think like that.

592
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,620
Mai belongs with Gus.

593
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,660
Jade?

594
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,300
What's wrong?

595
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,720
Erm.

596
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,240
Nah.

597
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,240
Er.

598
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,620
Too close.

599
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,180
I'm sorry.

600
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,560
Uea!

601
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,080
Huh?

602
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,700
Where are you going?

603
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,360
-So...
-What?

604
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,100
Have you assigned him with anything?

605
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,340
Not yet. Why?

606
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,760
About the client's brief for the latest product...

607
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,220
Can you lend Gus to help Mai with this work?

608
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,180
Help Mai?

609
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,800
I wanna let them work in pairs to strengthen their bonds.

610
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,320
Yes. Of course.

611
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,540
Thank you, Uea.

612
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,200
-I'm gonna go to the restroom.
-Okay.

613
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,920
Mai, I've already sent the brief to you.

614
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,740
Please help him, Gus.

615
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,380
Yes, sure.

616
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,960
Find a place for brainstorming.

617
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,600
Let's go work at the resting area, Mai.

618
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,540
Yeah, so you can come up with great ideas.

619
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,340
Go ahead.

620
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,280
I'll be right back.

621
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,720
Alright. Don't be anxious.

622
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,020
I mean... work hard, guys.

623
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,200
Yes, I will.

624
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,160
Let's go.

625
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,740
What great timing.

626
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,100
The programmers aren't here, and Mongkol was called over by Bas.

627
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,900
Hahaha. That was smooth sailing.

628
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,820
Boosting a couple's bond... my toes curl just thinking about it.

629
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,500
Keep it down, Jade.

630
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,800
-What did you just say?
-Woah!

631
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,540
Huh?

632
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,180
What did you say?

633
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,060
Me?

634
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,600
Yeah.

635
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,960
Nonsense! I haven't said a thing!

636
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,660
Are you hearing things?

637
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,120
Get your ears checked.

638
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,480
Woah, it's awesome, Mai.

639
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,440
It's settled, then.

640
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,540
I'll send it to Jade.

641
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,380
Yeah.

642
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:44,640
Huh?

643
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,920
Do you have a stiff neck?

644
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,040
A little.

645
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,840
Should I give you a massage?

646
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,520
I'm very good at it, you know?

647
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,280
Thank you.

648
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,980
Haha.

649
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,100
Eh? Tong?

650
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,160
Do you want a massage, too?

651
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,640
What. Tong.

652
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,580
No, I don't like it.

653
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,080
C'mon. What's the rush? Take it easy.

654
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,300
Didn't you just attend a meeting? I know you're tense all over.

655
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,160
What I mean is I just don't like it.

656
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,000
Can't be Tong & Gus. Must be Mai & Gus only!

657
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,420
I don't like... really...

658
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,140
Hey! Hahaha.

659
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,300
How did it go, guys?

660
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,220
We're done, and I'm going to email it to you.

661
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,640
Oh, that's cool.

662
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,920
So, what are you doing?

663
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,460
I'm going to give Tong a massage.

664
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,620
Do you need my help with anything?

665
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,820
Yes, I do!

666
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,320
Ah. Ow!

667
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,760
It's here. Can you have a look at it for me?

668
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,320
My shoulders...

669
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,800
Ah, it's so tense.

670
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,820
Gus.

671
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,780
Use your full strength on my shoulders.

672
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,200
-Full strength?
-Yes.

673
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,160
Argh!

674
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,680
Ow!

675
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,540
Ouch!

676
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,440
Oh!

677
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,820
Ah!

678
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,240
Ow.

679
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,320
Does it still hurt?

680
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,540
No, I'm good.

681
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,660
It's Friday.

682
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,120
The traffic is heavy.

683
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,080
Are you in a hurry?

684
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,820
No.

685
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,800
It's Friday.

686
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,080
If we go back now, we might have to sleep on the road.

687
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,740
Exactly!

688
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,900
We're on the same page.

689
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,420
Do you want to go somewhere first?

690
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,540
I'm in no rush. I can go with you.

691
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,120
I want to go to the pharmacy.

692
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,720
Jade, have you got a fever?

693
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,080
Your heart rate...

694
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,100
-No, I'm fine.
-Your heart rate...

695
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,400
No, I'm fine.

696
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,780
Rose higher than normal.

697
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:33,900
Or...

698
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,260
Are you going to buy a pain relief cream?

699
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,200
I just want to see something.

700
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,580
Yay! She's here.

701
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,340
Jade, what are you guys up to?

702
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,800
-Hello, Na.
-Hello, there.

703
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,200
How are you? Long time no see.

704
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,620
I was so busy, so I didn't drop by.

705
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,820
And this is...

706
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,120
Ah, he's... Ouch.

707
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,320
This is Mai.

708
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,360
My intern.

709
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,920
He's very nice and talented.

710
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,460
Hello.

711
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,680
Hello.

712
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,860
Na, where is Sakoo?

713
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,140
He's in the back of the shop. Go right in.

714
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,040
Thank you, Na.

715
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,240
Let's go, Mai.

716
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,300
Sakoo!

717
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,160
Do you remember me?

718
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,160
Ah, my baby.

719
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,840
He's quite lovely.

720
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,400
So Sakoo is his name?

721
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,240
That's right.

722
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,240
When I found him last month, he was being beaten up.

723
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,420
I wanted to adopt him, but my apartment doesn't allow pets.

724
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,380
Fortunately, Na lent me a helping hand.

725
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,140
If I didn't have her, I'd be at a loss.

726
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,280
Sakoo, I'm sorry that I can't bring you back with me.

727
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,080
You did your best, Jade.

728
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,460
Sakoo was lucky meeting you back then.

729
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,080
I'm also lucky to have met you.

730
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,980
Sakoo, say hello to Mai.

731
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,840
Am I adorable, Mai?

732
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes. Very much.

733
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,160
Right? He's so cute and cuddly.

734
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,840
Oh. Sakoo.

735
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:55,900
Yes.

736
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,920
So cute...

737
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,500
and cuddly.

738
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,920
Sakoo is lovely.

739
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,680
But Jade is even lovelier.

740
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,340
Mai.

741
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,820
Are you saying that I look like a dog?

742
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,140
That's not what I meant.

743
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,860
I mean... you're lovelier.

744
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,400
I'm lovelier than a dog?

745
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,460
Haha. I'm lovelier than you, Sakoo.

746
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,380
P;Jade.

747
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,240
Shall I take a photo of you and Sakoo?

748
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,180
Eh? Yes, yes, yes!

749
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,640
Sakoo, look at the camera.

750
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:45,780
1, 2, 3.

751
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,480
Jade, change your pose.

752
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,880
Change my pose? What should I do?

753
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,300
This picture is so cute.

754
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,180
Would you mind if I use it as my phone wallpaper?

755
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,580
I like it a lot.

756
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,380
You like dog that much?

757
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,060
Yes, I do.

758
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,440
Jade.

759
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,100
Eh?

760
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,040
Why didn't you answer my call?

761
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,860
My dear karaoke, Jade is here!

762
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,740
Do you think... Mai sing this song for someone?

763
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,180
Who?

764
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,240
For Gus, of course!

765
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,260
Are you sure you're on the right track?

766
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,720
When I was in the restroom,

767
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:53,800
I heard someone knocking on a wall. Knock knock.

768
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,120
Argh!

769
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,800
I have someone I like.

770
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,900
Are you drunk? Your face is so red.

771
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,060
I like myself when I'm with Jade.

772
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:18,020
