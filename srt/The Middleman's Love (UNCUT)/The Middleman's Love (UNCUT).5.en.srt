3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,310
The person I like is...

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,690
You, P'Jade.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,850
I ...

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,380
Er.

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,470
Err.

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,620
So I ...
- You know what?

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,510
I've been impressed with you since our first encounter.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,450
Then, the good impression turned into 'Like.'

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,180
After I've met you,

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,560
I tried to get closer to you.

13
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,460
I know it might be inappropriate.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,900
But I want to tell you that ...

15
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,819
I've never liked anyone as much as you.

16
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,230
[It seems like you're exercising.]

17
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,890
P'Jade.

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,710
If you feel the same ...

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,600
can you please give me a chance?

20
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,670
Uh.

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,940
[Your heart rate rose higher than normal.]

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,770
[Do you want to call an ambulance?]

23
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,890
So ...
You don't need to answer me right now.

24
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,250
I just can't suppress ... my feelings for you any longer.

25
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,550
Why do you like me?

26
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,490
There's no reason ...

27
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,620
not to fall in love with you.

28
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,440
You know?

29
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,460
Actually,

30
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,610
I met you before the interview.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,320
Get out! I'm doing business!

32
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:42,400
Aunty! Please don't hit it.

33
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,510
Hey, if you don't want me to hit it ...

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,180
then take it away!

35
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,590
Alright, alright.

36
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,600
Can I have it?

37
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,040
Hmm, are you okay?

38
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,610
You can live with me.

39
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,810
I'm glad I could save you.

40
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,010
What's your name?

41
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,690
What name do you like?

42
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,410
No worries.

43
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,100
You're safe and sound with me.

44
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,180
Yay! Hooray!

45
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,970
I'll think of a name for you.

46
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,290
How does it sound? Good?

47
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,350
You're kind,

48
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,630
considerate,

49
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,700
and gentle.

50
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,170
I'm a boring guy, Mai.

51
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,520
In fact ...

52
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,310
maybe it's not that kind of 'Like' between us.

53
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,730
Maybe we're ...

54
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,060
just close?

55
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,450
What makes you think that?

56
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,580
I believe that ... no one will like someone like me.

57
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,220
But I really like you.

58
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,870
I didn't get it wrong.

59
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,760
The feelings that I have for you is real.

60
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,600
Give me a chance, please.

61
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,730
Eh?

62
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,160
P'Jade?

73
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,070
Morning.

74
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,750
Morning.

75
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,120
Let me help you.

76
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,550
Click.

77
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,050
Um.

78
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,890
Click.

79
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,080
Here.

80
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,909
It's sandwiches with ham and egg today.

81
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,220
Thanks, Mai.

82
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,190
Have you eaten yet?

83
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,190
I ate cereal with milk.

84
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,190
Oh.

85
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,860
Oh.

86
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,940
Well.

87
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,980
Can I turn on music?

88
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,550
Sure.

89
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,370
[I want to express my love for you]

90
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,490
[But I'm too scared]

91
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,790
[I want to let you know how much I love you]

92
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,470
Err.

93
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,110
Let's change the song.

94
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,460
[Playing with my heart, you crazy]

95
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,140
[That caught me off guard]

96
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,789
[How did you fall for me? Tell me how]

97
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,230
Why do you only have ...

98
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,200
Love songs? Right?

99
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,860
Let's turn it off, then.

100
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,780
Uh.

101
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,290
Ah, I'm so hungry.

102
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,400
Time to eat.

103
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,450
Whoa.

104
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,470
Mai! You made it in such a cute way!

105
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,470
There's even a heart shape!

106
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,200
Heart shape ... Dang! He's so lovely!

107
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,810
I tried my best.

108
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,510
Uh-Huh.

109
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,930
Well.

110
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,520
I'll definitely enjoy it a lot.

111
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,060
You're so cute.

112
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,170
I have no regrets falling for you.

113
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:33,270
[Your heart rate rose higher than normal while you're resting.]

114
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,480
Huh?

115
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,390
Ha.

116
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,620
What are you doing?

117
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,170
I like doing cardio before going to work.

118
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,180
The doctor advised me to do cardio exercises regularly.

119
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,990
Mai.

120
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,740
Why is everything in pink color?

121
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,540
Maybe it's because I fell for you.

122
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,200
Ah. I couldn't be more shy.

123
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,170
Act fool!

124
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,790
P'Jade.

125
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,950
My mom's calling. I'll talk to her for a while.

126
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:33,610
Um.

127
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,160
You can go wait inside.

128
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,750
Mhm.

129
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,580
Um.

130
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,370
Your bag.

131
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,220
Thank you.

132
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,240
Hello, mom. Why did you call me so early this time?

133
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,770
I'm in Bangkok right now.

134
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,380
Why don't you come to P'Man's house this evening?

135
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,900
This evening?

136
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,670
Yeah, I'm staying over at his house.

137
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,010
Can you come over to have dinner with me?

138
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,180
Okay, but I'll leave before it gets too late.

139
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,970
Will you not be staying over?

140
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,460
Never mind. I have to go to work in the morning.

141
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,930
P'Man's house is closer to your office, isn't it?

142
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,270
I ... just want to sleep in my condo.

143
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,500
That's fine.. It's up to you.

144
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,220
I'm hanging up, mom. I'm preparing to go to work.

145
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,100
Alright. See you in the evening.

146
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,370
P'Jade.

147
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,010
You know me the best.

148
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,200
Thanks.

149
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,170
Hmm.

150
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,650
Just smelling the sweet fragrant makes me happy.

151
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,960
It look so tasty when you drank it.

152
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,510
Hey! It's really tasty!

153
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,250
I'm Jadeniphat.

154
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,020
Which means I only eat tasty food!

155
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,910
Speaking of which, I'd like to take you to a popular hot pot restaurant.

156
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,430
A popular restaurant?

157
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,370
Where is it?

158
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,980
It's close to my apartment.

159
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,650
And it's always crowded.

160
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,370
The hot pot is good, and Som Tam is just right.

161
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,730
There's also Grilled pork neck. I'm drooling just thinking about it!

162
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,340
Wow! Why don't we eat it today?

163
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,720
Mai.

164
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,720
Do you wanna go with me?

165
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,720
Er.

166
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,270
Can we go tomorrow?

167
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,270
Today ...

168
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,700
I'm going to my brother's house.

169
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,670
Um.

170
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,670
Tomorrow is fine.

171
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,250
You're always nice to me.

172
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,960
Um.

173
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,110
Is something going on between you guys?

174
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,870
Hey, Gus!

175
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,050
Gus.

176
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,170
I'm going to eat hot pot. Wanna join me?

177
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,550
No.

178
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,240
Hey.

179
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,950
Are you two fighting again?

180
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,470
Yes.
- No.

181
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,340
Huh?

182
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,620
Do what you want. I'm not going.

183
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,700
Huh?

184
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,040
P'Jade.

185
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,360
We're not fighting.

186
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,270
If that's the case, why don't you talk to me?

187
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,830
What am I supposed to talk about?

188
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,100
Would you like me to say it here?

189
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,430
Come on! Just say it. Where else could you discuss it?

190
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,510
Hurry up. I'll be a good listener.

191
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,510
And a witness.

192
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,540
Ah?

193
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,940
Hey, Tong!

194
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,940
What? Aren't you going to talk?

195
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,710
Bruh. What's up with them?

196
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,780
So Jade, the middleman, is starting an investigation again?

197
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,250
Are you thirsty?

198
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,630
It tastes good, isn't it?

199
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,660
What do you want?

200
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,680
Do you simply want to argue?

201
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,310
I'm not.

202
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,400
Why aren't you speaking to me nicely, then?

203
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,370
No.

204
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,620
I just...

205
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm sorry.

206
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,740
I've wronged you.

207
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,650
Let's make up.

208
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,820
Hmph.

209
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
I'm not that easy.

210
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,020
You're so late. Mom and dad have been waiting for you.

211
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,910
My bad. The traffic is terrible.

212
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,290
Aren't you late because you were sending someone home?

213
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,490
How do you know?

214
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,770
Bro, I've got experience.

215
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,839
You know too well.

216
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,310
Alright. Let's eat.

217
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,020
Yes.

218
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,980
I made them by myself.

219
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,640
Try this chili paste.

220
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,330
She just cooked to keep her son's affection.
- Hey!

221
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,690
Your cooking is as good as always.

222
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,450
Yeah, they all look delicious.

223
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,010
Whoa, I'm on cloud nine.

224
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,260
Let's start.

225
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,270
Yes.

226
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,870
Mai, how is your internship going? Is it exhausting?

227
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,920
Not at all. The seniors took good care of me.

228
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,450
Hm.

229
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,150
Is his name P... P'Jade or something?

230
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,880
Mom said you're so attached to him.

231
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,150
Haha.

232
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Yes.

233
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,990
To be honest, I have a crush on someone.

234
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,690
What do you mean?

235
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,950
I like P'Jade.

236
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,670
I've been wanting to tell you for a while.

237
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,220
We're all here today, so I think this is a good time.

238
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:48,070
You've reached adulthood. I respect your decision.

239
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,710
Do you... like men?

240
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,720
Is it wrong?

241
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,620
No, that's not it.

242
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,690
Well. How do I put this?

243
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:12,700
Isn't it wonderful to like someone and fall in love with them?

244
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,870
The way I like P'Jade and starting to love him...

245
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,300
is my happiness.

246
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,570
Mai.

247
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,140
Have you made up your mind?

248
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,640
Yes, I have.

249
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,230
Also,

250
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,680
I've already told P'Jade that I like him.

251
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,020
Huh? What did he say?

252
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,170
He said he's not ready.

253
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,530
But from what I can tell, I think he feels something for me, too.

254
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,150
Good. There's still time. You can learn more about one another.

255
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:09,210
I'm asking because I thought you like...

256
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,950
He's a grown man.

257
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,650
Let him choose his own path.

258
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,910
I'm worried about you no matter what.

259
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,100
You can always ask for my help, bro.

260
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,400
I appreciate your understanding of me.

261
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,940
Shall we eat?
- Sure. I'll give you a scoop.

262
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,750
Enjoy eating.

263
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,930
This is for you, dad.
- Oh, thanks.

264
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,070
So, what's the matter?

265
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
Er.

266
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,120
I just wanna pay you a visit. It's been a long time.

267
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,630
You said that you came to see Uea earlier, though.

268
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,410
Ah, that's right.

269
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,840
I need your opinion on something.

270
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,530
Is something wrong?

271
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,270
Nah, it's not about me.

272
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,140
It's my friend.

273
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,670
Your friend?

274
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,670
Which one?

275
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,380
Eh? No, no, it's my sister!

276
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,370
You remember Jan, right?

277
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,870
Oh? Jan?

278
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,300
What's up with her?

279
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,000
So... she told me that...

280
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,650
someone confessed his love to her.

281
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,330
That guy is very good looking!

282
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,710
And considerate.

283
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,550
So I don't know what to do with myself.

284
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,670
Whose story is this again?
- Mine.

285
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,070
Your story?
- Huh?

286
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,280
Hey!

287
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,250
This is about Jan! My sister!

288
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,830
You made me confused!

289
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,320
You don't have to do anything.

290
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,460
Just being yourself is good enough.
- No, I...

291
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,930
That's not what I mean.

292
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:37,290
You don't know how to react to Mai's confession, aren't you?

293
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,790
You know that, too?

294
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,730
Mhm.

295
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,060
Well, just try to get to know each other more.

296
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,770
I understand that you're at a lost.

297
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,510
It's easy-peasy. Just go on a date!
-Huh?

298
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,970
King!

299
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,490
Go on a date!?

300
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,460
Darling, I'm just giving advice.

301
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,860
This way, he can understand his feelings.

302
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,730
You've nothing to lose.

303
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,460
[Your heart rate rose higher than normal while you're resting]

304
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,390
Um.

305
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,390
You've already got an answer.

306
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,310
I got Bubble tea for you.

307
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,450
P'Jade.

308
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,530
P'Jade.

309
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,600
Huh?

310
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,090
Oh.

311
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,540
Hm.

312
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,130
What's on your mind?

313
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,130
Nothing.

314
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,880
Why are you calling me?

315
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,020
This is a 100% sugar bubble tea...

316
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,070
as you like.

317
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,550
Thanks a lot, Mai!

318
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,620
You don't want it?

319
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,690
I do!

320
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,140
Which one do you want? Bubble tea or me?

321
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,040
Bubble tea.

322
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,770
P'Jade!

323
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,450
P'Jade.

324
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,020
P'Jade.

325
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,460
Mai.

326
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,950
Mai.

327
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,300
It's fine. I'm good.

328
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,810
Are you really alright?

329
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,830
Do you still find it hard to breathe?

330
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,680
I'm all good, Mai.

331
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,780
If you need anything,

332
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,490
please tell me right away.

333
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,990
Ha! I was on the verge of death!

334
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,300
Because of this one hell of a bubble tea!

335
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,510
Bubble tea.

336
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,640
Hmph. You can't get way with this.

337
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,100
P'Jade.

338
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,740
P'Jade.
- No, Mai! There's no need!

339
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,090
I'm just kidding. Hehehe.

340
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,400
P'Jade!
- Ow! Mai!

341
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
You shouldn't joke about this!

342
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,370
P'Jade.

343
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,690
P'King and P'Uea just texted...

344
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,250
Er... P'Jade?

345
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,010
P'Jade! Read my messages!

346
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,550
Gun! Why do you have to shout!?

347
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,200
Sorry, bro. The deadline is so tight.

348
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,440
Read my messages, please.

349
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,170
Fine.

350
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,190
HR: Don't forget to tell me your size. The winner team will get 500 baht each.

351
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,740
Gun: Now I'm looking forward to Sports day!

352
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,320
HR: Jade, can I have your size? And your intern's as well.

353
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,130
Mai's size and my size are Large.

354
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,120
Mai, your size is Large, isn't it?

355
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,430
Yes.

356
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,250
What's it for, by the way?

357
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,250
It's Sports day's shirt.

358
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,690
Hey!
- Ah!

359
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,390
How do you know his size?

360
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Umm.

361
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,960
Mai borrowed my shirt once!

362
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,390
This is very common. What's wrong with it, huh?

363
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,790
When did he borrow it?

364
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,710
You two are suspicious. Are you...

365
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:50,400
Hey, P'Mongkol!

366
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,450
You're imagining things!

367
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,390
There's nothing. Really!

368
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,750
We often go home together.

369
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,370
Are you sure?

370
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,370
Yes! There's nothing fishy.

371
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,490
Am I right, Mai?

372
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,230
Yes.

373
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,680
Uh.

374
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,090
I'm not teaming with you this time.

375
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,960
Why?

376
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,080
What's wrong being on my team?

377
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,270
Your team lost every game!

378
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,740
Argh!

379
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,820
Haven't you heard about this?

380
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,830
Nice guys finish last, devils finish first!

381
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,770
Just like the monk's preaching.

382
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,950
Eh.

383
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,060
You should go home.

384
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,060
You're letting me go?
- Um.

385
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,850
Okay.

386
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,190
See you later.
- Yeah.

387
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,970
Good bye.

388
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,250
See ya.

389
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,610
Go quickly!

390
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,890
Can we go?

391
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,590
Can we?

392
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,540
P'Jade I'm going home.

393
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,220
Bye bye.

394
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,870
See you later.

395
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,290
Mai, this year's Sports day will be amazing!

396
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,020
Members of the winner team will get 500 baht each!

397
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,210
Shall we sign up for a running competition?

398
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,170
We can strengthen our body like that!

399
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,020
Anything you wish.

400
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,380
Does it sound like I'm asking him out? What the heck am I thinking!?

401
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,830
P'Jade.

402
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,210
P'King and P'Uea texted us in the group chat...

403
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,210
Um.

404
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,290
Hello, I'm Bas.

405
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,910
Today I'm serving as a host for Mandee Sports day.

406
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,260
In the theme 'Grow up to be' of IT department.

407
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,340
I hereby declare that Sports Day has begun!

408
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,290
Whoo!

409
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,330
Great!

410
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,330
Yay!

411
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,110
I couldn't be more ready!

412
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,570
Twerk!

413
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,570
Yass!

414
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,740
P'Mongkol! Don't stop dancing!

415
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,040
Gimme more!

416
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,980
I'm tired!

417
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,500
Tired of what?

418
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,010
Come on! Give me more!

419
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,950
Wooh!

420
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,820
Ay ay!

421
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,030
Wooh!

422
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,340
Ready?
- Yes.

423
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:49,900
Go!

424
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,780
Whoa!

425
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,220
Ah! So cool!

426
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,160
You're so good!

427
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,740
Are you tired?

428
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,100
No.

429
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,600
Keep fighting!

430
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,990
Jade!
- Ow!

431
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,640
We're yellow team, not blue.

432
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,050
Come back here.

433
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,670
Argh!
- Support your team!

434
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,640
Go!

435
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,520
Hurry up!

436
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,650
Mai.

437
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,360
Mai, are you alright? Does it hurt?

438
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,040
I'm fine.

439
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,010
It just hurt when I pulled the rope.

440
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,030
Hm.

441
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:27,480
How about you apply some medicine?

442
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,790
Are you worried about me?

443
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,520
I'm so happy.

444
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:49,110
A-are you tired?

445
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,250
Not at all.

446
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,520
Are you going to root for me?

447
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,900
Or P'King?

448
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,050
Whoa.

449
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,580
Of course I'm rooting for you!

450
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,430
Eh?

451
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,690
I'm supposed to root for my team, Mai!

452
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,180
Hmph.

453
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,650
Come on now. Go back to your seat

454
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,570
And remember to apply some medicine.

455
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,910
Roger that, P'Jade.

456
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Go.

457
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,350
Uh.

458
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,710
Yay! You guys are the best!

459
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,950
I'm good. It's just a scratch.

460
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,310
I'm alright.

461
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,640
What's wrong with me?

462
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,910
Am I jealous of him?

463
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,990
Pass it to me!

464
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,750
Yeah!

465
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,740
Thanks.

466
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,980
You're always nice to me.

467
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,910
Aren't you bored coming to cheer me up every day?

468
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,150
No.

469
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,470
I enjoy watching you play.

470
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,570
I also have to wait for King who's playing Basketball over there.

471
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,420
I thought you came because you like me?

472
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,720
Er.

473
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,470
What did you just say, P'Top?

474
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,090
I've known you for like ... 6 months, right?

475
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,930
Yes.

476
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,760
I've been here to cheer you up for 6 months.

477
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,430
Hmm, I guess ...

478
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,900
it's time to tell you this ...

479
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,640
I like you, Jade.

480
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,860
Will you go out with me?

481
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,370
If you say yes,

482
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,730
drink this.

483
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,790
(Burp)

484
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,600
Ah.

485
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,490
Sorry.

486
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,040
Now we're lovers.

487
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,760
I'm ready.

488
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,560
P'Top! Keep fighting!

489
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,110
Pass it now.

490
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:58,160
P'Top! Keep fighting! That's my boyfriend!

491
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,830
Hahaha.

492
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,920
P'Top.

493
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,920
Here.

494
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,840
Are you upset because I keep you waiting?
- Jade.

495
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,790
I ...

496
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,940
I'm sorry.

497
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,210
My club has been very busy lately.

498
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,430
I'm sorry for not giving you more time.
- Let's break up.

499
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,150
During a month that we're together ...

500
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,620
You're so boring

501
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,580
and get jealous easily.

502
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,730
You even go far as to keep me from speaking with others.

503
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,480
You're too nice it annoys me.

504
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,600
You never understand me.

505
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,430
Do you have someone else?

506
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,400
There's no one else.

507
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,520
This is all about your character.

508
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,310
Stop acting like this.

509
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,520
No one will want you otherwise.

510
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,570
Ow!

511
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,970
Hey! Why did you bump into me!? I'm dancing!

512
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,440
You're the one who ran into me!

513
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,290
I'm just having fun dancing around!

514
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,480
Why a straight face? Do you wanna poop? Just go.

515
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,680
Look at you. I think it's you who needs to poo.

516
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,560
Hey, I don't wanna poop, this is dancing!

517
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,040
Is that so?

518
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,800
Yeah. Come on, dance with me.

519
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,670
Ah.

520
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:26,840
Aiya.

521
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,840
Jade! Look at that!

522
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,740
Hey! You, you ... King!

523
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,330
What!?

524
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,410
My fried egg!

525
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,420
It's mine!

526
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,160
Then where's mine!?

527
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,060
How the heck would I know?

528
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,060
Wahh.

529
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,380
Sob sob. My fried egg.

530
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,600
Hmm.

531
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,660
You took good care of him.

532
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,280
Stop playing around.

533
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,600
Darling! It hurts!

534
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,060
Mai.

535
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,600
What was it like to be apart from Jade all day?

536
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,240
Isn't it great?

537
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,380
Attention, please.

538
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,380
After finish eating,

539
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,510
use the restroom, and get back here when you're ready

540
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,820
so we can continue our activity, got it?

541
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,090
Okay.

542
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,400
What? Open it yourself.

543
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,580
Here you are.

544
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,950
Thanks.

545
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,320
Here you go, P'Jade.

546
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,910
You're still eating? Are you that hungry?

547
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:02,840
Nah.

548
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,010
P'Jade.

549
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,060
Please cheer me up.

550
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,770
Mhm.

551
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,140
Let me put it away for you.

552
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,400
No, I can do it.

553
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,910
Allow me to take care of you.

554
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,700
I can do it myself, really.

555
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,600
Mai.

556
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,280
Let's go.

557
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,110
P'Jade.

558
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,850
Good luck with the Yellow!

559
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,850
Um, thank you, Gus.

560
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,350
Come on, Mai.

561
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,940
Hurry up.

562
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:23,240
Let's get started. Are you ready? And you?

563
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:34,980
Argh! Those in the back, help!

564
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,780
Go for it!

565
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,760
Come on!

566
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,160
Hurry!

567
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,280
The rear, assist your friend!

568
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,870
Hurry up!

569
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,050
Huh? We lost?

570
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,810
Hey.

571
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,460
What's wrong, Tong?

572
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,800
Sh*t! He's bleeding!

573
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,950
Oh. Are you hurt?

574
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,740
It's fine.

575
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,050
I just thought you would be hurt.

576
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,170
Did you just curse me?

577
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,340
You must be crazy.

578
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,540
Who would do that?

579
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,460
I'm fine now.

580
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,390
And you should get back to compete.

581
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,350
Excuse me?
Yes.

582
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,260
Can you look after my sweetheart?

583
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:08,730
Yes. So, please let me take him to do wound dressing first.

584
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,630
You guys are so cute.

585
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:48,740
Keep fighting, my dear.

586
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:54,460
Whoa.

587
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,700
Go!

588
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:03,820
Five.

589
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:05,730
Is it this way?

590
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:11,970
[I’m not asking to be a candidate]

591
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,590
[Cuz I know I don’t deserve it]

592
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,990
[But you've made it so clear]

593
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,490
Left?

594
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:25,630
[What was hopeless now has become hopeful all because of me]

595
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:30,580
[Playing with my heart, you crazy?]

596
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:34,310
[That caught me off guard]

597
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:38,750
[How did you fall for me? Tell me how]

598
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,310
[I can't figure this out]
Rock, paper, scissors.
Yeah.

599
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:46,250
[You changed me with the great power of love]

600
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,420
[For a middleman]

601
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,270
[You made me a man]

602
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,910
[In the middle of your heart]

603
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,460
[Drop me off, pick me up, never complain]

604
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:05,830
[Nobody can resist that]

605
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:11,220
[Because of your relentless loveliness, I love you with all my heart]

606
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:16,490
[Never wanted to jump the gun]

607
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:20,350
[But how much longer do I have to wait?]

608
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,770
[My heart surrenders]

609
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:29,100
[I’m not asking to be a candidate]

610
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,090
Take the chair out.
[Cuz I know I don’t deserve it]

611
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:37,220
[But you've made it so clear]

612
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,100
You're out.

613
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:43,180
[What was hopeless now has become hopeful all because of me]

614
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,450
Hey! Don't come too close.

615
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,790
I'm standing far enough.

616
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:48,180
[Playing with my heart, you crazy?]

617
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,890
[That caught me off guard]

618
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:56,510
[How did you fall for me? Tell me how]

619
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:59,370
[I can’t figure this out]

620
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:03,620
[You changed me with the great power of love]

621
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:07,050
[For a middleman]
Okay.

622
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:13,730
[You made me a man In the middle of your heart]

623
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:25,110
[Playing with my heart, you crazy?]

624
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:28,590
[That caught me off guard]

625
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:33,550
[How did you fall for me? Tell me how]

626
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:36,300
[I can’t figure this out]

627
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:40,770
[You changed me with the great power of love]

628
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,610
[For a middleman]

629
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,290
[You've changed me for the better]

630
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,210
[There's no more a middleman, no]

631
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,970
[You made me a man in the middle of your heart]

632
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,350
Faster.

633
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:05,590
Yeah.

634
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,290
Yeah. Whoa.

635
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,940
Yeah.

636
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,590
Your hands, please. Let's make a handshake here.

637
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:43,020
[Have you ever felt this way? That you aren't tall, white, and attractive like others]

638
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:52,870
[Have you ever felt this way? That you aren't rich, or stylish, but rather ordinary]

639
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:57,700
[I'm just an average man, who's not special]

640
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:02,590
[But you came and change me]

641
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:08,030
[When I'm with you, my life becomes wonderful]

642
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:11,350
[And I began to fantasize]

643
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:19,990
Darling.

644
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,650
Do you think I'm good?

645
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,540
I also won, you see?

646
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,250
You're the best.

647
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:30,300
But you're better than me.

648
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,410
Faster.

649
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,630
Is this part okay? Now turn another part.

650
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,790
Hey! Jade.

651
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,220
Hey! Where are you going?

652
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,430
Is it not any better?
No, fine.

653
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,500
Now side away.

654
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,500
Jade.

655
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:30,750
Uh. What are your guys doing here?

656
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,290
Let me ask you that question instead.

657
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,290
Why did you leave us?

658
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,610
Um. I just wanted to take a breath.

659
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,050
During the games, I filled my lungs with a lot of powder

660
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,820
Are you worried about anything, Jade?

661
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,130
Err.

662
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,180
I err.
How's it going between you and Mai?

663
00:53:58,570 --> 00:53:59,980
Darling.

664
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,230
I just want to know.

665
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,730
Whether they've already dated or not.

666
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,710
Not yet.

667
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,550
What are you waiting for?

668
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:17,330
King.

669
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:19,330
Darling.

670
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,550
I don't want my friend to worry anymore.

671
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,020
Jade.

672
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,010
Don't wait for what you want to do.

673
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,930
Time never waits for anyone.

674
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,650
Err.

675
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,810
I don't understand why love is not easy.

676
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,990
You're right. It's not easy.

677
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,340
Do you think so? Uea.

678
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,380
As I told you before.

679
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,980
Take your time and think about it.

680
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:01,050
One day you will know.

681
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:05,020
Everybody, here comes the time you are waiting for.

682
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,910
The announcement for our Sports Day winner.

683
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,130
Your own feelings.

684
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:15,150
You know them well.

685
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,710
As King said earlier.

686
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,470
You certainly have an answer for your heart.

687
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,210
Yellow.

688
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:42,370
Yellow. Yellow. Yellow.

689
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,860
Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow.

690
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,860
And the winner is ...

691
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:53,460
Yellow.
Yellow.

692
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:55,460
Team ...

693
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,780
Yellow.

694
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:01,730
The winner is Blue team!
Yeah.

695
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,750
Come on here. Our winner today.

696
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,020
Jade.

697
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:09,100
Oh no. Gun.

698
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:10,130
Because of you, Jade.

699
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,250
They're good. Very good.

700
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,070
Congratulations.
Yeah.

701
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:26,270
Congratulations.
Yeah.

702
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:30,090
Me?

703
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,450
Hey!
- I'm going.

704
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,210
You're so good, my dear.

705
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,450
Bravo!

706
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,790
Can I join?
Do come.

707
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,500
Everyone.

708
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:45,660
Where is Mai?

709
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,300
I don't see him too.

710
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,070
Everyone, let's take a photo here.
Yeah, come here.

711
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,420
Whoa!

712
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,810
Yeah.
Whoa!

713
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,770
Bravo!

714
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:12,230
Whoa!

715
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:23,710
[If you have to choose one you love]

716
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:28,630
[So, can it be me?]

717
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:35,710
[Or you have another one in your heart not me now]

718
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:40,530
[Just want to ask you to love me once a time]

719
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:20,190
[How could a middleman like me be suitable for you?]

720
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:29,950
[Please don't give me false hope, then leave my side]

721
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,660
[After I seriously think about it]

722
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:38,470
[I realize this is really all I can do]

723
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:43,020
[I'll just be the middleman for you two]

724
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:47,570
[Even though truth is I love you]

725
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,000
[Love from the bottom of my heart]
