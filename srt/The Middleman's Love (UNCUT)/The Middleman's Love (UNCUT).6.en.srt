3
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,690
P'Jade.

4
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,710
There's nothing going on between us.

5
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,650
I haven't said a thing.

6
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,650
Are you having a guilty conscience?

7
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,010
I...

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,830
I just wanna let you know.

9
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,650
In case you have the wrong idea.

10
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,550
Can't you see that Mai doesn't like you?

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,570
Didn't I tell you so many times that I like you?

12
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,340
It's not Mai that I like.

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,709
I want to believe it.

14
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,480
But your action says otherwise.

15
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,940
What?

16
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,620
(Sigh)

17
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,420
Jade.

18
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,660
Jade, what's wrong?

19
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,729
Nothing.

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,780
If you have any problems, tell me.

21
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,520
I... I have no problem.

22
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,570
My mom called and asked me to go home.

23
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,570
I gotta go.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,500
What's wrong with him?

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,920
Do you know where P'Jade is?

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,420
He said his mom called him over.

27
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,420
So he left.

28
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,780
Really?
- Hang on, Mai.

29
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,730
But...

30
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,970
Don't go after him right now.

31
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,520
But we've agreed to--
- Save it for later.

32
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,990
I know my friend well.

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,100
Alright.

34
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,900
Then...

35
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,530
I'll see myself out.

36
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,630
What's on your mind?

37
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,130
I'm sure Jade just found out something.

38
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,480
What is it?

39
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,860
I think...

40
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,110
Jade's feeling for Mai is overwhelming.

41
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,140
Why don't he go out with Mai, then?

42
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,890
King.

43
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,610
This matter is challenging for Jade.

44
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,840
Should we help him?
- No.

45
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,870
We should let him make his own decision.

46
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,090
Is it time to use the most common method?

47
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,130
One sheep.

48
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,130
Two sheep.

49
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,660
Three sheep.

50
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,620
Four sheep.

51
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,100
Five sheep.

52
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,210
Waaah. Jade!

53
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,810
Stop thinking about it!

54
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,870
Don't be like this, Jade.

55
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,680
A dolphin jumps one times.

56
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,460
Splash.

57
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,190
Kiss.

58
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,730
Aaargh! Jade! Put it out of your mind!

59
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,240
Stop it. Don't think any longer.

60
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,890
Aw! Ouch!

61
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,520
It hurts like crazy! I'm losing my mind!

62
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,850
Is something wrong?

63
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,440
No, mom. I just dropped something.

Huh?

79
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,150
Ahem! Ah, ah.

80
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,080
Hello, Mai.
- P'Jade.

81
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,970
Can I talk to you?

82
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,240
Sure.

83
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,310
Um.

84
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,840
I'm at your front door.

85
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,280
What!?

86
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,740
Mai. Err... give me a minute.

87
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,220
I'll be there shortly.

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,039
Okay.

89
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,300
Am I troubling you?

90
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,630
Nah.

91
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,840
What do you wanna say?

92
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,490
P'Jade.

93
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,880
Yesterday...

94
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,410
Did I make you mad?

95
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,390
No.

96
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,110
I had to rush home.

97
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,320
So I forgot to tell you. Sorry.

98
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,150
P'Jade.

99
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,690
Is that all?

100
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,960
Yeah. Why would I lie to you, hm?

101
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,080
Isn't it because you misunderstood me and Gus...
- Mai.

102
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,650
I gave some thought about our relationship.

103
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,290
I think...

104
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,410
It's better for us to be just a mentor and an intern.

105
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,680
Hm?

106
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:19,090
[Do you know I can hardly suppress my feelings for you?]

107
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:26,450
[I've been hiding it for a long time]

108
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:33,520
[It's just a common word that everyone uses casually]

109
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,830
P'Jade. But I...
- Mai.

110
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,840
I've made up my mind.

111
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,890
Um.

112
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,030
Get right in.

113
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,470
Yes?

114
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,490
Ah.

115
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,110
Come on in, P'Jade.

116
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,610
Come on in, sir.

117
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,230
P'Jade.

118
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,280
Please close the door.
- Close the door, please.

119
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,940
P'Jade.

120
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,940
Grilled pork for you.

121
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,210
Ah!

122
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,850
Oh no!

123
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,950
[Successfully recorded]

124
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,540
Well, finally I'm in time.

125
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,140
P'Jade. Did you come here alone?

126
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,680
How about Mai?

127
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,940
He goes to the university this morning.

128
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,270
And come here this afternoon.
Well, he'll be coming here alone, right?

129
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,890
Umm.
Ah. Now I know why your hair's messy.

130
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,890
P'Jade. Look at this photo.

131
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,690
P'King's face was so ridiculous.

132
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,570
Ha ha ha. It might work for him being a comedian too.

133
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,840
And look at this one.

134
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,170
You and Mai were always close to each other.

135
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,660
Very cute.

136
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,400
Cute? Ugly, instead. Why did you save it?

137
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,090
You better delete it. You know?

138
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,940
I can delete it but still can save a new one.

139
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,090
Ouch!

140
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,170
You should go now.
- Ow! It's hurt.

141
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,200
Good afternoon, P'Mongkol.
Good afternoon.

142
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,630
Good afternoon, P'Gun.
- Good afternoon.

143
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,920
Good afternoon, P'King.

144
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,530
P'Jade.

145
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,460
Molen fried bananas for you.

146
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,870
Mai. I'm so hungry. Can I get a bag of them?

147
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,560
Oh Mai. What have you brought today?

148
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,070
Molen fried bananas. I bought them for all of you.

149
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,850
Molen fried bananas. Hmm.

150
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,520
This is one of Jade's favorite foods.
How do you know about it, Mai?

151
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,990
This one is for you only, P'Jade.

152
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,750
Can you help me with something?

153
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,260
Hey! Guys. Let's get back to work.

154
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,770
Gun.

155
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,150
Let me see it.

156
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,080
Hey! It's not the same that I have.

157
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,570
Can I get one? Thank you.

158
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,170
Hey! P'Mongkol.

159
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,940
If you were not considered my senior,

160
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,810
you would definitely be finished!

161
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,370
Gus. Tong. What's the matter?

162
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,060
Mai.

163
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,520
I'd be pleased if you can answer my question.

164
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,900
What's that?

165
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,840
You and I have no feelings for each other.

166
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,360
Never. Is it correct, Mai?

167
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,320
Umm.

168
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,620
Do you still not believe in me?

169
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,460
So, Mai. Can you be a witness for me?

170
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,960
I like you, Tong.

171
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,320
And I told you many times.

172
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,860
Please tell me what you want me to do.

173
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,600
I witnessed his confession.

174
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,210
I should let you talk to each other.

175
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,980
Why do you like me?

176
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,240
Why do I need to have reasons to love you?

177
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,200
Okay.

178
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,840
You prove your own feelings.

179
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,060
If you find out you love me too,

180
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,220
Let's talk and figure out next.

181
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,500
If you don't,

182
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,360
Fine. I understand.

183
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,960
Gus.

184
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,440
Why are you following me?

185
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,520
About us,

186
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,980
Can you give me more time to think?

187
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,560
Yes.

188
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,900
Not in a hurry.

189
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,240
[I want to express my love for you]

190
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,560
[But I'm too scared]

191
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,630
But this is for your deposit.

192
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:09,860
[I want to let you know how much I love you]

193
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,100
[I don't even dare to say I miss you]

194
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,820
[But one thing is that]

195
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,980
[I always miss you]

196
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:28,260
[At any time, I still can't say I love you]

197
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,440
This bag is for you, P'Jade.

198
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,260
Thank you, Mai.

199
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,900
Why is Mai so good at acting? He acts like nothing happens before.

200
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,680
There's only you, Jade, who still can't adjust the feelings.

201
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,060
Er. Mai.

202
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,500
How's it like for you going back to the university?

203
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,220
Good. I also hadn't met my friends for a long time.

204
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,080
Jade.

205
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,620
Er. Hello. P'Bas.

206
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,620
Hi, P'Bas.
Hi, everyone.

207
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,600
Jade, you sent me the wrong work.

208
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,300
The one you sent me is promotions of next month.

209
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,050
But the one I assigned is of next Saturday.

210
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,560
Oh really?

211
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,040
Is it the promotion about 30% discount?

212
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,820
Yes, correct. This one.

213
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm sorry for that, P'Bas.

214
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,060
I'll be making the correct version for you right now.
- Alright, there you go.

215
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,500
Jade.

216
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,520
You seem very nervous these days.

217
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,400
If you have anything, please talk to me.

218
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,660
Thank you.

219
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,080
Nothing at all. I just...

220
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,160
I just made my mistake.

221
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,780
Okay.

222
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,840
Work hard.

223
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:11,170
Hey, Jade. You need to concentrate and stop thinking about it.

224
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,370
Creak!

225
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,970
Everyone, Gun and I have to go home first.

226
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,060
See you tomorrow, bye.

227
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,580
Good bye.

228
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,140
I'm going home. Good bye, P'Jade.

229
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,490
Good bye, P'Uea, P'King.

230
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,260
Get home safely.

231
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Please think about it.

232
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,920
P'King, I have to go.

233
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,320
Good bye, P'Uea, P'Jade.
-Good bye.

234
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,610
Hey.

235
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,680
Jade.
- Huh?

236
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,660
Tell Uea I'll wait for him downstairs.

237
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,860
Uea is right here. Why don't you tell him yourself?

238
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,200
Jade, tell him to get lost. I'm gonna stay at my condo tonight.

239
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,150
Do you really want to start a fight, Uea?

240
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,460
Jade.
- Huh?

241
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,530
Do you hear something?

242
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,270
Good!

243
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,100
I'm not fighting with him.

244
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,100
He is the only one who is upset.

245
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,950
What exactly are you arguing about?

246
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,920
I just talked to Mr. Boom.

247
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
Nothing else.

248
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,140
Hi, Mr. Boom.

249
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,400
Hi, Mr. Uea.

250
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,320
How have you been? Long time no see.

251
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,380
You look more lively than before.

252
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,910
I do?
- Yeah.

253
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,250
You also look brighter.

254
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,400
Me?
- Yes.

255
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,430
Are you going somewhere?
- I'm gonna eat something downstairs.

256
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,610
Oh, it's lunch break.

257
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,730
Nice to see you again.
- Likewise.

258
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,160
(sigh)

259
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,710
I have to go now.

260
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,630
See you later.

261
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,060
See you.

262
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,930
Er.

263
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,780
Take it easy.

264
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,980
Um.

265
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,410
I'm leaving.
- OK.

266
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,330
Fighting.

267
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,060
(sigh)

268
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,010
P'Jade, you haven't finished work?

269
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,290
Let me help you.

270
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,290
Eh. No no no. It's just...

271
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,240
Er...

272
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,590
I've been talking with Uea.

273
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,740
Then...

274
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,960
Let me save the file first.

275
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,590
Eh.

276
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,740
Or... do you want to go down and wait in the car?

277
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,890
We better go together.

278
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,260
Um.

279
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,480
Eh. Or you want to go down and wait in the car?

280
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,690
Surprise!

281
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,040
Mom. How did you be here?

282
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,070
Well...

283
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,120
I miss you so that I'm here.

284
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,120
What? You're not happy that I'm here, are you?

285
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,890
I'm happy.

286
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,740
But...

287
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,440
If you're here then who will be with Dad at the resort?

288
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,370
It's Man for sure. If not, how can I ran away like this?

289
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,740
What's this? It's already 9 pm, why haven't you bathed?

290
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,120
Did you just arrive?

291
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,940
Why did you get off work late?

292
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,940
What time do you get off work?

293
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,190
I know you care about me.

294
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,190
But you should sit down first.

295
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,240
You were in a car for many hours, l'll give you a massage.

296
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,890
Oh right. My neck is pain.

297
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,020
So good.
- Come on.

298
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,590
Awww. I miss you so much.

299
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,820
Here's water.

300
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,640
Thank you.

301
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,990
Just miss me?

302
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,190
Or you came to see how I live alone?

303
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,490
Mai...

304
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,120
I didn't...
-It's ok.

305
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,040
I understand.

306
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,090
But next time must tell me first.

307
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,820
In case I come home late.

308
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,620
Well, I'm sorry.

309
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,770
But I intend to come and surprise you..

310
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,220
To be honest, I had lunch with friends around here.

311
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,220
So I dropped by here.

312
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,440
Hm?

313
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,740
Mai...

314
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,170
Are you skinnier?

315
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,020
Have you had dinner? Shall I cook for you?

316
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,020
I already had with P'Jade.

317
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,590
Hm?

318
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,820
P'Jade?

319
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,870
How is it going between you and him?

320
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,640
I thought that he might like me.

321
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,170
But I probably misunderstand.

322
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,970
Mai...

323
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,790
Are you ok?

324
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:27,740
It's impossible to get everything we yearn for.

325
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,320
I understand that well.

326
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,340
Mai, my dear...

327
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,270
When have you become so mature?

328
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,170
Mai. Are you making sandwiches for me?

329
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,170
I'm already full.
- Yes, Mom.

330
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,590
I know that you don't eat late-night meal.

331
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,370
I'm preparing for the morning.

332
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,120
Oh?

333
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,690
Then, let me help you?

334
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:21,870
Alright?

335
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,270
How many sandwiches should we make?

336
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,990
Let's make more so you can keep for a late-night snack.

337
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,570
It's fine, Mom.

338
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,020
I usually make many of them...

339
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,840
for P'Jade as well.

340
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,790
You can just sit and wait.

341
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,340
I'm finishing it in just a little while.

342
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,690
Here's your milk.

343
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,420
Be careful, it's hot.

344
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,190
Thank you.

345
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,120
Do you want anything?

346
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,640
I just want to talk to you.

347
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,640
How are you?

348
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,990
Are you tired recently?

349
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,420
Yes. Mom.

350
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,470
You can tell me anything.

351
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,340
I've just been feeling discouraged lately.

352
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,820
Exhausted about work...

353
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,970
or about P'Jade?

354
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,490
If what you are doing doesn't turn out as expected,

355
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,870
will you still fight for it?

356
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,170
If it were me,

357
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,140
I would take a risk.

358
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,420
Then you...

359
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,120
Are you ready to keep fighting for it?

360
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,170
Hm?

361
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,530
I still want to fight for it.

362
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,300
That's it.

363
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,300
It's the answer.

364
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,600
You probably really like him, don't you?

365
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,880
I also didn't realize when did I start to like him so much.

366
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,150
Do you remember you told me that...

367
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,680
love is a beautiful thing.

368
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,780
I've never stopped you from loving anyone.

369
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:48,580
There are plenty of things that you have to face.

370
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
And whenever you feel tired...

371
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,330
please come to tell me.

372
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,330
Got it?

373
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,250
(whimpering)

374
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,630
I'm here beside you. Don't be scared of anything.

375
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,929
Understand?

376
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:19,530
Yes.

377
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,030
But now...

378
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,679
I need more time to flirt with P'Jade again.

379
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,050
You can be discouraged but don't lose hope.

380
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,730
You got it?

381
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,679
I'm rooting for you.

382
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,980
Actually, I'm tired

383
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,179
but I don't want to give up now.

384
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,980
I'll keep going.

385
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,540
Go for it.

386
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,760
Oh, dear!

387
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,540
Mai: see you tomorrow, same place and time.

388
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,800
I'm crying too.

389
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,300
Love you, mom.

390
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,200
Hi, Mai.

391
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,040
Hi, P'Jade.

392
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,880
Have you had breakfast yet?

393
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,200
I've already had cereal with milk.

394
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,380
Shall we?

395
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,960
P'Jade.

396
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,520
Please have sandwich and milk.

397
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,440
Thank you.

398
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
It's okay.

399
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:44,840
By the way,

400
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,200
sitting in a car like this reminds me of yesterday.

401
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,160
Why?

402
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,560
Just... just a traffic jam.

403
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,900
I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable.

404
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,360
It's not your fault.

405
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,020
Did you sleep late last night?

406
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,360
Umm.

407
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,360
I was thinking about you.

408
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,400
Oops!

409
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,280
I was thinking about work.

410
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,740
You can take a nap if you want.

411
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,760
Nah.

412
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,980
I'm not sleepy.

413
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,740
Please drive carefully, mom and dad.

414
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,900
Take some rest if you need.

415
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,080
Yes.

416
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,020
Goodbye.

417
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,320
Mai.

418
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,820
Why didn't you tell me we've arrived?

419
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,920
It's not late yet.

420
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,680
I want you to have a good rest.

421
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,080
Why did you do this?

422
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,980
Er...

423
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,640
I'm worried about you.

424
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,580
Don't do this again.

425
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,360
I'm sorry.

426
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,280
If you don't like it, I won't do it again.

427
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,700
Never mind.

428
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,020
Let's get to work.

429
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,580
Yes.

430
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,480
[I've loved you for so long, even though you don't notice]

431
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,540
[My feelings is the same no matter what]

432
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:05,720
[I love you so. If you had love me,]

433
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:11,460
[you would have accepted my love]

434
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:20,580
[How much of love do I need to give you to make you look at me?]

435
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,040
Jade.

436
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,820
Hey, Wan!

437
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,540
What's up?

438
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,500
I bought coffee for your intern.

439
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,640
You helped me a lot.

440
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,500
Here, I'll buy a new one.

441
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,080
Yes.

442
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,140
You're so handsome and has cute smile.

443
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,060
Where are you going?

444
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,500
May I be excused?

445
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,480
Today, I've already had a coffee.

446
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,860
Thank you so much.

447
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,440
I gotta go.

448
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,240
P'Jade.

449
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,240
P'Jade.

450
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,980
Are you mad at me?

451
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,020
No.

452
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,720
You walked so fast.

453
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,360
You were talking to Wan

454
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,120
so, I walked here.

455
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,140
P'Jade.

456
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,260
Are you frustrated?

457
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,560
How could I be frustrated at you?

458
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,560
You did nothing wrong.

459
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,080
What!?

460
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,940
Why are there so many people?

461
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,080
So crowded!

462
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,760
Mai.

463
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,280
What's wrong?

464
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,180
Huh?

465
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,220
I'll be there soon.

466
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,160
What a gloomy Saturday morning!

467
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,860
What's wrong?

468
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,580
A folder.

469
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,380
A limited Conan folder is out of stock.

470
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,000
Out of stock!

471
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,600
Empty.

472
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,120
Nothing.

473
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,320
How can that be?

474
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,880
You've never missed a single one.

475
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,360
Mai was sick, so I went to check on him.

476
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,440
Mai?

477
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:49,880
Is he alright?

478
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,660
Umm.

479
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,940
You have a high fever.

480
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,260
Have you taken any pills?

481
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,880
I'll get a towel to wipe you down.

482
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:01,660
P'Jade.

483
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,460
Hmm?

484
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,440
Am I disturbing your weekend?

485
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,620
It's okay.

486
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,840
Worry about yourself first.

487
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,660
You have a fever.

488
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,380
I'll get a towel to wipe you down.

489
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,680
Are you interested in Mai more than Conan?

490
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,360
I can't believe it.

491
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,680
Well, he was sick, I needed to be there for him.

492
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,440
You must really like him then.

493
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,740
Hey, no!

494
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,740
I'm not.

495
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,000
Stop talking nonsense.

496
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,760
Me and him are only brothers.

497
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,580
Stop talking nonsense

498
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,290
and trying to be a matchmaker.

499
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,240
Really?

500
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,180
Yeah.

501
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,980
Mai.

502
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,760
Directed by Thanamin Wongskulphat

503
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,420
From now on, let's stop hanging out together

504
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,420
and keep some distance.

505
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,870
I don't wanna like someone like you anymore.

506
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,270
I think Mai hates me.

507
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,370
Why don't you try approaching him first?

508
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,310
Can you really help me?

509
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,310
What are you gonna do next?

510
