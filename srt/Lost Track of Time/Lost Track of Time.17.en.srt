2
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,120
Your Highness.

3
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,959
And the maid in the princess's court

4
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,120
called Cuicui.

5
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,319
It was she that

6
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,040
came to me that day,

7
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,640
and said princess wanted to commit suicide.

8
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,840
She asked me to visit her.

9
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm incompetent.

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,640
I couldn't find any evidence.

11
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,920
So, I didn't report it to Your Highness.

12
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,919
I guess

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
I was worried too much.

14
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,120
I'm afraid

15
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,520
it's too late to say these now.

16
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,639
Your Highness,

17
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,599
princess and I

18
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,000
don't have any amour.

19
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:41,960
Absolutely no.

20
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
I only hate,

21
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,719
hate that

22
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,520
I finally become a part of

23
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,520
Lu Anran's plan against you.

24
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,919
Your Highness,

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,560
I have to die

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,120
to make Your Highness

27
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,159
think about these words.

28
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,000
Your Highness.

29
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,319
I said,

30
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,639
I'll repay you for the rest of my life.

31
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,879
Sorry,

32
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,960
I broke my promise.

33
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,039
Wangjin,

34
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,039
after I die

35
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,520
I,

36
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,240
I'll talk to you.

37
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,599
Have a good trip.

38
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:35,920
Your Highness,

39
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,639
on the night of the incident,

40
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,720
Cuicui is gone.

41
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,240
After many inspections, I found that

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,560
the last place Cuicui showed

43
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,360
was the Lu Wharf.

44
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,480
She must have

45
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,680
left the city by now.

46
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Lu Anran,

47
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,920
you've been scheming against me

48
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,560
all the way.

49
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,120
You make me lose my right-hand man.

50
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,399
Since you want the Lu family
to escape so badly,

51
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,800
I won't let you get what you want.

52
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,240
Young master,

53
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,040
where have you been these days?

54
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,600
Let go of me!

55
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,199
Young master!

56
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,759
You must deliver

57
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,120
the letter to Hu in person.

58
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,439
Although we quit the business in Hanjing,

59
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
Hu's tea gardens are

60
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
all over the country.

61
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,959
We can't abandon this line.

62
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:18,800
Here you are.

63
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,560
Yes, Miss.

64
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,680
How can you be

65
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,360
so cold-blooded?

66
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,079
Young master!

67
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,319
Mother's body is still warm.

68
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,720
But you've already made up your mind

69
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,000
how to take advantage of her funeral

70
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,920
to pave the way for the Lu family's business.

71
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,600
Why?

72
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,519
Why did you become like this?

73
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,360
Young master, you can't

74
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,720
talk to Miss like that.

75
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,120
She has suffered enough.

76
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,079
Shut up!

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,920
What did I become?

78
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,680
This cold-blooded look.

79
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,959
You only care about

80
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,079
money now, right?

81
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,120
Are all the people

82
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,000
around you

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,040
can be used by you?

84
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,600
Xu Qingce was used by you.

85
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,480
And now mom is used by you.

86
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,279
If you say one more word,

87
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,199
even if Miss beats me to death today,

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
I will make you shut up, too.

89
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,439
Lu Anran!

90
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,319
Lu Anran!

91
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,079
Second sis.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,639
Second sis.

93
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,199
Yun.

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,480
Second sis. Second sis.

95
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:15,800
Second sis!

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Lu Anran!

97
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,360
Second sis!

98
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,160
What's wrong with you?

99
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,959
Second sis!

100
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,879
What's wrong with you?

101
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,600
Second sis!

102
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,920
Lu Anran!

103
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,040
Why did you lock Second sis up?

104
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,199
Or what?

105
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,680
Let her go crazy,

106
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,399
and run on the road.

107
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,160
Let the whole Hanjing City

108
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,879
make fun of us and Prince Qing's Mansion?

109
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,680
Lu Anran.

110
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,439
This is all because of you.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,319
This is all because of you.

112
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,560
This is all because of you.

113
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,519
Lu Anran!

114
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,519
What does Second sis mean by that?

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,720
Yun,

116
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,639
since you don't believe me anymore,

117
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,759
what's the point of asking it?

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,759
This is all because of you.

119
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,759
Miss.

120
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,639
Young Master

121
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,680
left after worshiping Madam.

122
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,639
I asked someone to follow him secretly.

123
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,079
We found out

124
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,560
he went to Xiao Ying's barracks.

125
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,879
What?

126
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,399
But General Lu

127
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,879
led the pioneers to chase the enemy
for thousands of miles.

128
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,519
And they were ambushed.

129
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,800
They fought hard for seven days,

130
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,639
exhausted and finally died.

131
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,560
Miss, are you okay?

132
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,040
You may leave now.

133
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,160
Mom,

134
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,839
Yun joined the army anyway.

135
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,399
Pa is also ill.

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,360
I'm the only one left in the Lu family.

137
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,920
I will cheer myself up.

138
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,040
Take Yun out of the barracks.

139
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,199
Send him back to Su City safely.

140
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,510
(Xiao)

141
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,399
Attack!

142
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,440
Attack!

143
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,399
Attack!

144
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,399
Attack!

145
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,559
Attack!

146
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,600
Attack!

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,639
Attack!

148
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,120
Attack!

149
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,159
Attack!

150
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,960
Young master!

151
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,840
Attack!

152
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,080
Young master!

153
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,480
Young master! Come out!

154
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,159
Why are you shouting out?

155
00:08:59,159 --> 00:08:59,759
Young master!

156
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,840
Military camp.

157
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,399
No outsiders.

158
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,559
One step closer,

159
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,279
don't blame us for being blind.

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,159
Who are you scaring?

161
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,879
I didn't scare you. Leave now.

162
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,559
Attack!

163
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,720
Attack!

164
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,639
Miss,

165
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,799
seems Young Master doesn't want to see us.

166
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,240
It's useless for us to wait any longer.

167
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,000
We can't get into the barrack either.

168
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,679
If Young Master doesn't come out

169
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,679
voluntarily,

170
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,360
we don't have a chance to persuade him.

171
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,720
No way.

172
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,639
At any costs,

173
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,639
I will take Yun

174
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,000
away from Xiao Ying's army.

175
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,559
But Xiao Ying and Prince Qing

176
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,480
are in the same boat.

177
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,759
We have no right

178
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,120
to control the deployment of new recruits.

179
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,200
Deployment of new recruits?

180
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,200
(Hanjing)
It's easy to persuade the farmers.

181
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,559
But in this area,

182
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,840
a lot of manors have been built.

183
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:43,879
Our Ministry of Works'

184
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,960
frail scholars went there

185
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,960
and were all worried.

186
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,679
It has been put off till now.

187
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,080
Most of them still refuse to move out.

188
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,600
Since they bully the weak
and fear the strong,

189
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,559
why don't you give them

190
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,960
a harder stone to touch.

191
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,480
Why are you here?

192
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,320
I need your help,

193
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,639
and solve your problem incidentally.

194
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,440
Do you have any tricks?

195
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,320
Tell me.

196
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,159
This area was

197
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,519
a rich place during the imperial court.

198
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,200
(Li City)
(Port)

199
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,320
Many high-ranking officials and dignitaries

200
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,799
will buy a private house here.

201
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,759
If you want to change the course of Han River,

202
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,159
this place must be through.

203
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,600
But for those who can live here,

204
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,639
they don't care what the imperial court

205
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
will compensate them.

206
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,679
They care more about

207
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,279
the land itself.

208
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,480
So you need manpower,

209
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,600
especially tough guys who know Kung Fu.

210
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,720
Your Highness, you might as well think about it,

211
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,399
now the country is peaceful,
and the people are at peace.

212
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,759
Who are the idlest people

213
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,480
in Hanjing?

214
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,279
Garrison in Hanjing and its roundabout.

215
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
My second brother also said a few days ago,

216
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,759
Xiao Ying recruited a group of new soldiers.

217
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,519
Newborn calves are not afraid of tigers.

218
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,440
It's best for these recruits

219
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,519
to deal with

220
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,480
these stubborn landlords.

221
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,159
What you're asking for

222
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,320
is also related to the new recruits' camp?

223
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,679
Please help me, Your Highness Prince Qi.

224
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
With this opportunity,

225
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,159
take my brother Lu Yun

226
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,240
out of new recruits' camp.

227
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,399
What are you doing?

228
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,200
Such a big salute.

229
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:16,919
I have told you,

230
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,240
as long as you need me,

231
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,480
I'll always be there.

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,600
You can ask me for help,

233
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,679
I'm already very happy.

234
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,600
Thank you, Mu Chuan.

235
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,840
Attack!

236
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,200
Attack!

237
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,360
Attack!

238
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,519
Attack!

239
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,039
Attack!

240
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,919
Attack!

241
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,440
Attack!

242
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,320
Attack!

243
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,000
Attack!

244
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,000
Attack!

245
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,360
General Xiao is indeed a good leader.

246
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,120
These recruits have only been in the camp

247
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,080
just for a month.

248
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,440
They have already taken shape.

249
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,679
Your Highness Prince Qi, I'm flattered.

250
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,559
The recruits this year have a good base.

251
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,000
By the way,

252
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
especially that

253
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
young master of the Lu Family.

254
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,879
Attack!

255
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:06,679
Attack!

256
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,639
A talented general.

257
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,080
Such a good soldier,

258
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,360
I'll certainly make him stay by my side.

259
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,559
And take good care of him.

260
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,360
But the recruits in our court

261
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,200
need to practice for two years
according to the law.

262
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,600
After passing the instructor's test,

263
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,480
they can fight and kill the enemy.

264
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,879
No matter how talented he is,

265
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,279
he needs time to check.

266
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,600
Am I right, General Xiao?

267
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,200
Your Highness is busy on weekdays.

268
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,000
Why are you free to come here today?

269
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,039
I'm here

270
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,159
to ask General Xiao for help.

271
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,919
To divert the river course,

272
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,480
we need to relocate a part of houses.

273
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,960
I don't have enough men,

274
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,039
so I want to borrow your recruits.

275
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,039
The recruits

276
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:45,080
have the responsibility of
protecting and defending our country.

277
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,799
How can I borrow to you at will?

278
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,200
His Majesty has already made it clear that

279
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,879
the water conservancy strategy
will benefit the future.

280
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,600
If I need,

281
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
all six Ministers should serve me.

282
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,000
I knew General Xiao is stingy,

283
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,639
so I asked His Majesty for an order

284
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,360
before I came here.

285
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,159
(Xiao)
Take a look yourself.

286
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:13,919
Attack!

287
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,000
Attack!

288
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,440
Zhufeng.

289
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,720
Check the list of new recruits.

290
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,200
Tomorrow,

291
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,399
everyone should

292
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,759
appear in front of my building.

293
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,320
Yes.

294
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,399
Your Highness Prince Qi,

295
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,480
take away the new recruits.

296
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,480
I'm afraid you're

297
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,559
helping my sis.

298
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,480
I thought

299
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,000
Your Highness is a reasonable man

300
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,360
who knows right from wrong.

301
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,480
I didn't expect it to be just like that.

302
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,360
Don't you know

303
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,240
what kind of person your sis is?

304
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,120
If you hadn't forced her

305
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,840
to do nothing about it,

306
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,240
how could she come to me?

307
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,879
Go back and tell her,

308
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,759
do not waste her time.

309
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,240
I want to go my own way.

310
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,799
It's none of her business.

311
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,679
Look at these blue landmarks.

312
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,360
These are the ports

313
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
your sister collected.

314
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,720
(Su City) (Port)

315
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,840
(Qing Zhou) (Hanjing)
Do you think only when

316
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,679
you be a general,

317
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,639
your life is not a waste?

318
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,480
Of course.

319
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,720
A man should take his country as his home.

320
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,840
Make great efforts to protect the territory.

321
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:06,679
But do you know?

322
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,799
What your sister has done,

323
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,120
is to expand the territory,

324
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,320
and protect the family and the people.

325
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,600
What do you mean?

326
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,000
In the 20th year of Jingyong,

327
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,440
(Yi Zhou)

328
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,279
there was a drought in Yizhou.

329
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,240
Hungry people are everywhere.

330
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,759
People in the city sold
their children for food.

331
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,639
When Lu Anran's fleet

332
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,559
passed by,

333
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,480
they were snapped up by the people of Yizhou.

334
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,840
She herself almost starved to death.

335
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,240
But your sister forgot it
and forgave them,

336
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,639
Put up half of her wealth to
change the river course,

337
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,840
sharing the water in Qingzhou
with two places.

338
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,120
It solved the problem of
water shortage

339
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,759
in Yizhou for more than 20 years.

340
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,440
Li City,

341
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:44,720
(Li City.)

342
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,679
a barbarian land.

343
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
When bandits besieged the city,

344
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
your sister sneaked in alone

345
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,679
and made a bet with the bandits.

346
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,360
With one year,

347
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,600
she would help Li City earn
ten thousand-odd tales.

348
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,159
If she made it, she'll take the port.

349
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,440
If she failed,

350
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,840
she may be killed.

351
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,440
Your sister made it too.

352
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:03,559
Why I know nothing

353
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,720
about what she did?

354
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,159
I always thought that

355
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,480
she was just doing business.

356
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,399
Yizhou is no longer afraid of drought,

357
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,799
and Li City also becomes a rich place

358
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,360
which connects the surroundings.

359
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,039
More than tens of thousand people

360
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,399
lived because of her all these years.

361
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,159
It's great to be the General-in-Chief

362
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,759
and defend our country.

363
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,519
But I think your sister

364
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,600
is no worse than the General-in-Chief.

365
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,399
Then why is she

366
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,080
so calculating now?

367
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,039
Drawing water to her mill.

368
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,080
You shouldn't say that.

369
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,360
Things are treacherous in Hanjing.

370
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,399
Everyone in it

371
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,240
is forced to

372
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,080
do something against his or her will.

373
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Lu Xinran framed your sister

374
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,639
for so many times.

375
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,679
Because of what did by Lu Xinran,

376
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,440
your Lu Family

377
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
took a hit.

378
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,559
None of us can feel

379
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,480
the bitterness in it.

380
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,200
Even if she has difficulties,

381
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
she can't force me

382
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,120
to follow the path she chooses.

383
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,799
She asked me to give up martial arts,

384
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,120
so I have to give up martial arts.

385
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,399
She never

386
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,720
asked me

387
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,440
what I want to do in my heart.

388
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,159
It's okay.

389
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,919
You have your own path,

390
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,320
just go by yourself.

391
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,600
It doesn't matter if
you don't want to inherit the Lu family.

392
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,200
Everyone has his own ambition.

393
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,639
But your mother has just passed by.

394
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,120
Your father is still ill.

395
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,200
There's a crazy sister at home.

396
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,159
You're the only male

397
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,559
of the Lu family.

398
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Can you act like a man?

399
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
Take the responsibility you should take.

400
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,279
Although you're a bit naive,

401
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,480
but you're reliable.

402
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,080
You'll be in charge of

403
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,639
relocating the private houses along the river.

404
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,800
(Order.)

405
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:15,599
Do it or not?

406
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:19,559
I will!

407
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:27,880
Your Highness.

408
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,759
Come in.

409
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,160
Your Highness.

410
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,759
In Prince Yi's

411
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,000
private residence
on the Five Miles Street,

412
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,319
we found this.

413
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,279
What is this?

414
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,519
This medicine is called Five Stone Powder.

415
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,079
It's easy for people to get addicted to it,

416
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,039
and have illusion.

417
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,440
It is very popular

418
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,640
among the noble in Hanjing recently.

419
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,400
His Highness Prince Yi

420
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,559
must earn much

421
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,440
through selling this.

422
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,559
It seems that Fourth Brother

423
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,839
uses this to control

424
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,079
most of the officials under his command.

425
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,200
Your Highness.

426
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:03,880
What's wrong?

427
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,359
Your Highness.

428
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,799
Prince Qi came to my army yesterday

429
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,240
and borrowed the new recruits for his use.

430
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,279
And he especially

431
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,720
asked for Lu Yun.

432
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,160
He came

433
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,440
with His Majesty's edict.

434
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,039
So, I really can't refuse.

435
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,119
He treats others as confidants,

436
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,039
but he doesn't know

437
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,880
others are making use of him.

438
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
My ninth brother

439
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,119
is so naive.

440
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:29,920
Otherwise,

441
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Your Highness, wait a bit longer.

442
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,640
It only takes three to four months

443
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,400
to divert the river course.

444
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,319
By then,

445
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,519
Prince Qi will return

446
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,200
all the new recruits.

447
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,519
No.

448
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,319
Lu Yun needs to be taken back to
camp as soon as possible,

449
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,519
so as not to worry for long.

450
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,480
By the way,

451
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,519
has ninth brother already

452
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,319
started to arrange

453
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,759
the relocation of houses?

454
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,519
Yes.

455
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,359
He even asked Lu Yun to lead the team.

456
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,440
And he takes full charge of

457
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,039
land and fund distribution

458
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,480
of the relocation household.

459
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
It seems that my fourth brother

460
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,720
can do me a big favor

461
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,599
this time.

462
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:08,799
Find a way.

463
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,880
Add the private residence on

464
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,759
Five Miles Street to the demolition list.

465
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,880
Yes, Your Highness.

466
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,960
It's been half a month.

467
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,880
Why hasn't there been any news of Young Master?

468
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,799
Miss.

469
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,480
Miss.

470
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,519
Young Master has left the military camp,

471
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,319
and came to Prince Qi's camp.

472
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,200
Shan Yue said that at first

473
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,519
Young Master was very unwilling.

474
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,359
But within half a day,

475
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,839
he became His Highness's sidekick.

476
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:38,759
He's helping to

477
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,039
deal with the houses now.

478
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,599
Miss.

479
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,680
should we

480
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,279
thank His Highness?

481
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,759
Miss.

482
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,480
why don't we invite His Highness

483
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,000
to have a family dinner?

484
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:53,640
Miss.

485
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
His Highness Prince Qi is here.

486
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:57,960
Lingxi,

487
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,440
seems we need to prepare a pot of good wine.

488
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,480
Okay.

489
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,319
Your Highness.

490
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,440
Let's go!

491
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,839
I just heard from Holly.

492
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,519
Yun is helping you to relocate.

493
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,599
Yun's character is not good,

494
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,599
and stubborn.

495
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,599
If there's something wrong with him,

496
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,079
you can beat him up and scold him.

497
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,920
Don't worry about me.

498
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:24,480
Lu Anran,

499
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,880
can you have a conscience?

500
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,519
You don't even say thank you.

501
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,079
You sound like I didn't

502
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,319
help you solve the problem.

503
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,400
Don't you have enough people

504
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,200
to relocate now?

505
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,279
All right. All right.

506
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,559
You're always right.

507
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,880
You're so smart.

508
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,440
Be careful. It's hot.

509
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,000
Thank you.

510
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,920
Thank you for bringing Yun back.

511
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,720
Thank you for understanding my difficulties.

512
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,880
Thank you for helping me

513
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,319
during my family's most difficult time.

514
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Thank you, Mu Chuan.

515
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,440
Don't worry.

516
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,799
After the river course is diverted,

517
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,039
I'll ask His Majesty for merits.

518
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,519
Then he'll be able to

519
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,200
stay by my side safely.

520
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,440
The water conservancy plan

521
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,640
is not a matter of a year or two.

522
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
With him by my side,

523
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,920
I'm sure he won't be in danger.

524
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,480
I have to apologize to you.

525
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,920
I know,

526
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,559
you don't like to interfere in court affairs.

527
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,000
But this time I dragged you in.

528
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,359
Anran.

529
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,960
You can count on me.

530
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,799
I really don't like

531
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,480
those scheming things

532
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,839
in the imperial court.

533
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,039
But for the person you care about,

534
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:01,880
I also care about.

535
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,319
For the person you want to protect,

536
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,680
I can protect them, too.

537
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,480
It's great that you can rely on me

538
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,640
this time.

539
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,240
Xinran, give me the tablet.

540
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,480
Give me the tablet.

541
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,480
Xinran.

542
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,519
Master, slow down.

543
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:30,519
Give me the tablet.

544
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:32,799
Give me the tablet.

545
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,440
Master.

546
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,559
Lu Anran.

547
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,160
They're all dead.

548
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Xinran, give me the tablet.

549
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
All the members of the Lu family are dead.

550
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,079
Shan Yue!

551
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,759
Go to hell!

552
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,000
You evil bastard!

553
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,920
Lu Xinran,

554
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,400
you're the murderer.

555
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,359
You're going to kill me.

556
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,720
Come on, be careful!

557
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,759
You're going to kill me.

558
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,799
You're the murderer.

559
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,039
Xinran,

560
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
be quiet!

561
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,200
She sends someone to beat me.

562
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,279
She sends someone to beat me.

563
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,039
All right, all right.

564
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,160
What's going on?

565
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,279
Why did she come out?

566
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,799
She ran out on her own.

567
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,720
When I discovered it,

568
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,640
she ran to the mourning hall,

569
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,599
breaking things.

570
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:29,720
Servants!

571
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:31,799
Master.

572
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:32,799
Lock her up.

573
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,839
No one is allowed to let her out.

574
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,160
Yes. Yes.

575
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,920
I'm going to play.

576
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,519
They're all dead. All dead.

577
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,359
Dad.

578
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,079
Leave it to me.

579
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,079
I'll send your mother back.

580
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,240
Ever since Madam passed away,

581
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,440
Master has lost his spirit.

582
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,119
Lu Xinran makes such a scene today,

583
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,039
I'm afraid it will upset Master now.

584
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,359
I'll kill her!

585
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,240
Lingxi. Forget it.

586
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:27,799
Why, Miss?

587
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,319
Lu Xinran has done many evil things

588
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,599
and won't stop even when she's crazy.

589
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,440
We're serving her well

590
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,279
for what?

591
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:38,839
Now,

592
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,200
the Lu family doesn't have
many relatives left.

593
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,560
(The Great Buddha's Hall)

594
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,680
Miss,

595
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,839
the abbot has given Madam's memorial tablet

596
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:01,319
to the Buddhist temple.

597
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,759
Madam had been vegetarian and
chanting Buddha before her death.

598
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,119
She is sure to be comforted

599
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,799
staying here.

600
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,039
Miss,

601
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,680
I heard that Moxuan Temple is very efficacious.

602
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,279
I know you didn't believe this before.

603
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,799
But the Lu family

604
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:16,960
hasn't been peaceful lately.

605
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,160
Maybe we should

606
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,480
go and put incense on it.

607
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,680
God is always there.

608
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,880
The wicked will surely get a bad reward.

609
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,480
The good will get a good one.

610
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:29,960
Miss,

611
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,880
let's just wait for the result.

612
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,279
Where is His Highness?

613
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,400
He was here just now.

614
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,000
I heard that

615
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,839
Prince Qi came here early in the morning

616
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,319
to listen to the morning class

617
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,200
with the monks.

618
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,319
When he chanted for Madam,

619
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,039
he was also very attentive.

620
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:52,920
In my opinion,

621
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,359
he really takes your family

622
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,960
as his family.

623
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,359
Miss,

624
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,960
Holly thinks

625
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,400
His Highness

626
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,680
is a very trustworthy person.

627
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,880
When something happens to you,

628
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,240
you can turn to him for help.

629
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,680
There's no need to carry
everything on your own.

630
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,799
That's right, Miss.

631
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,119
Last time I told His Highness

632
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,279
you wanted zongzi candy.

633
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,240
Then he bought

634
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,559
a basket of them.

635
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,240
Don't you think he's very attentive?

636
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,720
When did I say

637
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,119
I want to eat zongzi candy?

638
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,200
Miss,

639
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,680
why is there so many

640
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,799
red, red cloth strips

641
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,960
on the tree?

642
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
These are all made by destined people.

643
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,599
Listening to the morning bell
and the evening drum day and night,

644
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,960
those wishes are believed by them.

645
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,480
Naturally, they have spirituality.

646
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,870
(Everything goes as you wish.)

647
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,160
I remember this place.

648
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,519
There should be a tree.

649
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,720
May the one I love,

650
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,359
love the one she loves,

651
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,559
and live a happy life.

652
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,079
Your Highness,

653
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
this is the amulet
the abbot

654
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,839
to bless Young Master.

655
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,680
Keep it.

656
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,039
That's weird.

657
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,559
Why doesn't this wooden plate have a name?

658
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:31,079
As one can't love the one he loves,

659
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:33,839
how can he make a name for what he wants?

660
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,920
I think only Buddha

661
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,079
can understand

662
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,559
who this destined person loves.

663
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
I see.

664
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,960
He has to endure so much

665
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,200
bitterness and grievance

666
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,119
to wish his beloved

667
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,680
to love who she loves.

668
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,079
Your Highness Prince Qi, where have you been?

669
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,799
I heard from the abbot here,

670
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:02,000
to raise a sapling here,

671
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,960
is very spiritual.

672
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,079
They say the wishes

673
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,160
can get into Buddha's ears.

674
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,440
So, I come and try it.

675
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,400
Thank you.

676
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:32,400
May the one I love,

677
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,720
loves who she loves,

678
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,440
and live a happy life.

679
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,640
Your Highness,

680
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
which one do you love?

681
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:53,480
This destined man

682
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,839
planted this tree.

683
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,759
Now it flourishes like an umbrella.

684
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,960
The hidden love

685
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,079
roots and sprouts here.

686
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,920
It can be regarded as
he told his words to that girl.

687
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,519
It also lasts forever.

688
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,240
You'd better write down your name.

689
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,160
Don't let the person you care about

690
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,920
not find you.

691
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:31,759
Okay.

692
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,119
It still looks a little weak.

693
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:51,880
I don't know

694
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,680
whether it can withstand

695
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,839
the wind and rain here.

696
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,640
It won't take long for it

697
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,160
to thrive and form a green shade,

698
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,720
cover the sky and the sun.

699
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,279
That must be my will

700
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,839
that can help the one I care about

701
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,079
got what she wants.

702
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,400
Your Highness is so pious.

703
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,680
What wish did you make?

704
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,440
Is you hoping

705
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,319
National Granary can be built soon?

706
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,759
The building of National Granary

707
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,200
depends on the people's heart and manpower,

708
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,880
and the down-to-earth

709
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,839
long hard work.

710
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,039
We don't need to

711
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,200
trouble Buddha on it.

712
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,799
I left my wish to you.

713
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,200
I told Buddha,

714
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,440
must bless the person beside me

715
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,599
get what she wants,

716
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,039
and all her wishes come true.

717
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,200
What about you?

718
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
What did you wish for?

719
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,359
I hope Lu Family can be safe,

720
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,640
and escape from villains,

721
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:05,880
with no more dangers.

722
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,519
Are you leaving so soon?

723
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,640
Miss Lu,

724
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,200
you came here today.

725
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,960
Are you here to worship Buddha,

726
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,799
or your own desires?

727
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,720
Second Brother,

728
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,440
why are you here?

729
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,440
Second Brother came here today,

730
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,680
of course, is to ask Buddha

731
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,240
to keep Dahan and its people safe.

732
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,720
I think,

733
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,599
Miss Lu

734
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,039
can worship Buddha more often.

735
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,799
The Lu family is no longer

736
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,599
as smooth as it was two years ago.

737
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,839
Accidents happen one after another.

738
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,319
Have you ever thought about

739
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,759
why bad luck

740
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,960
always haunts the Lu family,

741
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,440
instead of others?

742
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:08,799
Miss Lu,

743
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,359
you want to

744
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,160
get rid of all evils.

745
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,640
But you're ignorant that

746
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,640
the Lu family's luck

747
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,240
has run out of.

748
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,000
What result in it?

749
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,400
Your evil brings about the unfortunate.

750
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,319
Second Brother,

751
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,960
I know

752
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,079
Lu Xinran has disgraced you.

753
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,759
But those are her

754
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,599
own behaviors.

755
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,519
The Lu family has nothing to do with it.

756
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:34,880
You shouldn't have

757
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,519
taken it out on Anran.

758
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,599
After all, she used to be

759
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,359
your right-hand man,

760
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,680
and has done a lot of things for you.

761
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,279
Ninth Brother is right.

762
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:46,680
She did do a lot of things

763
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,880
for me.

764
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,839
I should thank Miss Lu.

765
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:50,599
Right?

766
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,279
Don't worry, Your Highness.

767
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,640
The Lu family is not a rootless duckweed.

768
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:58,720
Strong winds and waves.

769
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,880
We've experienced a lot.

770
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,480
Though it's not as good as

771
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,160
the rare flowers in the courtyard.

772
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,079
But weeds have their own tenacity.

773
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,279
You can't burn it nor cutting it.

774
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:10,880
When the wind blows, it even lifts the sky.

775
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,079
Miss Lu is right.

776
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,079
All right,

777
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,359
I finished praying.

778
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,160
I'm leaving.

779
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,160
By the way,

780
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,519
let me give you another piece of advice.

781
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,640
The Buddha,

782
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:30,720
Miss Lu,

783
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,640
you can worship it again.

784
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,880
Let it keep

785
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,000
your Lu family safe and sound.

786
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,839
And bless your brother

787
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,759
to live as you wish.

788
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,680
I also want to see

789
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,759
the Buddha of Moxuan Temple

790
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,519
can be how effective?

791
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,799
Does Mu Ze know something?

792
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,559
No!

793
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,599
Miss, Prince Qing's guard is here.

794
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,000
He said he had
something important to tell you.

795
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,840
Do you want to meet him now?

796
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,000
What happened?

797
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,079
Miss Lu,

798
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,159
His Highness sent me here to
deliver a message.

799
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:51,320
He said that when Young Master Lu

800
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,800
was demolishing a private residence

801
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
in Five Miles Street,

802
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,360
he had a conflict

803
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,199
with Prince Yi's men.

804
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,960
Fortunately, General Xiao was alert

805
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,800
and arrived in time.

806
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,119
Now Young Master Lu

807
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,320
has been brought back to the army to rest.

808
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,320
His Highness feared that
Miss Lu might be worried,

809
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:04,960
so he sent me to visit late at night.

810
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,719
Hope Miss Lu

811
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,079
can understand His Highness's

812
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,280
good intentions.

813
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,639
How's Yun's injury?

814
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,639
I was just ordered to send a message.

815
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,760
For other things,

816
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,480
I don't know either.

817
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,960
Miss Lu, please have a good rest.

818
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,199
I'll take my leave.

819
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,440
Let me give you another piece of advice.

820
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,440
The Buddha, Miss Lu,

821
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,480
can worship again.

822
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,000
Let it keep

823
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,800
your Lu family safe and sound.

824
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,400
And your brother

825
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,920
do what you wish.

826
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,880
Miss, where are you going?

827
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,840
It's late.

828
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,620
(Mansion of Prince Qing)

829
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,599
His Highness is tired these days,

830
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,880
and went to bed early.

831
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,320
If there's something wrong,

832
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,800
please come early tomorrow.

833
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,900
(Mansion of Prince Qing)

834
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Miss, have some.

835
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,599
It's early in the morning.

836
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,480
You stand here.

837
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,599
Dressed like this.

838
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,159
Aren't you afraid others will talk about it?

839
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,559
Isn't this exactly

840
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,679
what Your Highness wants?

841
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,559
Your Highness,

842
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,519
when did my brother have an intersection

843
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,440
with Prince Yi?

844
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:58,800
When did he ever

845
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,679
negotiate about the imperial court?

846
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:01,360
Why did

847
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,119
he have a conflict with Prince Yi last night?

848
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:04,519
Why did General Xiao

849
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,400
come to save Yun by coincidence?

850
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
What do you think?

851
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,000
Your Highness, what you said

852
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
in Moxuan Temple is not a reminder,

853
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,559
but a warning.

854
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,920
You're smart.

855
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,719
You could

856
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,800
use ninth brother's name to
divert the river course.

857
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,760
And bring your brother out.

858
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,599
But now what?

859
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,559
You have 100 ways

860
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,760
to transfer your brother out.

861
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,519
I have

862
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,360
1000 ways

863
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,159
to send him back to the barracks.

864
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,000
Now,

865
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,320
he only got a few minor injuries.

866
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,119
If you keep trying like this,

867
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,920
I can't guarantee

868
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,800
what will happen to him.

869
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,440
Mu Ze,

870
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,280
what are you trying to do?

871
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Lu Anran,

872
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,920
do you think I'm ignorant

873
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,440
of your schemes?

874
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
As I said,

875
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,280
I hate being arranged by others the most.

876
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:05,440
I want to return everything
to the original point.

877
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:06,519
And where is the origin?

878
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,519
You know it very well.

879
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,960
Your Highness, do you think

880
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,480
His Majesty will allow you

881
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,360
to marry

882
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,280
another discredited girl from Lu Family?

883
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:19,079
I think this matter

884
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,920
doesn't need His Majesty to know.

885
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,079
Miss Lu,

886
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,719
don't you think

887
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,280
if you come to
Prince Qing's Mansion again,

888
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,039
you can still be the Princess?

889
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,119
Back to the original point,

890
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,159
you only deserve to be a concubine.

891
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:36,639
All right,

892
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:37,960
before it gets dark,

893
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,320
give me an answer.

894
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,360
Second Brother.

895
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,000
Second Brother.

896
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,000
I know what you're going to say.

897
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,280
Mu Lin's private pharmacy

898
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,599
was destroyed by Lu Yun.

899
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,000
This business can earn a lot.

900
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,760
Mu Lin,

901
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:18,960
you know him well.

902
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,280
He must be vindictive.

903
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,480
If he's not in the military camp,

904
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,599
his life will be in danger.

905
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,559
But...

906
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,239
My great second brother,

907
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:29,880
do you think

908
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,000
with Xiao Ying,

909
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,360
you can win me over?

910
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,800
I'm telling you,

911
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:34,840
you

912
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
hide Lu Yun

913
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,000
in the military camp for the rest of his life.

914
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,400
As long as he takes one step out of the camp,

915
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,360
I can

916
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,840
let him die without a completed corpse.

917
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,480
At this point,

918
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,559
Second Brother, please take care of

919
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,239
and protect Anran's brother

920
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,480
for the sake of

921
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,880
her hard work all the way.

922
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:00,360
Don't let him get hurt again.

923
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,159
Hard work?

924
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,199
You tell her,

925
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,360
I will treat her brother as the way

926
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:09,159
how she treated me before.

927
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,079
Exactly.

928
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,039
Miss,

929
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,039
we've been waiting for the whole night.

930
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,559
But Prince Qing humiliated you in return.

931
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,000
He deliberately makes Young Master
stay in the barracks.

932
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,039
He said it's protection but a threat indeed.

933
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,400
He did it

934
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
just to force you to compromise.

935
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,920
We must figure out a way quickly.

936
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,719
Get Young Master out.

937
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,360
Miss, it's time to eat.

938
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,000
Only when you're full can you think about things.

939
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,079
It's all Lu Xinran's fault.

940
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,519
Doing so many bad things

941
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
makes the Lu family

942
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,840
is now in disrepute,

943
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,960
and Madam die in vain.

944
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,800
She even made Young Master go to that

945
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,079
military camp to make meritorious deeds.

946
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,920
Since they were born to the same mother,

947
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,679
why is there such a big gap

948
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,920
between Young Master and Lu Xinran?

949
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,719
Actually, Yun and I are just

950
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,440
half-siblings.

951
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,920
It's common for a man of the right age

952
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,599
to enter a military camp.

953
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,280
Right?

954
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:25,079
I can only take a gamble.

955
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,800
Your Highness,

956
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,280
Miss Lu wants to see you.

957
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,039
Let her in.

958
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:41,599
Please.

959
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,639
It's not dark yet.

960
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,159
Miss Lu already has made up your mind.

961
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,000
I've already made up your mind.

962
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,960
But Your Highness was back
from the meeting late,

963
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,800
so we can only meet till now.

964
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,280
Then,

965
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,039
what's Miss Lu's answer?

966
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,000
I will never marry you as a concubine,

967
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,639
nor will I die.
