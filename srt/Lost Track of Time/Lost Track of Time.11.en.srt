=Lost Track of Time=
=Episode 11=

2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,480
Your Majesty.

3
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,280
Does what I said just now

4
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,719
go too far?

5
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,200
Your Majesty just criticized
your own child.

6
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,400
How can it go too far?

7
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,280
Back then, I was drunk.

8
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,080
Made Consort Liang's maid

9
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,120
pregnant with my child.

10
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,639
I don't have many children,

11
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,759
so I didn't feel anything wrong at that time.

12
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,479
I just didn't expect that

13
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,240
this child has become

14
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,879
so gloomy now.

15
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,290
(Have a look!)

16
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,200
(Umbrellas.)

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,750
(Hurry up.)

18
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,280
What do you think?

19
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,479
You looked dying when you first left.

20
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,919
But now you're excited.

21
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,400
Hanjing City does look interesting.

22
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,319
But, sis,

23
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,400
You take me

24
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,680
to study at the Imperial Academy
in Hanjing.

25
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
This is not what I want.

26
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,439
I know.

27
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,840
You want to be a general.

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,919
Fight and kill the enemies.

29
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,960
Gallop across battlefields.

30
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,039
But Yun.

31
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,319
Protect our family and defend our country.

32
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,120
The family comes first.

33
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,879
Sis.

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,039
Our home has you.

35
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,159
Our dad has already

36
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,599
handed the family business to you.

37
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,319
What if one day I'm gone?

38
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,759
Gone? Where can you go?

39
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,719
Prince Yi and his people

40
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,120
has been in charge of Spring Imperial Exam.

41
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,319
His Majesty changed the
chief examiner this year,

42
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,960
and asked Ninth Prince to participate in the questions.

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,120
I'm sure His Majesty also intends to

44
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,280
check and balance this time.

45
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,159
Your Highness,

46
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,800
this is a good time for us

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,960
to deploy in the court.

48
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,759
By the way,

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,759
how is Minister Yan going?

50
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,159
As a veteran of two dynasties, Minister Yan

51
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,639
is highly valued by His Majesty.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,199
Not supporting any princes

53
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,000
is his way to survive in the court.

54
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,599
Prince Yi has failed

55
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,719
many times in drawing him over to his side.

56
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,719
But Your Highness,

57
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,960
everyone has weaknesses.

58
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,400
Weaknesses.

59
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,400
Tell me about it.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
Minister Yan has

61
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,879
a useless son.

62
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,199
He goes to brothels all day long.

63
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,240
He failed in Spring Imperial Exam for 5 times.

64
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,079
If we can help

65
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
Minister Yan's son
score high in the exam,

66
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,920
we will shape up in the court for sure.

67
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,240
Lu Anran

68
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,959
may arrive, right?

69
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,759
Your Highness,

70
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,639
in my opinion,

71
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,639
there are too many confusions

72
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,240
on Lu Anran.

73
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
You should be careful with her.

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,839
It doesn't matter.

75
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,560
I'd like to see

76
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,120
how Lu Anran will

77
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,639
complete

78
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,040
the other half of her pledge.

79
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,759
Pass my order.

80
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,439
If Lu Anran comes to the mansion,

81
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,480
no need to inform me.

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,800
She can find me at any time.

83
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,240
Yes, Your Highness.

84
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,480
(Mansion of Prince Qing)

85
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:16,959
Stop.

86
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,839
Holly.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,439
Take Yun back

88
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,439
and have a good rest.

89
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,199
I'll be right back.

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,319
Yes.

91
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,319
Sis, where are you going?

92
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,000

you'll not be angry anymore?

123
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,839
I'm even sadder when you're sad.

124

Don't worry.

In the future,

will come happiness after sufferings.

It'll be better and better.

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,120

132
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,279

Since you want to be a loyal servant,

138
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,600
and go against me every day.

139
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,519
Piss me off.

140
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,879
Then you die with

141
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,160
Lu Anran and serve her in the hell.

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,879
In this way,

143
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,920
I've fulfilled

144
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,120
your love with her.

145
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,839
Lingxi!

146
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,079
Miss!

147
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,040
Princess. Princess.

148
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,480
Long time no see. Princess Qing.

149
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,000
You are still alive?

150
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,240
Princess. Princess.

151
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,679
Lu Xinran, you've done so many bad things.

152
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,840
I didn't kill you in your dreams.

153
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Haven't you doubted that I didn't die?

154
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,960
I should have watched you die.

155
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,679
And blocked your way back to life.

156
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,600
This marriage

157
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,080
was operated by me.

158
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,840
Your mother's look when she died

159
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,600
is really wonderful.

160
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,679
What?

161
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm going to kill you!

162
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,279
So dutiful?

163
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,720
Go to the hell and accompany her.

164
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,399
Princess! Princess!

165
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,799
Princess! Princess!

166
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,159
I'm Princess Qing.

167
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,679
If you kill me,

168
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,559
His Highness will never forgive you.

169
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,480
What His Highness needs is the Lu family.

170
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,440
You're just a good-for-nothing.

171
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,240
Even if I kill you,

172
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,480
His Highness won't care.

173
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,519
Your death

174
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,600
can't repay the Lu family

175
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,679
and Yu.

176
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,519
Princess! Princess!

177
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,399
Lu Anran!

178
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,480
Let go of me!

179
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,080
What are you doing?

180
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,600
Let go of me! I kill her.

181
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,840
Let go of me!

182
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,320
Lingxi! Pay attention to her.

183
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,879
Princess.

184
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,759
Let go of me!

185
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,399
Princess. Princess.

186
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,360
Princess...

187
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,840
Princess is out of breath.

188
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,159
Get out of the way!

189
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,639
Princess.

190
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,639
Princess.

191
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,200
Princess. Princess.

192
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,639
Wake up!

193
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,279
Princess.

194
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,399
Princess.

195
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,480
Princess. Are you all right?

196
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,600
Princess.

197
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,799
Princess.

198
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,320
Princess. Princess.

199
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,840
Lu Anran, killing her now

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,240
can only make you happy at a moment.

201
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,200
You're different from her.

202
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,039
You can't bear the
guilty of killing your family.

203
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,960
And I won't let you bear it.

204
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,240
I didn't do things properly just now.

205
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,759
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

206
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,519
Since it's a confession,

207
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,639
you have to make it look like a confession.

208
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,360
Kneel down.

209
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,559
I want you to kneel down.

210
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,080
My action was improper,

211
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,480
and offended Princess Qing.

212
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,480
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

213
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,039
I don't care about

214
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,440
Lu Xinran's life.

215
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,399
Even if she's a dog,

216
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,600
she's still a dog of Prince Qing's Mansion.

217
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,759
You should know when you beat a dog

218
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,240
you should see who the owner is.

219
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,679
Next time, I will

220
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,200
ask for Your Highness' permission first,

221
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,440
and then kill her.

222
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,759
You are

223
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,960
getting more and more interesting.

224
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,399
Stand up.

225
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,960
You just came to Hanjing,

226
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,799
and hurried to see me.

227
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,919
Why?

228
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
Are you here to kill her?

229
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,639
I want to take Lingxi back.

230
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Your Highness, please allow me to do so.

231
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,399
You're a businesswoman.

232
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,879
Danzhou's merits

233
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,240
can't be paid today.

234
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,879
If you want to take your maid back,

235
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,440
you have to show your sincerity.

236
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,660
(Minister Yan's son failed the exam five times
because he has been lingering in brothels.)

237
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,870
(Change his paper for a talent's
to help him score high.)

238
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,360
Your Highness,

239
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,320
if you're really worried,

240
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,679
go in and have a look.

241
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,879
His Highness Prince Qing

242
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,080
won't argue with you.

243
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,200
How is it?

244
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,759
Second brother didn't give you
a hard time, did he?

245
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,159
What about Lingxi?

246
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,240
I'm a little tired.

247
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,360
I've been on the road for a whole day.

248
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,440
I'll go back first.

249
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
You brat.

250
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,840
you're becoming more and more unruly.

251
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,120
You don't even knock on the door.

252
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,360
All right, all right. You've already come in.

253
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,080
Well.

254
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:35,960
I ask you.

255
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,200
Do you come

256
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,399
to see me

257
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,399
for Lu Anran?

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,799
Second Brother,

259
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,360
you know what happened

260
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
between her and Lu Xinran.

261
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,279
She was just in a rush today,

262
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,159
so she went too far.

263
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,120
If you punish her, you can
punish for something else.

264
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,720
Let Lingxi go back with her.

265
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,960
Lu Anran is a friend to you,

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,279
but to me,

267
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,399
she just wants to form an alliance with me.

268
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,679
So it needs her sincerity.

269
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,080
Second Brother hasn't

270
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,840
fully trusted her yet.

271
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,360
If I don't hold

272
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,440
her sore spot,

273
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,879
how can she be

274
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,279
fully made use of by me?

275
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,879
But in my opinion,

276
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,679
people should use sincerity as the medium,

277
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,799
so that we can build our trust.

278
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,960
There's not so much sincerity

279
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,159
in this world now.

280
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,039
Most of them are intentional designs.

281
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,879
And weigh gains and losses.

282
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,639
Your second brother is the same as them.

283
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,399
Why?

284
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,360
Are you disappointed in Second Brother?

285
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
I know that during this period of time,

286
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,320
a lot of strange things

287
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,639
happened to Lu Anran.

288
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,360
Your suspect towards her

289
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,759
must be reasonable.

290
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,399
I know

291
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
you will understand me.

292
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,279
But I also want to make my friend happy.

293
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,519
What do you want to do?

294
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,399
Second Brother,

295
00:14:58,879 --> 00:14:59,720
can you lend me Lingxi

296
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,480
for a day?

297
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,000
As borrowing flowers to offer Buddha.

298
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,480
Let me

299
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,000
give my newly arrived friend

300
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,759
a small gift.

301
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,840
Well.

302
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,519
You brat.

303
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,240
You care her so much.

304
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,000
Do you have a crush on her?

305
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,679
No.

306
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,759
Just a bosom friend.

307
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,320
Just a bosom friend?

308
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,919
Bosom friend.

309
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,440
Ok. I promise you.

310
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,039
Thanks, Second Brother.

311
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:36,960
Your Highness.

312
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,840
I know what you're worried about.

313
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
But Ninth Brother

314
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,480
seldom comes to beg me.

315
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,799
So,

316
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,000
I can't refuse.

317
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,679
But don't worry.

318
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,559
He's a man of his word.

319
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,559
He said for a day.

320
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,759
Then he will keep his word.

321
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,840
I wonder if Lu Anran

322
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,480
will be grateful to you?

323
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,759
I don't care

324
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,080
whether Lu Anran is grateful or not.

325
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,399
Doesn't she cherish that girl?

326
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,440
Let her take a look and take her back.

327
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,440
Let her lose after having her.

328
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,039
She will work even harder.

329
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,240
Your Highness is wise.

330
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,279
Saved by the wandering doctor.

331
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,879
How could it be such a coincidence?

332
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,919
His Highness must know by now

333
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,000
that you poisoned your sis

334
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,960
and get married with him.

335
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,159
What should we do?

336
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,759
Why are you panicking?

337
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,720
You idiot.

338
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,320
It's my fault.

339
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,360
How can there be so many people

340
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,679
survive after disasters in the world?

341
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,000
Mother and I both got it wrong.

342
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,200
From the very beginning,

343
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,600
it was her plan.

344
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,000
She just wanted to humiliate me.

345
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,720
Torture me.

346
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,039
I also heard that

347
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,559
she stayed in Hanjing.

348
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,039
She'll come to

349
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,839
the mansion often for sure.

350
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,720
No.

351
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,319
I have to tell His Highness.

352
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:28,960
Your Highness.

353
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,519
I have something to report to you.

354
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,920
How dare you break into the study

355
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,319
without permission?

356
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,200
I'm worried that Your Highness

357
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,599
will be deceived by Lu Anran.

358
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,359
That's why I do so.

359
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,799
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

360
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,599
You and Liu Mingyu ganged up

361
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,599
and poisoned Lu Anran.

362
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,519
For this matter,

363
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,160
I haven't investigated it yet.

364
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,119
You come here now

365
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,720
and blame Lu Anran.

366
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,119
Do you think I don't know

367
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,559
your thoughts?

368
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:00,920
Your Highness.

369
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,920
Lu Anran broke into Prince Qing's Mansion

370
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,160
in a fierce manner,

371
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,759
wanting to kill me.

372
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
How can she

373
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,680
be hurt by my mom?

374
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,200
Why did my mother die?

375
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,200
Lu Anran

376
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,839
is still alive.

377
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,119
Lu Xinran.

378
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,000
Do you think I care about

379
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,519
the truth of this matter?

380
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,400
Your Highness!

381
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,759
Let me tell you,

382
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,400
as long as the Lu family

383
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,119
can still work for me.

384
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,319
Lu Anran,

385
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,039
can work for me.

386
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,440
That's enough.

387
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,519
I don't care there is

388
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,839
an idle person like you in my mansion.

389
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
But there's one premise.

390
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,759
If you stir up enmity all the time,

391
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,960
you'll

392
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,039
live a bad life for sure.

393
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,400
Got it?

394
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,000
Your Highness!

395
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,759
Get out.

396
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:47,960
Your Highness.

397
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,200
I want you to get out!

398
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,759
Yes.

399
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,359
I'll take my leave.

400
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,359
(Do I really have to bear it?)

401
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,599
(How can I accept it?)

402
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,799
(How can mother rest in peace?)

403
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,519
I'm rude.

404
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,079
Please forgive me, Princess.

405
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,839
No need to be courteous, sir.

406
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,720
I'll take my leave.

407
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,599
Sir, please wait.

408
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,559
Your Highness Princess.

409
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,599
No need for giving such a salute.

410
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,000
I really can't take it.

411
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,640
His Highness might be

412
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,960
suspicious of me

413
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,119
because of Lu Anran.

414
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,119
I don't know

415
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,319
how to defend myself.

416
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:51,759
Princess, don't worry,

417
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,599
His Highness doesn't trust Lu Anran.

418
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,200
Just now, because she

419
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,119
confronted you,

420
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,519
His Highness punished her.

421
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,880
Really?

422
00:19:59,039 --> 00:19:59,880
Yes.

423
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,400
I really thought she was seriously ill.

424
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,680
I didn't know it was my mother

425
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,960
who killed her.

426
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,680
Now I married His Highness on her behalf.

427
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,519
Although I hold the title of Princess,

428
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
no one cares about me.

429
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,079
I was tricked

430
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,319
by fate,

431
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,839
and trapped in this cold mansion.

432
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,680
Compared to Lu Anran's

433
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,559
speciosity,

434
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,720
I believe His Highness will understand

435
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,559
your sincerity for him one day.

436
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,079
Really?

437
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,559
His Highness has been
working hard all these years,

438
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,880
so he knows the hearts of people the most.

439
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,000
As long as Princess

440
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
abides by your duty,

441
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,039
and focus on His Highness, that's enough.

442
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,359
Thank you for your comfort.

443
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,559
In this mansion,

444
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,440
only you, sir,

445
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,200
are willing to talk to me like this.

446
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,240
You're too serious, Your Highness.

447
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,599
I'll take my leave then.

448
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,079
(No wonder after
the Spring Imperial Exam that year,

449
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,359
(Minister Yan, who has always been neutral,)

450
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,599
(suddenly stood for Mu Ze.)

451
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,279
(Mu Ze's plan)
(It turns out that in the Spring Imperial Exam,)

452
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:05,839
(he changed the exam papers.)

453
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,359
(Helped Minister Yan's son)

454
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,319
(to be the top of it.)

455
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,720
Mu Ze.

456
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,200
I didn't expect you to be

457
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,480
such a despicable person so early.

458
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,240
He asked you to find a man whose paper

459
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,759
can be changed to the son of Minister Yan.

460
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,720
It is obvious that

461
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,799
he is embarrassing you?

462
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,599
It's my fault for being too anxious.

463
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,680
I let him

464
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,039
hold my sore spot too early.

465
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,640
Miss, don't worry,

466
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:26,720
Since Prince Qing

467
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,599
holds Lingxi as the hostage,

468
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,680
he won't let her

469
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,759
get hurt again.

470
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,559
Even if we can find the student,

471
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,799
we can't do that.

472
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,279
To save Lingxi,

473
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,599
we should think another way.

474
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,240
How are you going to

475
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,839
explain to Prince Qing?

476
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,640
The alliance is just an excuse for me

477
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,920
to enter

478
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,440
Prince Qing's Mansion justifiably.

479
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,640
Mu Ze would never have thought that

480
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,839
I didn't come to Hanjing for him.

481
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,720
But for

482
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:54,559
Lu Xinran.

483
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:55,799
Miss!

484
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,640
Lingxi.

485
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:57,640
Miss!

486
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,200
Lingxi.

487
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,680
I'm back!

488
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,799
Miss!

489
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,839
Why are you back?

490
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
Prince Qing let you come back?

491
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:06,000
No.

492
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,880
Prince Qi thought you might be worried,

493
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,519
so he talked to Prince Qing

494
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,400
and let me back for a day.

495
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,839
I have to go back tonight.

496
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,319
One day is good.

497
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,759
That's great. That's great.

498
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:16,839
Lingxi,

499
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,920
let me do it.

500
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,400
You're going back soon.

501
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,480
Talk to Miss for a while.

502
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,680
What?

503
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,559
Are you treating me as a guest?

504
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:25,960
Let me tell you,

505
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,079
I'm Miss' favorite maid

506
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,160
forever.

507
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,559
Don't try to take my place.

508
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,319
Okay.

509
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,279
You do it.

510
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,440
There're so many bowls.

511
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,799
You asked me to clean up myself?

512
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,200
That's how you serve Miss?

513
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,400
You don't have to clean up.

514
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,039
Don't take the cook's job.

515
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,920
But I don't know

516
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,559
when I'll come back again.

517
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,640
I have to do something for Miss.

518
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,279
Let me see.

519
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,880
Miss, Miss. I'm fine.

520
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,920
Miss, don't see it.

521
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,599
Let me have a look.

522
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,480
Miss.

523
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,359
Prince Qi is still here.

524
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,119
I have some work to do in the yard.

525
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,160
I'll go over there.

526
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:12,359
- Give me your hand.
- Miss.

527
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,640
I'm really fine.

528
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,359
I'll get the medicine.

529
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,400
Miss, don't look at it.

530
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,079
See...

531
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,720
Lu Xinran did all this?

532
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,160
I always make her angry.

533
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,920
It's all healed.

534
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:33,279
It doesn't hurt at all.

535
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:33,920
I'm sorry.

536
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,599
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

537
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,319
I'm sorry.

538
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Miss.

539
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,759
Miss. Don't say sorry to me.

540
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,039
Miss, I really...

541
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,160
See you still alive.

542
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,599
I'm very, very happy.

543
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,000
Really. Really.

544
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm really happy now.

545
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,480
If that day,

546
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,359
I really committed suicide on impulse.

547
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
I'll never see you again.

548
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,799
That day, I was holding a knife,

549
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,359
and I wanted to kill myself.

550
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,240
His Highness stopped me.

551
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,359
He said I must wait for him to come back.

552
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,880
If you were killed by others,

553
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:05,680
he will definitely

554
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,000
get justice for you.

555
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,400
Does it hurt?

556
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,480
Miss.

557
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:16,920
It really doesn't hurt.

558
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,000
All right.

559
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,000
Why didn't you tell me you were here?

560
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,559
Don't you spend more time with Lingxi?

561
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,640
Holly is applying medicine to her.

562
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,200
I haven't toasted you yet.

563
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,160
It's not a big deal.

564
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,079
My Second Brother is not

565
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:29,920
a cruel man.

566
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,240
I'll persuade him later.

567
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,680
You'll be reunited sooner or later.

568
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,240
What are you doing?

569
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:40,960
A grapevine.

570
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,680
Doesn't it look like one?

571
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,680
Listen,

572
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,319
my grape trellis

573
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,680
is different from

574
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,400
the ordinary ones.

575
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,279
I particularly

576
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,400
leaned it against the tree.

577
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,279
It can

578
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,599
extend upwards along the tree trunk.

579
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,039
The vines

580
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,519
can also climb upwards.

581
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,799
It can

582
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,440
extend upwards along the tree trunk.

583
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,359
The vines

584
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,400
can also meander up,

585
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,599
and climb up.

586
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,480
At that time, whether it's flowering

587
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,359
or fruiting,

588
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:26,799
four seasons have different scenery.

589
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,240
Isn't it interesting?

590
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,039
Where is the grape

591
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,000
you want to plant from?

592
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,680
From Su City.

593
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:34,839
Don't you like

594
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,039
the green grapes from Su City the most?

595
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,759
But later, I found out that

596
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,799
it's unique in Su City.

597
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,880
It's hard to grow here.

598
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,160
I know,

599
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,680
ever since you got pregnant,

600
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,920
you have a bad appetite.

601
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,000
And like to eat green grapes
from your hometown.

602
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,359
So I personally

603
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,559
built a grape trellis for you.

604
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,250
♪Silently hide the surprise♪

605
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,210
♪that no one knows♪

606
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,920
What's wrong with you?

607
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,359
I'm acting on my own.

608
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,839
Don't be angry.

609
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,200
This grape trellis is very unique.

610
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,039
Where did you learn it?

611
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,720
When I was traveling this year,

612
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,039
I learned it from an old farmer.

613
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,279
I thought it was funny,

614
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,279
so I kept it in mind.

615
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,400

God,

632
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,720
what did I do wrong?

633
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,200
You made

634
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,000
such a cruel joke with me.

635
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,000
Why are you still drinking?

636
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,480
Give it to me.

637
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,519
This is my home.

638
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,680
I can drink as much as I want.

639
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,079
You can drink as much as you want.

640
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:38,759
You almost killed me

641
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,680
when you drank too much last time.

642
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,359
No matter what,

643
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:40,920
you can't drink this time.

644
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,640
What kind of world is it now?

645
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,240
Can't people drink as much as they want?

646
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,319
Then what's the point of living?

647
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,160
Have some prunes.

648
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,160
Give it back to me.

649
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:47,720
No.

650
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:49,359
Give it back to me.

651
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,000
No.

652
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,799
Have some prunes.

653
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,680
Prunes are good.

654
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:53,279
You can't.

655
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,440
Give it back to me.

656
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,200
You can't drink anymore.

657

00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:56,960
You can't drink anymore.

659
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,799
Give it back to me.

660
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,920

What's wrong?

665
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,480
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

666
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:29,279
Do you mean the grape trellis?

667
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,440
Sorry.

668
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,519
I should have told you earlier.

669
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,319
I'm not talking about the grape trellis.

670
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:36,599
Then what is it?

671
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,839
I always think

672
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,680
I'm a good judge of character.

673
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,000
The funny thing is,

674
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,519
not only can't I see the bad guy clearly,

675
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,359
I can't see the good person either.

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,839

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,759
I bring the vines.

684
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,240
I bring the vines.

685

Why do you bring it here?

686
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,279
Prince Qi asked me

687
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,279
to find it from Su City.

688
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,920
Well,

689
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,400
it just arrived at the dock with the fleet,

690
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,680

00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:33,519
Come on.

692
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,799
Plant the vines.

693
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,720
Wait for me.

694
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,559
I will definitely get you back.

695
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,319
All right.

696
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,960
Let's go back.

697
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,200
Sis,

698
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,680
I think His Highness Prince Qi

699
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,480
suits you better.

700
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,119
What are you talking about?

701
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,400
Even a fool can tell that

702
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,480
although Prince Qi is a prince,

703
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,960
he has no airs at all.

704
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,119
He has a good temper,

705
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,680
and can go around with you.

706
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,559
How nice?

707
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,240
I think

708
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,640
the second sis got married on behalf of you.

709
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:08,799
It's because God wants you to

710
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,079
make a new choice.

711
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:10,759
Am I right?

712
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,920
What do kids know?

713
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,640
I don't want to get married now.

714
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:15,720
Sis.

715
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,079
If you like it just say you like it.

716
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,359
If you don't like it, then just say you don't.

717
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,480
But if you clearly like him,

718
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,640
but you always say you don't like him.

719
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,359
And act like

720
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,640
those pretentious ladies.

721
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,119
Well,

722
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:27,960
sis,

723
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,920
you must like him very much.

724
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,319
Am I right?

725
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:37,720
Well,

726
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,079
here you are.

727
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,200
Zongzi candy?

728
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,319
Your Highness Prince Qi,

729
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,799
are you trying to coax a child?

730
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,839
Though I asked my Second Brother

731
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,039
to transfer you away

732
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:51,839
from Lu Xinran.

733
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,599
But life in the mansion

734
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,599
must be hard too.

735
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,759
If you're unhappy,

736
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:56,640
take one.

737
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,799
When you finish it,

738
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:58,960
your Miss will be able to

739
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,440
bring you out.

740
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,119
It's delicious.

741
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,119
Thank you, Your Highness.

742
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,039
Why don't you go to bed?

743
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,240
Don't be late tomorrow.

744
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,000
Teacher may punish you.

745
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,680
Okay. I'll go to sleep.

746
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,119
You're shy, sis.

747
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,400
Miss.

748
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:50,880
Actually,

749
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,279
young master is right.

750
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,000
Prince Qi

751
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,799
really loves you.

752
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,680
And Holly can tell

753
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,960
you have affection for His Highness.

754
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,400
Then why didn't you follow your heart?

755
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,720
All my plans to come to Hanjing

756
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,319
are just to get the Lu family

757
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,920
out of this hellhole.

758
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,360
If I'm together with him,

759
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,760
it'll be a mess after all.

760
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,400
It seems that you already

761
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,679
have a plan for the next step.

762
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,559
According to Lingxi,

763
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,599
Lu Xinran's court

764
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,280
is no different from the Cold Palace.

765
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,400
When she's unhappy,

766
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,719
she will take it out on maid Cuicui.

767
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,840
I'm sure that girl

768
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,960
is suffering too.

769
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,480
Hasn't His Majesty

770
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,920
already rewarded His Highness
because of the Danzhou issue?

771
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,400
Why is there a reward again?

772
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,400
According to old men in the mansion,

773
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,920
His Highness's birthday is in two days.

774
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,960
I think

775
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,760
it must be a regular reward from the palace.

776
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,400
Stop!

777
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,159
Is this for His Highness' birthday?

778
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,880
Princess, yes.

779
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,920
Why nothing happens

780
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,280
in the mansion?

781
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,679
I fret His Highness

782
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,039
doesn't want to be extravagant.

783
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,440
After all, His Highness

784
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,000
is the prince who leads the army to fight.

785
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,280
Naturally, he's a bit different from

786
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,760
other royal people in the capital.

787
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,360
It's rare for you to have such an opinion.

788
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,119
Though His Highness refused to do it.

789
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,920
Other people

790
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,639
can't think it's really not a big deal.

791
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,719
Or we really don't

792
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,000
behave ourselves.

793
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,639
You're right.

794
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,280
Mr. Cai also said,

795
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,360
now,

796
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:34,920
I just need to

797
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,960
focus on His Highness.

798
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,880
Lu Xinran is already in a difficult situation,

799
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,519
and she will never miss
such an excellent opportunity

800
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,519
as Mu Ze's birthday.

801
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:49,960
But she doesn't know that

802
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,719
Mu Ze never celebrates his birthday.

803
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,320
I'm afraid Prince Qing doesn't want to

804
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,280
see her anymore.

805
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:56,920
Sis,

806
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,519
see who did I meet today?

807
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:00,800
You are?

808
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,320
Anran.

809
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,519
Good timing.

810
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,760
Let me introduce you.

811
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:12,079
This is the first of this Spring Imperial Exam,

812
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,159
Xu Qingce.

813
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,760
He's also your fellow villager in Su City.

814
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,639
This is the special rice cake from Su City.

815
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,519
I asked the kitchen to make it today especially.

816
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,280
Try it.

817
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,400
Thank you, Your Highness.

818
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,239
I am Xu Qingce.

819
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:31,960
Miss Lu.

820
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,360
Brother Yun didn't tell me before

821
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:36,239
this place is actually your residence.

822
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:37,360
It's abrupt

823
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
to stay here.

824
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,079
The inn you booked

825
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,239
starts to raise the price unreasonably.

826
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,719
All inns in the entire Hanjing

827
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,159
is full now.

828
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:48,320
I won't let you sleep on the street.

829
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,599
It doesn't matter.

830
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,039
A gentleman takes heaven as his quilt

831
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:51,920
and the earth as his mat.

832
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,039
I don't believe that

833
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,199
in the entire Hanjing,

834
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,679
I can't find

835
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,840
a shelter from winds and rain.

836
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,559
I'll take my leave.

837
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,880
Mr. Xu, please wait.

838
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,280
Though I haven't seen you before,

839
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,840
in Su City,

840
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,440
your talent is well-known.

841
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,880
Since I meet you today,

842
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,000
how can I allow you

843
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,400
to live on the street?

844
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,400
Yes,

845
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,360
my sister is right.

846
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,400
Our house is very big.

847
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,320
I'll find you a place

848
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,480
far away from my sister.

849
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,559
It's definitely not abrupt.

850
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:17,519
Is it, sister?

851
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:18,000
However,

852
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,440
Mr. Xu can't stay here for nothing.

853
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,199
Yun has been having a hard time

854
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,079
with her lessons lately.

855
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,800
You can urge him.

856
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,559
If Mr. Xu wins the first place,

857
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,199
you will also remember

858
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,400
the Lu family's kindness to you, right?

859
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,360
Sis,

860
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,920
can you not mention my studies?

861
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,159
Then.

862
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,079
I'll thank you for your kindness.

863
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,600
(Examinees of Spring Imperial Exams)

864
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,440
Is there any one you like?

865
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,599
In the entire Hanjing,

866
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,039
talents are all

867
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,519
from noble families.

868
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:05,960
If they find out that the test paper

869
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,840
has been changed,

870
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,719
they will cause troubles.

871
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,599
Even if it can be used,
for what they write,

872
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,840
poetry and argumentation
are popular in Hanjing.

873
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,440
This time, Ninth Brother

874
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,000
will participate in
the question setting and marking.

875
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,559
It's obviously not acceptable to
talk about historical scriptures.

876
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
What Ninth Brother cares about

877
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,840
is the people's livelihood and the country.

878
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,719
This kind of talent needs to be

879
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,519
selected from the poor families.

880
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,559
But most of the poor kids

881
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,159
are unknown.

882
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm afraid we need

883
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,599
more time to investigate.

884
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,000
I wonder if Lu Anran

885
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
cares about

886
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,079
the mission I give to her.

887
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:07,400
Mr. Xu!

888
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:23,880
Maybe it's because I brought Yun

889
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,800
to Hanjing.

890
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:27,320
So I met Mr. Xu in advance.

891
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,039
But the talented always make others jealous.

892
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,920
The imperial court

893
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,159
is in a turbulent time.

894
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:34,840
Do I have to watch him

895
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,039
be trapped in the party struggle again?

896
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,360
And die on the street?

897
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,519
But now how many energy I have

898
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,920
to spare?

899
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:57,960
What are you doing?

900
00:39:59,119 --> 00:39:59,599
Watch out!

901
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,199
