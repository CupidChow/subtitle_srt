2
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,400
Come here.

3
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,040
Kneel down!

4
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,480
I want you to kneel down!

5
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,799
The court is investigating
the accumulated drawbacks,

6
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,920
eliminating corruption.

7
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,039
The Ministry of Works is the source of it.

8
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,000
Receiving their gifts,

9
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,719
do you want to make His Highness be punished?

10
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,400
Now, the imperial court

11
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,879
is investigating corruption thoroughly.

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,800
With what you've done,

13
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,360
do you want to make me

14
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
be punished?

15
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
No, Your Highness.

16
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
I didn't receive it on purpose.

17
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,680
I'll ask someone to return it now.

18
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
I really didn't expect that,

19
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,800
how

20
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,080
could you become

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,240
so arrogant, domineering and vain now.

22
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,120
I tell you.

23
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,599
I don't care

24
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,520
the lives of these nonentities,

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,840
but you're wrong about one thing.

26
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,599
Lu Anran,

27
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,319
is my concubine.

28
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,000
If you kill people because of jealousy,

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,479
you don't put me in your eyes.

30
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,319
You took bribes

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,919
because you're short-sighted.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,120
Look at you now.

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,240
Whether it's your behavior,

34
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,960
or your vision,

35
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,919
are you worthy of the word "princess"?

36
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,000
Xiao Jingque,

37
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,039
kneel here

38
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,039
for a day and a night.

39
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,520
Think carefully about what I said.

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Forgive us, Your Highness.

41
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,719
Are you satisfied?

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,039
Don't let me see

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,400
you being tortured like this again.

44
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,599
Take good care of your master.

45
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,039
Yes, Your Highness.

46
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,319
(In Memory of Lingxi)

47
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,120
Lingxi.

48
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,800
I make Xiao Jingque

49
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,919
to keep vigil and atone for her crime tonight.

50
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,840
If you're not mad anymore,

51
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,719
wait for me on the Naihe Bridge.

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,080
Okay?

53
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,680
Take it away.

54
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,120
I don't want to see your tears of cayman.

55
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,000
Your Highness doesn't have to eat,

56
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,279
but my Miss has to

57
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,079
give you.

58
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,560
It's a courtesy.

59
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,439
It can't be abolished.

60
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,240
Take it away.

61
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,240
It's good to knock it over.

62
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,639
Your Highness. Did you see

63
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,639
that stone?

64
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,920
That's where Lingxi fell,

65
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,920
and died without having dinner.

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,879
If she knew it,

67
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,399
she would also thank Your Highness

68
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,199
for the meal.

69
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,399
Your Highness.

70
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,879
Nanny.

71
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,000
Nanny.

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,759
Damn unruly servant.

73
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,920
How dare she scare the princess?

74
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,160
Don't be afraid.

75
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,720
Be careful.

76
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,600
Slow down, Your Highness.

77
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,720
Your Highness, your jujube soup.

78
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,000
What a shame!

79
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,399
I've never been insulted like this

80
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
in my life.

81
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,959
Calm down, Your Highness.

82
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,759
But now,

83
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,040
if we continue to fight with Lu Anran,

84
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,279
I'm afraid you won't win His Highness's heart.

85
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,439
What do you think I should do?

86
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,240
We have to endure it.

87
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,160
What His Highness mentioned is right.

88
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,000
You are the Princess Consort,

89
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,000
so, you should have a tolerant mind.

90
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,439
Suffering from such injustice,

91
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,600
if you can still endure,

92
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,879
His Highness will be impressed.

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,160
Return all the valuable things.

94
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,720
Don't make trouble for His Highness.

95
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,079
Yes, Your Highness.

96
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,079
Miss.

97
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,879
The yard is finally peaceful and quiet.

98
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,199
I'm afraid the peace and quiet

99
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,360
are only for a while.

100
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,399
Your Highness.

101
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,000
Come in.

102
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,800
Your Highness.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,480
Ever since Ms. Lu got married,

104
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,120
you haven't slept for a few nights.

105
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,040
You should eat some, too.

106
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,439
If you keep doing this,

107
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,480
you'll be ill.

108
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,040
Leave it there.

109
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,560
I'll eat it later.

110
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,000
Nothing goes well lately.

111
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,000
Just now, I heard from the farmers outside

112
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,959
the north of the city is not peaceful recently.

113
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,720
What's wrong?

114
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,360
It is said that Prince Yi

115
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,319
is dissatisfied with the demolition of the manor.

116
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,240
So, they took over

117
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,519
the fields of many farmers.

118
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,079
People have been killed.

119
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,720
General Xiao.

120
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,919
Your Highness.

121
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,399
Good evening.

122
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,320
Brother!

123
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,399
Get brother a bowl of sweet soup.

124
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,080
Yes, Your Highness.

125
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,399
You're

126
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,039
such a grown-up.

127
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,279
But you're still like a kid,

128
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,279
in favor of these sweet dishes.

129
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,559
Brother, don't make fun of me.

130
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,480
Why are you free today?

131
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,080
I've been working for His Highness recently,

132
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,679
so I came to see you when I was free.

133
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,559
That's good.

134
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,759
I'm bored.

135
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,480
I heard that

136
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,879
you haven't had a good time

137
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,000
with the concubine recently.

138
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,039
Were His Highness partial to Lu Anran?

139
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,440
No, he weren't.

140
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,200
His Highness is very kind to me.

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,919
Brother, don't worry.

142
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,159
You,

143
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,480
you've just been titled
the Crown Princess.

144
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,600
You should hold

145
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,039
a family banquet for His Highness.

146
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,080
We need to let His Highness know

147
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,600
that we have our own bearing as hostess.

148
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,200
Your Highness, what are you doing?

149
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,240
Write down

150
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,399
all the charges of Prince Yi

151
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,639
and report it to His Majesty.

152
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
Ask Mansion of Hanjing's Mayor to handle it.

153
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,080
I heard from those farmers that

154
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,639
they already reported it to it.

155
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,840
But nobody cares about it.

156
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,120
Your Highness Prince Qi, Rongpei wants to see you.

157
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,600
Your Highness.

158
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,879
You are?

159
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,759
I, Rongpei,

160
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,039
am the general nanny

161
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,039
of Princess Qing's court.

162
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,519
The princess will hold a feast
at home tomorrow.

163
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:24,320
The princess invites Your Highness Prince Qi
to the mansion for a catch-up.

164
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,159
Thanks for sister-in-law's kindness.

165
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,519
However,

166
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,639
the dam is about to be built,

167
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,759
so I have to keep an eye on it every day.

168
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,840
I really can't leave.

169
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,200
Your Highness,

170
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,279
it's just a family feast.

171
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,200
It won't take Your Highness too much time.

172
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,200
Besides,

173
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,399
our Madam has just been
promoted to Princess Consort.

174
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,519
Sorry.

175
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,120
Well,

176
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,440
I'll take my leave now.

177
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,960
Nanny.

178
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
Is there anything else

179
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
you want me to do?

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,080
Second sister-in-law has just been
promoted to Princess Consort.

181
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,159
If I don't attend the first feast dinner,

182
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,679
it's really disrespectful.

183
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,279
Your Highness agreed?

184
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,519
I'll be there on time.

185
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,519
Thank you, Your Highness.

186
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,759
I'll take my leave then.

187
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,879
Have you informed her?

188
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,519
Yes, I did.

189
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,919
The concubine can't attend

190
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
the family feast like this by rules.

191
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,919
Your Highness invites her.

192
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,919
It fully shows

193
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,159
your manner of being the mistress.

194
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,600
If it weren't for His Highness,

195
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,440
I wouldn't bother

196
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,519
to make such superficial efforts.

197
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,279
Just bear with it tonight.

198
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,720
It's all for His Highness.

199
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,200
Got it.

200
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,200
Your Highness.

201
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,639
Why are you here?

202
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,720
As soon as I came back, I heard that

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,480
you had been busy with
the family feast all afternoon.

204
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,559
So I come to have a look.

205
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,840
I know that

206
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,360
I've been making
Your Highness unhappy recently.

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,039
But Your Highness,

208
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,039
I'm just a little girl.

209
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,759
I'm very shallow-minded.

210
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,840
A woman suddenly appears in the mansion,

211
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,039
and robs my husband.

212
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,639
I lost my sense of propriety
for a short while,

213
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,919
so I mistreated Sister Lu.

214
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,720
I know I was wrong.

215
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,759
Do you really know you were wrong?

216
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,600
This family feast

217
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,360
is to make amends to Your Highness.

218
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,159
I specially sent someone

219
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,240
to invite Sister Lu.

220
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
What about ninth brother?
Did you send someone to invite him?

221
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,039
Of course.

222
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,279
Your Highness loves Ninth Brother the most.

223
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,679
I won't forget to invite him.

224
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,679
Ninth Brother...

225
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,320
Does he agree to come?

226
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,559
Yes.

227
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,840
I asked Nanny to invite him in person.

228
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,440
His Highness Prince Qi agreed on the spot.

229
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,279
Good.

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,279
You did a good job.

231
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,519
She suddenly holds the feast.

232
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,159
I wonder

233
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,159
what Xiao Jingque is

234
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,320
trying to do.

235
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,840
Miss,

236
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,120
we should be careful tonight.

237
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,480
Don't fall into her trap.

238
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,279
The way you look now

239
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,679
really likes a frightened bird.

240
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,679
There are all kinds of

241
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,120
demons and monsters in the mansion.

242
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,720
We should tread on thin ice.

243
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,559
Don't worry.

244
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,639
Mu Ze just punished

245
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,879
Xiao Jingque these two days.

246
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,480
She doesn't dare to do anything today.

247
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,240
If she does the same thing again,

248
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,759
she is killing herself.

249
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,320
That's true.

250
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,039
Miss, I'm going to light a lantern.

251
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,000
Wait for me.

it's better for you to go with me.

Let me guide the way for you.

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,799
No need.

264
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,960
Your Highness Prince Qi,

265
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,840
we knew each other very well.

266
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,720
But now I'm your sister-in-law.

267
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,480
There are many people in the mansion.

268
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,399
If we come in and out together,
it will lead to gossip inevitably.

269
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,279
You should go first.

Your Highness Prince Qi,

278
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,480
you don't spend much time

279
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,360
in the mansion these days.

280
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,320
People who're ignorant of it

281
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
would think you had a fight

282
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,399
with His Highness.

283
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,240
Sister-in-law, you're kidding.

284
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,759
This is the osmanthus cakes

285
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,600
made by the old farmer recently.

286
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,360
I specially bring some.

287
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,679
At this time of every year,

288
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,240
I always look forward to

289
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:05,559
having a bite of

290
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,759
the osmanthus cakes you gave me.

291
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,879
I could have brought more.

292
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:13,080
However,

293
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,639
Prince Yi has occupied farmland recently.

294
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,480
It disturbs the farmers

295
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
who are not in the mood to do this.

296
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,639
I heard about it too.

297
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
If he goes on like this,

298
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,200
he will arouse public anger sooner or later.

299
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,440
I'm going to report this to His Majesty.

300
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,240
After all,

301
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,480
if it weren't for me
building water conservancy,

302
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,879
it wouldn't have happened.

303
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,519
Report it to His Majesty?

304
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,559
In my opinion,

305
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,080
it's not the time to report it yet.

306
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,240
Why?

307
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Sister Lu is here.

308
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,960
Sister Lu, take a seat.

309
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,680
Your Highness, I'm just a concubine.

310
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,240
We're a family. You don't
have to care about that.

311
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,880
Sister, just sit here.

312
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,880
Since everyone is here,

313
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,240
Your Highness, let's start.

314
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,680
Okay.

315
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,720
Let's start.

316
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:33,960
Sister,

317
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,119
this glass of wine

318
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,160
is to apologize to you.

319
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,920
From now on, we can

320
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,799
get along well.

321
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,119
And we can assist His Highness together.

322
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,200
You're too serious, Your Highness.

323
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,480
It is I that am thoughtless.

324
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,240
So, I need more advice

325
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,440
from Your Highness in the future.

326
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,920
Your Highness,

327
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,200
a toast to you.

328
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,799
Stop messing around.

329
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,480
Your Highness, you're too partial.

330
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,279
During the wedding night,

331
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,119
you drank cross-cupped wine

332
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,200
with sister.

333
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,400
Now that you've broken your precepts,

334
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,160
why not have another drink?

335
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,559
As for some drinks,

336
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,440
it can only drink once.

337
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,759
Your Highness and sister

338
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,839
are so affectionate.

339
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's enviable.

340
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,039
But I've always been curious,

341
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,920
how did Your Highness and sister

342
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,000
get together?

343
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,519
I want to know it as well

344
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,880
as second sister-in-law said so.

345
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,119
His Highness Prince Qi doesn't even know it.

346
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,400
Your Highness, just tell us.

347
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,680
Your Highness is concerned about
family and state affairs.

348
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,880
He can't talk about

349
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,359
those love affairs.

350
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,240
Why not let me tell you?

351
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,680
That's great. Go ahead, sister.

352
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,720
When His Highness and I were in Su City,

353
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,680
we fell in love at first sight.

354
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
If that's the case,

355
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,880
why the one who married back then,

356
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,640
is not sister?

357
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,799
Because His Highness and I
were quarreling.

358
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,880
Were quarreling?

359
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,400
I thought His Highness's marrying me

360
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,680
was for the Lu family.

361
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,160
I, Lu Anran, have been proud all my life.

362
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,839
I must find

363
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,480
a man who loves me with all his heart.

364
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,640
If I can't get his true heart,

365
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,319
I don't want to compromise.

366
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,000
So,

367
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,200
I asked my sister to marry him.

368
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,799
In that case,

369
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,720
His Highness also got the Lu Family.

370
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,000
His Highness was very angry
after he married my sister.

371
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,319
Then I realized

372
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,559
I misunderstood His Highness.

373
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
Not only does he want the Lu family,

374
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,640
he also wants me.

375
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,200
No wonder Lu Xinran

376
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,400
can't get His Highness's heart.

377
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,240
So she was possessed by ghost,

378
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,240
and did such things.

379
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,160
Now that my sister has done wrong thing.

380
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
The Lu Family has become like this.

381
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,519
I wanted to go back to Su City

382
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,039
for the rest of my life.

383
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,480
But I didn't expect that

384
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:06,799
my mother died miserably.

385
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,920
Anran,

386
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,279
stop it.

387
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,559
Sit down.

388
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,039
Your Highness,

389
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,759
just let sister go on.

390
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,200
His Highness Prince Qi also wants to know,

391
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,839
right?

392
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes.

393
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,039
The Lu family has fallen,

394
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,359
and my father has been in prison.

395
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,680
His Majesty took the opportunity to take

396
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,599
the Lu family's shipping.

397
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,440
I'm hopeless,

398
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,599
and have no idea.

399
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,079
It was His Highness who
pitied me because I'm helpless.

400
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,079
That's why

401
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,559
I have a peaceful life now.

402
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,839
All of this

403
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,359
is given by His Highness.

404
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,039
It's really touching.

405
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,440
Your Highness,

406
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,839
if there's anything wrong,

407
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,759
don't make fun of me.

408
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,240
For what Ms. Lu mentioned,

409
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,839
I was there every time.

410
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,799
I just didn't know that

411
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,880
girls would hide their thoughts

412
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,599
so deep.

413
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,880
I was acting like a fool,

414
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,319
knowing nothing.

415
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,799
Second Brother,

416
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,519
you fooled me so hard.

417
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:52,839
Actually,

418
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,279
if Your Highness Prince Qi doesn't mind,

419
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,759
I can

420
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:56,880
arrange a marriage for you.

421
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,799
So that your Second Brother

422
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,839
can envy you.

423
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,160
Thank you for your concern.

424
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,799
But as my business hasn't been done yet,

425
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,440
how dare I marry a wife?

426
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,799
Get married and then start one's career.

427
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,920
It has always been the case
since ancient times.

428
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:14,960
Did you talk

429
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,279
too much today?

430
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,480
Your Highness,

431
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,079
you've always

432
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,359
felt sorry for His Highness Prince Qi.

433
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,119
Do you want to see him

434
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,480
living alone all the time?

435
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,599
Thank you for your kindness, sister-in-law.

436
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,000
I already have

437
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,759
someone I like.

438
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,359
I'm sorry, Your Ladyship.

439
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,759
It's because my clumsiness.

440
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,599
Please punish me.

441
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,880
Servants are clumsy.

442
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,799
Make Your Highness Prince Qi laugh.

443
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,799
I wonder

444
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,440
which great lady do you have a crush on?

445
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,039
No need to bother you.

446
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,640
This girl and I

447
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,519
are not destined for each other.

448
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,440
We won't be together for the rest of our lives.

449
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:02,960
Why is that?

450
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,039
She and I...

451
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,720
All my feelings for her

452
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,160
maybe are just my wishful thinking.

453
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,160
But we will wake up
from pipe dreams eventually.

454
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,039
I have to wake up

455
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:22,799
one day.

456
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,279
Ninth Brother doesn't want to say it,

457
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,559
but you have to get to the bottom of it,

458
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,599
don't you?

459
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,319
Second Brother,

460
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,519
second sister-in-law is kind.

461
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:37,720
When I finish my work lately,

462
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,400
I might have to ask second sister-in-law

463
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
to help me find a beautiful woman,

464
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,640
and enjoy the life.

465
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,200
Your Highness,

466
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,880
the moon is so beautiful tonight.

467
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,039
Second Brother,

468
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,160
if

469
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,880
there's nothing else today,

470
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,000
I'll go back first.

471
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,319
You can come today.

472
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,440
Second brother is very happy.

473
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,880
We can't find out where the bracelet is from.

474
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,240
Lu Anran must be behind it.

475
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,599
What are you doing?

476
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,920
Second sister-in-law, what are you doing?

477
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,160
Are you out of your mind?

478
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,880
With all of you here today,

479
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,319
I'd like to ask

480
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,279
what the hell is she doing
behind our back?

481
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,599
Your Highness said

482
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,200
I took bribes.

483
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:45,960
But we can't

484
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,759
find out where the bracelet is from.

485
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,240
It must be she that slandered me

486
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,480
on purpose behind me.

487
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,720
Do you have any evidence, Your Highness?

488
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,519
What evidence do I need?

489
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,920
That bracelet is so rare

490
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,920
that ordinary people can't get it.

491
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,799
But you, Lu Anran, are different.

492
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,200
Is there anything that

493
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,559
you, Lu Anran, can't buy?

494
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,240
Second sister-in-law,

495
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,279
is there any misunderstanding?

496
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,079
Your Highness Prince Qi,
maybe you don't know.

497
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,039
This woman is scheming.

498
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:12,319
Besides her,

499
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,960
who else wants to slander me behind my back?

500
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,319
Is that all?

501
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,079
If this bracelet was really

502
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,400
put in by me,

503
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,799
how could I make sure

504
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,200
you would wear this bracelet,

505
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,279
coming to my yard to make trouble?

506
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:26,519
You!

507
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,079
Your Highness, decide for me.

508
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,480
That bracelet

509
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,039
really wasn't given by others.

510
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,640
Even if you didn't take the bracelet,

511
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,240
didn't you take

512
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,000
anything else?

513
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,400
Your Highness,

514
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,359
in order not to argue with you,

515
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,640
I have locked myself up in the mansion

516
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,279
and don't want to go out.

517
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,599
What else do you want?

518
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Lu Anran,

519
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,359
don't pretend

520
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,400
to be lofty.

521
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,279
If you keep acting like this,

522
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,720
I'll be willing to argue with you

523
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,680
even if it disturbs

524
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,160
the peace of the mansion.

525
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,160
It's really funny.

526
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,400
My brother is helping

527
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,079
His Highness with something important.

528
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,359
The Lu Family is nothing but

529
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,880
a street rat in Hanjing City.

530
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,680
Shut up!

531
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,319
Rongpei,

532
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,799
take princess back.

533
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,279
Think about her mistakes.

534
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,119
Yes, Your Highness.

535
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:28,960
Your Highness.

536
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,960
Your Highness.

537
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,799
Let's go, Your Highness.

538
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:32,359
Your Highness.

539
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,039
I didn't do anything wrong.

540
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Why should you punish me?

541
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,759
Second Brother,

542
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,279
let's meet

543
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,480
in the study from now on.

544
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,000
I really can't get involved

545
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,079
in the affairs of your mansion.

546
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:55,839
Let you

547
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,720
incur ridicule.

548
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,480
(Lu Anran,)

549
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,279
(are you really willing to be trapped)

550
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,720
(in this square inch of land?)

551
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,400
(Are you going to live)

552
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,119
(in endless jealousies?)

553
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,319
Let me do it.

554
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,119
You may leave.

555
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,279
How dare I bother Your Highness

556
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,319
to do this kind of thing?

557
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,720
Let Holly do it.

558
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,759
Today,

559
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,279
you look like Lu Anran before.

560
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,519
I just don't dare to forget

561
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,480
Your Highness's teachings.

562
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,519
If I continue to be in such a mess,

563
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,519
Your Highness will hate me.

564
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,119
Then my life in this mansion

565
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,279
will be even more difficult.

566
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,319
Did you

567
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,599
give the bracelet?

568
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
You don't have to look at me like that.

569
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,559
I won't

570
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,279
blame you

571
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,000
for such a thing.

572
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:46,839
I just think that

573
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,880
you fight for my favor with her,

574
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,720
using housewives'

575
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,519
tricks.

576
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,880
I'm happy.

577
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,599
Do as the Romans do.

578
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,680
Though I don't want to cause trouble,

579
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm not easy to bully.

580
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:04,519
Your Highness. I'm a bit tired.

581
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
I want to rest.

582
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,319
Your Highness, please allow me.

583
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,079
I'll spend the night here today.

584
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,559
You don't have to be so nervous.

585
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,279
Before you say yes,

586
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,519
I won't do anything.

587
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,359
Your Highness is a gentleman,

588
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,559
I have nothing to worry about.

589
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,559
What you said at the dinner feast,

590
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
every word of it made me cry.

591
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,799
Every word

592
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,200
was engraved in my heart.

593
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:46,920
I admit,

594
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,839
I pushed you too hard.

595
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,039
But Lu Anran,

596
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,160
you also made me lose a lot.

597
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,759
If you want to cast accounts,

598
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,079
you and I should be even.

599
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,319
I know,

600
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,359
you're like this now.

601
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,799
Because you haven't

602
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:13,640
regarded me as your husband yet.

603
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,119
You haven't taken Prince Qing's Mansion

604
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,559
as your home.

605
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,000
But it doesn't matter.

606
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
There's still a long way to go.

607
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,160
I can wait slowly.

608
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,519
And I believe

609
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,960
I can wait for the day.

610
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:53,839
Your Highness,

611
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,759
another farmer died in the north of the city.

612
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,079
But there was no injury on him.

613
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,079
When I looked at the bodies during the day,

614
00:32:59,119 --> 00:32:59,920
their bodies were covered

615
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,799
with signs of being beaten.

616
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:02,640
It should be the guardians

617
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,720
of Prince Yi's manor.

618
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,519
But there was one person

619
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,319
whose neck was wringed.

620
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,200
So fiercely and directly.

621
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,640
Without any hesitations.

622
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,759
It looks like someone from the army did.

623
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:18,480
I suspect it has something to do

624
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,640
with someone from the army.

625
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,400
Check it

626
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,039
in this direction.

627
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,359
Yes, Your Highness.

628
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,599
The grapes in season are really watery.

629
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,000
But I prefer

630
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
the green grapes in Su City.

631
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,880
Crispy and sweet.

632
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,319
By the way,

633
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,680
you haven't seen green grapes, have you?

634
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,279
There seems to be a plant

635
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,400
in Ms. Lu's yard.

636
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,359
Ms. Lu even knows how to plant this?

637
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,799
Of course not.

638
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,480
I heard that His Highness Prince Qi

639
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,559
comes to fertilize and heat up

640
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,920
from time to time.

641
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,039
Stop!

642
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,480
You just said

643
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,960
the grape vine in Lu Anran's courtyard

644
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,799
is from Su City?

645
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,640
Reply to Your Highness,

646
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
it's from Su City.

647
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,680
I'm from Su City.

648
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
I can realize it.

649
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,440
It's not easy to grow

650
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,800
green grapes in Hanjing.

651
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,239
It needs to be taken good care of.

652
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:11,840
Leave now.

653
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:13,880
Yes.

654
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,559
(Could it be that)

655
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,000
Sparrow!

656
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,440
If you dare to touch the vine,

657
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,239
I'll kill you.

658
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,639
Thank you for your kindness, sister-in-law.

659
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:21,559
I already have

660
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,159
someone I like.

661
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:25,519
I'm sorry, Your Ladyship.

662
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,840
It's because of my clumsiness.

663
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,440
Please punish me.

664
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,519
Is there really something with them?

665
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,800
Your Highness,

666
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,440
do you want me

667
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,599
to investigate it carefully?

668
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,199
Of course.

669
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,400
Nanny,

670
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,840
look into it carefully.

671
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,119
Don't let me down.

672
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,719
Yes.

673
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:13,920
Sister Holly,

674
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:14,840
what are you

675
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,639
cooking

676
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,840
for Ms. Lu?

677
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,440
Grape jelly.

678
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,079
It's late autumn now,

679
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,320
and the grapes are ripe.

680
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,840
It's the most delicious time.

681
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,639
When Her Ladyship was in Su City,

682
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,039
she liked grapes the most.

683
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,280
I remember there was a grape vine

684
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,400
in Her Ladyship's yard.

685
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,000
It's flourishing.

686
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,559
But when I passed by a few days ago,

687
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,480
it dries up suddenly.

688
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,320
It's a long story.

689
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,559
What Her Ladyship cherishes the most

690
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,960
is this grape vine

691
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,000
sent by His Highness Prince Qi.

692
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,400
What a pity.

693
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,760
Sent by His Highness Prince Qi?

694
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,679
I heard that

695
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,599
Her Ladyship and Prince Qi are good friends.

696
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,119
But why since

697
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,440
Her Ladyship married into the mansion,

698
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,679
His Highness Prince Qi

699
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,000
doesn't come to the mansion much?

700
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,639
Sister Holly,

701
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,400
you're always by Her Ladyship's side.

702
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,599
Do you think

703
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,480
Her Ladyship and His Highness Prince Qi

704
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,000
are really just friends?

705
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,280
What do you mean?

706
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,559
Sister,

707
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:11,079
we're just chatting.

708
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,519
If you don't want to tell me,

709
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,199
I won't ask.

710
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,559
Sister Holly,

711
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
- I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

712
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,639
Miss.

713
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,440
Just now, the maid in the mansion

714
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,800
talked to me about the grape vine.

715
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,280
Xiao Jingque should be investigating

716
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,599
the past between you and Prince Qi.

717
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,280
Xiao Jingque can't lift

718
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,760
any big waves yet.

719
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,920
Ms. Lu,

720
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,480
His Highness specially asked us

721
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,000
to bring you food.

722
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,400
A cook from Su City?

723
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,599
Yes.

724
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:04,280
His Highness is afraid that
Your Ladyship will be homesick.

725
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,199
So he specially invited the cook from Su City.

726
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,239
His Highness is considerate.

727
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,559
You may leave.

728
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,159
Yes.

729
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:14,519
Miss.

730
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:15,800
Sweet and sour mandarin fish.

731
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Sugar lotus root
stuffed with glutinous rice cake.

732
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,320
These are your favorite dishes

733
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,559
when you were in Su City.

734
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,480
Shut me in a golden cage

735
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:24,679
with delicious food.

736
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,960
Even if he moves the whole city here,

737
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,800
it won't have the original taste of food

738
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,519
from the streets and lanes of the city.

739
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,679
He is just moved by himself.

740
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,360
Miss.

741
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:35,760
I heard the servants said

742
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,719
Prince Yi took the farmland

743
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,559
and killed the farmers.

744
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
This matter is also related to

745
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,760
Prince Qi's promotion of water conservancy.

746
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,239
I'm sure Prince Qi

747
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,239
is also in a lot of trouble now.

748
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,559
The heavy rain

749
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,840
really helped us a lot.

750
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,199
It rushed

751
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,360
more than 30 bodies
out of the farm in the north.

752
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,559
Now the public is furious,

753
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,360
and they are blocking the door

754
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,400
of Prince Yi's Mansion every day.

755
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,360
Call for him to pay for their lives.

756
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,199
When His Majesty finds out about this,

757
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:00,159
he will punish Prince Yi severely for sure.

758
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,400
If he is to blame,

759
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,159
he can only blame himself for
being too greedy.

760
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,000
Take farmers' lands and houses.

761
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,199
What is it?

762
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,480
This is called

763
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,840
being trapped by his own cocoon.

764
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,119
But Prince Yi

765
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,239
is really cruel.

766
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,920
For this personal gain,

767
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,800
he killed so many innocent farmers.

768
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,800
It's not that simple.

769
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,239
Your Highness,

770
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,400
Lu Anran and His Highness Prince Qi

771
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,840
indeed have something.

772
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,119
Took an outing to enjoy the moon.

773
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,639
Got drunk in Su City.

774
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,199
There's no pure friendship

775
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:52,320
between a man and a woman.

776
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,039
It's all with their mutual agreement.

777
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,360
The dirty thoughts are hiding.

778
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,400
Lu Anran

779
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,199
dared to be so arrogant a few days ago.

780
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,039
She doesn't know

781
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:07,280
we are holding something on her now.

782
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,039
One is protecting the vine,

783
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,679
the other is planting An Assuring Rice.

784
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,320
They really love each other.

785
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,960
Only His Highness can't see it clearly.

786
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,679
I'm going to let that woman

787
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,480
show her true colors.

788
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,280
Your Highness,

789
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,880
do you forget your lesson before?

790
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,000
Lu Anran is used to

791
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,840
turning things upside down.

792
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,440
We still need to find

793
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,119
concrete evidence.

794
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,519
But the two of them

795
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,679
have been avoiding suspicion recently.

796
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,199
During the family feast,

797
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,199
Lu Anran was so watertight.

798
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,880
She didn't even look at Prince Qi.

799
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,360
Prince Qi also

800
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,760
doesn't come to the mansion at all.

801
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,320
Even if he comes,

802
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,719
he stays in the study.

803
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,039
Your Highness,

804
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,960
if they don't meet,

805
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,119
then we can find a chance

806
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,119
to make them meet,
which they can't avoid.

807
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,239
Your Highness,

808
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,400
according to your order,

809
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,199
I traced the clues.

810
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,840
We found that the people
from Xiao Ying's military camp

811
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,639
appeared in the farmland in the north of the city.

812
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,559
So funny.

813
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
My brother

814
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,960
is helping His Highness

815
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,920
with something important.

816
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,880
The Lu Family is nothing but

817
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:42,920
a street rat in Hanjing City.

818
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,199
Recently, Prince Yi has occupied farmland.

819
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:47,159
I'm going to report His Majesty about it.

820
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,119
I think

821
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,280
it's not the right time to report, is it?

822
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,639
(I hope I think too much.)

823
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,920
Your Highness,

824
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,440
what should we do?

825
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:00,679
It can't be

826
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:01,719
related to Prince Qing.

827
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,840
Don't tell anyone about it.

828
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,320
I'll go to Prince Qing's Mansion first.

829
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:14,880
Your Highness, please.

830
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,039
Your Highness, please wait here.

831
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,599
His Highness has been
in the palace for a while.

832
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:21,639
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

833
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,639
I'll take my leave now.

834
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,920
Thank you.

835
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:03,920
Your Highness,

836
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,880
Butler Liu has brought Prince Qi

837
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,960
to the study.

838
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,840
He's finally here.

839
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,519
Is everything ready?

840
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,320
It's foolproof.

841
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,199
Do you think we can succeed this time?

842
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,519
As long as it can leave

843
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,880
bad feelings in His Highness's heart,

844
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:23,880
it won't be in vain.
