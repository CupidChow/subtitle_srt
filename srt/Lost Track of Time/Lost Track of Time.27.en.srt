2
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,079
What's she doing here?

3
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,239
I took her here

4
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,959
to pay tribute to your brother.

5
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,480
My brother doesn't want to see her.

6
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,719
I'm gonna stab you to death!

7
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,759
Kill you.

8
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,080
I'm gonna kill you

9
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,280
to avenge my brother's death.

10
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,680
Don't do that.

11
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,719
I'm gonna kill you

12
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,240
to avenge my brother's death.

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,759
I'm warning you.

14
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
If you do this again,

15
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,120
you'll be sentenced

16
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,039
to a violent death.

17
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,280
Why treat me like this?

18
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
I told you

19
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,759
and your brother to do
what you should do.

20
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,680
And not to test my patience.

21
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,240
But you never listened.

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Now,

23
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,439
you want to kill my woman.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,599
Tomorrow,

25
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,560
are you going to challenge my authority?

26
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,479
You brought misfortune unto yourself.

27
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,159
Don't blame others.

28
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,759
Come over.

29
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Listen.

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,479
From now on,

31
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,120
don't touch Lu Anran.

32
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,759
Stay in the Prince Qing's Mansion.

33
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,879
Stay put.

34
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,719
And I'll let you live.

35
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,840
Otherwise,

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,479
you're dead.

37
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,719
Go.

38
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,240
Princess.

39
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,560
No.

40
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,240
I brought you here

41
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
to tell her

42
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,960
what she'll face

43
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,680
if she goes against you.

44
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,919
No. Princess.

45
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,919
You look

46
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,479
not happy.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,159
Not happy.

48
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,759
I feel sad for her
because we are alike.

49
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
I understand.

50
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,159
Don't worry.

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,360
I

52
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,759
won't treat you like that.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,800
Miss.

54
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,319
General Liang.

55
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,360
Tonight

56
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,240
I have a favor to ask.

57
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,079
Whatever you say.

58
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,399
We've been

59
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,439
through life and death

60
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,839
with General Xiao.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Without him,

62
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:52,720
we would have

63
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,639
long been dead.

64
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,480
Thank you.

65
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,360
Brother must be proud

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,399
to have such an loyal army.

67
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,160
We are the Xiao Family's army.

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,079
We only follow General Xiao.

69
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,959
Now he's gone.

70
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,439
We should protect Miss

71
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,519
in his stead.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,079
We will do everything we can

73
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,240
to fulfill your wish.

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,879
OK.

75
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
I want you

76
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,800
to kill someone for me.

77
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,680
Why are you here?

78
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,720
His Highness said,

79
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,600
no more entering this place.

80
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,439
I need someone to have a drink with me.

81
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,519
Ms. Lu.

82
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,399
Join me.

83
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:10,720
Drunk like crazy

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,279
in broad daylight.

85
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,720
Miss.

86
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,439
I'll drive her out.

87
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,439
I dare you!

88
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,199
I'm Princess Qing.

89
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,519
Why can't I ask a concubine

90
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,399
to have a drink?

91
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,959
Shan Yue, let her in.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,800
What?

93
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,160
Afraid it might be poisonous?

94
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,439
What do you want to say?

95
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,000
I have nothing to say to you.

96
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,040
Yes.

97
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,920
We're enemies

98
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,920
as long as we live here.

99
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,839
You even upset

100
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,439
Brother's perfect plan.

101
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
I underestimated you.

102
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,000
Are you here to

103
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,040
avenge your brother's death?

104
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Avenge?

105
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,480
I dare not in this mansion.

106
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,680
You're His Highness's gem.

107
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,360
Touch you,

108
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,720
and he'll take my life.

109
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,560
But I'm a woman.

110
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,360
I can tell if you love someone

111
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,639
from your eyes.

112
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,399
You can hide

113
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,959
and pretend.

114
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
You can trick His Highness.

115
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,920
But you can't trick me.

116
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,079
Lu Anran.

117
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,680
Let's talk in the open.

118
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,720
You like Prince Qi, don't you?

119
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,159
You're here to set me a trap.

120
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,720
Xiao Jingque.

121
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,000
No one in this mansion

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,720
will believe you anymore.

123
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,639
Your brother is dead

124
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,320
because of you.

125
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,600
Don't you understand?

126
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,960
So,

127
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,399
I'll not beat around the bush.

128
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,519
For all the scheming,

129
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,679
I need a result.

130
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,279
How troublesome.

131
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,679
My Brother died because of you.

132
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,320
How can I leave your loved one

133
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,399
safe and sound?

134
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,320
For all the pain I suffered,

135
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,759
you too will suffer.

136
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,240
What do you mean?

137
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,559
It's said Prince Qi is good at combat.

138
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,559
Can fight ten people down.

139
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,559
How about thirty?

140
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
What did you do to Mu Chuan?

141
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Scared?

142
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,000
And you say you don't love him?

143
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,639
So what if you kill me?

144
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,440
Today the bell will ring
in the imperial palace

145
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,720
for Prince Qi's death.

146
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,399
Just wait.

147
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,399
Aren't you afraid

148
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,879
you'd get your whole family killed?

149
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,399
Rather than wasting your time with me,

150
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,840
you should go quickly

151
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,360
and see him for one last time,

152
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,080
so you won't regret.

153
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,039
Brother.

154
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,320
I

155
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,480
avenged your death.

156
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,519
Miss, don't worry.

157
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
The doctor is treating His Highness.

158
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,279
His Highness will be fine.

159
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,159
No.

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,960
Brother Shen will

161
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,679
get people to save him.

162
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,879
Nothing will happen to him.

163
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,720
Had I come earlier,

164
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,679
you would still be alive.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,320
It's my fault.

166
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,600
Why so late?

167
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,039
Had you come earlier,

168
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,440
you would have seen him alive.

Do you remember

200
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,799
you asked me

201
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,559
when I lighted three incenses

202
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,200
before your memorial tablet,

203
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,159
and thought of the last time we met,

204
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,360
would I regret?

205
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,360
You got it right.

206
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,840
I can't bear to think

207
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,919
that the last time we met,

208
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,360
it was in a scheme I set up.

209
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,120
This is who I am.

210
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,080
Playing with power.

211
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Conceited.

212
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,360
But at the end of the day,

213
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,960
I have nothing.

214
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,359
Do you remember

215
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,119
the shadow puppetry story I told you?

216
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,759
The girl in the story

217
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,319
was me.

218
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,279
But if I told you,

219
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,720
would you believe me?

220
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,160
You'd think I was crazy.

221
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,799
Because that's

222
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,359
what I think sometimes.

223
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,599
In that nightmare,

224
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,720
the Lu Family was gone.

225
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,599
You were dead, too.

226
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,079
Why else did I

227
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,559
marry Mu Ze?

228
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,000
Only when I marry him,

229
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,200
and keep a close eye on him,

230
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:57,799
can I protect you and the Lu Family.

231
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,880
I pushed you away,

232
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,319
and hurt you like that.

233
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,039
Because I thought I could protect you.

234
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,200
But how did it turn out?

235
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,400
I wasted your true feelings.

236
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,640
Mu Chuan,

237
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,519
I should have told you earlier.

238
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,039
Should have told you

239
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,480
when you found me at Su City.

240
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,319
Mu Chuan.

241
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,079
I like you.

242
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,279
The world is so ugly.

243
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,799
Only you

244
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,400
made me feel happy

245
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,839
in this hellish place.

246
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,000
Do you know?

247
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,160

Anran.

249
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,599

250
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,039
I'm sorry.

251
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,599
I just want an answer.

252
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:38,480
Thank god you're alive.

253
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,160

Brother Shen.

256
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,079
I will leave Mu Chuan to you.

257
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:51,880
Take care of him.

258
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,880
I will.

00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:57,960
Miss.

262
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:04,559
Brother.

263
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,960
You know His Highness is not dead.

264
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,519
How could you

265
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,400
play Miss like that?

266
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,839
Made it.

267
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:15,680
Brother Chuan.

268
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:16,640
Are you alright?

269
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,720
Is it serious?

270
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,920
Won't die for now.

271
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,640
Who are those people?

272
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,960
Their movements

273
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
are learned from the military.

274
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,880
Should be Xiao Ying's people.

275
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:33,839
Xiao Ying?

276
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,519
Brother Shen.

277
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,359
Why are you here?

278
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,599
I woke up

279
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,680
and asked Holly to find you.

280
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,720
I was at the base, waiting.

281
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,920
But you didn't come.

282
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,559
I was afraid you ran into
trouble on the way.

283
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,640
Thank goodness I came on time.

284
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,799
Otherwise you'd have real trouble.

285
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:48,960
Brother Chuan.

286
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,039
I hurried to meet you

287
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:51,880
because I needed to

288
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,200
clarify something for Ms. Lu.

289
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,200
In case you misunderstand her.

290
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,799
She gave me a list

291
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,599
previously.

292
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:58,000
It was a list of farmers

293
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,920
your Second Brother wanted to kill

294
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,720
in order to frame Prince Yi.

295
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,160
But somehow,

296
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,400
your Second Brother suspected.

297
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,720
He set me up to catch me.

298
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,319
Just so that Ms. Lu
would reveal herself.

299
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,279
She stabbed me

300
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,599
in order to save me.

301
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,559
You misunderstood her.

302
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,920
Brother Shen.

303
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,799
Act like I'm dead.

304
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:26,880
This maybe my only chance

305
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,400
to know the truth.

306
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,279
Holly. Holly. Holly.

307
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,319
Holly. Holly.

308
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:39,559
Your Highness.

309
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,400
If you were certain this could

310
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,160
get Miss to speak the truth,

311
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,319
you must know

312
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,359
how Miss felt about you.

313
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,519
If so,

314
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,839
how could you put her through

315
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,759
such torment?

316
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,880
That's enough.

317
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,000
Your Miss

318
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,799
and Brother Chuan love each other.

319
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,920
Yet she married Prince Qing.

320
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,000
Did she care about

321
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,920
Brother Chuan's feelings?

322
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:58,640
But after that

323
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,240
His Highness himself wavered.

324
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,720
He didn't trust Miss.

325
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,359
Anyone would waver

326
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,680
given the situation.

327
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:04,880
Don't always speak

328
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,519
for your Miss.

329
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,680
Holly. Holly.

330
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,599
I intentionally hid it

331
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,400
from you

332
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,359
so that you'd be left out of it.

333
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,920
But even so,

334
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,960
you were still hurt.

335
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,079
It was indeed inconsiderate of me

336
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,279
to do that.

337
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,240
But if I couldn't

338
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,319
get an answer,

339
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,720
I'd really go crazy.

340
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Fortunately, you're fine.

341
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,440
Otherwise none of this would
be mean anything.

342
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,920
I didn't expect

343
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
the answer could be so hard to believe.

344
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,319
Funnily,

345
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,839

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,119
I believed every word she said

350
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,800
♪Our every beautiful days and nights♪

351
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,880
without a doubt.

352
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,880
But now that you know,

353
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,960
what if you want to do

354
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,920
something silly?

355
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,100
♪Even going through
the winding corridor of the destiny♪

356
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,600
♪I still remember your looks♪

357
00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:00,400
♪Those wonderful memories

358
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,000
♪As long as you are by my side,♪

359
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,500

360
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,500

361
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,500
♪It doesn’t matter if time passes♪

362
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,680
What?

363
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,920
What on earth?

364
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,200
Please.

365
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,480
Please leave me alone.

366
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,000
Your Highness.

367
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,319
It's so late.

368
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,799
Your Highness...

369
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
Tell me.

370
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
What did the Princess

371
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,200
do to Lu Anran?

372
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,319
I don't know

373
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,079
about that.

374
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,559
Then why did Lu Anran

375
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,119
cry like that?

376
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,680
She must have said something.

377
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,599
Perhaps

378
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,960
Princess holds rancor

379
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,960
because of her brother's death.

380
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,200
Your Highness, would you like to go in?

381
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,799
No.

382
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:39,440
Tell her.

383
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,960
Her Brother brought it onto himself.

384
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,039
He dared conspire against me.

385
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,559
And I eliminate anyone who attempts it.

386
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,759
And,

387
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,440
in this mansion,

388
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,160
she's still the Princess Qing.

389
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:54,920
That's my last compensation

390
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,880
to her.

391
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,079
Don't ask for more.

392
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,160
Yes.

393
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,640
Take care of her.

394
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,079
Goodbye, Your Highness.

395
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,119
Mu Ze.

396
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,079
I'm a human, too.

397
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,680
Have you ever

398
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,160
for a moment

399
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,200
cared about my feelings?

400
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,119
Princess.

401
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,680
The plan failed.

402
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,519
His Highness Prince Qi didn't die.

403
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,920
None of General Xiao's soldiers

404
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,359
didn't come back.

405
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,880
Princess.

406
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,839
Princess.

407
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,759
It's OK.

408
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:58,000
(Mu Chuan)

409
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,319
(To Mu Chuan)
Your Highness.

410
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:04,880
This is from Miss.

411
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
(May you be your
Rice Fragrance Hermit merrily.)

412
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,500
(Sometimes, I feel monsters in mountains
are more adorable than devils in the human world.)

413
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,000
(To Mu Chuan)

414
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,700
(The mud in fields is cleaner than
people's dirty thoughts.)

415
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,900
(Now, I see the world like a pipe dream
with you as pure as old alone.)

416
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,300
(Wish you live a life free and safe. Take care.
Lu Anran)

417
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,720
Wish you live a life

418
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,200
free and safe.

419
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:52,640
Lu Anran.

420
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,079
You always think for others.

421
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,599
When will you think for yourself?

422
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,039
What do you think is the ending?

423
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,920
I think this Miss Wang

424
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,400
would find she's back

425
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,359
where she started.

426
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:25,880
But

427
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,079
rather than

428
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,519
dwelling on the so-called fate,

429
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,079
she should leave everything behind

430
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,480
and enjoy life while she can.

431
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,680
You're right.

432
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,119
In the end, Miss Wang

433
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,079
is with the person she wants to

434
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:40,839
spend a lifetime with.

435
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,480
From them on,

436
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,720
they no longer engage in worldly concerns,

437
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,240
or political affairs.

438
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,200
You want to be with me

439
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,319
for the rest of your life, right?

440
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,640
Then I won't leave you.

441
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,119
Wait for me.

442
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,799
Anran.

443
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,559
Miss. Miss.

444
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:20,880
Look what I found.

445
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,640
Why are you carrying a pumpkin?

446
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,119
I found it in a grocery truck.

447
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,000
Look.

448
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
(Mu Chuan, don't grieve. I am still alive.)

449
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,680
It was my letter

450
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,559
to Mu Chuan.

451
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,480
So,

452
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,599
His Highness Princess Qi
used the same method

453
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,440
we used to trick Prince Qing

454
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,680
to send you a message.

455
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,319
Bravo.

456
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
I guess, he sent me this

457
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,519
to tell me

458
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
that he understood why

459
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,759
I lied to him.

460
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:05,519
I'm sorry.

461
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,000
Trust me.

462
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,599
Wait a minute.

463
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,400
You're taking her from him?

464
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,839
Isn't it a bit rude?

465
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,079
I worried too much

466
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:20,759
in the past.

467
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,839
That's why I missed my chances

468
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,039
and was left with so much regret.

469
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:25,599
Now the only thing I want to do

470
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,599
is to save her from there.

471
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,319
And nothing else.

472
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,599
Miss won't agree to this.

473
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,160
She pushed me away

474
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,079
so many times.

475
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,079
She owes me this one.

476
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,839
But Your Highness.

477
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:38,319
Holly.

478
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,559
Would you just gonna let your Miss

479
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,799
stay in that mansion?

480
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:47,799
If she's a meek woman,

481
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:48,680
that'll be fine.

482
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,160
But she restrains

483
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,240
Second Brother in every way.

484
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,799
If he finds out something,

485
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,400
her life will be in danger.

486
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,839
I can't bear it.

487
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:04,920
To be honest,

488
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,400
ever since I left the mansion,

489
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,679
I have been worrying

490
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,960
for Miss all the time.

491
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
I know

492
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,880
what a dangerous place it is

493
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,599
where I have to tread on thin ice.

494
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,239
Brother Shen.

495
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,199
You want to help me, right?

496
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,440
Sure.

497
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,880
You mean,

498
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,000
you need Lu Anran's assistance

499
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,280
on the day of the dam closure?

500
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,599
Yes.

501
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,440
The dam closure

502
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,440
is for drawing off water.

503
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,639
If there's any accident,

504
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,840
I need someone with experience

505
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,800
to handle it on the spot.

506
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,800
Lu Anran should be

507
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,000
the most familiar with rivers

508
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,119
in this country.

509
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,400
I can't think of

510
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
anyone else.

511
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,519
No personal motive?

512
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,880
If I have,

513
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,960
I wouldn't have come to Father.

514
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,480
I'd go straight for her.

515
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,199
And no one would know.

516
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,000
Your Majesty.

517
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,840
Why don't you ask if Princess Qi

518
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
wants to take

519
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,280
the imperial edict you issued earlier?

520
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,840
When he needs it,

521
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,679
he'll come to me.

522
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,039
No need to hurry.

523
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,800
(Mansion of Prince Qing)

524
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,500
(Mansion of Prince Qing)

525
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,079
Ninth Brother.

526
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,000
Your Highness Prince Qing.

527
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:15,880
You don't even

528
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,280
call me Second Brother now?

529
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,119
That day at Xiao Ying's military base

530
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,679
was an accident.

531
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,079
I didn't expect

532
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,440
it would put you in danger.

533
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,760
I don't blame you.

534
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,119
Really?

535
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,599
I ruined your plans one after another.

536
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,559
It's not hard to understand
why you wanted to kill me.

537
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,440
I'm here to deliver an imperial edict.

538
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,000
Please ask Ms. Lu to come here,

539
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,599
Your Highness.

540
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:56,320
What do you mean?

541
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,639
I need her assistance

542
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,760
on the day of the dam closure.

543
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,360
Hope you can understand.

544
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,920
After Lu Anran married me,

545
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,880
you reduced contact with her

546
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,840
to avoid embarrassment for us.

547
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,360
Xiao Jingque

548
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,159
made a mess here time and time again.

549
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,719
But you were nowhere to be found.

550
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,400
Today you come with His Majesty's edict

551
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,440
and ask her to go with you.

552
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,079
What

553
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,599
on earth do you want to do?

554
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,039
Your Highness worry too much.

555
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,800
I'm here just to deliver an order.

556
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,039
Then tell me.

557
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,800
Will Lu Anran come back

558
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,840
from this mission?

559
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,320
Your Highness,

560
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,400
please ask Ms. Lu

561
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,639
to accept the edict.

562
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,360
What?

563
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,159
Miss.

564
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:00,920
Please go quickly.

565
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:01,840
Or else

566
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,159
I'm afraid there'd be trouble.

567
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,199
Your Highness Prince Qing and Prince Qi.

568
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,199
Lu Anran.

569
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,360
Accept the edict.

570
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,199
His Majesty

571
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,719
notes that

572
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,840
Lu Anran is intelligent

573
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,639
and experienced with
water transport business,

574
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:50,320
and now orders her to assist Ninth Prince

575
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,199
at the ceremony

576
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,639
of the dam closure.

577
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,559
Your Highness,

578
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,559
I'm a married woman.

579
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,280
It would be improper
for me to make such a public appearance.

580
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,960
If it is possible,

581
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,719
I can send Shan Yue

582
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,679
to lead the entire fleet to assist.

583
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:22,920
The project in the western suburb

584
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,039
is important to

585
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:24,920
the water conservation of the country,

586
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,960
and cannot afford to go wrong.

587
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:28,920
Otherwise,

588
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,239
I wouldn't have

589
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,599
bothered Prince Qing and Ms. Lu.

590
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,840
But...

591
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,960
Are you trying to defy the edict?

592
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:40,800
No, I'm not.

593
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,119
Ms. Lu, please arrive on time

594
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,760
on the day of the dam closure.

595
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:08,880
Your Highness,

596
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,159
I'll take my leave.

597
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,199
What are you two up to?

598
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,039
As you can see,

599
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,639
I knew about it just now.

600
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:33,840
Do you think I'd believe it?

601
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,119
What he just did

602
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,039
is to take you away from me.

603
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,280
Take you away from me!

604
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,760
Your Highness said you'd

605
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,119
believe me and protect me

606
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,239
not long ago.

607
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,880
Why do you go back on
your word so soon?

608
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,519
You won't leave me.

609
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:55,719
Will you?

610
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,199
Tell me you won't leave.

611
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,280
How could I?

612
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,119
I won't leave

613
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
even if you orders me to.

614
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,360
OK.

615
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,000
I won't let you.

616
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:07,440
Never.

617
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,440
Father invited officials

618
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,119
to witness the dam closure.

619
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,480
I have to show up

620
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:19,599
at the ceremony

621
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,719
before I go to find you.

622
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,440
Stay where you are

623
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,599
and wait for me.

624
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,400
I need to ensure the lower
stream is not overwhelmed

625
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,960
when the water is drawn off.

626
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:31,800
I might be far away

627
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,920
from the ceremony site.

628
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,199
However far it is,

629
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:38,119
I will go and find you.

630
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,800
And take you home.

631
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,360
OK.

632
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,239
Anran.

633
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,639
Do wait for me.

634
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,639
Nanxing.

635
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,199
Send someone to follow her.

636
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,599
OK.

637
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,199
Will Miss be angry

638
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
that we did this

639
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,000
behind her?

640
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,840
Don't you know

641
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:45,920
who Miss thinks of every day?

642
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:47,679
I guess

643
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,000
Miss has met His Highness
at the port now.

644
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:57,000
(Lu)

645
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,559
You want to

646
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:00,519
send me away directly?

647
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:01,960
Yes.

648
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,239
You know I won't leave.

649
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:06,320
Why do you do it?

650
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,800
What do you think would happen to me?

651
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,039
To my family

652
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:10,760
in Su City?

653
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,559
Lu Anran.

654
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,639
Do you think I'll take you away from him

655
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:13,360
before I haven't thought clearly

656
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,239
about these things?

657
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:15,840
Can't you let me share

658
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,559
your load?

659
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:18,199
But what're you going to do

660
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,840
after I leave?

661
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:23,400
Opening the dam and drawing off water

662
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,639
will bring up the water level of the river

663
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:26,559
in a short time.

664
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:28,039
The riverside is dangerous.

665
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:29,360
If I say you fell into the waves,

666
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,239
who can verify it?

667
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:32,000
Even if they want to.

668
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,920
It's difficult to find
a person identical to you.

669
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,360
But the floating dead bodies,

670
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,039
with their faces hard to identify,
are everywhere.

671
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,440
Good.

672
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:42,960
His Highness has really

673
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,000
made his mind this time.

674
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:45,920
I'll be the first root for him.

675
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,159
It's not as easy as you think.

676
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,840
There will be more problems after that.

677
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:50,719
What about you?

678
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,679
Mu Ze won't let you go.

679
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:54,880
You're always thinking for me.

680
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:57,079
Why don't you ever ask me

681
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,400
if I want the safety

682
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,760
you sacrificed yourself to get for me?

683
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:02,840
And,

684
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,639
if something bad happens to you,

685
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:06,320
how can I forgive myself?

686
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,360
Mu Chuan,

687
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,639
now that you believe

688
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:10,920
what I've been through,

689
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,400
you should know

690
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,960
that I can't leave it all behind me

691
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:15,199
and live a carefree life.

692
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:18,039
You gave yourself a happy ending

693
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:19,360
with the shadow puppetry that day.

694
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:21,920
