2
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,159
Miss.

3
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,040
The Mansion of Hanjing's Mayor is on fire.

4
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,840
Help. Fight the fire.

5
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,959
Hurry up.

6
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,359
Go.

7
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,599
We're out.

8
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,799
Hurry up.

9
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,879
We're out.

10
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,680
Yun.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,560
Mr. Xu.

12
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,680
Yun.

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,239
Watch out.

14
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:05,920
Brother Xu.

15
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,680
What are you doing?

16
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,200
Young Master.

17
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,879
Mr. Xu.

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,960
Yun.

19
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,159
If even the Imperial Examination
becomes unfair,

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,439
then what do we strive for

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,280
with more than

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,319
a decade's hard work?

23
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,479
Brother Xu.

24
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,439
I know you are aggrieved.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,719
Mr. Xu.

26
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,360
Anran.

27
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:28,879
But it's not the time

28
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,560
for it now.

29
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,360
Get out of there.

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,280
Now!

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,680
Yun.

32
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,719
I figure it out.

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,800
When cheaters bully us with their power,

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,439
for you and I,

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,360
we are just like ants,

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,800
being bullied and trampling

37
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,400
as they wish.

38
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,400
Anran.

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Mr. Xu, get out!

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,319
Anran.

41
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,240
Mr. Xu!

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,719
But it won't hinder me...

43
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,439
Brother Xu.

44
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,159
from using my own way

45
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,400
to preserve

46
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,840
the justice in my mind.

47
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,599
Young Master!

48
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,280
Your Highness, take care.

49
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,759
Mu Chuan!

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,280
Lu Yun.

51
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,560
Brother Xu!

52
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,319
- Mr. Xu!
- Brother Xu!

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,560
Xu Qingce!

54
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,719
Mu Chuan!

55
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,159
Young Master!

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,879
Brother Xu!

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Mr. Xu!

58
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,800
As long as you are alive,

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,919
the issue can be overturned!

60
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,960
If you are dead,

61
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,199
there will be nothing left!

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,919
Dead?

63
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,840
The Spring Imperial Exam is unfair,

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,080
but the examination hall just sits back!

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,800
The Imperial Examination
and the imperial court is corrupt!

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,960
Three years.

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,159
Another three years.

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,240
Three years after three years!

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,560
One day, the bubble bursts eventually!

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,920
There is no way to
serve the country with our high spirits.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Today,

72
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,319
I,

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,160
Xu Qingce,

74
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,360
will shed my blood
for the Spring Imperial Exam.

75
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,800
Hope that a purge will start

76
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,639
after my death

77
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,600
to return the fairness

78
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,920
back to

79
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,600
the Imperial Examination.

80
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,279
To return the justice

81
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,279
back to students nationwide.

82
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,240
I would rather

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,680
be a broken straight sword...

84
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,160
No.

85
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,079
Don't.

86
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,240
than

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,240
be a bending

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,240
and compromised crook.

89
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,319
No!

90
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,639
Brother Xu!

91
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,360
No!

92
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,959
Brother Xu!

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,120
Miss.

94
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,439
Miss.

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,920
Miss.

96
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,279
Miss.

97
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,160
Your Highness.

98
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,160
Your Highness.

99
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,920
Miss.

100
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,360
Doctor.

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,959
How's our Miss?

102
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,480
Nothing serious.

103
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,720
Because she has been preoccupied for long.

104
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,759
She got irritated

105
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,560
and pent-up suddenly.

106
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,360
So, her blood pressure increased.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,879
I will give you a prescription
for tranquilizing and replenishing qi.

108
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,199
Let her take them.

109
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,160
She will be fine
when she comes to herself.

110
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,279
That's great, doctor.

111
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,439
Thank you, doctor.

112
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,519
I will go buy the medicines.

113
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,360
I will see the doctor off.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
Doctor, let me see you off.

115
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,399
Sorry.

116
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,959
It's all my fault.

117
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,639
Sorry. I am sorry.

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,040
Anran.

119
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,879
Sorry.

120
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,399
What are you mulling over on earth?

121
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,480
Young Master.

122
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,160
Young Master, where are you going?

123
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,279
What's going on

124
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,240
between the siblings?

125
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,439
After Miss is awake,

126
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,800
she will tell you personally

127
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,800
if she wants to.

128
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,720
Your Highness,

129
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,160
the examination hall is on fire as well.

130
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:03,879
Go.

131
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,680
Yes, Your Highness.

132
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,639
It's a dereliction of my duty.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,920
I didn't expect

134
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,879
Xu Qingce was really

135
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,000
a man of character.

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,920
He would rather die than give in.

137
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,959
Even if he forced himself

138
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,319
to yield today,

139
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:18,920
in the future,

140
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,040
he won't obey me either.

141
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,360
But His Majesty

142
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,399
will know the issue definitely.

143
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,240
Won't it draw attention

144
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,240
that Your Highness
asked to burn the examination hall?

145
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,079
If we can't conceal the truth,

146
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,279
then destroy the evidence.

147
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,639
Don't let them

148
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,360
investigate us.

149
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,440
Then, shall we deal with

150
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
the chief of the Imperial Academy?

151
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,360
It doesn't matter.

152
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,120
He at most can prove

153
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,799
Xu Qingce's paper has been changed.

154
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Even if he won't say it,

155
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,799
Xu Qingce has done so.

156
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,480
He has made the entire Hanjing

157
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,279
know the story.

158
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,440
Yes, Your Highness.

159
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,559
Ninth Brother,

160
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,240
why are you here?

161
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,279
Xu Qingce's paper has been changed.

162
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,720
The examination hall is on fire.

163
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,320
Are you relative to them?

164
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,080
For the Danzhou issue,

165
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,320
you said it's for
rooting out corruption in the army.

166
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,519
But now,

167
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,000
what is it for?

168
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,720
It's for myself.

169
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,120
Second Brother,

170
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,080
it's harder and harder for me
to see through you.

171
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,000
Your Highness,

172
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,559
if Prince Qi keeps looking into it,

173
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,240
I am afraid we will have a rough time.

174
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,679
Since the examination hall is burned,

175
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,039
he can't find the proof.

176
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,399
But Your Highness...

177
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,919
If he keeps investigating,

178
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,919
do something to stop him.

179
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,799
But do remember not to harm him.

180
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,840
Otherwise,

181
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,399
it's on your head.

182
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,080
Yes, Your Highness.

183
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,399
Mr. Xu.

184
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,080
Lu Anran!

185
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
Mr. Xu.

186
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,519
Lu Anran!

187
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,240
Why did you

188
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,600
take the liberty of stealing my title?

189
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,240
My high spirits

190
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,799
were buried by you.

191
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,440
Lu Anran,

192
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,960
you deserve bad karma!

193
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,799
Mr. Xu.

194
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,960
You finally awake.

195
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,759
You almost scare me off.

196
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,000
Lingxi,

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,039
hold Miss up.

198
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,080
Miss.

199
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
Take the medince.

200
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:57,960
Here.

201
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,399
Holly.

202
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,600
It is I who killed Mr. Xu.

203
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
You are not to blame, Miss.

204
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,000
Were it not for me,

205
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,200
Mu Ze wouldn't have chosen Mr. Xu.

206
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,519
He would have been

207
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,559
an impressive champion.

208
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,720
Miss, don't say it.

209
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,360
You had no other choices

210
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,799
because Lingxi was in Prince Qing's hands.

211
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,840
Don't say it.

212
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,039
It was for me?

213
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,200
Miss.

214
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,960
Miss, it's my bad.

215
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,200
Miss, I'm sorry.

216
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,519
It's all my fault.

217
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,519
I am sorry, Miss.

218
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,600
It's I who incriminated Miss.

219
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,159
Lingxi.

220
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,480
Lingxi, get up.

221
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,120
Miss, I am sorry.

222
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,399
Don't do this. Get up.

223
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,399
I didn't mean it.

224
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,240
Stand up.

225
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,200
I won't stand up.

226
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,519
Get up. Don't do this, Lingxi.

227
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,759
Get up.

228
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,960
I won't.

229
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,600
Miss.

230
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,600
My hands

231
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,720
are full of

232
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,480
Mr. Xu's blood.

233
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,279
I even thought

234
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,279
complacently

235
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,320
that I could

236
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,600
change his life.

237
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,080
But I never expected

238
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,559
he had a chance

239
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,360
to enjoy his bright future.

240
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,519
He should not have died
with the humiliation.

241
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,159
Miss, it's not your fault.

242
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,960
Don't blame yourself.

243
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,879
Holly,

244
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,519
Mr. Xu studied

245
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,080
by windows every day.

246
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,600
I believe he did this every day

247
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,440
over the past decade.

248
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,720
Holly,

249
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,120
why did I

250
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,600
hand him over to Mu Ze

251
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,799
easily?

252
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,600
Scoring high in the Imperial Examination

253
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,759
can at least end his regret

254
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,120
for the past ten-odd years.

255
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,639
What was I doing?

256
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,639
Miss.

257
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,759
Miss, don't be like this.

258
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,440
Holly,

259
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,759
tell me how could I

260
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,159
take his life away?

261
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,320
How could I think

262
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,200
it could protect him?

263
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,919
Miss.

264
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,519
Miss, it's not your bad.

265
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,000
Miss.

266
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,559
Miss, you are not to blame.

267
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,159
Your Highness Prince Qi.

268
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,440
Our Miss is depressed.

269
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,559
She hasn't recovered yet.

270
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,279
Please don't...

271
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:18,960
Get out.

272
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,240
Your Highness.

273
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,279
Get out.

274
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,320
Lingxi. Holly.

275
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,240
There you off.

276
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,519
Your Highness Prince Qi.

277
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,799
What do you mean by

278
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,120
taking his life

279
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,360
you mentioned?

280
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,440
Were you threatened?

281
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,879
Or deceived by others?

282
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,320
In such a vast Hanjing,

283
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
it's normal if you are deceived

284
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,519
because

285
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,120
you just arrived.

286
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,480
You were forced by my second brother?

287
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,639
I know

288
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,879
in order to collaborate with Minister Yan,

289
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,799
he changed

290
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,440
Yan Ziyun's paper for Xu Qingce's.

291
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,440
And Lingxi was in his hands.

292
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,720
You had no other ways, right?

293
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,960
Not right.

294
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,600
It is I who introduced Xu Qingce

295
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,080
to His Highness Prince Qing.

296
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,120
No way. It doesn't look like you.

297
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,840
No one forced me.

298
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,080
I did all I can

299
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,919
to achieve merits.

300
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,840
Even if Xu Qingce

301
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,919
is Yun's friend,

302
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,559
I still showed no mercy.

303
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,960
He was erudite

304
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,240
with no background.

305
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
He is the best choice for the change.

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,080
Lu Anran.

307
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,360
It is a life!

308
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,639
He is not a chess piece

309
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,120
that you can discard
when you don't want it.

310
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,840
It is you

311
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,200
who saved Holly desperately.

312
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,600
It's you who sacrificed yourself

313
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,240
to catch Gao Chengxian.

314
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,360
And now, it's also you
who cheated in the Imperial Examination

315
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,399
and made Xu Qingce die.

316
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,879
Which one is you?

317
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,799
Which one is the real you?

318
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,200
I will make it up

319
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,480
to their families.

320
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,399
Now, in your mind,

321
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,879
lives can be weighed by money,

322
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,159
right?

323
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,879
Great. Great.

324
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,679
So great, Lu Anran.

325
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,759
I toast you.

326
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,320
Toast that

327
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,440
you are as sharp as a tack,

328
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,039
while I see you through fogs,

329
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,919
seeing nothing at all.

330
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,680
Lu Anran.

331
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,039
Why didn't you die in anger on the spot

332
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,559
but just spat up blood?

333
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,319
Indeed,

334
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,519
you are hard-hearted.

335
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,920
Let me see

336
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,519
how you will

337
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,640
show your deep feelings
with your brother.

338
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,279
How His Highness will

339
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,559
let you go.

340
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,039
Life is what I desire for.

341
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Righteousness is also what I desire for.

342
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,599
However, if I cannot have both,

343
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,799
I will give my life
so as to uphold righteousness.

344
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,319
Mr. Xu.

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
(Mencius)

346
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,119
(People don't know a pine when it's small.)

347
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,880
(They don't start to praise its spectacle
until it reaches the sky.)

348
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,440
Sir's name hasn't been presented

349
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,920
on the imperial board.

350
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,000
The world doesn't know Sir yet.

351
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,599
I have no reason

352
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,839
to keep depressed.

353
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,839
It seems the chielf is a bookworm as well.

354
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,400
Really impresses me.

355
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,720
I am sure you must know

356
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,279
what I came for.

357
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,440
This is the essay

358
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,319
that Mr. Xu rewrote that day.

359
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,480
Take it.

360
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,640
But for what you ask for,

361
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,759
I can't help you.

362
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,240
Why?

363
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,000
You know the one who Mr. Xu reported

364
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,759
is the son of Minister Yan.

365
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,240
Aren't you asking me

366
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,359
to be the enemy of Minister Yan

367
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,759
if you want me to be the evidence?

368
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,720
Please Miss Lu stop embarrassing me.

369
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,079
Chief.

370
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,160
I know it does put you on the spot.

371
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,400
But if the truth is covered up like this,

372
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,359
then Mr. Xu's death

373
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,240
is no more than a common farce.

374
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,640
His weep and grief
in front of the examination hall

375
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,559
is only madness.

376
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,920
But Mr. Xu is a literary talent

377
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,319
with great governance.

378
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
And now,

379
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:16,119
he passed away in humiliation.

380
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,599
How can the innocent student

381
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,640
rest in peace?

382
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,900
(Select Talents for the Country)

383
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,839
Yun.

384
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,240
Your Highness Prince Qi.

385
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:35,880
Your Highness.

386
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,759
I have the evidence.

387
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:37,799
Evidence?

388
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,319
The proof that

389
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,599
Brother Xu is the champion.

390
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,240
When he finished the exam,

391
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,079
I took Brother Xu to find the chief

392
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,359
and he rewrote his essay
in the Imperial Academy.

393
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
The chief said

394
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,759
Brother Xu could rank the third class.

395
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,759
The essay Brother Xu rewrote

396
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:50,920
is in the chief's home.

397
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,160
Sir,

398
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,319
someone following His Highness Prince Qi

399
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,599
sent back a message.

400
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,920
Xu Qingce once rewrote the essay
in the chief's home.

401
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,480
Lu Yun took Prince Qi

402
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,119
to go for the inquiry.

403
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,279
His Highness Prince Qi has gone there.

404
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,400
Should we report it to His Highness now?

405
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,720
It didn't matter

406
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,519
if the chief says it or not.

407
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,720
But now if Prince Qi

408
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,079
knows the whole story,

409
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,119
I fret he will only

410
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,079
end our prince's bright prospects

411
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,160
for the justice

412
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,359
in his mind.

413
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,160
What should we do?

414
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,039
We have to do something now.

415
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,599
The road to an emperor

416
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,839
is paved with
hundreds of thousands of bodies.

417
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,680
How can one be soft-hearted?

418
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,319
Sir wants to...

419
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,519
We can't keep the chief.

420
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,359
Nor Prince Qi.

421
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,000
What a good opportunity.

422
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:48,799
I get a chance

423
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,359
to kill her by their hands.

424
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:58,359
Yun.

425
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,720
Yun. Yun.

426
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,799
What for again?

427
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,079
Did you

428
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:06,799
take Xu Qingce

429
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,279
to find the chief for rewriting the essay?

430
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,079
How do you know?

431
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,519
Prince Qing

432
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,559
has known it.

433
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,839
He sent someone to kill the chief.

434
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:19,359
What?

435
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,920
I planned to tell

436
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,759
Lu Anran.

437
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:22,680
But you know

438
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,160
she won't believe me.

439
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,200
Don't tell her I told you so.

440
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,880
Or, she still won't buy it.

441
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,119
I get it.

442
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,240
(Lu Anran,)

443
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,839
(as you are meddlesome,)

444
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,599
(once you go this time,)

445
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,480
(you may not be able to go back alive)

446
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,599
(because you are the same
in front of swords.)

447
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:40,960
Who are you?

448
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,160
Your Highness Prince Qi?

449
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,920
What's going on?

450
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,359
Run now!

451
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,839
You wanna die?

452
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,880
This is Mr. Xu's essay.

453
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,559
I must live up to the expectation.

454
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,359
Stop.

455
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,480
Dodge.

456
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,759
Who dares to hurt my Brother Chuan?

457
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,559
Brother Shen.

458
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:13,960
Say.

459
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Who sent you?

460
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,950
(Xu)

461
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,359
Thank God.

462
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,440
The essay is safe.

463
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,519
The essay is safe.

464
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,119
The essay is alright.

465
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,759
Miss Lu.

466
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,559
This is...

467
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,960
He is the leader of Qinghe Gang,
Shen Changqing.

468
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,000
I am supposed to ask Leader Shen

469
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,880
to escort you.

470
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,240
It's my negligence.

471
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,240
Nice to meet you.

472
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,920
What is the escorting for?

473
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,039
I am ashamed to say.

474
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,720
Miss Lu paid a visit to me in person,

475
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,519
asking me to justify Xu Qingce.

476
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,559
But as I am timid,

477
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,160
I didn't want to cause trouble.

478
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,920
Thank Miss Lu for her persistence.

479
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,039
Were it not for the murderers,

480
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,279
I might have

481
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,640
presented the petition
in the imperial court.

482
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,960
I was ill-considered.

483
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,559
Let you

484
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,720
be in great danger.

485
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,559
Miss, don't blame yourself.

486
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,720
It's rare for me

487
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,000
to stand out for once

488
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,119
for the righteousness

489
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,599
at my old age.

490
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,640
Thanks to Miss Lu

491
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,119
who persuaded me reasonably.

492
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,000
Therefore,

493
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,319
I won't die with the regret.

494
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,680
Not a big deal.

495
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,359
I will enter the court tomorrow for sure.

496
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,680
Tell His Majesty the truth.

497
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,519
Return the justice back to Student Xu.

498
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,200
I will go with you.

499
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:58,640
Great.

500
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
(Xu's Mansion)

501
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,319
Take care.

502
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,880
I will safeguard here tonight.

503
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,160
Just rest assured.

504
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,839
If the chief has anything,

505
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,200
just have my head.

506
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,839
Talk it through.

507
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,079
No sulks.

508
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,839
Leaving.

509
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,400
(Xu's Mansion)

510
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,480
Apply the medicines when you are back.

511
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,039
It will be bad if it festers.

512
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:57,700
(Xu's Mansion)

513
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,920
Even if I didn't take it the first time,

514
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,319
you could give me once more.

515
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,359
Hold it.

516
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,039
Gentler. Gentler.

517
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,960
Gentler.

518
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,200
Gentler. Gentler.

519
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,640
Wipe it if you want.

520
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,799
Do you know

521
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,240
what I was thinking

522
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
when dying?

523
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,799
I was thinking

524
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,319
it's so awful.

525
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
When we met last time,

526
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,279
we quarreled in heat.

527
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,759
If I die like this,

528
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,799
the end

529
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:18,799
doesn't seem perfect.

530
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,480
And you

531
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:28,680
put the incense

532
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,079
in front of my gravestone.

533
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,400
When you recall

534
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,359
we parted in a bad mood

535
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:33,960
after our last meeting,

536
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,680
will you feel

537
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,880
a bit regretful?

538
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,880
Till then,

539
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,799
will you think

540
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,839
it's fine to confide

541
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,039
all of your thoughts

542
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,000
that you are unwilling to tell me

543
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,359
in this circumstance?

544
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:11,920
I have no difficulties.

545
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,039
You are overthinking.

546
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:13,759
You were about to say.

547
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,640
You are overthinking.

548
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:24,759
I thougt you, in order to protect

549
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:25,640
the Lu Family,

550
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,319
highly prioritized

551
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,440
the alliance with my second brother.

552
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,920
Therefore,

553
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,000
you changed the papers.

554
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,920
But now,

555
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,480
for Xu Qingce,

556
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
can you, at the risk of

557
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,440
being the enemy of my second brother,

558
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
set your alliance

559
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,599
aside?

560
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,359
Don't you come to Hanjing City

561
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,920
for forming an alliance

562
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,839
with second brother, do you?

563
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,680
Anran,

564
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,599
what do you want on earth?

565
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:08,320
Alright.

566
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:11,960
Alright. Alright.

567
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,920
I should not have forced you.

568
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,119
Keep it if you don't want to say.

569
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,400
As you are upset now,

570
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
I shouldn't be anxious.

571
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,480
But promise me,

572
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,400
whatever you encounter in the future,

573
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,400
let me help you.

574
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,440
This is the essay Xu Qingce rewrote

575
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,760
before the rankings unveiled?

576
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,559
Your Majesty,

577
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,119
I will vouch with my head.

578
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,559
The essay

579
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,039
was rewritten by Xu Qingce

580
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,119
on the day
when the Spring Imperial Exam ended.

581
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:29,920
Your Majesty,

582
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:31,400
this essay

583
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
was selected by me.

584
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,079
It is no different from
the champion's essay.

585
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,039
The other examiners
in the examination hall

586
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,440
can prove it as well.

587
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,719
Great.

588
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,480
They should switch the papers

589
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,119
right under my nose!

590
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,239
They even burned the examination hall.

591
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,599
Lawless!

592
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,440
Xu Qingce shed his blood
for the Spring Imperial Exam,

593
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,519
showing his aspiration with death.

594
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,199
It is all for

595
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,559
returning the justice
back to students nationwide.

596
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,639
I plead with Your Majesty.

597
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,079
Fulfill the popular will
to get to the bottom of it.

598
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,719
Chuan.

599
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,639
I order you to investigate thoroughly

600
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,960
the Spring Imperial Exam at whatever cost.

601
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,239
Thank you, Your Majesty.

602
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,960
Your Highness.

603
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,039
I point it out, or,

604
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,719
you tell me yourself?

605
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,039
Please Your Highness express.

606
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,920
You sent a team
of secret guards out yesterday.

607
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,320
But they didn't return today.

608
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:55,880
Do you think

609
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,519
I am ignorant?

610
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,639
Thankfully, I sent someone

611
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,000
to Ninth Brother's mansion to ask for it.

612
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,440
Then, I know Ninth Brother is injured.

613
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,199
Why is it?

614
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,639
The chief is the evidence after all.

615
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,280
To avoid future worries,

616
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
I took upon myself

617
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
and sent people to kill him.

618
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,639
But didn't expect...

619
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,000
But didn't expect

620
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,320
Ninth Brother went there as well.

621
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,360
I didn't expect it.

622
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,880
Sent a team of guards

623
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,079
to kill a single old man.

624
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,280
Or,

625
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,000
killing the chief

626
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,079
is an excuse.

627
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,320
You wanted to use the chaos at the scene

628
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,719
to kill Ninth Brother.

629
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:44,119
This is your purpose, right?

630
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,679
Your Highness,

631
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:48,199
Prince Qi has already
had another thought.

632
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,239
If you keep

633
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,119
tolerating him,

634
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:50,960
it will harm you

635
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,039
in the end.

636
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:53,800
Say it again.

637
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,239
Even if Your Highness

638
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,119
ends my life now,

639
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,760
I will only regret...

640
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,880
Regret I failed.

641
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,079
What are you saying?

642
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,039
It's tough for Your Highness

643
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,199
along this way.

644
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,039
Everyone thinks Prince Qi

645
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,320
is Your Highness' right-hand man.

646
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,639
But in my opinion,

647
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,079
he is the hidden danger.

648
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,719
On the road to the emperor,

649
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,519
if you make a wrong step,

650
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,320
there will be no way back on track.

651
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,960
If Your Highness can't do it,

652
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,639
I will do it for Your Highness.

653
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
I am only willing to

654
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,360
be Your Highness' stepping stone.

655
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,280
I warn you.

656
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,960
If you hurt Ninth Brother again,

657
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,719
the thing that will drop

658
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:03,880
is your head.

659
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,159
Yes, Your Highness.

660
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:17,280
The Xu Qingce issue

661
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,840
has been passed to the imperial court

662
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,000
and infuriated His Majesty.

663
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,239
But I

664
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,880
have come up with the response.

665
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,519
Send someone to kill Minister Yan

666
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:31,920
and pass the buck to Prince Yi.

667
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:33,719
Yes, Your Highness.

668
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,760
Rumor has it that

669
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,599
Minister Yan committed suicide
for fear of punishment.

670
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,880
Before he died, he wrote a letter
to identify Prince Yi

671
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,639
who wanted to cooperate with him

672
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,360
through the Imperial Examination issue.

673
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,559
He still confided many other things

674
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:49,519
about Prince Yi.

675
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,159
His Highness Prince Qing
killed his alliance to stay afloat.

676
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,280
So decisive indeed.

677
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
Miss,

678
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,360
we'd better

679
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
leave the capital soon.

680
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,599
It's so terrible.

681
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,400
It's soon.

682
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,119
But before that,

683
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,559
we should take Mr. Xu's body back

684
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,239
from the Mansion of Hanjing's Mayor.

685
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,039
Then, we can bury him back in Su City.

686
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,320
Miss,

687
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,719
Cuicui is here.

688
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Princess invites Miss Lu
to catch up in the mansion.

689
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,079
What does she want from me?

690
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:23,880
Miss.

691
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,159
Lu Xinran has taken

692
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,840
Mr. Xu's body away.

693
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,159
What?

694
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,480
She took me there directly.

695
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,519
I didn't have a chance to inform you.

696
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,400
Where is Mr. Xu's body?

697
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:41,679
Have a seat.

698
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,559
Sister,

699
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,239
how long it is

700
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,440
for us

701
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,719
since we enjoyed tea like this?

702
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,480
It's not a matter of time,

703
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,519
but a matter of necessity.

704
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,960
Tell me.

705
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,519
What are you going to do?

706
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,320
I made this cup of tea for you personally.

707
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,679
What is my identity now?

708
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,079
What is your identity?

709
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,800
You can't refuse this cup of tea.

710
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:23,360
Then, I appreciate Princess Qing.

711
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,239
You.

712
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:27,800
Lu Xinran.

713
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,639
All you own today

714
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,880
is given by me.

715
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,360
And now you flex your muscle to me

716
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,599
with these.

717
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,360
It's so hilarious.

718
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,079
Do you believe

719
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,159
as long as I would like to,

720
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:44,199
I can take them back tomorrow?

721
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,119
Wishful thinking.

722
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,159
For every flower and tree

723
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,920
in this court,

724
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,559
I am familiar with them.

725
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:55,519
What?

726
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,519
Do you dare to bet with me?

727
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,559
What are you going to say?

728
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,119
There is a hole in your wall.

729
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:05,639
I suggest you to block it.

730
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:08,280
Otherwise,

731
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,480
if someone errant comes in,

732
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,760
Princess Qing has to watch out.

733
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,920
You must see it

734
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,079
from outside.

735
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,320
Let me talk about those in your room.

736
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,119
I can't see them, right?

737
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,559
You hear

738
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,519
sobs at night

739
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,920
sometimes.

740
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,440
Do you fear?

741
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,079
The window by the mirrow table

742
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,519
make noises when you open and close it.

743
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:50,199
You should lubricate it.

744
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,639
By the window, there is a bed

745
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,800
made of rarely-seen jade.

746
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,800
As you are living under the rock,

747
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,639
you must

748
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,480
dislike its hardness.

749
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,840
There is still a folding screen

750
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:13,679
with deer, tree and plants design
in clamp-resist dyeing.

751
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:17,199
Each panel is framed
by silks from Jiannan.

752
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:19,679
On the four panels,

753
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:22,599
there are probably six deer in total.

754
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,199
Insane.

755
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:27,480
I've told you.

756
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,280
The place belonged to me.

757
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,119
It's fine if you stay here well.

758
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,960
Why do you try to mess around with me?

759
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,000
Tell me,

760
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,320
why do you want

761
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,199
Mr. Xu's body?
