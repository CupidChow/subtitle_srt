2
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:55,879
Dad.

3
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,000
Holly. Lingxi.

4
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,319
There you off.

5
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,439
Yes, Miss.

6
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,319
Let's go.

7
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,680
Dad.

8
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,960
Why are you here?

9
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,199
I plan to

10
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,360
address the issues in Hanjing

11
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,439
before I go back to Su City.

12
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,840
This is your method?

13
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,479
If I know you will use
such a despicable way

14
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,400
to protect the Lu Family,

15
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
I would rather risk my life

16
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,879
to stop you from going astray.

17
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,919
Although I, Lu Qingzhou,

18
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,680
am a merchant,

19
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,560
I dare to say

20
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,599
I earn every single cent with clean hands.

21
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,039
I make every step

22
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,400
fair and square.

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,479
But you...

24
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,520
Dad.

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,520
I couldn't help it.

26
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,800
I had no other choice.

27
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,560
(Piss off!)

28
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,759
(You all piss off!)

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,759
(Try to harm me!)

30
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,400
(You all try to harm me!)

31
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,319
Listen.

32
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,000
That is your sister.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,520
Yes.

34
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,800
She is my sister.

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,879
But she wants me to die.

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,599
I would rather you do tit for tat.

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,120
If she wants to kill you,

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,400
then you kill her.

39
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,560
You shouldn't disgrace her like this.

40
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,520
She deserves it

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,319
for her scandal.

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,639
But you are her elder sister,

43
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,360
now that you noticed it in advance,

44
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,199
why didn't you stop her

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,960
but made great use of it?

46
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,919
Don't you know

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,879
how important virginity is

48
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,319
to a woman?

49
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,680
As she doesn't care about it herself,

50
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,360
why should I cover it up for her?

51
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,800
You are chopping logic.

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,479
She didn't marry the prince for long,

53
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,080
but she has done

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,360
such a ridiculous thing.

55
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,759
If we keep indulging her,

56
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,439
the entire Lu Family has to die with her.

57
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,120
I will never

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,280
let it happen.

59
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,080
You.

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,000
Dad,

61
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,439
I don't intend to defend myself.

62
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,159
Before I made such decision,

63
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,400
I have expected it would happen one day.

64
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,840
I will never regret

65
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,560
today's result.

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,759
Then kneel down here.

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,920
Don't get up

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,360
until you figure it out.

69
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,519
Anran.

70
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,279
Anran.

71
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,319
Here. Take it slow.

72
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,120
Mu Chuan.

73
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,319
Mu Chuan.

74
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,639
As she fell down suddenly,
I am sorry that we didn't serve you well.

75
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,319
Don't know what winds bring

76
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,600
Your Highness Prince Qi here
late at night?

77
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,759
The Lu Family recently
has entangled in a multitude of things.

78
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,439
She must have to mull over them.

79
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,199
So, I didn't pay a visit.

80
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,600
But it's raining hard today.

81
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,360
I worry about the grapes in the yard,

82
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,160
thus I came to have a look.

83
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,720
Are

84
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,639
the green grapes in the yard

85
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,720
grown by Your Highness?

86
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes.

87
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,560
The girl loves grapes indeed.

88
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,759
Very thoughtful of Your Highness.

89
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,720
The medicine is boiled in the kitchen.

90
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,879
I have to watch it in person.

91
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Your Highness Prince Qi,

92
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,759
I will take my leave now.

93
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
Mu Chuan.

94
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,759
Alright. Don't worry.

95
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,560
Anran is fine.

96
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,839
The doctor said

97
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,480
it's because she has been preoccupied

98
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,720
and exhuasted for long.

99
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,399
As a result, the evil qi got in her body.

100
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,360
She will be all right

101
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
as she conditions her body.

102
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,279
Preoccupied.

103
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,879
Exhuasted for long.

104
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,919
Anran

105
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,279
is too competitive.

106
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,159
She bears
all the responsibilities herself.

107
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,480
I don't know what you two

108
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,320
fought for.

109
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,200
But I know one thing.

110
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,759
Anything she does

111
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,720
is all for the Lu Family.

112
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,480
Sometimes,

113
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,519
I really hope that

114
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,159
she could consider herself for a bit.

115
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,840
However, her minds hold

116
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,720
too many things

117
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,799
except herself.

118
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,240
You awake.

119
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,519
Still hot.

120
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,799
Rest for longer.

121
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,080
During the tranquil days,

122
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,039
I can win more time

123
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,639
if I sleep less.

124
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,960
The things happened recently

125
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,440
are worrying enough for you.

126
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,320
Never mind.

127
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,879
Your mom and dad are here.

128
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,480
You can rest more.

129
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,440
It is rare

130
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,879
to see you tame.

131
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,159
I can't see it when you recover.

132
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,519
If Your Highness Prince Qi likes it,

133
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,480
then I could just stay ill.

134
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Don't talk nonsense.

135
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,679
When all the things end,

136
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,879
I will go back to Su City.

137
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,320
Afterwards,

138
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,919
I will never get back here.

139
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,039
The Lu Family has been
encumbered by its fame.

140
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,360
Maybe the present

141
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,399
is the most perfect finale.

142
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,399
I will go find you

143
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,639
after the water conservation

144
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,240
spreads the entire Dahan.

145
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,519
Attend my spring ploughing ceremony
tomorrow.

146
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,200
Your Highness.

147
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,120
A new batch of salt and iron

148
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,120
will arrive soon.

149
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,519
The Hanjing port nowadays

150
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,519
is badly managed.

151
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,080
Several groups of people are
fishing in troubled waters.

152
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,120
Do take care.

153
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,039
Don't be found out.

154
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,600
Yes, Your Highness.

155
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,080
Anthing else?

156
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,200
Mr. Cai,

157
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,120
Cai Wangjin wants to meet you.

158
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,519
I apologize.

159
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,759
There you off.

160
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,919
Yes, Your Highness.

161
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,440
Dad. Mom.

162
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,559
Anran.

163
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,440
Your mom

164
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,919
made efforts

165
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,039
to make the supplement for you.

166
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,519
Don't forget to drink it.

167
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
I remember it.

168
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,639
What are you leaving for?

169
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,600
I still have to address the issues

170
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,279
of some businesses.

171
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,120
I am going to take a look.

172
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,759
Let me go with you

173
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:31,919
after I change my clothes.

174
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Untidy.

175
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Don't come with me.

176
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,960
Mom, thank you.

177
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,039
Silly girl, thanks for what?

178
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,120
No grudges last over a night

179
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,600
between fathers and daughters.

180
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,759
He couldn't stand it any longer.

181
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,960
It's nothing to do with me.

182
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,080
Have a seat.
Let me check if you are good.

183
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,399
Do I look good?

184
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,720
Yes.

185
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,720
Girls make up and dress up
for their admirers.

186
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,720
I didn't expect

187
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,240
you would do this one day.

188
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,320
What a pity.

189
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,759
I can't do it though I am willing to.

190
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,159
Give me. Give me.

191
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,000
You excel in every aspect,

192
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,120
but for only one thing,

193
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
you will never rival

194
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,080
other girls in the city.

195
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,320
Mom.

196
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,200
I stay on ships all day.

197
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,200
Why need I comb?

198
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,080
I will look like a nut when winds come.

199
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,759
I can't comb even if I learn it.

200
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,720
Then why are you

201
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
anxious to comb this?

202
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,120
I am going to meet my boy.

203
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,559
Don't fret gossip?

204
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,639
No big deal.

205
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,480
I even prepared him

206
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,679
for a huge surprise.

207
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,480
I fret he will linger over it for long.

208
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,919
You are even not shy.

209
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,200
Mom.

210
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,279
I have missed too much.

211
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,200
Wasted too much time.

212
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,600
If I still waste my time

213
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,399
on coyness,

214
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,559
I will suffer a great loss.

215
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,559
Sometimes,

216
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,840
I do admire your character.

217
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,639
You know what you want.

218
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,480
Indeed, who says men

219
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,159
should be the first to confess their love.

220
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,879
This was sent

221
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,080
by your dad

222
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,840
when we tied the knot.

223
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,200
I have been carrying it.

224
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,120
Here.

225
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,440
Let me wear it for you.

226
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,639
I give it to you.

227
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,600
So attractive.

228
00:14:58,879 --> 00:14:59,799
Thank you, mom.

229
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,039
His Highness Prince Qing

230
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,480
is gentle.

231
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,519
On that day, his face

232
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,279
looked like he really cares about you.

233
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,320
In this world,

234
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,679
there are many men pursuing you,

235
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,759
but if there is a man

236
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,600
who cares about you wholeheartedly,

237
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,840
he must

238
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,799
understand and support you.

239
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,679
You will be the perfect match.

240
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,679
Get it?

241
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,799
I get it.

242
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,840
If it's going on well today,

243
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,960
invite him to have a dinner tonight.

244
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,200
Get it?

245
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,320
So anxious?

246
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,960
Tomorrow morning,

247
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,679
your dad and I will go back to Su City.

248
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,240
I don't know

249
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,080
when can we see him again.

250
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,080
If we don't have a meal today,

251
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,559
how long should we wait for?

252
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,679
Okay. I will listen to you.

253
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,279
Mom. Thank you.

254
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,360
We will come back

255
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,320
for dinner for sure.

256
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Bad girl.

257
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,639

260
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,679
I also dare to say

261
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
you sweet talk the best

262
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,879
I have ever met.

263
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
I mean it, okay?

264
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,679
I mean it as well.

265
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,320

308

Yes,

309
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,240
and no.

310
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,160
What are you going to say?

311
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,119
Because it is what I tell others

312
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,079
for sure.

313
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,680
So, I said yes.

314
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,519
Then, what is the wrong part?

315
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,240
The first "An"

316
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,519
is from Anran.

317
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,079
I've told you early

318
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,200
the wider world

319
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,480
is where you belong

320
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:18,920
but you

321
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,279
trap yourself

322
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:22,200
in the cage of Hanjing.

323
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,559
I even thought childishly

324
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:26,680
if I can't

325
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,160
drag you out of the cage,

326
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,759
is growing the rice

327
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:31,200
in every field of Dahan

328
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,200
and seeing them take roots and sprout

329
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,759
equivalent to your footprints left

330
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,200
on every inch of the nation?

331
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,119
Therefore, I gave the name

332
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,079
for myself actually.

333
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:45,960
(My old self)

334
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,640
(was imprisoned in the cage instead.)

335
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,039
(Did you)

336
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,480
(feel even uneasier then?)

337
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,000
Did I say something wrong?

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,519
No.

339
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,440
I was thinking

340
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,319
I had the same ears and eyes

341
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,319
as I have now.

342
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,440
Why was I deaf and blind?

343
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,640
What are you saying?

344
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,880
Nothing.

345
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,160
Thank you.

346
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,839
You are so considerate

347
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,599
that it makes me talk nonsense.

00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,400
I will leave for Su City.

351
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,480
Between you and me,

352
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,119
there is more than
the distance from Hanjing to Su City.

353
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,160
With the situation of the Lu Family...

354
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,880
I know.

355
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,599
Backgrounds, life experience,

356
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,319
power and fame in my eyes

357
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,599
are as transient as a fleeting cloud.

358
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,599
I don't care.

359
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,880
My destination is not Hanjing,

360
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,319
but you.

361
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:54,720
Your Highness Prince Qi.

362
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:55,759
When do you think

363
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,319
do we start the ceremony?

364
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,720
May I join you

365
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,759
and make some noises?

366
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,440
Why not?

367
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,400
Let's go.

368
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,880
Miss. Master.

369
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,240
The flower is so beautiful.

370
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,319
What's the rush for?

371
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,240
Madam.

372
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,240
When I made the final handover

373
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,200
at the wharf,

374
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,720
two groups came.

375
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,000
They both said one batch of goods

376
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,839
were theirs.

377
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,039
Made a big scene.

378
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,000
They almost fought.

379
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,160
(Lanyue Pavilion)
The one who has a bill of lading gets it.

380
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,359
Do it by rules.

381
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,799
Why will they fight?

382
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,359
But they both have the bills.

383
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,559
I couldn't tell the truth

384
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,000
in a minute.

385
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Master is dealing with the shops.

386
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:42,839
Let me address it.

387
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:44,559
Well,

388
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,319
don't inform Miss?

389
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,640
No need.

390
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,680
Just a trivial thing. Address it soon.

391
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,160
I have to go back to prepare dinner.

392
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,920
Let's go.

393
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,319
(Pray for favorable weather)
Yell with me.

394
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:58,680
(Pray for a good harvest)
Three!

395
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,640
Three!

396
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:00,880
Two!

397
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,519
Two!

398
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,960
One!

399
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,039
One!

400
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:04,920
Start ploughing!

401
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,559
Start ploughing!

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,440
Grab it. Grab it.

403
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,759
It's all mine.

404
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,440
Don't grab it.

405
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,240
Don't grab it.

406
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,920
Don't grab it.

407
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,200
Don't grab it.

408
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,480
Put it down.

409
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,160
No more grabbing.

410
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,039
Listen to me.

411
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,500
(Lu Guang Tong)

412
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,799
As long as

413
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,160
the Lu Family's Double Fish flags

414
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,519
are still hanging in the ports of Hanjing,

415
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,519
we will never ever

416
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,839
owe one cargo of yours.

417
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,839
If you want to get your goods,

418
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,200
take your bills of lading

419
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
for me to examine one by one.

420
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,640
I am the Lin Family from the west.

421
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,160
I get a batch of herbs arrived today.

422
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,799
Give me your bill of lading.

423
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,920
The Lu Family falls indeed.

424
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,759
They sent a woman to host.

425
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,839
This kind of bill.

426
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,200
I have as many as you want.

427
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,559
Scramble! Scramble now!

428
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:03,839
Master.

429
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,720
Don't grab it.

430
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,440
Don't scramble for it.

431
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,160
Stop it.

432
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,519
Don't grab it.

433
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,359
Don't grab it.

434
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,640
Stop now.

435
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,079
Don't grab it.

436
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,799
Anran.

437
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,440
Don't grab it. Don't grab it.

438
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,480
Don't grab it.

439
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,119
Don't grab it.

440
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:45,839
Don't grab it.

441
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,119
Hurry up.

442
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,920
Stop it.

443
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,279
Stop it.

444
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,839
Stop it.

445
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,200
Don't grab it.

446
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,079
Stop it.

447
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,359
Stop it.

448
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,640
Don't grab it.

449
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,000
Put it down.

450
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,240
Put it down.

451
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:27,519
Put it down now.

452
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,160
Don't scramble for it.

453
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:39,880
Stop.

454
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,400
Put it down.

455
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,079
You.

456
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,440
Master.

457
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:24,359
Mu Chuan.

458
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,000
I told you before.

459
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,400
Wait for me for some time.

460
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,720
Today, I want to tell you...

461
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,960
Miss! The fat is in the fire!

462
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,600
(Lu Guang Tong)

463
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:04,839
Mom.

464
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,960
Mom.

465
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,599
Mom.

466
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,119
- Anran's here.
- Mom.

467
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,359
(Impossible!)

468
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,279
(Impossible!)

469
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,279
(I have managed to change all.)

470
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,759
I am to blame.

471
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,920
I didn't protect Madam well.

472
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,720
I am to blame.

473
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,359
Who is it?

474
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,160
Who put my mom

475
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,519
in the casket?

476
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,600
(In Memory of Shen Lanxi)

477
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:25,920
Did you find a doctor?

478
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,079
If one doctor can't help,

479
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,680
you can find the doctors
in the whole Hanjing.

480
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,279
If the doctors in Hanjing can't help,

481
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,920
you can find the doctors
in the entire Dahan.

482
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,720
Go. Go find a doctor.

483
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,920
Go find a doctor.

484
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,119
I beg you. Go now.

485
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:53,759
Miss.

486
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,000
Miss.

487
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,680
Dad.

488
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,400
Anran.

489
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,440
Dad.

490
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,720
She passed away.

491
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,759
Dad, you are talking nonsense.

492
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,119
Mu Chuan.

493
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,599
You leave.

494
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,720
Leave!

495
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,700
(In Memory of Shen Lanxi)

496
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,599
The Lu Family

497
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,559
that cuckolded Prince Qing

498
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,279
some days ago

499
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,880
is in trouble again today.

500
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,160
I heard it.

501
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,039
Rioting in the port.

502
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:45,599
Rioting?

503
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,960
Madam Lu was beaten to death.

504
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,000
It is said that

505
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,680
she was going to
leave for Su City tomorrow.

506
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,519
Really unfortunate.

507
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,480
The hostess Lu Anran

508
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,160
should pray to God afterwards.

509
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,480
Forget it. Forget it. Cheers.

510
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,039
(Prisoner.)
Cheers.

511
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,119
Your Highness.

512
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,160
Your Highness.

513
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,119
Say it if you want.

514
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,319
Don't mumble.

515
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,640
This is passed

516
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
from Cai Wangjin.

517
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,720
I really didn't expect

518
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,440
you still keep the dagger.

519
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,839
I will never forgert

520
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,519
the second life Your Highness gave me.

521
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,920
Hands off. Hands off.

522
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,119
Hands off.

523
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,799
Give it to me.

524
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,680
Give me.

525
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:37,640
Stop.

526
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,319
A real man stands in the world.

527
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,440
I will look down on you

528
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,119
if you steal food from the dying.

529
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,960
If you want to have meals,
make them with your own hands.

530
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,279
If you don't have

531
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,319
even such bravery,

532
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,759
you are worse than being dead.

533
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,599
Easier said than done, Master.

534
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,160
Civilians like me

535
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,160
have no power.

536
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:06,920
We are just sitting ducks.

537
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,559
If we meet robbers again,

538
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,799
it's still hard for us to escape death.

539
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:53,319
Report!

540
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,240
Your Highness,

541
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:58,039
a person

542
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:58,960
like a beggar

543
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,039
says he must see you.

544
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,359
We can't drive him away however we try.

545
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:03,559
Let me in.

546
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:04,359
Yes, Your Highness.

547
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,279
(Get in.)

548
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:12,880
Greet Your Highness.

549
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,679
It's you.

550
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,840
Thank you for
Your Highness's enlightment.

551
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,400
Thus, I didn't descend to

552
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,360
a dead body,

553
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,599
discarding my dignity for food.

554
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,599
What is in the bag?

555
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,079
A head.

556
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,239
My whole family suffered from exile

557
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,800
only because I forgot to
avoid ancestors' names

558
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,119
when I sat the Imperial Examination.

559
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,760
On the way, we met bandits.

560
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
I was the only survival

561
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
and suffer till now.

562
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,440
Your Highness's words

563
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,719
encouraged me to take revenge.

564
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,480
I will never forget the favor.

565
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,079
If Your Highness doesn't mind,

566
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,159
I am willing to work for Your Highness,

567
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,920
going through fire,

568
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,800
with the rest of my life.

569
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,440
Do you think

570
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,920
with your part of little finger

571
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,239
and the dagger,

572
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,360
will I

573
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,559
forgive you?

574
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,679
Your Highness,

575
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,639
I never thought about

576
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,239
your forgiveness.

577
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,280
The reason why

578
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,360
I try hard to meet Your Highness

579
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,760
is to remind you.

580
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,840
Do watch out for Lu Anran.

581
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,440
What do you mean?

582
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,639
Hasn't Your Highness ever thought that

583
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,159
since Lu Anran

584
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,480
formed an alliance with us,

585
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,039
she seemed to
put her shoulder to the wheel.

586
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,119
But all of our plans

587
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,440
flopped every time.

588
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,679
Is it because

589
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,639
we didn't plan well,

590
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,320
or someone tripped us up?

591
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,559
Start to bite Lu Anran now?

592
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,039
Do you have any evidence?

593
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,719
I don't have.

594
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,920
But it can only prove

595
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,320
she takes care of things neatly

596
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,960
without a trace.

597
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,440
Cai Wangjin,

598
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,639
maybe you don't know yet.

599
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,880
The Lu Family now

600
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,840
has no place in Hanjing.

601
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:00,639
And there is no connection

602
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,079
between the Lu Family and me.

603
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:03,960
At this moment,

604
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,719
you sow discord between her and me.

605
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,000
It has no help

606
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,960
to your situation.

607
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,039
What I said

608
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,360
is not for sowing discord.

609
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,760
The more neatly the clues vanish,

610
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,079
the stranger she is.

611
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,039
The so-called barefoot doctor

612
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:24,000
went away

613
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,920
after he cured Lu Anran.

614
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,880
No one has seen him in Su City afterwards.

615
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:29,119
And for Chai Guang.

616
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,920
The jailor

617
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,039
checked the room he left.

618
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
He found the iron chains

619
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,800
were cut by an edge tool.

620
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:35,840
And when I threw him

621
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,760
in the prison,

622
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,800
I have searched him.

623
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,440
He couldn't have an edge tool.

624
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,519
And for these two,

625
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,559
they were missed

626
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,119
or died.

627
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,760
Both tell no tales.

628
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,840
For the team of secret guards I sent

629
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,760
to kill the chief,

630
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,639
no one is alive.

631
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,519
I verified

632
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,159
wounds on their bodies

633
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,400
were made by the Qinghe Gang.

634
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:57,719
And the scene

635
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:59,679
left the trace of a mine bombing.

636
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:00,880
Your Highness,

637
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,280
although

638
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,000
every single case

639
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,480
can't point to Lu Anran directly,

640
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,480
but all of these

641
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,239
relate to her indirectly.

642
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,159
It can't be a coincidence.

643
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,639
If what you mentioned is true,

644
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,440
then I have a question.

645
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,280
She and I are closely interwined,

646
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,360
riding and dying together.

647
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,719
What benefits her

648
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,679
if she ruins my plans again and again.

649
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,960
As for this,

650
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,719
I didn't figure it out.

651
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,760
But at the moment

652
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,480
when Ms. Xiao opened the door and went in,

653
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,360
a possibility

654
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,320
suddenly stroke me.

655
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,440
If it is true,

656
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,840
Lu Anran is so terrible.

657
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,840
Since Lu Anran plotted

658
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,480
to make Lu Xinran marry you,

659
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,960
everything she did is,

660
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,239
at whatever cost,

661
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
to get the Lu Family

662
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,079
out of the political predicament.

663
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,519
Mom.

664
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,360
I have made strenuous efforts

665
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,719
but I still failed to save you back.

666
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,159
Could you tell me

667
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,119
what's the use of all this?

668
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:57,400
Anran.

669
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,199
Mu Chuan.

670
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,880
I am sorry.

671
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,280
You don't have to apologize to me.

672
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,199
I am not angry.

673
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,840
Nor to others.

674
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,360
All of it is not your fault.

675
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:06,800
In this world,

676
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,880
there are many living in beds of roses.

677
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,400
But why do I live in
a bed of thorns alone?

678
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,559
If I did something wrong,

679
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,480
God could

680
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,119
condemn me alone.

681
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,800
Why does he punish my family?

682
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,400
Don't be afraid.

683
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,440
It will get better.

684
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,360
But I got such a worse result

685
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,800
after my endeavors for long.

686
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:45,840
How hard should I work

687
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,320
to make it right?

688
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,639
It will definitely get better.

689
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,199
Definitely.
