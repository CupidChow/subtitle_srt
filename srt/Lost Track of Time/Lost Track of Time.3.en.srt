=Lost Track of Time=
=Episode 3=

2
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Your Majesty.

3
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,000
Here's your medicine.

4
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,760
Your Majesty.

5
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,120
His Majesty passed away!

6
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,240
Ninth brother,

7
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,560
now we're each other's

8
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,840
only family

9
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,560
in the world.

10
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,879
Lingxi.

11
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,520
Lingxi.

12
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,400
Lingxi.

13
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,800
Princess.

14
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,360
You're awake.

15
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,039
How long did I sleep?

16
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,360
Almost a month,

17
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,360
on and off.

18
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,800
Wedelia wallichii Less really works.

19
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,800
Wedelia wallichii Less?

20
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
His Highness Ninth Prince got it for you

21
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,039
despite hardships.

22
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,800
Without it,

23
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,199
I'm afraid I won't see you anymore.

24
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,719
Yun.

25
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,039
Yun.

26
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,240
No.

27
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,800
You're still weak, Princess.

28
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,039
Don't get up yet.

29
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,919
Young Master was buried.

30
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,160
Buried?

31
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,879
I wasn't even there

32
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,240
when he was buried.

33
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,839
It's all my fault.

34
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,959
I encouraged him to fight in the war.

35
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,199
No.

36
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
Prince Yi and Qin Yekuo

37
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,800
were to blame.

38
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,519
But rest assured, Princess.

39
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,879
His highness has
revenged for Young Master.

40
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,639
Where is he?

41
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,759
The Emperor was enraged by Prince Yi,

42
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,040
fell seriously ill,

43
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,439
and died three days ago.

44
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,800
The court is now in a mess.

45
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,839
His highness has to maintain order.

46
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,399
Don't worry.

47
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,240
He'll come here later in the day.

48
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,959
How come?

49
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,879
He'll succeed as the Emperor

50
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,279
in three days.

51
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:04,879
Your Highness.

52
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,600
It should be His Highness.

53
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,319
Princess.

54
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,600
You didn't have your shoes on.

55
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,560
Good.

56
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,839
Good to know you're awake.

57
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,079
I didn't expect Fourth brother

58
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,160
to be so cruel.

59
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,240
I'm sorry for what happened

60
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,160
to Yun.

61
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,800
It's my fault.

62
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,759
I'm so sorry.

63
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,199
I promise,

64
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,759
from now on,

65
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,079
I'll protect you and your family

66
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,720
with my life.

67
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,079
OK.

68
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,200
(First Year of Jinghe)

69
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:03,959
There.

70
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,519
Make a courtesy call

71
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,680
to my natural mother.

72
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,000
Mother?

73
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,240
I haven't told you before.

74
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,079
My natural mother

75
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,199
was not Consort Liang.

76
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,680
She used my mother to

77
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,920
become the consort.

78
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,240
But killed her

79
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,959
afterwards

80
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,720
with poisoned wine

81
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,639
and threw her body

82
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,120
into a well.

83
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,720
I was only a child

84
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,120
when I saw it happen.

85
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,279
I couldn't do anything.

86
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,439
Don't be sad, Your Majesty.

87
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,720
It's not your fault.

88
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,399
Now I'm the Emperor.

89
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,560
But all I could do

90
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,000
was to find her remains

91
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,480
and bury her properly.

92
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,639
And put a memorial tablet

93
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,920
in my own chamber.

94
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,360
I couldn't confer a posthumous title

95
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
and let the world know.

96
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:10,759
Even less

97
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,439
bury her in the ancestral temple.

98
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,600
At least

99
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,839
she's no longer

100
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,240
a ghost roaming around.

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,079
When Qingming Festival comes,

102
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
we can burn incense and pray for her.

103
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,639
She will be pleased.

104
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,399
Mother.

105
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,639
All hardships have passed.

106
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,159
Mu Ze has now assumed
the supreme position.

107
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,799
In the future,

108
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,200
he will be an Emperor

109
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,120
loved by all people.

110
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,960
You may rest in peace.

111
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,879
I should

112
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,360
thank you.

113
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,100
(Chinese New Year's Eve
Third Year of Jinghe)

114
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,559
Father, Mother.

115
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,440
Don't have too much tea at night.

116
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,679
You'll have a hard time falling asleep.

117
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,759
Why not?

118
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,080
It's New Year's Eve.

119
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,279
We should stay up late anyway.

120
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,759
Your mother's right.

121
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,679
Come on.

122
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,279
OK.

123
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,440
I'll go and make dinner.

124
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,360
Sure.

125
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,159
Your Highness.

126
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,600
You just recovered.

127
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
Don't catch a cold.

128
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,480
Another year passed.

129
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:22,879
Yes.

130
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,559
A new beginning.

131
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,000
Everything's turning for the better.

132
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,559
His Majesty will be delighted to

133
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,200
learn about the news.

134
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,000
Your Highness.

135
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,600
You're here.

136
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,840
I found lots of fireworks
out of the court.

137
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's set them off later.

138
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,279
Sure.

139
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,519
Is His Majesty still occupied with work?

140
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,399
I've sent someone to him.

141
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,639
He tends to

142
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,360
forget everything else when he's at work.

143
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,840
Look.

144
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,120
Here he comes.

145
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,480
Your Majesty.

146
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,159
With the white snow on our hair,

147
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,080
it feels as if we had
turned old together.

148
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,840
We have lots of time before us,

149
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,120
no need to hurry.

150
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,600
Why don't you

151
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,960
remind His Majesty to come early?

152
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,399
Dinner is waiting.

153
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,000
He's been busy.

154
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,679
Today's time for family.

155
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,320
Let's forget about the courtesies.

156
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,240
Come on.

157
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,279
Have dinner together.

158
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,250
Let's go.

159
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,320
Let's go over there.

160
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,639
I'm pregnant.

161
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,120
Really?

162
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,960
Yu has come back to us.

163
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,400
(Two months later)

164
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,080
Your Majesty.

165
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,159
Why did Your Majesty rush to

166
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,440
sentence Doctor Jiang to death?

167
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,879
It shouldn't have
anything to do with you.

168
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,399
Leave it.

169
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,639
Had Mother not taken me in,

170
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,159
I couldn't have lived to this today.

171
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,399
She died all of a sudden.

172
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,000
How could it have nothing to do with me?

173
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
I was close to her, too.

174
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,759
I understand how you feel.

175
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,320
That's why

176
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,200
Jiang Linfu should die

177
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,440
for his treatment mistake.

178
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,440
Mother had always been healthy.

179
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,759
I asked

180
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,840
her maids.

181
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,120
They said for half a month,

182
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
Mother had been feeling hot.

183
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,679
She couldn't sleep and
seemed to have bulimia.

184
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,039
I suspect

185
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,399
there was something wrong

186
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,480
with the food she was served.

187
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,240
You think the food

188
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,320
went wrong.

189
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,919
Well, I'd like to ask you.

190
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,919
What

191
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,600
is it that you really suspect?

192
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,399
Why did Your Majesty
rush to kill Doctor Jiang

193
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,000
skipping all the judicial procedures

194
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,519
and forbidding anyone

195
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,519
from approaching the prison?

196
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,799
Is it because I have been

197
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,240
too easy on you

198
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,039
that you now suspect me like this?

199
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,279
Do I need

200
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,879
to obtain your consent

201
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,360
before sentencing someone?

202
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,759
I didn't mean it.

203
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,879
I just feel that

204
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
three years since Your Majesty
ascended the throne.

205
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,240
I didn't recognize you anymore.

206
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,360
You promised

207
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,720
to treat Prince Yi's men
who succumbed nicely.

208
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,600
But in three years,

209
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,639
they lost their lives

210
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:18,799
one after another

211
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,840
for some

212
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,679
groundless accusations.

213
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:21,960
Going back on your words

214
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,519
is not what Your Majesty used to do.

215
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,799
They conspired against me for Prince Yi

216
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,279
for decades.

217
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,720
Why should I spare their lives?

218
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,960
What about Doctor Jiang and others?

219
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,360
They had been whole-heartedly

220
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,320
helping Your Majesty.

221
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,840
Why should they be subject

222
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,799
to the same fate?

223
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,039
They did something wrong,

224
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,159
so they got punishment.

225
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,720
Was what they did really wrong?

226
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,919
Such quick conviction

227
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,399
makes one disappointed.

228
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,519
How dare you!

229
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,519
Your Majesty

230
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,600
can't even hear a true word now?

231
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,279
I

232
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,440
am kind to you.

233
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But that doesn't mean

234
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
you can doubt me time and time again.

235
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,279
Ninth brother.

236
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Know your position.

237
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,399
Guards.

238
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

239
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,039
Prince Qi

240
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,279
offended the Emperor

241
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,679
with impertinent words.

242
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,679
Lock him up immediately.

243
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,480
Without my permission,

244
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,679
he can't step out of the room.

245
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,519
Yes, Your Majesty.

246
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,480
Can I still call you

247
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,039
Second brother anymore?

248
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,159
Remember,

249
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,559
I'm first your emperor,

250
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,000
then your brother.

251
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:10,720
Your Majesty,

252
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,360
Princess Qi is suspecting something.

253
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
We have to plan

254
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,480
for the next step.

255
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,639
Your Majesty, I know

256
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,960
you keep him alive

257
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,000
because he's your brother.

258
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,440
But if you leave him like that...

259
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,639
Enough.

260
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,039
I know.

261
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,879
I

262
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,759
need to be alone now.

263
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,360
Your Highness.

264
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,840
Please don't give me a hard time.

265
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,360
Without His Majesty's consent,

266
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,720
I can't let you in.

267
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,120
Inside

268
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,720
is the only brother of His Majesty.

269
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,559
He locked his brother up

270
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,640
because he was angry at that moment.

271
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,680
This punishment serves to deter.

272
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,599
Also,

273
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,759
His Majesty forbids Prince Qi

274
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,559
from stepping out,

275
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,359
not anyone from going in.

276
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,079
If you insist on keeping me out,

277
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,200
I'd suspect you're

278
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,519
torturing Prince Qi inside.

279
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,039
Far from the truth, Your Highness.

280
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,359
We don't dare to.

281
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,359
Then let me in.

282
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,359
Your Highness.

283
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,599
Your Highness.

284
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,559
Move.

285
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,200
Your Highness.

286
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,160
Why are you here

287
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,200
at this time?

288
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,400
His Majesty will punish you, too,

289
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,799
if he finds out.

290
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:37,759
Go back.

291
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,480
It's OK.

292
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,640
I'm here

293
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,519
to find out

294
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,599
what exactly happened

295
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,160
that made you two come to this.

296
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
I offended him

297
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,119
due to impulse of the moment.

298
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
Don't worry.

299
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,559
He's always been nice to you.

300
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,759
Everybody knows that

301
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,000
he treats you differently.

302
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,519
You must have found something

303
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,200
that he didn't want to come to light.

304
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,160
That's why he did this to you.

305
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,599
You're overthinking it.

306
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,640
You don't have to hide it from me.

307
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,920
You know me.

308
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:05,720
If I suspect something,

309
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,960
I'd go figure it out.

310
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,359
You don't want me to

311
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,400
walk around while I am pregnant,

312
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,559
do you?

313
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,160
He stopped me

314
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,240
from investigating Mother's death.

315
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,759
You think her death is strange?

316
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,240
Mu Chuan.

317
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
I have no role to play in court,

318
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,880
but I'm not blind, or stupid.

319
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,640
He did a lot of things

320
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,440
after he took the throne.

321
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,319
I know.

322
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,000
I just don't believe it.

323
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,759
But now,

324
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,279
I don't want to lie to myself.

325
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,319
You and I

326
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,480
are his only family now.

327
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:53,960
Only we can

328
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,160
stop him.

329
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,119
If it is out of your power,

330
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,559
keep yourself safe first.

331
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,880
Don't try to save others.

332
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,200
I know.

333
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,200
Take care.

334
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,119
What is the relationship

335
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,559
between you two?

336
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,400
You put aside your own safety.

337
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,359
Threatening the guards

338
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,000
while you're pregnant

339
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,240
just to see him.

340
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,799
What changed you?

341
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,960
Into this authoritative emperor

342
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,000
who forgets about brotherhood,

343
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,920
and can't tell right from wrong.

344
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,640
I'm your husband.

345
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,640
You don't trust me

346
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,720
and trust him instead.

347
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,799
How can I trust you anymore?

348
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,680
I thought that

349
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,079
you did what you did before

350
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,640
because you had no other choice.

351
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,279
But now that you've got what you want,

352
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,720
why do you have to kill them?

353
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,559
What it is that you're afraid of?

354
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,559
If they did something wrong,

355
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,000
they should be punished, even killed.

356
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,279
The royal authority cannot be doubted.

357
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,039
And law

358
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,759
cannot be compromised by emotion.

359
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,440
How impartial.

360
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,160
But you know

361
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,559
Mother's death was strange.

362
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,599
Yet you stopped Prince Qi
from investigating

363
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,839
and killed Doctor Jiang.

364
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,799
He is your trusted subordinate.

365
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,599
When the late emperor was alive,

366
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,119
you even left
heavy responsibilities to him.

367
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,519
If you are sure it's Doctor Jiang's

368
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,319
poor ability

369
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,160
that led to Mother's death,

370
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,799
can I assume

371
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:42,599
that there was something strange

372
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,240
about the late emperor's death, too?

373
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,359
Lu Anran!

374
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,640
Do you hear

375
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,079
what you're talking about?

376
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,160
Consort Xiao is right.

377
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,279
Empress has become

378
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,119
more presumptuous than ever.

379
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,240
You regard my love for you

380
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,319
as rubbish.

381
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,039
How dare you!

382
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,759
How dare me?

383
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,599
If we were Mu Ze and Lu Anran

384
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,920
like ten years ago,

385
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,319
would you say the same thing

386
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,400
to me?

387
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:17,960
Your Majesty,

388
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,359
do you still remember

389
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,319
the ambitious bodyguard in Su City?

390
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,160
I remember,

391
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,440
Lu Anran

392
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,880
used to trust and love me.

393
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,599
She would marry Prince Qing

394
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,279
because of a letter,

395
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,240
even if he had nothing.

396
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,680
But Lu Anran today

397
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,160
suspects me like this.

398
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,559
When did it all change?

399
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,480
Was it

400
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,119
when Mu Chuan gave you the bracelet?

401
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,680
You think I have an
affair with Mu Chuan?

402
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,640
Can you swear to god

403
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,440
that there's nothing between you?

404
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,880
If there is,

405
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,039
I'd be struck by lightening

406
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,720
and die a violent death in every life.

407
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,400
Dare you say the same?

408
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,000
Dare you swear on your life

409
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,559
and your throne

410
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,759
that you never did anything dirty

411
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,759
to get where you are?

412
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,440
Lu Anran!

413
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,880
It's you who pretend not to know others' sincerity

414
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,480
and do the opposite of what you say.

415
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,960
It's you who throw away

416
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,160
your original aspirations.

417
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,359
Before you say I changed

418
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,599
didn't you realize that you are the one

419
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,240
who changed so much?

420
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,119
Shut up!

421
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,400
I made you Empress.

422
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,880
Gave the Lu Family wealth and fame.

423
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,680
This is how you pay me back?

424
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,359
I'm warning you.

425
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,039
From now on,

426
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,079
if you plead

427
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:41,880
for Mu Chuan

428
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,359
or discuss politics another time,

429
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,720
I won't let you off easily.

430
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,559
Is Your Majesty going
to remove my title?

431
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:52,839
Lu Anran!

432
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,599
Listen carefully.

433
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,799
Next time

434
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,200
before you say anything crazy,

435
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,920
think about your family.

436
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,079
Remember,

437
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,880
you're my wife.

438
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,240
Don't forget it.

439
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,160
Your Majesty,

440
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,720
river canals are critical
to the country.

441
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,039
They should be under
your administration.

442
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,319
Now time's ripe

443
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
for taking back

444
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,119
all that should have been yours.

445
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,000
Empress conducted
the Empress Dowager's funeral service

446
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,880
and delayed the burial

447
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,519
on the ground that

448
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,240
it was improper to bury the Empress Dowager,
who was a Buddhist,

449
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
on Buddha's birthday.

450
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,200
What does it mean?

451
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,119
Empress wants to investigate

452
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,319
the cause of the Empress Dowager's death?

453
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,359
It means

454
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,440
she is starting to suspect me.

455
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,519
Your Majesty.

456
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,160
Then the Lu Family shouldn't live.

457
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,440
The Dahan dynasty
was built near the rivers.

458
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,079
But now the canals across the country

459
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,319
are all in the hands

460
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,720
of a merchant.

461
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,000
Isn't it a joke

462
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,279
to the world?

463
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,079
Understood, Your Majesty.

464
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,550
(Hanguang Palace)

465
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,000
Your Highness.

466
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,160
It's cold.

467
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,240
Why are you here?

468
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,920
Come.

469
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,359
Come in to get warm.

470
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,960
(Lin, Son of Xiao Jingque)
You are so nice, Your Highness.

471
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,759
My mother made this. It's yours now.

472
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,160
The rabbit she folds

473
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,839
is unique in the world.

474
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,799
If you press its tail,

475
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,960
it can jump.

476
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,480
Sister,

477
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,079
the Emperor has taken a move.

478
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,839
This time, the Lu Family

479
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,880
won't escape.

480
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,240
Lu Anran

481
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,079
always intervenes when she shouldn't.

482
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,599
Now she's infuriated
the Emperor for real.

483
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,200
Deserves it.

484
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,680
Your Highness.

485
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,480
What...

486
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,240
Lu Anran!

487
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,799
Lin!

488
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,039
Answer me.

489
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,000
Did you have anything to do

490
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,720
with Yu's death?

491
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,240
Tell me.

492
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,839
Your sister testified,

493
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:21,880
didn't she?

494
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,880
I wasn't there.

495
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,039
But where Yu had the accident

496
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,160
there was a paper rabbit

497
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,759
the same as those you made.

498
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,759
So what?

499
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,839
I'm not the only person

500
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,960
who can make it.

501
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:31,680
Yes.

502
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,519
You're not the only one who
can make a paper rabbit.

503
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,400
But no one else can make

504
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,960
a paper rabbit that jumps.

505
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:38,079
Are you still denying it?

506
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,640
Mom.

507
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,160
It hurts.

508
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,079
Lin.

509
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,160
Lu Anran.

510
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,920
You want to kill my son?

511
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,240
Kill me?

512
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,440
And even His Majesty?

513
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,400
What do you mean?

514
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,519
He knows it was me

515
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
who killed your son all this time.

516
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,359
But what can he do about me?

517
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,440
You're no more than

518
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,160
a tool to him.

519
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,359
The son of a tool

520
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,119
is of little importance.

521
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,480
Lu Anran.

522
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,119
You're done for.

523
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,279
Your entire family is done for.

524
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:39,119
His Majesty is ordering

525
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,759
immediate execution of your family.

526
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,279
Go ask him yourself.

527
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,519
It's impossible.

528
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,200
What're you saying?

529
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,799
You better

530
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
face the reality.

531
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,319
Tell you.

532
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:00,880
I received the order to confiscate
your family property yesterday.

533
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:02,920
Search it.

534
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,359
Don't move. Stand still.

535
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,519
Father of Empress, how greedy.

536
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,960
The Lu Family's wealth can
rival that of a country.

537
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,880
You sold arms secretly

538
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,240
in the North.

539
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,039
The confidential letter is here.

540
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,519
Do you plead guilty?

541
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,039
Nonsense.

542
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,839
I've never done it.

543
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,480
What guilt is there?

544
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,279
We'll know

545
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,279
when His Majesty makes the judgment.

546
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,559
Take him away.

547
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,519
Yes.

548
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:34,640
Move.

549
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,720
Your father is now locked up in prison.

550
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,359
Also,

551
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,200
His Majesty

552
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,039
bribed a general

553
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,599
in Qin Yekuo's army,

554
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,279
and asked him to stamp
the seal on the letter.

555
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,640
That's why Qin Yekuo's army couldn't

556
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,960
save your brother in time.

557
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,000
His Majesty

558
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,160
sacrificed the entire vanguard

559
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,400
to frame Qin Yekuo

560
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,240
and defeat Prince Yi,

561
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,519
so that he could

562
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,200
take the throne.

563
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,279
Lu Qingzhou

564
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,839
secretly sold arms in the North

565
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,039
to enemies and committed treason.

566
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,519
That's the first crime.

567
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,160
Used his status as the Father of Empress

568
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,920
to monopolize salt and iron.

569
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,400
That's the second crime.

570
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,200
He hoarded food and
supplies for the military

571
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,720
and bid up price.

572
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,279
That's the third crime.

573
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:44,839
The evidence is clear

574
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
and the conviction stands.

575
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,720
His whole family

576
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,839
should be executed.

577
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,359
Yet

578
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,240
Empress...

579
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,440
Empress

580
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,160
has been in the palace

581
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,240
and thus knows nothing about it.

582
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,839
She should be exempt from punishment.

583
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:07,319
Your Majesty.

584
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,359
Don't let your feelings
interfere with the decision.

585
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,039
He's right, Your Majesty.

586
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,519
Don't let emotions blind you.

587
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,160
Don't, Your Highness.

588
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,160
His Majesty is in an
official discussion.

589
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Why is the Empress here?

590
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,319
At the court?

591
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Is it true you're executing
my whole family?

592
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,279
Your Highness.

593
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,599
You shouldn't be here.

594
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,480
What do you come here for?

595
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,319
Since you became the Emperor,

596
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,279
you killed every single person
from the previous dynasty.

597
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,799
Demoted people who
used to work for Prince Yi.

598
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,359
Held high all those

599
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,160
who helped you

600
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,319
but then threw them off.

601
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,039
Is it because you suspect them

602
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,480
or because they know

603
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,680
too many secrets of yours?

604
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,400
I need time alone with the Empress.

605
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:52,920
Everyone,

606
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,400
you may leave for now.

607
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

608
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:05,920
Now,

609
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:07,960
don't lie to me anymore.

610
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,160
I have three questions for you.

611
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,759
Swear on your throne,

612
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:12,759
and answer me.

613
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,400
First,

614
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,319
are you taking out

615
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,839
the Lu Family

616
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,599
to recover Lu's ports and fleets?

617
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,119
Anran.

618
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,200
Canals are crucial to a country.

619
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
Lu Family's control

620
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,400
of the water transport

621
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,240
has gradually

622
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,640
grown to a point

623
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,920
where no one can rival.

624
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,960
I

625
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,599
have to act.

626
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,160
Just answer me yes or no.

627
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,240
Yes.

628
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,079
Second,

629
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,400
was the demise of the vanguard
headed by Yun

630
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,839
part of your plan?

631
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,519
To take down Prince Yi,

632
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,039
it was the best opportunity.

633
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,319
Yun just happened

634
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,960
to be in the troop.

635
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:02,920
Happened to?

636
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,119
The death of an ordinary general

637
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,000
couldn't be as sensational

638
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,400
as that of the
brother-in-law of a prince.

639
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:10,480
Only his death

640
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,480
would make the late emperor

641
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,039
and all the officials

642
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,640
furious about what Prince Yi did.

643
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,680
Take it to the extremes if necessary.

644
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,799
That's what you once told me.

645
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,279
I had no other choice.

646
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,119
Third,

647
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,039
you know Xiao Jingque

648
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,440
killed Yu

649
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,960
all this time,

650
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,079
don't you?

651
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,160
Say it!

652
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,319
I didn't have a firm backing,

653
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:53,039
while Xiao Ying had an important army.

654
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:53,720
I couldn't venture

655
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,319
to hurt his sister.

656
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,799
Lu Anran.

657
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:18,960
Mu Ze.

658
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,000
Have you ever loved me?

659
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,680
Of course I have.

660
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,759
You love your throne more.

661
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,480
Your Highness.

662
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,760
Why are you crying?

663
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:38,599
Your Highness.

664
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:41,119
Don't be too sad.

665
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
It's not good for your health.

666
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,199
I'm fine.

667
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,800
With nothing to care about.

668
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,119
Your Highness.

669
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Tomorrow is the execution day.

670
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,920
Who can save the Master?

671
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,280
Ms. Xinran.

672
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,079
Ms. Xinran, you finally came.

673
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,519
Help Her Highness

674
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,280
to plead before His Majesty.

675
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,079
I'm afraid there won't be

676
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,920
any second daughter of the Lu Family.

677
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,599
Your Highness.

678
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,960
What are you saying?

679
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:24,679
Your Highness.

680
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,320
Lingxi.

681
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,440
Give us a moment.

682
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,079
Lady Nation Protection

683
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,599
must have something to say to me.

684
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,079
Clever you.

685
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,360
Guessed it right away.

686
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,559
Exactly.

687
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,480
The evidence found in the Lu's Mansion

688
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,639
was my doing.

689
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,199
And all those

690
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:54,320
commercial ships loaded with arms

691
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,960
were arranged by Second uncle and me

692
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,119
just to frame Father.

693
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,039
Xinran.

694
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,239
Why did you do this?

695
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,719
When I found accidently

696
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,800
that His Majesty and Cai Wangjin

697
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,760
intended to take down the Lu Family,

698
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,960
I made the decision.

699
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:15,360
Between the Lu Family
and the Royal Family,

700
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,159
of course I chose the latter.

701
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:28,199
And it proved

702
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,639
the right choice.

703
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Now

704
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,440
I'm the respected Lady
Nation Protection.

705
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,440
And you,

706
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,039
you're the removed Empress

707
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:44,280
even a dog wouldn't want to come near.

708
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Lu Xinran.

709
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,519
Aren't you afraid of karma?

710
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,199
Lu Anran.

711
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,719
You were born nobler.

712
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,400
But I won

713
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,760
in every other way.

714
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,679
You'll go to hell first.

715
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,199
Lu Xinran.

716
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,599
How dare you touch her!

717
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,599
I'm gonna kill...

718
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,800
Lingxi.

719
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,599
Lingxi.

720
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:25,960
Lingxi.

721
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,199
Lingxi.

722
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:32,760
Lingxi.

723
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,079
Your Highness.

724
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,880
Lu Xinran.

725
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,800
Why?

726
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,920
Lu Anran.

727
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,199
You lost.

728
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,800
You lost everything.

729
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,000
Now

730
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,320
I can tell you

731
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
one more thing.

732
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,960
Remember the poisoned walnut crisp?

733
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,079
They were meant for you.

734
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,960
You killed

735
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,320
your own mother.

736
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:41,400
Execute the 46 people
of the Lu Family now!

737
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,719
Power and wealth

738
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,559
are as fragile as bubbles.

739
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:30,320
How many people did you kill,

740
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,599
how much blood was shed

741
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:33,880
to get you to the supreme position.

742
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:39,519
Had I not followed you onto this path,

743
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,440
how would I become

744
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,320
your accomplice,

745
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,679
and came to this?

746
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,920
Burn.

747
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,280
Let it all burn.

748
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,199
Let this palace

749
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:00,800
be buried with those innocent lives.

750
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,519
Mu Ze.

751
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:25,199
You even murdered

752
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:26,440
your own brother.

753
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,079
Miss, how are you feeling?

754
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,960
Miss, Miss.

755
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,440
Oh no.

756
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,719
Miss is dazed by the bombing.

757
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:47,639
What do we do?

758
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:49,400
It's her hair-pinning ceremony tomorrow.

759
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,719
What do we do?

760
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,320
My hair-pinning ceremony?
