2
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,359
You don't go back to your workshop

3
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,120
after the meeting.

4
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,920
Do you need to talk to me?

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,680
I want to report one thing.

6
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:47,920
Say it.

7
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,799
Some days ago,

8
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,480
Lu Qingzhou of the Lu Family was framed

9
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,840
to connect the North secretly.

10
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,319
But after my investigation,

11
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,319
I found it was done
by Lu Xinran, his daughter,

12
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,719
deliberately.

13
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,719
Please Your Majesty

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
do the justice

15
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,719
for Master Lu.

16
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,039
I heard of the issue.

17
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,319
Isn't Prince Qing looking into it?

18
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,039
Why it's you

19
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,120
who nose out something instead?

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,560
I happened to find it.

21
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,000
Actually, Lu Xinran

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,800
wasn't insane at all.

23
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,400
She just had a grudge

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,479
and wanted to take revenge.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,000
As Your Majesty is perspicacious,

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,080
you will know once check.

27
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Where is

28
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,159
Lu Xinran now?

29
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,039
She jumped to her death.

30
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,800
Therefore,

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
no evidence?

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,479
Yes, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,080
This case is no more than

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,400
a result of a family intrigue.

35
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,560
A letter alone

36
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,759
can't prove anything.

37
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,759
The sisters harmed and tripped up

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,479
each other.

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,840
But is it because
the sisters of the Lu Family

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,439
try to fight desperatedly,

41
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,520
or,

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,360
speak the truth from their hearts

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,639
by the grudge?

44
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,800
Do you make it clear?

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
Miss,

46
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,199
time to take your medicine.

47
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,680
Just put here. I will take it later.

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,520
Lu Xinran's body

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,360
has been sent to Su City

50
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,520
and buried with her mother.

51
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,159
Don't know how dad is going in prison.

52
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,520
Miss, don't worry.

53
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,879
His Highness Prince Qi

54
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,360
went to the imperial court
early this morning.

55
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,520
He will manage to find a way

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,439
to save Master.

57
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,319
Before His Highness left,

58
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,919
he asked me to tell you for sure

59
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,680
that he will get everything covered.

60
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,759
Maybe there will be a turnaround.

61
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,080
For the turnaround,

62
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,159
I fret I may have to

63
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,400
pay a price for it.

64
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,560
How about this?

65
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,719
As long as the Lu Family

66
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,520
hands over their shipping business

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,280
to Dahan,

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,759
I will take it as a farce.

69
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:53,960
Your Majesty,

70
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,639
aren't you taking advantage
of their difficulty?

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,560
Chuan,

72
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,400
a tiny merchant

73
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,560
masters the Dahan Dynasty's

74
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,800
lifeline of waterways.

75
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,400
Nowadays,

76
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,039
even the royal family
needs to rely on the Lu Family

77
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,800
to ship its goods.

78
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
How can I turn a blind eye?

79
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,439
But if Dahan boasts such talents,

80
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,839
why should we care if they are the royal

81
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,639
or civilians?

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,480
We all are Dahan's people

83
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,639
and contribute for its own good.

84
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,120
Your Majesty,

85
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
if we grab with power like this,

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,319
it's really unfair to the Lu Family.

87
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,319
Starting from scratch,

88
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,399
the Lu Family achieves today's success

89
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,439
through ups and downs.

90
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,839
If we treat them like this

91
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,399
only to sit back and enjoy
their hard-won profits,

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,879
it will really disappoint

93
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,839
businessmen around the nation.

94
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,959
This is the emperor.

95
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,160
His Majesty covets the Lu Family for long.

96
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,040
And now

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
he has such an opportunity.

98
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,000
How could he let it go?

99
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,600
Second Brother,

100
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,279
Lu Xinran is dead.

101
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:11,680
For this case,

102
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,879
there is no culprit to plead guilty.

103
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,800
But you met her last night.

104
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,000
You must know

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,720
what she has done.

106
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,079
Can you

107
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,079
enter the imperial court with me

108
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,680
and meet His Majesty?

109
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,399
Do the justice for the Lu Family

110
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,319
as the evidence.

111
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,560
Who can change

112
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,199
what His Majesty decides?

113
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
Moreover, the Lu Family

114
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
rules the entire waterways in Dahan.

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,199
Leaving them to now

116
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,079
is the greatest mercy to them.

117
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,040
Think of it.

118
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,240
Will His Majesty forsake

119
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,120
the chance in his hand easily?

120
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,720
This is grabbing with power!

121
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,319
How can His Majesty

122
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,240
make use of their difficulty?

123
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,800
This is royal politics.

124
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,959
If I were His Majesty,

125
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,079
I would do the same.

126
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,720
Royal politics.

127
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,759
It seems that

128
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,959
I can't have the meal with you now.

129
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,199
I'll take my leave.

130
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,720
Your Highness,

131
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,839
if Miss Lu accepts

132
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,160
His Majesty's arrangement,

133
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,040
we will thus have

134
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,399
Lu Yun, the one last card.

135
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,439
Then, Miss Lu...

136
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,319
No worries.

137
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,959
I still have the letter

138
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,120
Lu Xinran forged.

139
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,000
Only if Lu Anran

140
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,879
is willing to bow down to me,

141
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,759
will I take the letter

142
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,639
to the imperial court as the evidence.

143
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,879
As for Ninth Brother,

144
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,519
he won't

145
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,800
stand by for sure.

146
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,160
As long as we make it a big scene,

147
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,720
even if His Majesty
reaches his hands out to the Lu Family,

148
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,959
he can't do it.

149
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,519
Lu Anran,

150
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,399
will you submit to me,

151
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,879
or His Majesty?

152
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,319
I believe you are smart.

153
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,720
You know how to make the choice.

154
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,120
Miss, do you need me?

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,759
How's the business recently?

156
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,680
Do you want the good news

157
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
or the bad news?

158
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,959
The bad news.

159
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,240
Because of Second Miss,

160
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,240
our business takes a nosedive.

161
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,920
This is my first time

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,199
to see the Lu Family
unable to make ends meet

163
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,480
since I worked in the Lu Family.

164
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,680
The Hanjing Wharf

165
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,759
has paid the shipmen

166
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,199
with the deposits.

167
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,720
What about the good news?

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,800
The shipmen

169
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,680
thought our Lu Family

170
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,600
has come down,

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
so they quit one after another.

172
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,639
And now it's balanced.

173
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Pass my order.

174
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,360
Deliver the goods on the way

175
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,439
to the buyers as soon as possible.

176
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,040
Inform the managers of 36 ports

177
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,600
to finish their orders.

178
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,679
Don't take more orders this month.

179
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,559
Attend the meeting
at the Lu's Mansion in Hanjing

180
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,960
on the first day of the next lunar month.

181
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,879
Miss,

182
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,559
it's widely rumored that

183
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,519
our Lu Family is about to close for real.

184
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,279
Rest assured. Only if I am here

185
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,080
will not the Lu Family fall down.

186
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,600
Go. Pass my order.

187
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
So close.

188
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,720
It was so close.

189
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,279
I could have taken

190
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,080
the Lu Family's fleets

191
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,159
to a farther place.

192
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,900
(Dahan River Map)

193
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:31,799
You are here.

194
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,639
What belongs to you is yours.

195
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,440
I won't let others take away

196
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,159
your belongings.

197
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,639
What if I volunteer to send them away?

198
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,600
Your Highness Prince Qi
rushed around for a day.

199
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,679
Tried to go to the Mansion of Prince Qing

200
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,159
and find His Highness Prince Qing
to be the evidence.

201
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Then went to
the Mansion of Hanjing's Mayor

202
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,159
to check the fake letter of collaboration.

203
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,639
You searched for the evidence
related to the North

204
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,799
around the city.

205
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,879
But what's the result?

206
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,120
As the saying goes,
things that are hard to come by

207
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,639
are often hard to lose;

208
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,519
things that are easily come by

209
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,840
are often easy to lose.

210
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,279
It seems that God

211
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,600
thinks I walked

212
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,840
a smooth way.

213
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Are you really willing to do so?

214
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,440
They were earned by you

215
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,279
little by little.

216
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,480
Of course not.

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,039
But living

218
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
is more essential than anything.

219
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,919
Isn't it?

220
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,679
Although I am Prince Qi,
I don't own military power.

221
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,360
I can't safeguard you at all.

222
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,279
You are willing to depend on me.

223
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:02,919
But as for this issue,

224
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,080
I can't help you with anything.

225
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,159
I have never felt worthless

226
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,399
as I felt today.

227
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,120
I thought such a thing

228
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,759
unimportant.

229
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,759
But today, I understand that

230
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,399
having a soft underbelly,

231
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,759
I should use power as my armor.

232
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:24,840
Anran,

233
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,279
should I strive for

234
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,039
this thing?

235
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,519
Mu Chuan,

236
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,120
I can't give you an answer.

237
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,279
People live and die

238
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,120
for power.

239
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,519
But I don't think once owning power,

240
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,399
you are destined

241
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,480
to become a deceitful evil.

242
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,720
As long as you don't change
your original aspirations,

243
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,919
means

244
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,240
are only tools.

245
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,679
Mu Chuan,

246
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,320
tomorrow,

247
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,639
I want to meet His Majesty.

248
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,080
Okay. I will help you.

249
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,360
Your Majesty.

250
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,559
Miss Lu is here.

251
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Greet Your Majesty.

252
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,480
Raise your head.

253
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,200
At a young age,

254
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,240
you have been

255
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,960
the hostress of the Lu Family.

256
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,879
Miss Lu

257
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,639
looks like an ordinary person

258
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,519
but not acts like an ordinary one.

259
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,600
Your Majesty,

260
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,480
it's a stroke of luck

261
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,559
that we gained the success.

262
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,159
I don't dare to
ask for rewards and admiration.

263
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,840
These are the Double Fish Order

264
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,720
with which you can
rule the 36 ports' ships,

265
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,440
and the transfer agreement.

266
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,960
Please Your Highness check them.

267
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,320
Are you willing to do so?

268
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,480
The cilvilians nationwide

269
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,720
all bow to Your Majesty.

270
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,320
The same to the Lu Family.

271
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,360
The Lu Family's possession

272
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,399
is Your Majesty's possession.

273
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,799
I don't dare to be unwilling.

274
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,559
Nice talk.

275
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:20,840
I

276
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,320
would like to talk with the intelligent.

277
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,919
There you up.

278
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,399
Your Majesty,

279
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,159
I have to beg you for one thing.

280
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,240
Say it.

281
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,679
Please Your Majesty

282
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,240
let me continue
managing the Lu Family's shipment.

283
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,559
The waterways of Dahan are complicated.

284
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:44,720
I am afraid it's hard

285
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,159
to find someone
to take it over in a minute.

286
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,919
I don't want to see

287
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,200
the shipment I built personally

288
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,919
bear stains on failing to ship

289
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,600
and poor management.

290
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,879
Moreover,

291
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,559
Your Majesty know better than I know

292
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,960
about what the imperial officials think.

293
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,080
Your Majesty

294
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,879
may not expect the Lu Family

295
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,639
to become the pawn of fights
in the imperial court either.

296
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,320
I heard that

297
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,799
you get well along with Prince Qing.

298
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,840
The Lu Family failed to

299
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,879
contribute a bit to
the Mansion of Prince Qing

300
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,240
in our heyday.

301
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:18,759
Nowadays,

302
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,360
the Lu Family's reputations are ruined.

303
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,879
It's of no use.

304
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,879
Okay.

305
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,519
I promise you.

306
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,559
Thank you, Your Majesty.

307
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,440
There you up.

308
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,200
Walk with me.

309
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,080
Did Chuan

310
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,360
mention his mother

311
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,159
to you?

312
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,240
When I met Chuan's mother,

313
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
I could say
I fell for her at first glance.

314
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,840
Thus, I led the whole military forces

315
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,240
to wait at the gate of neighbor South.

316
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,960
I compelled her to marry me as my concubine.

317
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,720
After she entered the imperial court,

318
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,919
I treated her so well.

319
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,519
But she dismissed it.

320
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
Even when she delivered Chuan,

321
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,600
she didn't want to have a look at him.

322
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,639
Untill when she heard

323
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,559
her lover

324
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,200
died in the battlefield,

325
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,320
right at that place,

326
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,080
she hung herself,

327
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,399
going with her lover.

328
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,639
I like him.

329
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,320
In a way that I will marry no one but him.

330
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,559
Trapped by love,

331
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
they imprison themselves.

332
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,120
Some birds will become obedient

333
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,000
when in captivity for long.

334
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,519
While for some birds,
the longer in captivity,

335
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,200
the more they long for freedom.

336
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,440
Chuan acts like his mother so much.

337
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,600
Yesterday, he should say

338
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,200
the same words

339
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,240
as his mother said then.

340
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,519
I like Lu Anran.

341
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,240
I beg for her in the imperial court today

342
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,519
because I don't want to see her anxious.

343
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,799
It dosen't matter if you like her.

344
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,159
I have had

345
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,720
the affections to others.

346
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,919
They are like

347
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,879
fans in summers

348
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,039
and fires in winters.

349
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,919
Refreshing.

350
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,799
We can't stop using them

351
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,120
nor leave them for a while.

352
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,200
However,

353
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,879
as spring goes and autumn comes

354
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,080
they will become useless.

355
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,240
You have to figure it out.

356
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,600
But I like her

357
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,279
in a way that I will marry her.

358
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,559
I fret he will be trapped by love.

359
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,319
I don't want him

360
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,400
to follow in his mother's footsteps.

361
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,319
Your Majesty, please be frank.

362
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
I want you

363
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,480
to stay away from Chuan.

364
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,720
After you leave the court,

365
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
you can't meet him anymore.

366
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,000
If I hear

367
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,880
you say something to Chuan,

368
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,200
I will definitely let you...

369
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,160
Oh, yes. Your father

370
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,720
is old and infirm.

371
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,240
I decided

372
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,400
to let him go back to Su City

373
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
to live a peaceful life.

374
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,519
Whether he can pass away in peace or not

375
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,039
depends on whether you, his daughter,

376
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,519
are loyal to Dahan or not.

377
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,920
Your Majesty,

378
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,599
you have already

379
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,759
upset the princess of the South.

380
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,720
Do you want to hurt His Highness Prince Qi

381
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,000
in the same way?

382
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,680
You

383
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,000
don't deserve Chuan's future.

384
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Chuan is not yours

385
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,000
but Dahan's.

386
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,920
Behave yourself.

387
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,599
(I want you)

388
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,519
(to stay away from Chuan.)

389
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,119
(After you leave the court,)

390
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,920
(you can't meet him anymore.)

391
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,720
(You don't deserve Chuan's future.)

392
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,480
(Chuan is not yours)

393
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,160
(but Dahan's.)

394
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,559
(Background,)

395
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,039
(power, and reputation in my eyes)

396
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,400
(are as transient as fleeting clouds.)

397
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
(I don't care.)

398
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,680
(My destination is not Hanjing)

399
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,160
(but you.)

400
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,720
(I can remind you)

401
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,599
(I am willing to let you)

402
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,920
(be a concubine of
the Mansion of Prince Qing.)

403
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,640
(If you really piss me off,)

404
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,839
(I can let you)

405
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,440
(be a dog of the Mansion of Prince Qing.)

406
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,720
(Even if you want to be a ghost,)

407
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,200
(you have to be a ghost of
the Mansion of Prince Qing.)

408
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,640
(Remember it.)

409
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,920
(Lu Anran.)

410
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,119
(In this life, love)

411
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,960
(is just a dream for you.)

412
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,160
(I will go to the North for sure.)

413
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,359
(But General Lu...)

414
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,880
(I will also earn merits and reputations.)

415
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,799
(...chased the enemies for thousands miles...)

416
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:54,920
(To be your strongest support.)

417
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,480
(but encountered the ambush)

418
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,920
(and fought with them for a week.)

419
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,500
(For today's result...)

420
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,759
(I will never come back...)

421
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,960
(- if I don't win.
- The evidence they searched in the Lu Family...)

422
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,319
(- Master Lu, you are so greedy.
- was set by me.)

423
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,480
(- And I colluded with Second Master...
- Dad!)

424
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,559
(- to betray the Lu Family.
- Betrayed the country...)

425
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,119
(to sell weapons to the North.)

426
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,839
(Lu Anran, you are doomed.)

427
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,160
(Your Lu Family is all doomed.)

428
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,359
(The Emperor
is ordering the imperial edict.)

429
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,680
(Execute the whole Lu Family now!)

430
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,839
(It was you who killed)

431
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,279
(your mother personally.)

432
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,079
(Why those sufferings in that decade)

433
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,480
(torture me again)

434
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,319
(in this life?)

435
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,119
(It turns out that some caged birds)

436
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,880
(are doomed to die in cages.)

437
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,440
(I'm really weary of)

438
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,839
(the enormous cage)

439
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,680
(and endless intrigues.)

440
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,039
Lu Anran.

441
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,759
Lu Anran.

442
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,079
As you have been overwhelmed already,

443
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,000
you even try to drop everything

444
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,880
to stay with your beloved forever.

445
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,599
How naive you are!

446
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,200
You have nowhere to escape.

447
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,440
Unless you upend the end

448
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,079
that Mu Ze is not the emperor anymore,

449
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,319
otherwise,

450
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,880
you will never run away from him

451
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,759
forever and a day.

452
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:36,720
Now,

453
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,799
do you regret it?

454
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,039
All of this

455
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,279
is wrong from the beginning.

456
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,880
No matter what you choose,

457
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,200
you can't run out of

458
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,680
Mu Ze's palms in the end.

459
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,519
No matter how many times you are reborn,

460
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,960
you can't save the Lu Family

461
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:04,480
but to get drown deeper and deeper.

462
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,599
Lu Anran,

463
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,839
face your destiny.

464
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,240
No. It's not.

465
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,680
I will figure something out eventually.

466
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,359
I will know how to save the Lu Family.

time rewinding never

484

she was eluding the fate to come.

491
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,680
Now, she made up her mind.

492
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,039

Anran.

500
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,319
How did you deal with it?

501
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,839
Is there anyone who embarrassed you?

502
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,279
Dad.

503
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,200
I am sorry.

504
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:03,119
I sent the Lu Family to the royal.

505
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,480
I didn't keep it.

506
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,799
You did your best.

507
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,720
Since I started from scratch,

508
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,960
I have seen

509
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,279
many social climbers.

510
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,240
When the Lu Family took off luckily,

511
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,440
I started to resist

512
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
being complicit with dignitaries.

513
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
I keep virtuous

514
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,720
and stay immune.

515
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:24,839
In retrospect,

516
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,319
what I did is actually embarrassing you.

517
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,640
Anran,

518
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,359
I have figured it out.

519
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,599
Power and prosperity

520
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,759
are water under the bridge.

521
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,200
Just let them go.

522
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,480
That a family stay together

523
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,720
is better than anything.

524
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,680
Let's give up everything.

525
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,960
Go back to Su City with me.

526
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:53,839
Dad.

527
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:54,920
I can't go back.

528
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,119
Take care of your health.

529
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,880
After I end the disputes in Hanjing City,

530
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,240
I will go back to care for you for sure.

531
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,960
But now,

532
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,119
I must take another shot.

533
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,799
Is there anyone embarrassing you?

534
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,279
Dad.

535
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,480
No one is embarrassing me.

536
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,200
Although I can't escape the situation,

537
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,559
I won't go down without a fight.

538
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,400
For the Lu Family or me,

539
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,839
I must overturn the world.

540
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,920
All the people on this road

541
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,519
are not kind.

542
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,079
If you have to choose one,

543
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,559
who will you choose?

544
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,519
Prince Qing?

545
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,759
The authority shouldn't be

546
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,319
the next best choice.

547
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,640
I would rather choose
no one than the worse.

548
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,000
Dad, you have to believe

549
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,920
there will be a day when we meet again.

550
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,160
She should be willing to do it.

551
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
I really didn't expect it.

552
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,200
Lu Anran is bold indeed.

553
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,960
Your Highness.

554
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,000
Till now,

555
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,960
Miss Lu has handed in

556
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,480
the Double Fish Order to His Majesty.

557
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,240
It has resolved

558
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,440
the urgent issue from the Lu Family.

559
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,960
We don't have anything to

560
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,880
threaten her any longer.

561
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,200
Send a death squad

562
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,720
to watch Lu Qingzhou closely.

563
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,680
Yes, Your Highness.

564
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,599
Lu Anran, I didn't expect it for real.

565
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,319
In order not to marry me,

566
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,799
you forsake your essential part.

567
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,119
You should relinquish

568
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,440
the entire shipment business
of the Lu Family.

569
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,440
She is so cruel and resolute.

570
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,720
But relax.

571
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,079
I

572
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,480
will never

573
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,960
let you fulfill you wishes easily.

574
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:40,079
Miss,

575
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,000
I planned with my brother

576
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,839
to take Master away halway,

577
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,200
staying away from the court.

578
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,240
But

579
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,440
Brother found Prince Qing

580
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,759
sent someone to follow Master Lu secretly.

581
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,079
So...

582
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,279
Lingxi.

583
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,480
Holly.

584
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,000
Do you feel

585
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,200
all along this way,

586
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,759
I seemed to grab the head starts,

587
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,319
but I always skated on thin ice,

588
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,599
getting deeper and deeper.

589
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,319
Only a smart aleck.

590
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,960
I am too innocent.

591
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,680
In this world,

592
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,720
there is no firmness and control.

593
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:16,839
When you change one thing,

594
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,440
a new crisis ensues.

595
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,759
Miss,

596
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
what's wrong with you?

597
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,160
I am just a little tired.

598
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,400
I only wanted to

599
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,720
protect the Lu Family.

600
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,440
But till now, I have protected no one

601
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,839
and get nowhere to hide as well.

602
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,920
Miss, you tried your best.

603
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:52,839
Your Highness,

604
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,319
Master Lu has arrived in Su City.

605
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,279
Although Miss Lu
handed over the Double Fish Order,

606
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,039
His Majesty

607
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,079
admired her talent

608
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,119
and ordered her to keep
taking charge of the Lu's shipment.

609
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,440
In this way,

610
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,680
it benefits both.

611
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,160
I only hope

612
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
she can get over it.

613
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,839
But Your Highness,

614
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,359
as weal and woe coexist,

615
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,799
if the Lu Family is like this,

616
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,240
Miss Lu doesn't need to

617
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,559
shoulder the heavy responsibility
of the Lu's ups and downs.

618
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,720
Nor giving advice

619
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,079
to the Mansion of Prince Qing.

620
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,559
There may be less concerns

621
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,799
between you and her.

622
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,880
She handed over the Lu Family

623
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,200
because she was cornered.

624
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,440
She must grieve.

625
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,680
I can't offer a hand

626
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,799
in this matter.

627
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,240
How can I think about

628
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
the future?

629
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,640
Your Highness,

630
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:38,920
I am sorry for my wrong words.

631
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,640
Your Highness.

632
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,000
Lingxi,

633
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,359
why are you here?

634
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,160
Miss,

635
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,960
time to wash up.

636
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,720
Miss, do you know?

637
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,279
His Highness Prince Qi

638
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,559
looked so happy today.

639
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,559
You should be more motivated

640
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:28,200
as today.

641
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,240
Don't always hide in the yard,

642
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,759
watching the grapevine in a daze.

643
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,880
Miss, why do you

644
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,680
escape your minds all the time?

645
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,920
His Highness Prince Qi

646
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,400
likes you publicly.

647
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:46,759
But you always

648
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:47,680
conceal your minds

649
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,599
without a confirmation.

650
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,799
You are so...

651
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,440
So...

652
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,319
Shameless.

653
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,200
Right.

654
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,519
No, Miss.

655
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,200
Do you like

656
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,279
His Highness Prince Qi or not?

657
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,680
I am confused.

658
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,960
Mu Chuan is like that bright moon.

659
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,640
Encountering him

660
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,200
is my only consolation

661
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,880
when I come all this way.

662
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,319
But Lingxi,

663
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,119
how could I try to shoot for the moon?

664
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:20,480
He should shine bright in the sky

665
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,839
as radiantly as the sun.

666
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,119
It is not that complicated, Miss.

667
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,000
I think as long as you like him,

668
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,000
then go meet him

669
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,079
for several times.

670
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,079
Have several meals together.

671
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,839
It will be good

672
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,920
as you always meet each other.

673
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,880
Am I right, Miss?

674
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,559
Let me prepare

675
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,440
your tomorrow's clothes.

676
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,759
You must show up beautifully.

677
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,680
(But tomorrow)

678
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:57,319
(is the last time.)

679
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,440
(Maybe it's the last time)

680
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,960
(in this life)

681
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,200
(for him to tug my heartstrings.)

682
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,799
What?

683
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,199
There are a large amount of ladies

684
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,519
more beautiful than I am in Hanjing.

685
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,679
Why do Your Highness Prince Qi
look like this?

686
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,519
It seems you haven't seen the world.

687
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,719
Well, no.

688
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:17,880
Mainly because

689
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,480
Miss Lu

690
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,280
wears differently from the past.

691
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,599
It surprises me.

692
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
This is for you.

693
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,000
Open it after you arrive home.

694
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,239
Alright. So mysterious.

695
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,800
Let's go.

696
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,519
To where?

697
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,840
Take a walk.

698
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:44,840
What's wrong?

699
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,440
I have had this sort of dessert

700
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,239
when I was in Li City.

701
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,400
They were soft and sweet,

702
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,800
but this is tougher.

703
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,239
Lady.

704
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,639
For my dingsheng rice cakes,

705
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,280
I learned them formally

706
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,599
from a chef in a restaurant

707
00:35:58,599 --> 00:35:59,960
who is from Li City.

708
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,440
I assure it is
authentically flavored rice cake.

709
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,320
Calm down, please.

710
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,400
Do you want one?

711
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,920
The dingsheng rice cakes

712
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,440
need patience the most.

713
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,760
You have to sift the flour carefully.

714
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,519
If you want to stuff them,

715
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,159
you need to steam

716
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,320
every layer.

717
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,920
It needs many efforts.

718
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,039
I tell you.

719
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,039
I bet the boss must laze,

720
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,480
so the cake doesn't taste good.

But what about the future?

In the future, when you have a child,

782
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,519
you have to calculate

drinking, shopping and idling

820
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,719
are a waste of time.

821
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
But seeing from now,

822
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,320
they are good as well.

868
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:53,719
Later,

869
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,320
Miss Wang thought

870
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,800
God gave her a chance to live again

871
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,119
in order to help her
stay with the true lover.

872
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,039
But she found out

873
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:04,800
the destiny just asked her to ponder over

874
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,599
her stupid love at first sight.

875
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:12,200
♪I will turn the tide regardless♪

876
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,400
And then?

877
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,599
What do you think will be the end?

878
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,719
I think Miss Wang

879
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:27,880
seemed to return

880
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:30,199
to be back where she was.

881
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,719
But

882
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:34,000
instead of dwelling on

883
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,280
the so-called fate,

884
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,000
she'd better abandon all

885
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,719
and enjoy her every single day.

886
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:42,880
Yes.

887
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,400
Because she had no other choices.

888
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:47,639
Had no other choices?

889
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,480
You are right.

890
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,199
The end is Miss Wang

891
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,719
stayed with the one whom she desired to

892
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:05,679
live with forever.

893
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,199
Since then, they lived seclusion,

894
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:10,760
not caring about the world.

895
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,480
See?

896
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:14,960
I said she was magnanimous.

897
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:17,559
She was only blinded

898
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:18,599
by the hatred temporarily.

899
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,079
The past and the future
both aren't the present.

900
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,840
Extremely dwelling on them

901
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,000
will compromise today's scenery.

902
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,599
Mu Chuan,

903
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,000
if you had a second life,

904
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,039
what would you do?

905
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:44,760
I wouldn't be a prince anyway.

906
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:46,519
A person with a horse

907
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:47,760
knocked around

908
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,760
the splendid world.

909
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:51,679
What about you?

910
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:57,599
If I had a second life,

911
00:46:58,719 --> 00:46:59,920
I would like to marry one person.

912
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,719
Grew old together after long missing.

913
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:05,119
Stayed ordinary to death

914
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:06,559
so as to avoid being picked up by God

915
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:07,679
for an ordeal.

916
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:17,679
Right,

917
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:18,960
what is the story

918
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,920
you wanted to tell me?

919
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,840
I forget it.

920
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,239
I-I... It's fine.

921
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:27,920
I will tell you afterwards.

922
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,519
There's much time ahead of us.

923
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,199
What are those things

924
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:43,000
you bought?

925
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,599
A surprise for you.

926
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,000
A surprise for me?

927
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,039
What are you doing?

928
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,000
Your Highness.

929
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:21,880
You are here.

930
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:23,519
I bought many fireworks

931
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:24,159
from the outside.

932
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:25,039
Let's set off them.

933
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,440
Mu Chuan,

934
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,960
your improved rice

935
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,000
will spread all over Hanjing one day.

936
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,400
The golden fields

937
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,039
will be as stunning as the fireworks.

938
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,519
What about you?

939
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,840
I?

940
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,400
Where are you then?

941
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,679
I believe

942
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:21,880
we will witness the day

943
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,559
together.
