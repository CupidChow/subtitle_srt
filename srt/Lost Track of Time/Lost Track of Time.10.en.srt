00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,000
=Lost Track of Time=
=Episode 10=

2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,840
I miscalculated this time.

3
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,879
I am unlucky to be caught.

4
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,359
You can kill me in a way

5
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,480
as you like.

6
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,519
Given the crimes you committed

7
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,000
in Danzhou during these years,

8
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,959
it's not much

9
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,079
even if I kill you ten times.

10
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,040
Gao Chengxian,

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,359
as you've ruled Danzhou for years,

12
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,319
will you be reluctant

13
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,760
if you die like this?

14
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,799
So what if I am not reluctant?

15
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,959
Or

16
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,360
will Your Highness let me go?

17
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,400
As for

18
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,039
the robbery of famine relief,

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,159
it could be done

20
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,800
by you and Chai Guang

21
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,000
or Chai Guang

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,360
alone.

23
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,879
If it were you,

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,520
how would you choose?

25
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
How could you be willing to release me?

26
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,919
Or

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,960
you want to play and frame me again?

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,199
Nowadays, in this world,

29
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,960
people live or die for interests.

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,479
If you can

31
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,039
benefit me for real,

32
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,280
why don't I free you?

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,840
As long as Your Highness discharges me,

34
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,479
so what if I am a dog

35
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,240
in the Mansion of Prince Qing?

36
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,800
Don't get emotional.

37
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,520
Why don't you think it over

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,240
if there is a better option

39
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,479
except for being a dog?

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,199
For Your Highness, I am willing to

41
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,400
be eyes and ears around Prince Yi

42
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,240
to help Your Highness
achieve your great cause.

43
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,240
Look. Look.

44
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,159
You don't seem stupid indeed.

45
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

46
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,360
Extend your gratitude later.

47
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,280
Your Highness.

48
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,000
Why is it?

49
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,439
The Lu Family coexists with

50
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,639
the Mansion of Prince Qing.

51
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,960
As for what tricks you played on Lu Anran,

52
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,439
do you think I am ignorant of them,

53
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,479
don't you?

54
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,719
Even if you want to be a dog

55
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,080
of the Mansion of Prince Qing,

56
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,960
you should be clear about

57
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,919
who you can bite

58
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,120
and who

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,639
you can't touch.

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,759
Understood?

61
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,240
Understood.

62
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,120
It turns out that
the Lu Family is wronged.

63
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,279
Don't talk nonsense.

64
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,319
Chai Guang is a traitor to Qinghe Gang.

65
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,000
A nice catch.

66
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:33,920
Theoretically,

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,800
it shouldn't be the Lu Family.

68
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,519
Yes.

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,759
Second Brother.

70
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,959
Even if you have a word,

71
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,000
you shall change your clothes.

72
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,160
Or, you will get a cold.

73
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,879
Second Brother,

74
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,279
why is that?

75
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,319
I still have to use him.

76
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
If not to say he was posted to be idle

77
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,680
and didn't bear the responsibilities
for the garrison,

78
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,319
the wealth he grabbed alone

79
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,439
is enough to feed Danzhou's civilians

80
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,399
for a year.

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,920
In this process,
how many wrongdoings he made

82
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
and civilians he exploited?

83
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,920
Second Brother, do you know?

84
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,439
Enough.

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,839
I know all you mentioned.

86
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,480
How useful he is on earth?

87
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,399
Can let you ignore

88
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,399
all these crimes.

89
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,399
What about reading this?

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,439
The ledger

91
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,279
between Prince Yi and Qin Yekuo?

92
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,720
All of the armies

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,560
governed by Qin Yekuo

94
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,480
are Prince Yi's vaults.

95
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,439
The funds

96
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,399
they embezzled from the locals

97
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,480
will send to Prince Yi

98
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,959
continuously.

99
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,879
If I kill him now,

100
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,519
what about other places?

101
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,600
Then I can report to His Majesty

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,120
with the evidence

103
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,000
and ask him to get to the bottom of this.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,199
So childish.

105
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,800
What will it cause?

106
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,519
You will warn them.

107
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,240
And they will conceal deeper,

108
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,399
which makes it harder to investigate.

109
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Corruption in an army

110
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,079
will shake a country's foundation.

111
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,160
I save his life

112
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,680
to root out

113
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,199
the corruption in the army compeletly.

114
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,279
If one day

115
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,439
when powerful enemies intrude,

116
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,720
what do you want?

117
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,959
Do you want civilians to revolt?

118
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,519
But so many people

119
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,519
died in his hands.

120
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:46,839
Will it be solved

121
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,800
only by this?

122
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,120
What about those innocents?

123
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,720
They were dead after all.

124
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,560
I care about the living.

125
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,600
Your Highness.

126
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,839
Your Highness. Something's wrong.

127
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,279
The mountain roads to the city
are crushed because of the heavy rain.

128
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,160
The teams that allocate food from Yizhou

129
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,079
are all buried in the mudslides.

130
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,879
What?

131
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,600
I will go find Brother Shen.

132
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,040
Wait.

133
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,759
People in Jianghu

134
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,319
can't help much after all.

135
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,160
It will only waste the time.

136
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,560
Gao Chengxian.

137
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:20,959
Yes, Your Highness.

138
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,000
Call for all soldiers.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Divide into two squads.

140
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,759
For one, stabilize the mountain,

141
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,040
preventing from further landslides.

142
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,800
For another,

143
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,680
strive to rescue victims.

144
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
I will do it now.

145
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,120
Ninth Brother,

146
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,879
I know

147
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,000
all you mentioned.

148
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,959
I promise you

149
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,720
I won't miss

150
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,399
any punishments he deserves.

151
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,000
Brother Shen said you stayed alone

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,959
without a word

153
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,720
after you came back.

154
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,560
I slept.

155
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
But I see

156
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,079
your wide open eyes.

157
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,879
You sleep with eyes opened?

158
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,800
I am going to sleep now.

159
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,360
Remember

160
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,240
drink this cold prevention medicine.

161
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,320
Why don't you leave?

162
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,840
I have to see you

163
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,039
drinking the medicine.

164
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,240
As you got wet in the rain,

165
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,080
what if you are ill?

166
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,039
What about dams you most care about?

167
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,759
Done.

168
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,519
Kick me out once you finished?

169
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,399
Still hot.

170
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,679
Sleep now.

171
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,600
I am alright.

172
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,200
Even if you are unhappy,

173
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,639
you should also

174
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,360
take care of yourself.

175
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:52,759
You...

176
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,879
You knew it?

177
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,080
It was published.

178
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,240
How could I be ignorant?

179
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,200
I think I am shameless to face

180
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,159
civilians in Danzhou.

181
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,080
I am even shameless to face you.

182
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,840
He is he. You are you.

183
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,080
You don't have to

184
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,000
bear these for him.

185
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,360
But he is my second brother.

186
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,679
But you can't agree with him completely.

187
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,360
He said he wanted to use Gao Chengxian

188
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,039
to collect evidence

189
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,440
and eliminate corruption in the army.

190
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,320
But we all know

191
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,200
as long as Gao Chengxian is in Danzhou,

192
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,559
civilians of Danzhou
can't live in peace for a day.

193
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,799
And why should their lives

194
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,840
give in to

195
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,559
those glorified excuses?

196
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,120
It isn't supposed to be

197
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,840
a choice.

198
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,240
How will you response

199
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,720
if he goes farther in the future?

200
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,320
You will not be able to

201
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,399
convince yourself one day.

202
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,960
Till then,

203
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,159
you won't have a chance

204
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,240
to remedy.

205
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,000
So, stop him from scratch.

206
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,240
In this world, there are lots of things

207
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,399
you can bend the rules to deal with,

208
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,120
but for right and wrong,

209
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,759
you can't blur the boundaries.

210
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,159
A man of virtue
understands and observes what is morally right;

211
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,639
while a petty man only has his eyes on
and goes after what brings personal gains.

212
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,399
It is good

213
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,799
if you stick to what you think.

214
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,360
Brother Chuan.

215
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,159
Mu Chuan.

216
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:21,759
Brother Chuan.

217
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:23,559
Brother Chuan.

218
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,240
Prince Qing

219
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,559
looks dignified.

220
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,080
But I didn't expect him

221
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,200
to collude with Gao Chengxian.

222
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
With this conduct,

223
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,879
he even wasn't ashamed

224
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,120
of trying to cooperate with Qinghe Gang.

225
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,759
Leader Shen,

226
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,679
do you want to help Mu Chuan?

227
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,080
I know you have an idea.

228
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,039
Just tell me.

229
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,799
How can you get in?

230
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,639
You don't need to know it.

231
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,240
You only need to know

232
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,960
I am here to make a deal with you.

233
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,159
What deal?

234
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,159
You must know

235
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,559
His Highness Prince Qing's choice.

236
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
You are the mastermind

237
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,759
to rob the rice relief.

238
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,840
Appropriating famine relief is a felony.

239
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,919
You will die for sure.

240
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,480
As a traitor of Qinghe Gang,

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,080
your family will be disdained,

242
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,440
with nowhere to hide.

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,759
But if you are willing to

244
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,039
do me a favor,

245
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,279
I will ensure your family

246
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,080
are safe and sound in wealth.

247
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
What do you want from me?

248
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,720
As you wish,

249
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,559
to reveal the truth.

250
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,919
Who is it?

251
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,240
What is he doing?

252
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,039
Have no idea.

253
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,559
I am Mu Chuan,

254
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,879
Ninth Prince of Dahan Dynasty.

255
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,559
I stand here today

256
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:54,679
to do my duty

257
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,559
for you

258
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,799
and for me.

259
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,039
I am sure

260
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,080
you all know Gao Chengxian.

261
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,679
He is the general
of the garrison in Danzhou,

262
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,879
more of a devil

263
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,000
haunting you.

264
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:03,960
How many appalling things

265
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,080
did he make?

266
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,960
How many happy families

267
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,200
did he break?

268
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,360
Not only at here,

269
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,679
but also many other places.

270
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,519
He regards all the innocent civilians

271
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,799
as sheep to the slaughter.

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,120
Would cilivians of Danzhou

273
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,600
like to

274
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,799
make your own minds for once?

275
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,519
Who wants to go with me

276
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,120
and identifies Gao Chengxian

277
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,360
to let him get executed now?

278
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,879
If we fail,

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
you will have no trouble indeed.

280
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:25,960
At last,

281
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,480
the ones who suffer

282
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,279
are still us.

283
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,720
Right. Right.

284
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,519
Easier said than done.

285
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,120
So many people have been here before.

286
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,279
But they were all driven away

287
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,080
by Gao Chengxian eventually.

288
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:34,720
True.

289
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
Yes. It's true.

290
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,159
I know

291
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,480
you are terrified

292
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,960
and hopeless.

293
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,759
If officials are incapable,

294
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,879
civilians will suffer and grieve.

295
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,960
You have no ways to seek help,
so you hate the court.

296
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,039
Maybe it's rediculous for an individual

297
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,279
to take down the powerful,

298
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,399
but individuals can overcome anything

299
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,440
when they make
determined efforts together.

300
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,320
I would like to vouch with my own power

301
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,120
that if Gao Chengxian
stands here for one day,

302
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,360
I won't leave either for one day.

303
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,200
Ninth Prince,

304
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,720
I am not scared of death.

305
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,000
I will go with you.

306
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,559
Ninth Prince, me, too.

307
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:16,039
I will go as well.

308
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,960
Count me in.

309
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,399
The lady is powerful.

310
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:39,679
I like her.

311
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,399
Let me caress you.

312
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:46,399
Chai Guang?

313
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,120
Don't move.

314
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,200
Chai Guang!

315
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,240
Why are you here?

316
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,080
Aren't you in the prison?

317
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,720
You said we would

318
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,679
go through thick and thin together.

319
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:05,480
But I am in the prison,

320
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,519
while you live it up here.

321
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,240
Get away!

322
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,720
Mister.

323
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,200
Mister.

324
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,720
Don't move.

325
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,559
We could talk it through.

326
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,799
We could talk it through.

327
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,879
Talk it through?

328
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,960
Let you treat me like sheep,

329
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,399
butchering me as you wish?

330
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,320
Don't get close. Don't get close.

331
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,039
Where is Prince Qing? I want him.

332
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,360
Go! Call for Prince Qing!

333
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes.

334
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,600
The stage is well-prepared.

335
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,279
What a pity.

336
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,279
The audience is not enough.

337
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,159
Miss, let me do it.

338
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,159
Don't move.

339
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,720
Here comes His Highness Prince Qing!

340
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,480
Get away.

341
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,759
His Highness Prince Qing is here.

342
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
His Highness Prince Qing is here.

343
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,600
Your Highness.

344
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,039
You finally came.

345
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,879
Y-Your...

346
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,600
Your Highness, save me.

347
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,200
Seizing the court official on the street.

348
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,240
What crime it is?

349
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,279
Chai Guang,

350
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,120
do you think

351
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,720
your crime is not serious enough?

352
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,679
I will die anyway.

353
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,480
I don't care if I bear more crimes.

354
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,559
I once was

355
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,639
a true man in Jianghu.

356
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:31,879
I can't die,

357
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,039
taking the fall

358
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,799
for no reason.

359
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,840
Don't move.

360
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,000
Otherwise, I will kill him now!

361
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,639
Your Highness, save me.

362
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,799
Civilians of Danzhou,

363
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,240
I appologize to you first.

364
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,039
The rice relief was stolen by me

365
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,120
in disguise of river bandits indeed.

366
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,639
What is going on?

367
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:03,960
But all of this

368
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,240
was instructed by Gao Chengxian.

369
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,359
He is the mastermind.

370
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,319
He brute.

371
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,880
It turns out to be him.

372
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,519
D-Don't...

373
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,759
Don't listen to his nonsense.

374
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,640
He was hurting someone else casually,

375
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,039
dragging me down

376
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,000
before his death.

377
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,640
Don't dare to admit
what you've done, do you?

378
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,400
Then go to hell with me.

379
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,559
If I can't ask for the justice
in the human world,

380
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,440
let's ask for it from King Yama.

381
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,119
It's me. It's me.

382
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
It's me.

383
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,640
Say.

384
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,240
How did you do it?

385
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,880
I told you in advance

386
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,559
the court's food transport route

387
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
and asked you to pretend as river bandit

388
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,240
to steal and sell food.

389
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,599
How did we share the profits?

390
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,279
Say it.

391
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,119
I, 70% and you, 30%.

392
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,200
So inhuman you are.

393
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,079
What a beast.

394
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,240
You bully us with your power in peacetime.

395
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,839
It's fine.

396
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,359
But you even don't let go of

397
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,279
our food for surviving.

398
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,440
Right. Right.

399
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,920
Kill him.

400
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,039
Killing him is right.

401
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,160
Kill him.

402
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,839
So heinous.

403
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,400
Kill

404
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,519
this beast.

405
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,319
So heinous.

406
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,400
Kill him.

407
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,200
Chai Guang.

408
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,799
What's the difference between

409
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,279
what you're doing
and torturing him into confessing?

410
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,200
But do you know

411
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,759
the court needs evidence to hear?

412
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Do you have one?

413
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,400
Evidence?

414
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,039
I am the evidence!

415
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,960
He's dead.

416
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,839
Thank you for holding your hand.

417
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,720
Chai Guang betrayed Qinghe Gang,

418
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,079
colluding with a bastard official

419
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,119
and endangering civilians.

420
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,720
As a gang leader,

421
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,160
I should clean up our own mess.

422
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,599
As Your Highness Prince Qing is eagled-eye,

423
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
you must be more virtuous

424
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,519
than me from the Jianghu.

425
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,200
Please rest assured.

426
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,480
His Highness Prince Qing

427
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
must do the justice for you

428
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,480
and punish the bastard official hard.

429
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:38,000
Punish the bastard hard!

430
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,440
Your Highness.

431
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,200
Since the civilians are indignant now,

432
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,440
I am afraid it's hard to end this.

433
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,839
What about

434
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:43,640
detaining Gao Chengxian now?

435
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,680
Table it later.

436
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,759
Punish the bastard hard!

437
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,119
Punish the bastard hard!

438
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,160
Can't let the bastard go.

439
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,599
Punish the bastard hard!

440
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,319
Robbing the famine relief

441
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,559
is a big deal.

442
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Although we don't have evidence,

443
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,079
I will never

444
00:19:59,079 --> 00:19:59,920
stand by for sure.

445
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,319
I will give you

446
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,640
a satisfying answer.

447
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,119
Guards.

448
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:04,799
Yes, Your Highness.

449
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,359
Detain

450
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Gao Chengxian.

451
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:09,839
Yes, Your Highness.

452
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,480
Your Highness, you can't...

453
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,279
Your Highness.

454
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,000
I talked nonsense

455
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,599
in order to save my life.

456
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
I am wronged.

457
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,920
They are wronging me.

458
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,079
Stop there.

459
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,359
What's wrong?

460
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,759
I want to report an injustice.

461
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,119
Ninth Brother, what are you doing?

462
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,960
Behind me

463
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,640
are standing the civilians

464
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,680
tormented by Gao Chengxian.

465
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,000
They are just a small part.

466
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
And more of them

467
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,400
don't dare to stand up and make voices.

468
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,440
Futhermore,

469
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,240
can't make voices anymore.

470
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,279
Okay.

471
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Now that you have injustice,

472
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,240
then go back with me.

473
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,440
The very Gao Chengxian

474
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
who bullies with power

475
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,519
makes civilians behind me

476
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,319
lose too much

477
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,839
and sacrifice too much.

478
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,920
Today,

479
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:23,960
they don't have to

480
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,119
keep sacrificing

481
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,640
for the justice in others' mouths.

482
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,880
Gao Chengxian owes them justice.

483
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,960
It should be repayed
by Gao Chengxian himself.

484
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:34,400
Right. Repay it by Gao Chengxian himself.

485
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,640
Repay it by himself.

486
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:40,880
Crucify him.

487
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,519
Crucify him.

488
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,559
Ninth Brother,

489
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,920
no matter what it is,

490
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
let's discuss it when we are back.

491
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,519
Today,

492
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,400
I, on behalf of the civilians in Danzhou,

493
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,319
present a petition to Your Highness

494
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,079
to report

495
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,920
Gao Chengxian's monstrous crimes

496
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,079
when he's in Danzhou.

497
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,119
Please Your Highness

498
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,920
execute Gao Chengxian right now

499
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,000
with your executive privilege
as an imperial envoy.

500
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:32,359
Execute Gao Chengxian right now.

501
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,039
Your Highness.

502
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,440
Your Highness.

503
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:35,880
Save me, Your Highness.

504
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,400
Save me.

505
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,559
Your Highness.

506
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,519
Your Highness.

507
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,839
Save me, Your Highness.

508
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,240
Your Highness, save me.

509
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:44,920
Your Highness.

510
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,400
Your Highness.

511
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,000
As the general of the garrison,

512
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,559
Gao Chengxian didn't do his duty.

513
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:53,240
He ignored wanton river robbers

514
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,960
that butchered crews,

515
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,400
but he colluded with business ships himself

516
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,599
to charge for protection.

517
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,839
His cupidity

518
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,440
made trade in Danzhou fall.

519
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,799
This is the first crime.

520
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,240
He stole and raped

521
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,440
innocent women.

522
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,079
Torturing those who didn't submit to

523
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:12,200
and killing the rescuers

524
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,000
in public.

525
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,680
He was in the leading position,

526
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,599
but he disrespected everyone,
even His Majesty,

527
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,119
regarding lives as straws

528
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,440
and doing whatever he wanted.

529
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,000
This is the second crime.

530
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,079
I plead with Your Highness

531
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,880
to kill Gao Chengxian.

532
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,200
Do the justice

533
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,279
for my son and my daughter-in-law.

534
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,759
I plead with Your Highness

535
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,599
to do the justice

536
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,519
for me and my dead sister.

537
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:48,960
Do the justice.

538
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,039
Do the justice.

539
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,160
Do the justice.

540
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:55,000
Nonsense. Talking nonsense.

541
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,680
Prince Qing, I am wronged.

542
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:57,960
I am wronged.

543
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,279
I am wronged.

544
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,680
Your Highness, I am wronged.

545
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,319
Kill him.

546
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,920
Your Highness, I am wronged.

547
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,839
Kill him.

548
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,359
Taking advantage of his position,

549
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,920
he appropriated
all kinds of funds from the court,

550
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,440
and even colluded with the evils.

551
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,400
What's more, he raised the food price

552
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,640
for personal gain.

553
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,200
He completely disregarded
the civilians of Danzhou

554
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,400
dying of starvation.

555
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,440
This is the third crime.

556
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,200
All his evil deeds,

557
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,119
every single one,

558
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,920
have been stated in the petition.

559
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,759
Gao Chengxian is henious

560
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,240
and utterly repulsive.

561
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,319
Your Highness please do the justice.

562
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,079
Ninth Brother, are you forcing me?

563
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,799
Your Highness please do the justice.

564
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,079
Execute Gao Chengxian

565
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,880
right away.

566
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,640
Right.

567
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,000
Execute him right now.

568
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:50,920
Kill him.

569
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,559
Execute him right now.

570
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,160
Your Highness.

571
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,839
Your Highness, save me. Your Highness.

572
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:55,759
Your Highness.

573
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,319
Save me. Save me.

574
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,400
Your Highness.

575
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,920
Save me.

576
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,279
Kill Gao Chengxian.

577
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,519
Your Highness.

578
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,599
Your Highness.

579
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,559
Kill him.

580
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,680
Kill him.

581
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,319
Your Highness.

582
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,200
Your Highness.

583
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,000
You said you would protect me.

584
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:16,799
You...

585
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,079
You can't betray me.

586
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,799
If there are lawless ones

587
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
who harm civilians

588
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,880
in the future,

589
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,920
they will end up like him.

590
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,839
His Highness Prince Qing is wise.

591
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,839
His Highness Prince Qing is wise.

592
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:09,799
His Highness Prince Qing is wise.

593
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,599
Don't want your life?

594
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,799
I called you, but you didn't reply to me.

595
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,680
If you keep exercising,

596
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,200
you will hurt yourself.

597
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,400
I know today

598
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,240
I went a bit far.

599
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,720
But I really couldn't stand

600
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,240
Gao Chengxian at large.

601
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,880
You should inform me

602
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,799
in advance.

603
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,480
Do you think it is suitable

604
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:08,720
to force me in front of crowds?

605
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,720
But if I tell you in advance,

606
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,319
will you kill Gao Chengxian for real?

607
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,680
I admit

608
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,400
I did strive for a quick buck.

609
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,319
And I should know

610
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,400
you are quick-tempered from childhood.

611
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,759
You aren't angry any longer?

612
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,519
You are my brother.

613
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,920
How can I be angry with you?

614
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,160
I am sorry, Second Brother.

615
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,440
All right.

616
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,279
Have a seat inside.

617
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,799
I will go back to Su City tomorrow

618
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:08,799
and take Yun to Hanjing.

619
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,000
What about you?

620
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,160
I will go back

621
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,119
with Second Brother tomorrow.

622
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,000
It seems that

623
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,920
your National Granary program
has been planned.

624
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,920
But in the cage of Hanjing,

625
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,039
how do you

626
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,039
leisurely stay out of political intrigue?

627
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,920
If there is someone
traveling with me sincerely,

628
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,759
I can be leisured wherever I am.

629
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,079
Nice word.

630
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:42,279
Here.

631
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,000
I toast you.

632
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,240
For what?

633
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,000
May you live up to
your original aspirations

634
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,839
when riding the winds and waves.

635
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,000
I toast you as well.

636
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,920
May you accompany your love all the way

637
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,319
as the moon does.

638
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,799
See you in Hanjing.

639
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,400
See you in Hanjing.

640
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
As Gao Chengxian died,

641
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,519
I fret Prince Yi will take actions.

642
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,559
We got the evidence of his corruption.

643
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,920
So we can give advice to His Majesty

644
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,400
with the evidence.

645
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,400
Assassinators!

646
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,200
Second Brother, run.

647
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,759
Save the evidence on the horsecar.

648
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,599
Second Brother, take it.

649
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,440
Your Highness, the horsecar is on fire.

650
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,599
The evidence.

651
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,160
What are you doing?

652
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,240
The evidence is inside.

653
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,839
It's late.

654
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,559
Don't care about your life?

655
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,319
Your Highness.

656
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,400
Zhaolie.

657
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,720
Zhaolie.

658
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,799
Zhaolie.

659
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:19,920
Zhaolie.

660
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,599
Zhaolie.

661
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:22,920
Zhaolie.

662
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,000
Your Highness.

663
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,160
Do watch out for Prince Yi.

664
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,559
Zhaolie.

665
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,119
What a pity.

666
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:32,680
I can't

667
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,519
see you achieve your great cause.

668
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,400
Zhaolie.

669
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,319
Your Highness.

670
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,200
All the evidence is ruined.

671
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,400
How do we identify Prince Yi?

672
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,799
Even if it's for Zhaolie,

673
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,880
I will have a try

674
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,119
at whatever costs.

675
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,839
Miss has regained trust

676
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:09,799
from Prince Qing.

677
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,119
Why are you still preoccupied?

678
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,279
Mu Ze is sinister and suspicious.

679
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,559
Were it not for

680
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,440
keeping the Lu Family above water,

681
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,559
I will never

682
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,960
go back to Hanjing, and by his side

683
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,440
whatever happens.

684
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,640
Only I enter the Mansion of Prince Qing

685
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,680
will I be able to

686
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,960
find the key to the conundrum.

687
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,119
Your Majesty,

688
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,000
Gao Chengxian robbed the famine relief

689
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,599
with the disguise of a river robber.

690
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,200
I have executed him.

691
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,839
As for Qin Yekuo,

692
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,759
he has indulged Gao Chengxian

693
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,880
to wreak havoc in Danzhou for years.

694
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
In every links,

695
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,599
misprison exists.

696
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,359
Hope Your Majesty look into it.

697
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,519
Your Majesty.

698
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,240
Everyone knows Qin Yekuo

699
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,359
is my uncle.

700
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:06,119
Prince Qing seems to try to drag me down.

701
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Anyway,

702
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,000
you've made contributions

703
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,839
when you thoroughly investigated
the famine relief robbery.

704
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,680
I bestow you a thousand tael silver

705
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
and a hundred silks and satins.

706
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,880
But

707
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,200
there was Gao Chengxian,

708
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,720
an arrogant criminal,

709
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,079
in Qin Yekuo's jurisdiction.

710
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,279
Order him to insepect by himself now.

711
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,720
Your Majesty.

712
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,599
Don't discuss it anymore.

713
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,279
I heard Chuan is back.

714
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,200
Call for him to meet me.

715
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,680
Call for His Highness Ninth Prince to present.

716
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,599
Your Majesty.

717
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:50,640
There you up.

718
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,599
Thank you, Your Majesty.

719
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:53,839
Chuan.

720
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,599
You have been left for days.

721
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,640
You must stay here for longer

722
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,680
this time.

723
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,119
I am here

724
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,559
to show your Majesty something.

725
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:05,640
Okay.

726
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,880
National Granary.

727
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,840
This is the new cereal I cultivated.

728
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,440
Every grain is full and perfect.

729
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,480
I think

730
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,559
the number of grains on the ears

731
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,000
is much more than the number of those

732
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,039
offered by
the Department of Agriculture.

733
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,840
The cereal was cultivated

734
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,719
from the wild rice

735
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,760
I found accidentally.

736
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,920
But it was grown with
severely restricted water and soil.

737
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,000
I am still doing research.

738
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
If I succeed,

739
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,559
National Granary isn't an empty talk

740
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,320
with the help of
water conservation promoted everywhere

741
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,599
that brought fields back to civilians.

742
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,280
Great. Great.

743
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,199
You don't make disputes

744
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,440
and care about civilians.

745
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,679
You are a good kid.

746
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:57,840
I am flattered, Your Majesty.

747
00:34:59,039 --> 00:34:59,440
How about this?

748
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,599
I order you to set questions
for the Spring Imperial Exam

749
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,519
and select some talents

750
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,239
for yourslef by the way.

751
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,360
Your Majesty.

752
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,960
How could it be possible?

753
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:12,840
Ninth Prince is just an idle prince.

754
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,360
How can he shoulder the responsibility?

755
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,119
Chuan, thank your brother now.

756
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,760
He reminds me.

757
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,960
Yes.

758
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,039
How can you take the great responsibility

759
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,599
without an official post?

760
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,920
I declare an imperial decree

761
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,159
that Ninth Prince Mu Chuan
is bestowed Prince Qi

762
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,519
and responsible for agriculture
and water conservation.

763
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,199
Thank you, Your Majesty.

764
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,760
I will live up to it.

765
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,280
There you up.

766
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:50,599
As you are Prince Qi now,

767
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
you need a mansion.

768
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,199
I bestow the mansion on the Anping Street

769
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,280
to you.

770
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

771
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,519
All right. All right.

772
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,880
My father

773
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,239
is really biased.

774
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,679
Our Prince Qing

775
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,480
went to Danzhou,

776
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,679
a deserted place,

777
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,000
catching bandits and finding famine relief.

778
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,679
He is thinner for exhaustion.

779
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,559
But it turned out

780
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,639
His Majesty just gave him the runaround.

781
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,760
Worse than Ninth Brother, though,

782
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,239
who traveled around Dahan.

783
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,920
The latter is bestowed a prince title

784
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,719
with shoddy rice from nowhere.

785
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,639
You are upset, right?

786
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
When you try to trip me up,

787
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,760
think yourself first

788
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,840
that what it is yourself

789
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,719
in His Majesty's mind.

790
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,960
You lost a head start in setting questions
for the Spring Imperial Exam.

791
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,400
Lost a stream of funds either.

792
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,840
Won't Imperial Noble Consort blame you?

793
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,079
Don't be complacent.

794
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Do you think His Majesty

795
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,239
would change his minds on you

796
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,400
even if you did this?

797
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,599
But it turned out

798
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:08,239
inspecting by my uncle himself.

799
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,719
Try to hurt me?

800
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,840
Save your time, Second Brother.

801
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,199
Go back first.

802
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,159
I want to give it another try.

803
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,119
Second Brother.

804
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,039
Go back.

805
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,039
Your Majesty, Prince Qing
is asking to meet you.

806
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,280
Don't know it's for what

807
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,760
that High Higness doesn't dress formally.

808
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:05,679
Call him in.

809
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,079
Call.

810
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:23,440
Greet

811
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Your Majesty.

812
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:27,400
Still come for the Danzhou issue?

813
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,000
Your Majesty,

814
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,079
yes.

815
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,800
Don't discuss it anymore.

816
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:32,880
There you off.

817
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,679
Your Majesty.

818
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,400
I have brought

819
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,760
the evidence

820
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,559
that Prince Yi and Qin Yekuo

821
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,639
asked Gao Chengxian to grab money

822
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,559
back to Hanjing.

823
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,000
But I didn't expect on the way,

824
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,440
we got robbed.

825
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,960
All the bodyguards were dead.

826
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,519
Ninth Brother and I

827
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,360
almost died.

828
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,519
Your Majesty.

829
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
I still want to say

830
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,280
Qin Yekuo

831
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:13,920
owns

832
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,440
countless helpers

833
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
like Gao Chengxian.

834
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,519
They are nibbling away at Dahan

835
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,840
like maggots.

836
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,519
If Your Majesty sits back,

837
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,679
Dahan

838
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,400
will leave nothing sooner or later.

839
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,880
Your Majesty.

840
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,199
You did well

841
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,719
during this trip.

842
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,239
Take

843
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,679
what I rewarded you.

844
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,719
Never mind

845
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,280
other things anymore.

846
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:03,840
Just leave.

847
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,159
Your Majesty.

848
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,920
Why is that?

849
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,679
Is your appeal

850
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,960
for the country for real,

851
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:25,000
or anything else?

852
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,960
Your Majesty. What do you mean?

853
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,480
For the Danzhou issue,

854
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,320
many officials
made statements to me recently.

855
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,559
They said you were upright,

856
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,199
well versed in both
literature and martial arts,

857
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,280
as well as military strategy.

858
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,679
You can not only
fight desperately on battlefields,

859
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:48,159
but also pay attention to civilians.

860
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,000
You do look like

861
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,039
a sagely prince.

862
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,320
But now,

863
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,320
you make use of your injury

864
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,679
to force me

865
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,159
to deal with Prince Yi.

866
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,639
Are you too anxious?

867
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,039
Your Majesty is perceptive.

868
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,920
All I do is for justice, rules, and laws,

869
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,119
and to let civilians feel at ease.

870
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,239
Justice, rules, and laws.

871
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,400
Consort Liang hid your parentage

872
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,559
from me for years.

873
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,519
Do you think

874
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,679
I don't know for real?

875
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:45,199
Be Prince Qing well.

876
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:47,920
Rest well.

877
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,440
As for other things,

878
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,400
never

879
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,599
consider them anymore.

880
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,559
Leave.

881
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,400
Mu Ze is my child now.

882
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,400
Should you try to ask him back?

883
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,599
Your Highness.

884
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,920
I didn't.

885
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,320
If you dare to say anything,

886
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,880
he will die for sure.

887
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,360
Be Prince Qing well.

888
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,840
Rest well.

889
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,719
As for other things,

890
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,480
never

891
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:18,280
consider them anymore.

892
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,039
Your Highness,

893
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,840
are you going to

894
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,920
review these military strategies again?

895
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
I believe every word

896
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,639
on every book

897
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:42,320
is all in your minds.

898
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:52,800
Don't know
how the Gao Xiancheng issue is going

899
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:54,679
after you went to His Majesty?

900
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,960
♪The abyss drowns the ego♪

901
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:10,390
♪To be a king and to lose is just a struggle for desire♪

902
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:17,460
♪Complaining is just a rope for the weak♪

903
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,079
♪Binding the weakness of each time♪

904
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:24,119
What military merits?

905
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,880
What miliary efforts?

906
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,159
All of these are futile.

907
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,720
♪I have never given up♪

908
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,560

♪And yet, only darkness is mine♪

911
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:44,320
Your Highness.

912
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:49,280
Your Highness, what is going on?

913
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,360
Whatever it is begging for mercy,

914
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,360
or striving for the best,

915
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,519
all is wishful thinking.

916
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:58,199
All the results

917
00:44:58,519 --> 00:44:59,840
are arranged

918
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,719
in advance.

919
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,519
Your Highness, what is going on?

920
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:09,599
Today, when I met His Majesty,

921
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:11,719
he looked me

922
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,320
with loathing.

923
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,199
I know he dislikes me,

924
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,199
so whatever I do

925
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:22,800
is in vain.

926
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:24,800
All is in vain.

927
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,119
Mind youru injury. Take care.

928
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,159
Your Highness.

929
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,199
Are you doing all this

930
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,559
only for

931
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:36,039
His Majesty's admiration?

932
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,599
I think

933
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,239
the great cause you are striving for

934
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:44,639
is to be immortal.

935
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,599
To keep your own destiny

936
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:47,679
from being controled by others.

937
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,559
What you strive for

938
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,199
is the supreme position.

939
00:45:58,519 --> 00:45:59,880
Zhaolie just died.

940
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,519
He is watching us in Heaven.

941
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:08,960
You are right.

942
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,960
The ties of royal kinship

943
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:15,239
is the utmost cold and distant.

944
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,199
Now,

945
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:20,880
one has no emotion.

946
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,480
And the other

947
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:24,800
tries to kill me to death.

948
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,679
Why should I

949
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,519
be prim and proper?
