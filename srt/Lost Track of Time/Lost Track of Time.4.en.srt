2
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,599
Miss.

3
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,479
What's wrong with you?

4
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,120
Miss.

5
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,120
Miss.

6
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,560
Oh no.

7
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,120
Miss is dazed by the bombing.

8
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,599
What do we do?

9
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,000
It's her hair-pinning ceremony tomorrow.

10
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,680
What do we do?

11
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,080
Hair-pinning ceremony?

12
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,159
Tomorrow?

13
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,319
Tomorrow is my hair-pinning ceremony?

14
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,479
Shan Yue, we are toast.

15
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,919
Miss suffers memory loss.

16
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,919
Look at miss.

17
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,039
She looks weird.

18
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,400
She seems to don't know us.

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,919
What are you saying?

20
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,919
Miss. Miss.

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,319
Something's wrong over there.

22
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,280
Seems to be river robbers

23
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,479
stealing a ship.

24
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:03,960
What should we do, Miss?

25
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,520
What else should we do, idiot?

26
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,360
Run now.

27
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,080
Keep going ahead.

28
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,520
Fetch me one more mine.

29
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,199
Hurry up.

30
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,319
Miss.

31
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,360
Leave the rescue to Shan Yue

32
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,280
and others.

33
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,039
You can't do martial arts.

34
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,759
It's too dangerous.

35
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,919
Who says I am going to rescue?

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,120
I want to check somethings.

37
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:30,719
Miss.

38
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,810
(Lu)

39
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,280
I am going to kill you.

40
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,360
Miss.

41
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,079
Are you alright?

42
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,720
It is not a dream.

43
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,160
I came back for real.

44
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,120
Are you okay?

45
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,920
I'm okay.

46
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,920
Miss,

47
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,720
you fought me proactively

48
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,240
with flaws.

49
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,160
Are you going to kill me desperately?

50
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,759
I'll protect you and your family

51
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,160
with my life.

52
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,120
You are my everything.

53
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,759
I fell for you instantly

54
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,600
when I first met you.

55
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,040
Miss?

56
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,560
Miss?

57
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,279
Since black smoke billowed

58
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,040
after I threw River Dragon,

59
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,800
I couldn't tell friends from foes

60
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,480
for my poor sight.

61
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,560
I got the wrong one.

62
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,920
Is that true?

63
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,560
What do you think?

64
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,000
Miss.

65
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,439
Cry later.

66
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
As you came from afar, Hanjing,

67
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,279
you must not come for business, right?

68
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,800
How do you know

69
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,240
we are from Hanjing?

70
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,680
Low-profile as your ship is,

71
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,439
it is made of first-class teak.

72
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,839
Teak is not the best material

73
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,800
for business ship

74
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,560
because ships made of teak

75
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,920
have a such small load
that they can't ship much.

76
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,319
And your bodyguards

77
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,040
don't seem like common shipping escorts.

78
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,240
I can tell

79
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,360
from their moves.

80
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,519
Especially for this little guard,

81
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,600
his moves don't like
those used in Jianghu.

82
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,800
He must

83
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
learn martial arts

84
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,160
from the nobles in Hangjing.

85
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,160
I learned a bit

86
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,399
from my elder brother.

87
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,720
Miss looks

88
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,120
extraordinary

89
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,279
and knowledgeable.

90
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,160
Not like a common woman either.

91
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,199
May I have your name?

92
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,959
Even though knowing my name,

93
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,600
you may not meet me again.

94
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,639
As Jianghu is like a jungle,

95
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,319
even if you have tricks,

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,439
you shall tread carefully.

97
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,199
Farewell.

98
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,399
Although she is from the Lu Family,

99
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,319
she is too arrogant.

100
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,120
Mr. Cai found out as well.

101
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,120
The double fish patterns on the sails

102
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,240
is exactly the sign of the Lu Family.

103
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,519
I am afraid

104
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,240
that woman

105
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,199
is Lu Qingzhou's daughter,

106
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,199
Lu Anran.

107
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,759
It is said that since she was a girl,

108
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,680
she has built channels

109
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,959
and ports everywhere

110
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,000
with Lu Qingzhou.

111
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,079
She must take charge of the Lu Family

112
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,399
in the future.

113
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,720
But as she acts like this,

114
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,920
it is hard for us to collaborate.

115
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,680
If it is that easy,

116
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
Prince Yi

117
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,279
wouldn't hit the wall for times.

Fought in the martial arts club again, right?

158
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,919
You can't go there anymore.

159
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,039
Why?

160
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,519

170
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,639
Why?

171
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,759
You asked me to learn martial arts.

172
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,159
True, Anran.

173
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,159
It was you

174
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,879
who found a martial arts club for Yun.

Mom.

176
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,320
I have figured it out.

177
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,360
In this world,

178
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,600
men can benefit civilians

179
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,000
by not only safeguarding the country,

180
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,559
but also carrying forward family business

181
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,960
as businessmen

182
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,039
who care about the world.

183
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,039
Sis,

184
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,320
you changed.

185
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,679
Before you went, you asked me

186
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,960
to beat down the second son
of Ministry Councillor Sun.

187
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,759
Yun.

188
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,960
It is for your own good.

189
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:05,799
Listen.

190
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,639
No way.

191
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,039
I want to be a great general!

192
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,720
Yun.

193
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,559
Yun.

194
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,759
Mom.

195
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,120
Yun.

196
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,159
Go back to have a rest.

197
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,000
♪I will turn the tide regardless♪

198
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,120
I am okay.

199
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,300
♪if I stick to what I wish♪

200
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
♪a staunch figure♪

201
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,480
Lingxi.

202
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:31,639
Go to the kitchen.

203
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,039
Take out the dregs
of the herbal medicines my mom had.

204
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,559
Ask a doctor outside

205
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,519
to check them whether they are wrong.

206
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,799
Remember.

207
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,879
Don't let anyone
in the Lu's Mansion find out.

208
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,240
Miss,

209
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,799
why do you check the medicine dregs?

210
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,480
You are so wierd today.

211
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,399
Since mom doesn't recover for long,

212
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,799
I have to do something.

213
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,039
Right,

214
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,159
check what mom eats every day too.

215
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Tell Yuzhu

216
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,080
anything mom takes

217
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,840
must pass the silver needle test.

218
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,840
There you go.

219
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,679
I will protect you well.

220
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,840
This time,

221
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,879
I won't let you get injured.

222
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,320
Anran.

223
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,000
Sis.

224
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,080
You are back.

225
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,919
It's been a long time.

226
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,360
I dreamed about
Second Madam and sister last night.

227
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,200
What did you

228
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,080
dream about yesterday?

229
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,240
The Lu Family followed a wrong host

230
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,399
who decided to kill the contributors

231
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,399
after he made a success.

232
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,039
All the people form the Lu Family

233
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,919
were guillotined in the end.

234
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:44,840
Anran,

235
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
you can't curse the Lu Family like this.

236
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,879
Right, sister.

237
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,840
Dreams...

238
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,600
Dreams are opposite to reality.

239
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,559
Yes.

240
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,039
This time,

241
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,919
it must be opposite.

242
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,000
Royalties are the cruelest.

243
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,240
Once involved in the royal intrigue,

244
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,320
I am not sure the Lu Family

245
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,759
will manage to escape the annihilation.

246
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,080
This time,

247
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,639
I will never let it happen again.

248
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,720
Miss,

249
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,000
the zhuanghua satin
embroidered with gold threads suit

250
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,159
prepared by Second Madam is so exquisite.

251
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,320
It is no worse than the suit

252
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,639
you dressed on the hair-pinning ceremony.

253
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,159
Miss will definitely shine through

254
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,000
at the banquet later.

255
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,519
Second Madam is scrupulous indeed.

256
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,879
Gentle and obedient.

257
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:19,799
We can't find a defect

258
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,000
over the years.

259
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,200
What?

260
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,519
Such a beautiful suit.

261
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
It is such a pity

262
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,639
if I admire it alone.

263
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,960
Go.

264
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,120
Ask Miss Xinran to come.

265
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,440
Yes.

266
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,399
How can you

267
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,039
let a green girl

268
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,039
master the Lu Family?

269
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,519
Everyone,

270
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,679
today is my daughter's birthday.

271
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
With the first glass of wine,

272
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,399
I, Lu,

273
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,960
propose a toast to you.

274
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,839
Master Lu, you are welcome.

275
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:10,839
With the second glass of wine...

276
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,599
Dad.

277
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,640
Stop being pedantic.

278
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,519
The managers of 36 ports are all here.

279
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,200
Are you going to announce

280
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,640
something important?

281
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,200
You kid

282
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,720
is anxious indeed.

283
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,400
Come.

284
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,319
Today,

285
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,799
I don't

286
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,960
beat around the bush.

287
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,400
I proclaim

288
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,200
from now on...

289
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,640
I am reluctant to see you get married.

290
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,720
Take the Double Fish Order

291
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,759
as my birthday present

292
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,640
for you.

293
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:48,920
In the future,

294
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,640
with the Lu Family as your backup,

295
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,599
you won't be inferior

296
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,960
even after you tie the knot.

297
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,799
...is the host of the 36 ports

298
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,839
and the only heir

299
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,880
of the Lu Family business.

300
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,880
Happy birthday to Miss!

301
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,799
Wish you all the best!

302
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,319
Anran,

303
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,000
I leave the Lu Family

304
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,880
to you now.

305
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,000
Congratulations.

306
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,799
True. The business will be carried forward.

307
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:19,960
Right.

308
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,039
Congratulations to Miss.

309
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:22,960
Congratulations to the head.

310
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,680
Congratulations to Miss.

311
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,039
Congratulations.

312
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,079
Dad.

313
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,440
I swear to protect the Lu Family.

314
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,519
Congratulations to Miss.

315
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,000
Congratulations.

316
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,920
Congratulations to Miss.

317
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,160
Wait a second.

318
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,759
Second Uncle,

319
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,720
I know you have a word.

320
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,559
The Lu Family's business

321
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,000
passing to a woman

322
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:51,920
makes you, a man,

323
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,079
feel offensive,

324
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:53,839
right?

325
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:54,640
You...

326
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,799
I just

327
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,359
feel sorry for Yun.

328
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,480
Since Second Uncle is so righteous,

329
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,960
please show us

330
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:03,920
what contributions you have made

331
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,039
for the Lu Family?

332
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,200
What do you mean?

333
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,200
Dad,

334
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,920
two ships of Second Uncle

335
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,160
wrecked last month

336
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,680
because the shipmen of both ships

337
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,480
mishandled in rough sea.

338
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,880
Shan Yue.

339
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,680
Miss.

340
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,519
Second Master's ships

341
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,000
do have something.

342
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,519
Under the decks,

343
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
there are cabins

344
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,559
where a large amount of food lie,

345
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,480
as well as tea and cloth.

346
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,279
You.

347
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,200
Seeing from now,

348
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,799
I fret that the greedy Second Uncle

349
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,759
violated to overload,

350
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,240
which led to the disasters.

351
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,039
You...

352
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,960
You talked nonsense.

353
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,759
I will look into it in person.

354
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,519
I will never wrong you.

355
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,200
Big brother.

356
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,680
Big brother.

357
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,759
It's my bad, big brother.

358
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,720
Please forgive me.

359
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,400
Big brother.

360
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:45,519
You knowingly

361
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,559
caused the deaths.

362
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,920
So detestable.

363
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,160
From today,

364
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,559
you have nothing to do with

365
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:51,759
the Lu Family.

366
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,160
Big brother.

367
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,079
Big brother.

368
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:55,920
Second Madam,

369
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,680
say something for me.

370
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,480
How can we forgive you

371
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:01,880
as you made such a wrongdoing?

372
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,160
Guards.

373
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Take him out.

374
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,680
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

375
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,640
Second Madam.

376
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,480
Big brother.

377
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,200
Big brother.

378
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,200
Big brother.

379
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
Big brother. Big brother.

380
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,119
Big brother.

381
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,359
Big brother.

382
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,680
Please forgive me, big brother.

383
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,039
You deserve it.

384
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,039
Deserve it.

385
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,160
Miss Lu.

386
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,079
Mr. Cai.

387
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,039
Why don't you send her
a shoddy flower box

388
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,759
that contains seasonal fresh flowers?

389
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,039
In this way,

390
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,680
you can win her smiles.

391
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,400
What are you doing, Miss Lu?

392
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,240
What brings you here?

393
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,880
I am here

394
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,240
to celebrate your birthday

395
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,079
following my master.

396
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,799
But I didn't expect

397
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
the enthusiastic girl

398
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,799
on the boat

399
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,799
was Miss Lu.

400
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,440
Didn't expect such a coincidence

401
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,400
that we met again.

402
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,119
A coincidence?

403
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,440
It is such a big scene today.

404
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,960
All the people in Su City

405
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,039
must know me,

406
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,119
the famous first daughter of Lu.

407
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:53,680
Why do you

408
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,079
come after me?

409
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,920
Nowadays, the Lu Family

410
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,039
has ruled

411
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,640
all the waterways of Dahan.

412
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,119
Miss Lu

413
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,799
won't stop there now, right?

414
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,400
Here is a little present.

415
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Hope you like it.

416
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,119
This is Dahan River Map.

417
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,759
Hope Miss Lu likes it.

418
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:53,799
It was I who led my fleets

419
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,559
to build the channels of Dahan

420
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,119
inch by inch.

421
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,200
Things at my fingertips

422
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,319
are less impressive than those I gain

423
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,000
after I tread mountains and rivers.

424
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,599
So that every mountains
and hills are in my mind.

425
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,960
Miss Lu,

426
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,359
did I

427
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,880
offend you?

428
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,759
Why are you hostile to me?

429
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:14,960
Well, then.

430
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,960
Tell me honestly,

431
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,880
who are you on earth?

432
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Your Highness Prince Qing.

433
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,359
Is it fun?

434
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,400
You even want to align with me

435
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,880
with no sincerity

436
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,400
to show your true identity.

437
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,359
Don't you think it is hilarious?

438
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,119
Miss Lu

439
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,960
did observe meticulously.

440
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,720
Seems I did something superfluous.

441
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,319
Please excuse me
for not seeing Your Highness Prince Qing off.

442
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,319
Miss.

443
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,240
Shan Yue is here.

444
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,680
Miss,

445
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,039
what can I do for you?

446
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,559
I am afraid

447
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
Second Uncle won't submit

448
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,319
to be expelled from the Lu Family.

449
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,119
Shan Yue,

450
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,680
send someone

451
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,240
to spy on him these days,

452
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,279
in case he schemes against us.

453
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,279
Yes, Miss.

454
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,759
Miss,

455
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,880
are you alright?

456
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,720
Where are you going, Miss?

457
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,839
Tavern.

458
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:11,880
Miss,

459
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,519
why didn't you tell me in advance

460
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,880
you had poisoned the suit?

461
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:15,720
Look.

462
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,200
Look.

463
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,720
What if my face

464
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,640
has scars afterwards?

465
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,799
I didn't finish the suit
until this morning,

466
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,160
so I didn't get a chance to inform you.

467
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,400
But you instead.

468
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,480
Did you desire for the limelight so much?

469
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,079
As today is the birthday ceremony

470
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,039
of Lu Anran,

471
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,519
people would gossip about you

472
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,319
if your dress attracts their attention.

473
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,319
I have taught you

474
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,240
to keep low-profile.

475
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,799
In one ear and out the other.

476
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,880
I have hidden it for long.

477
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,960
I can't wait anymore.

478
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,839
You have to wait even if you can't

479
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,839
because you weren't born
by the first madam.

480
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,480
I have looked down on that crazy girl.

481
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,079
Today,

482
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,119
she not only managed

483
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,720
to kick Lu Yan out of the Lu Family,

484
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,640
but also enhanced her prestige

485
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,079
among 36 ports' managers.

486
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,440
From now on,

487
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,240
I am afraid it will be harder

488
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,880
to grab a piece of pie from her.

489
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,279
I always feel she was strange today.

490
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,119
Especially when she looked at me.

491
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,880
She looks considerate

492
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,200
but with coldness.

493
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,640
Miss is right.

494
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,119
I think so.

495
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,680
She seemed to prepare for

496
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,319
our actions.

497
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,279
She's just a green girl.

498
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,200
What's the fear?

499
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,720
But you.

500
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,240
I asked you

501
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,799
to send a sachet

502
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,880
to Mr. Cai.

503
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,039
Have you sent one?

504
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,200
Mr. Cai loves it.

505
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,640
Remember.

506
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,799
Write to him often.

507
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,759
You must grasp

508
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,680
this special guest from Hanjing.

509
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,519
He is Prince Qing's most trusted follower

510
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:54,319
who boasts unlimited prospects.

511
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,160
If you walk down the aisle with him,

512
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,480
Lu Anran

513
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,759
won't have a say any longer.

514
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,119
I get it, mom.

515
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,200
I will try hard.

516
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,240
Being drunk helps reduce anxiety.

517
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,519
It is so true.

518
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,599
Forget the present

519
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,640
and the past.

520
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,480
Table them until I live it up.

521
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,519
Look, I always have good taste.

522
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,880
Why was I deceived by the shameless man

523
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,319
for years?

524
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,680
Miss,

525
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,759
as you are wise,

526
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,519
which blind one dares to frame you?

527
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,839
Too many.

528
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,759
So many hypocrisies.

529
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,279
I can't stand them for real.

530
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,279
Miss,

531
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,519
are you alright?

532
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,960
Don't make me worry.

533
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:16,559
Lingxi.

534
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,839
Fortunately, you are by my side.

535
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,720
You shall stay with me forever.

536
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,400
Are you drunk as a skunk?

537
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,680
Let me find a horsecar

538
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,039
to send you back.

539
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,759
Waiter, one more bottle of wine.

540
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,000
All right.

541
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:47,839
Miss,

542
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,480
are you okay?

543
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,920
Bastard.

544
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,640
Miss,

545
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,519
still have a headache?

546
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,400
What was wrong that night?

547
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,079
I just drank a few jars of wine.

548
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,640
It's been three days.

549
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,440
Why do I still feel dizzy?

550
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,240
That is because in the Tusu wine,

551
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,839
I added Bamboo Leaf Green liquor,

552
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:27,400
Catch You In Three Steps,

553
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,240
Nu Er Hong wine,

554
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,119
Autumn White Dew rice wine,

555
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:29,960
and...

556
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:31,440
Anyway, there are many kinds.

557
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,720
A jar of my special drink
prevails over ten jars of straight one.

558
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,640
It is strong indeed.

559
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,400
Lingxi,

560
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,960
are you dissatisfied with me?

561
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:39,680
Didn't you say

562
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,240
you wanted to drink till you are drunk.

563
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,680
Normal wines

564
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,200
can't make you drunk.

565
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,640
I have to share your distress, right?

566
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:47,920
Miss,

567
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,920
am I awesome?

568
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,440
Yes, you are.

569
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,400
So awesome.

570
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,519
Right, Miss,

571
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,079
I have checked

572
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,079
Madam's medicines

573
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,119
and all she ate.

574
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,480
No problem at all.

575
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,559
Do you overthink it?

576
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Since I confirmed Liu Mingyu

577
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,200
did something to my suit,

578
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,519
I staunchly believe

579
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
that my mom's illness
isn't a coincidence.

580
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,119
What else can we look into?

581
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,400
There will always be flaws

582
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,319
in clothing, food,
accommodation, and transportation.

583
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:23,799
Miss.

584
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,079
Fat is in the fire.

585
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,400
Second Master recently

586
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,240
met Prince Yi's men secretly

587
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,359
for several times.

588
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:30,640
I saw them

589
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,279
taking a person sneakly

590
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,319
to the wharf.

591
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,839
The one looks familiar.

592
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,039
It struck me

593
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:37,599
that he is the robber

594
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,160
on the most wanted list.

595
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,119
Do you think

596
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,799
they are going to do anything bad?

597
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,000
Even a worm will turn.

598
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,759
He hid the robber purposely

599
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,720
to set up my dad.

600
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,240
He knew harbouring a criminal
is a death penalty.

601
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:00,960
If it is the thing,

602
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,680
the Lu Family will not
be able to make it clear.

603
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,160
Prince Yi's men got involved

604
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,079
to cash in on as well.

605
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,319
After Second Uncle succeeds,

606
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,039
he can take over the Lu Family then.

607
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:16,640
Then...

608
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,119
Then what should we do?

609
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,079
Let's address it in two ways.

610
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,599
Find some reliable shipmen

611
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,039
to investigate the wharf secretly.

612
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,000
I will go find the magistrate

613
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,039
to see if I can

614
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:27,880
report the crime

615
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,839
in the name of the Lu Family.

616
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,880
(Country Government)

617
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,440
Miss.

618
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,240
Miss.

619
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:46,880
How's it?

620
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,400
Nearly a hundred ships of businesses
from everywhere

621
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
came for your celebration.

622
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,200
We can't search it in high profile,

623
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,200
so we have to check it secretly.

624
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,279
In this way,

625
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,319
we can't find out anything

626
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,599
in a dozen of days.

627
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,119
They don't let me in either.

628
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,880
Might be bought by Prince Yi's men.

629
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,720
They want to put the crime

630
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,799
on my dad.

631
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,640
I fret that after a dozen of days,

632
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,079
my dad will be in prison.

633
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,599
Don't we have other choices?

634
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,720
Do you think

635
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,920
I will be cornered?

636
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:14,880
There is someone

637
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,359
who must be willing to help me

638
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,240
cope with the crisis.

639
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,799
What winds bring

640
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:56,799
Miss Lu here?

641
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,480
I am crystal clear

642
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,480
about why Your Highness came to Su City.

643
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,119
Prince Yi sent men

644
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,599
to Su City after your arrival.

645
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,039
As for his aim,

646
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Your Highness knows it well.

647
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,680
The Lu Family'd prefer not to get embroiled
in the court's wrangle.

648
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,920
So, we didn't do what he wanted us to.

649
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,759
Prince Yi seems to

650
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,480
embarrass the Lu Family this time.

651
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,720
I think Your Highness
must know better about

652
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,680
and take greater advantage of

653
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,880
these political measures than I do.

654
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,200
Prince Yi has tripped the Lu Family up

655
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,759
for times.

656
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,079
But these

657
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,279
could be handled with money,

658
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,319
so we didn't care about them.

659
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:38,839
But this time...

660
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,599
This time,

661
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,920
I am afraid it is not easy.

662
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,839
The Lu Family will make up our minds

663
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,480
depending on your actions.

664
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,519
I will resolve

665
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,240
your conundrum.

666
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,799
I promise

667
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,119
as long as I, Lu Anran,

668
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,640
stay in the Lu Family,

669
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,240
we won't join the Prince Yi.

670
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,839
And if only your requirements

671
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,000
benefit civilians,

672
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,320
the Lu Family will consider them.

673
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,500
(Lu's Mansion)

674
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,639
Lingxi, stop swirling.

675
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,960
The issue can be dealt with indeed.

676
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,119
Miss,

677
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:20,920
can we...

678
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,280
Can we go check the wharf?

679
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,639
I can't.

680
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,559
If I go,

681
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,840
it will warn them.

682
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,119
I want them

683
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,440
to think they planned well

684
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,519
without mistakes.

685
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,039
Miss.

686
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,880
Miss.

687
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,559
How's it?

688
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,880
All right?

689
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,360
Yes.

690
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,960
When His Highness Prince Qing went there,

691
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,239
he said Master reported the robber

692
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,480
fled to the wharf.

693
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,880
And asked the garrison to search.

694
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Second Master stood their,

695
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,079
not daring to say a word.

696
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,800
But that was close.

697
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:45,760
Not for a while,

698
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,800
the magistrate took attendants there.

699
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,440
He couldn't do anything

700
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,880
but to ask attendants to do the same.

701
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,480
It turned out that
they did find the robber

702
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,679
in the ship.

703
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,119
So jubilant.

704
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,119
Thanks to you.

705
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,920
Were it not for you

706
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,239
who found out Second Uncle's rigging,

707
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,280
there would be a catastrophe.

708
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,360
Well,

709
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,039
Miss,

710
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,360
any rewards?

711
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,119
Do you want this?

712
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,079
Miss. Miss.

713
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,239
Miss.

714
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,480
Something's wrong.

715
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,159
Miss.

716
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:11,880
Miss.

717
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,440
Something's wrong.

718
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,400
Miss.

719
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,239
You must help us.

720
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,519
This brat.

721
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,800
He should look down on us!

722
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,639
Our Miss is righteous.

723
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:33,039
She backs you up every time.

724
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,519
I will knock his teeth out

725
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,800
later on.

726
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,519
Right.

727
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,960
Don't pull them. Don't pull them.

728
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,239
Don't pull them.

729
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,159
Stop pulling them all.

730
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:47,960
Stop it.

731
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,119
Stop pulling.

732
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,599
We grew them with efforts.

733
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,760
Miss Lu's here.

734
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,519
Miss Lu.

735
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,079
Miss Lu.

736
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,119
Miss Lu's here.

737
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Stop, you.

738
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,719
Don't pull.

739
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,400
The seedlings are sick for real.

740
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,239
You are sick instead.

741
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,159
Don't pull.

742
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,079
Stop pulling.

743
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,079
It's you.

744
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,840
Do you remember me?

745
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,519
Don't you remember?

746
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,519
That night,

747
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:13,639
you tormented me hard.

748
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,199
What's the nonsense?

749
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,280
This is my first time to meet you
when I came back.

750
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:22,760
Forget it.

751
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,559
Well,

752
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,840
the priority is the rice seeddlings.

753
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,159
The rice seedings are sick for real.

754
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:35,639
Inside the rice seedlings,

755
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,320
there are things like spider webs.

756
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,320
Here. Take a look.

757
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,239
Here.

758
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:40,920
Check them.

759
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,239
It's true.

760
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,880
They are sick for real.

761
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,679
And they will infect.

762
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:45,920
Here.

763
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,719
Pull them as he orders.

764
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,440
Move your body.

765
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,519
Okay. Okay.

766
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,719
Chop. Chop.

767
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,159
I didn't expect it.

768
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,559
Yes.

769
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,599
So strange.

770
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:57,880
Pull them.

771
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,800
Steamed glutinous rice
and pork ribs in lotus leaf.

772
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,760
Stir-fried shrimp in dragon well tea.

773
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,840
West lake fish in vinegar gravy.

774
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,039
Giant meatballs with crab.

775
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:17,960
Wensi tofu.

776
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:18,840
All right.

777
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:19,679
Hold on.

778
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,000
Leave the fish and meatballs

779
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,840
out.

780
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,960
Two people. Two meats and one vegetable.

781
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,840
That is enough.

782
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:26,840
No wasting.

783
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,239
Okay.

784
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,960
Why are you looking at me like this?

785
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,719
I am curious whether

786
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,960
the one in the tarvern

787
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,840
who mistook me as a heartbreaker

788
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,800
is the same person

789
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,840
as the Miss Rich gave orders today?

790
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:54,360
I can't remember.

791
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,639
If only you remember it,

792
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,760
then it doesn't count.

793
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,679
You even play dirty like this.

794
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,800
Alright.

795
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,199
I drink this up

796
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,159
for apologizing.

797
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,079
Ok?

798
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,840
But I remember nothing indeed.

799
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,360
Did I do anything

800
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,480
wild?

801
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,679
Nothing wild.

802
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,239
Just almost took my life.

803
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,599
Miss, you got the wrong one.

804
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,000
Leave alone your ingratitude

805
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,440
despite my wholeheartedness.

806
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,920
Why did you

807
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,039
wipe all my family out?

808
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Hadn't we aided you enough?

809
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
We gave you money and ships

810
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,800
as you demanded.

811
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,480
But you executed all my family in return.

812
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,039
So inhuman you are.

813
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,159
Miss. Miss.

814
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,000
Calm down. We could talk it through.

815
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,519
You tore my family apart.

816
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,280
And you are here now.

817
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,159
I won't let you get your wishes.

818
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,239
What did I do on earth?

819
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,199
You

820
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,199
pulled your hairpin and tried to kill me.

821
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:54,880
Do you remember?

822
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,360
Indeed, drinking's harmful.

823
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,039
Never mind.

824
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,840
It's good if you can be drunk.

825
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,320
You only live once.

826
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,239
No need to restrain yourself.

827
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,320
You know me well.

828
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
No wonder you are Ninth Prince.

829
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:19,519
How do you know it?

830
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,360
Not everyone

831
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,320
is able to command

832
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,079
those magistrates' attendants.

833
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:31,320
And in Su City,

834
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,159
there is no promising youngster like you

835
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:34,159
who is bent on agriculture.

836
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,800
Just because of this?

837
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,800
During these years

838
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,199
when I traveled around with my fleets,

839
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:47,000
a little bird told me

840
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,760
a mysterious thing.

841
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,760
What is it?

842
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:53,920
A prince,

843
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,079
to keep civilians from starvation,

844
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,639
soaks in the fields

845
00:40:58,639 --> 00:40:59,800
with muddy farmers,

846
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,000
living like them.

847
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,800
Do you think it is wierd?

848
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,039
I think

849
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,119
he enjoys himself,

850
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,239
free and unfettered instead.

851
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,000
Hearing croaks in summer

852
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,000
and admiring golden fields in autumn.

853
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,480
These are the most scenic.

854
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,280
It is said that

855
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,440
merchants value profits.

856
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:19,840
But someone

857
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:22,920
promotes water conservation

858
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,880
at whatever costs.

859
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,079
Therefore, Su City

860
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
boasts farmland

861
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,119
instead of muddy city.

862
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,599
Do you think it is strange?

863
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,800
Both are weirdos.

864
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:34,880
Bottoms up!

865
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,320
To weirdos.

866
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,000
Stand there!
