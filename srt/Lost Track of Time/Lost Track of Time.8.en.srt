00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,319
Mu Chuan,

3
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,239
don't be sad.

4
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,079
I'm still alive.

5
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,760
If you come here because of my death,

6
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,400
I should have left Su City.

7
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,400
People are as evil as the demon.

8
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,640
I've seen too many of them,

9
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,959
but I don't want you to see them.

10
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,159
With such a clean character,

11
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,439
you should be with the seedlings and soil,

12
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,400
you should see the splendid mountains,

13
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,120
and enjoy the fragrance of mountain flowers.

14
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,520
Just be Rice Fragrance Hermit freely.

15
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:09,919
Take care.

16
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,599
Don't miss me.

17
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,000
Anran.

18
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,039
Sad?

19
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,120
Sometimes, if you don't face it,

20
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,759
you can pretend it didn't happen.

21
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,520
Right?

22
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,560
However,

23
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,960
I always think

24
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,879
I should see you one last time.

25
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,400
There are so many regrets in this world,

26
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,560
I don't want to have one more.

27
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,439
Then you have to hurry.

28
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,719
I won't wait for you.

29
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,439
Shan Yue,

30
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,199
if the Ninth Prince comes here,

31
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,479
give him that letter.

32
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,560
Miss Lu.

33
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,680
This man

34
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,520
is so weird.

35
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
When you talk to him,

36
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,639
he just giggled there.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,759
It's so strange.

38
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,000
It's like he's possessed.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,960
It only takes two days.

40
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,319
What two days?

41
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,000
It takes three days from Hanjing to Su City.

42
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,079
But he arrives in two days.

43
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,199
I didn't even know

44
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,199
he was torturing himself like this.

45
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,160
He stood there since he came.

46
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,399
Go back to your work.

47
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,040
Okay.

why don't you enter the city?

53
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,480
I finally understand

54
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,079
what is "Nearing home, timid I grow".

55
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,040
What "Nearing home, timid I grow"?

56
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,439
What nonsense are you talking about?

57
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,920
Is this how you react when you see me?

58
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,720
You always showed up

59
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,759
without telling me.

60
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,920
How can I react?

61
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,560
I've been there all the way.

62
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,519
I tried my best to get there.

63
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,680
I just want to

64
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,240
I just want to see you one more time

65
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,279
before you pass away.

66
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,600
I want to

67
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,639
put an end to the madness

68
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,399
these days.

69
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,160
But when I'm almost there,

70
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,560
I don't want to end it.

71
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,600
Maybe if I don't see you for the last time,

72
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,519
in the future,

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,360
you can show up like now

74
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,759
from time to time.

75
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
It's good, too.

76
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,240
So,

77
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,839
you always think I'm an illusion?

78
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,399

Poor treat.

106
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,720
Just make do with it.

107
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,799
Thank you.

108
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,840
Such fresh food,

109
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,440
by such a simple way of cooking,

110
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
can stimulate its delicacy.

111
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,159
I'm going to have a feast today.

112
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,279
I'm afraid you put the freshest honey

113
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,600
on your mouth.

114
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,799
Delicious.

115
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,519
How is the poison in your body?

116
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,919
It's okay now.

117
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,720
Don't worry.

118
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,600
But Second Brother will find out

119
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
you're still alive sooner or later,

120
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,000
What will you do then?

121
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,480
Marrying him

122
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,000
is to form an alliance.

123
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,519
I don't love him at all.

124
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,080
Now Lu Xinran is married to him.

125
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,360
It's the same.

126
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,879
Really?

127
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,000
Then you.

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,080
Just see how things develop.

129
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
How was the wedding?

130
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,159
Lu Xinran

131
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,960
will not allow herself

132
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,720
to make any mistakes

133
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
during the ceremony.

134
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,360
Look at yourself.

135
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,159
Ride horses as quickly as possible

136
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,679
just to see a dead person.

137
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,080
Is it worth it?

138
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,000
Mu Chuan,

139
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,960
though you like me so much,

140
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,919
I have no choice.

141
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,159
I can't ignore the safety of my family,

142
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,759
do you understand?

143
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,039
Mu Chuan.

144
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,080
I only give you one chance.

145
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,200
Now,

146
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
if you ask me

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,360
whether I like you or not.

148
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,200
I like you.

149
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,519
Anran?

150
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,279
Anran?

151
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,840
Anran?

152
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,519
Holly.

153
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,519
Burn the letter.

154
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,240
Miss.

155
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,000
are you really

156
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,080
not going to tell Ninth Prince?

157
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,360
He hasn't slept for the past two days,

158
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,639
so he has to sleep till noon tomorrow.

159
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,519
We'll catch the earliest boat.

160
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,279
Okay.

161
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,200
Your Highness.

162
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,200
Take a funeral gift to Su City.

163
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,200
Find out how

164
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,720
Lu Anran died.

165
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,600
Yes.

166
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,039
Remember.

167
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,559
See her in person if she is alive.

168
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,919
See the corpse if she is dead.

169
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,919
Understood.

170
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,500
(In Memory of Liu Mingyu)
(Her son, Lu Yun)

171
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,360
Yun.

172
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,440
You haven't slept for days.

173
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,279
Go back and rest.

174
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,639
Sis.

175
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,039
She's dead.

176
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,679
Sis.

177
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,399
She's dead.

178
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,440
I apologize to you on her behalf.

179
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,279
Yun,

180
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,639
it's not your fault.

181
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,840
It has nothing to do with you.

182
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,159
My mother poisoned you,

183
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,559
because she wants Second Sis and I

184
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,919
to inherit the family business.

185
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,080
Take what belongs to you.

186
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,679
How can it have nothing to do with me?

187
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,120
Yun.

188
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,159
You are you. She is she.

189
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,039
You don't have to

190
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,279
bear her crime.

191
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,120
But she's my mother.

192
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,039
I don't have a mother anymore.

193
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,759
What should I do, sister?

194
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,799
I don't have a mother anymore.

195
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,360
Mom, you're here.

196
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,480
You just recovered from the poison.

197
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,440
Your body is weak.

198
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,840
You'll catch a cold if you fall asleep like this.

199
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,320
Holly.

200
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,559
How did you take care of her?

201
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,240
It's because of my carelessness.

202
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,159
Please punish me, Madam.

203
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,679
Mom, it's not her fault.

204
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,240
I asked Holly to

205
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,879
pack up for Danzhou.

206
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,639
Go on.

207
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,879
Danzhou?

208
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,559
You are going to Danzhou?

209
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,440
No way.

210
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,279
You were almost killed

211
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,320
by Liu Mingyu.

212
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,320
I still have a lingering fear.

213
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,639
If I can't see you for a day,

214
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,000
I feel uneasy.

215
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,559
I just want you to stay by my side.

216
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,240
Mother, I'm really fine.

217
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,680
Look.

218
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,960
Look at me.

219
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:10,960
Look.

220
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,680
No way.

221
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,039
Well.

222
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:14,599
Anran.

223
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,279
I heard that you're going to Danzhou.

224
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,559
Why are you going to Danzhou?

225
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,599
Master, you're finally here.

226
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,880
Please help me persuade her.

227
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,720
She goes here and there,

228
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,279
I worry about her.

229
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,079
Dad.

230
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,839
Floods frequently occur in Danzhou.

231
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,160
The navigation is poor now.

232
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,839
Now that you've handed over

233
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:32,720
36 ports to me.

234
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,720
I can't stay out of it.

235
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,599
You're indeed my daughter.

236
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,000
Thank you, Dad.

237
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,759
I'm asking you to persuade her. You...

238
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,079
Ok, fine. You all have big ambitions.

239
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,319
I'm just an ignorant woman

240
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,359
with no ambition.

241
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:56,720
Mom! Madam!

242
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,440
Are you sure you're okay?

243
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,680
Don't pretend to be fine.

244
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,519
It's okay now.

245
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,720
There are too many unexpected events recently.

246
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,480
Now you go out in a hurry.

247
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,359
I'm worried about you.

248
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,039
Dad, don't worry.

249
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,559
I know what to do.

250
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:23,839
I have a perfect plan.

251
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,359
Take good care of yourself.

252
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,119
No matter what happens,

253
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,720
mom and dad are there to support you.

254
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Lu family is there to support you as well.

255
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,160
Okay.

256
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,079
Go and comfort mom.

257
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,680
I'll go then.

258
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,440
Miss.

259
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,119
packing is almost done.

260
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,599
Would you like to take a look?

261
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,599
Miss.

262
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,920
is there a problem?

263
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,640
Lingxi is the worst at packing things.

264
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,200
Every day from now on,

265
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,440
if Lu Xinran is having a hard time,

266
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,400
Lingxi will suffer.

267
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,680
I believe you will

268
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,200
definitely save her.

269
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,599
But,

270
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,640
why are we going to Danzhou in such a hurry?

271
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:44,920
Mu Ze will know

272
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,079
I'm not dead soon.

273
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,279
I must hurry to Danzhou as soon as possible.

274
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,240
Mu Ze will be ordered to go to Danzhou soon

275
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,720
and investigate the local bandits

276
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,519
hijack the food for disaster relief
all the year round.

277
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,359
What we have to do is

278
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,759
to tell Mu Ze

279
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,880
Gao Chengxian is the

280
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,279
criminals behind

281
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,839
before he finds out

282
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,319
the truth.

283
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,440
Use it to show my loyalty.

284
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,079
Do you think I'm crazy?

285
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,559
No.

286
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:22,920
I believe you, Miss.

287
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,680
But

288
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,599
what I can't figure out is that

289
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,400
you fight to live when facing
the danger of death,

290
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,559
isn't it just to get rid of Prince Qing?

291
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,319
I'll get rid of him sooner or later.

292
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,319
But now,

293
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,119
I need him

294
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,960
to enter Prince Qing's Mansion justifiably.

295
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,759
Only by entering Prince Qing's Mansion,

296
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
will I have a chance to find the key

297
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,960
to save the Lu family.

298
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,200
Anran,

299
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
out of home,

300
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,519
take good care of yourself.

301
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,599
Nothing is more important than

302
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,480
your safety.

303
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,480
Know it?

304
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,200
Mom,

305
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,160
don't worry.

306
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,079
When I'm done with my work,

307
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,200
I'll come back to accompany you.

308
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:15,759
Ok.

309
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:17,920
Go.

310
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,319
Mom. Dad.

311
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,880
Take care of yourself.

312
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,400
Good morning.

313
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:38,960
Why are you here?

314
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,079
I asked Shan Yue.

315
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,400
He told me that

316
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,839
you are going to take the earliest boat to Danzhou.

317
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,480
It happens that I'm also going to Danzhou.

318
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,359
You won't be so stingy

319
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,359
that you don't even want to give me a ride.

320
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,640
Are you really going to Danzhou?

321
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,279
Yes.

322
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,880
Danzhou is the last stop

323
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,079
of my trip over the years.

324
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,880
The river system of Danzhou is complex,

325
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,319
and floods often occur during rainy seasons.

326
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,319
The imperial court always

327
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,319
grants funds and stored grain all the year around.

328
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,839
I don't think this is a long-term solution.

329
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,920
I came to Su City

330
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,079
is also to learn something from it.

331
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,920
I plan to go Danzhou

332
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,799
after Second Brother gets married.

333
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,119
It is delayed by me?

334
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,200
I didn't say that.

335
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:26,559
Let's go?

336
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:34,599
Let's go.

337
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:43,799
It's yours.

338
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,119
The travelling expenses.

339
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,799
It's delicious.

340
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,150
(In Memory of Liu Mingyu)
(Her Son, Lu Yun)

341
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,519
What on earth is going on?

342
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,480
I'm ashamed.

343
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,039
It is caused by a scandal

344
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,240
of my family.

345
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,119
It's she that

346
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,960
poisoned Anran.

347
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,839
It was a critical situation,

348
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,400
but I knew

349
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,920
what His Highness Prince Qing wants.

350
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,519
So I made Xinran to get married with him.

351
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,960
If His Highness wants to punish someone.

352
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,000
Just punish me.

353
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,720
Where exactly is Miss Lu

354
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,920
now?

355
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,480
This was left by Anran.

356
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,039
She asked me to give it to Prince Qing.

357
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,359
I can only trouble you to go again.

358
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,680
Anran recognized the evil as good.

359
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Believed the wrong person,

360
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,000
and was finally killed by them.

361
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,839
But the God doesn't want me die.

362
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,160
I've set off for Danzhou,

363
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,680
Waiting for the reunion with His Highness.

364
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,279
Was Lu Anran really poisoned

365
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,480
by Liu Mingyu

366
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,000
and almost dead?

367
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,200
Yes.

368
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,920
I've asked

369
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
everyone in Lu's Mansion.

370
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,880
The details are also the same.

371
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,039
That's true.

372
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,000
The appearance of the

373
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,240
roving doctor is strange.

374
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,920
Why does she wait me in Danzhou?

375
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,440
Here comes the imperial edict.

376
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,319
Prince Qing listens to it.

377
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,079
There are frequent floods in Danzhou.

378
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,880
The harvest and the surplus grain are poor.

379
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,319
The imperial court has allocated

380
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,960
more than 60 kilograms relief food.

381
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,799
However,

382
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,599
River bandits are rampant.

383
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,000
They rob the relief food many times.

384
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:30,920
It leads

385
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,200
people to starve

386
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,519
and live badly.

387
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,799
I order Prince Qing, Mu Ze

388
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,359
to go to Danzhou immediately.

389
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,680
Clean up the river bandits.

390
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,960
Comfort and

391
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,640
appease the people.

392
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,160
How could she know that

393
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,359
I'm going to Danzhou?

394
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:47,799
This woman

395
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,839
is getting more and more interesting.

396
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:51,599
Your Highness Prince Qing.

397
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,000
Your Highness Prince Qing!

398
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,359
Take the edict.

399
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,599
Yes, Your Majesty.

400
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,720
I'd like to see

401
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,920
what Lu Anran

402
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:07,480
is going to do.

403
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,700
(Danzhou)

404
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,720
Miss, have pity on us.

405
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,839
Give us something to eat.

406
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,400
Holly.

407
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,240
Yes, Miss.

408
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:16,920
Have pity on me.

409
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,039
Give me something to eat.

410
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:19,799
Thank you.

411
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,759
This is for you.

412
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:22,720
Thank you.

413
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Don't worry. Everyone will have one.

414
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,480
Take it.

415
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,880
Thank you. Thank you.

416
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,920
This is yours.

417
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,519
Buy rice or not?

418
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:43,440
Come and have a look.

419
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,720
Good rice.

420
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,160
That's great.

421
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,279
Five tales 60 kilograms.

422
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,759
Take a look!

423
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,079
Five tales?

424
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,160
It's really good rice.

425
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,000
Kind-hearted man,

426
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:00,920
please give me some food.

427
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,200
Please give me something to eat.

428
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,799
Give us some.

429
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:06,640
The situation in Danzhou

430
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,400
seems to be more serious than I thought.

431
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,920
I've been here a few times before,

432
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,839
but it's not that serious.

433
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,000
The relief food allocated by the imperial court

434
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,720
was stolen again a few days ago.

435
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,319
Gao Chengxian is a damn
Assistant Garrison Officer.

436
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,480
He doesn't do a stroke of work.

437
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
It's time for him to abdicate.

438
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,680
I was going to look for someone

439
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,400
of the state government,

440
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,400
and discuss about how to repair the riverway.

441
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:26,839
It seems that

442
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,279
we can't even find people

443
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:28,880
to build the river levee.

444
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,519
If this goes on, people will starve to death.

445
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,039
I'll write a letter

446
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,160
to the neighboring states government tonight.

447
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,279
I have dealt with some before.

448
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:38,920
They have a good harvest now.

449
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
We can borrow some

450
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,039
relief food.

451
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,960
But it will take 3 to 5 days at the earliest.

452
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,240
Come with me.

453
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
(Lu Guang Tong)

454
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
There're a lot of rice.

455
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
During the years when Lu family built wharfs,

456
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,920
floods occurred frequently
all over the country.

457
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,000
So every time the Lu family built a wharf,

458
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,079
my father would keep a warehouse

459
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:06,839
to store grain.

460
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,519
It can

461
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,559
make the boatmen not hungry.

462
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,799
It can also deliver the rice

463
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:10,920
to the wharf where food is scarce along the channel.

464
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,039
According to the thoughts,

465
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:13,759
the court can cooperate with

466
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:14,920
the route of the Lu family,

467
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,319
Set up the public warehouse

468
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,200
in states.

469
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,559
Reduce taxes in bumper years

470
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:22,880
and store the grain in the warehouse.

471
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,039
When the year of disaster begins,

472
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,480
they don't have to be so passive,

473
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,440
waiting the relief food.

474
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,519
Give me a bag.

475
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,240
Come on.

476
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,119
Go to Chen's Rice Shop and buy a bag of rice.

477
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,880
Then go to the city gate,

478
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,039
wait a black gold carriage.

479
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,799
Give him the rice.

480
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,160
Yes.

481
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,799
Be careful.

482
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,440
Come on.

483
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:51,880
Have some water.

484
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:52,640
Thank you.

485
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,640
These rice

486
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:56,680
is enough for the victims

487
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,599
to eat for three days.

488
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,079
At that time, the rice from
neighboring states also arrives.

489
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,359
But building water conservancy
and protecting farmland

490
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,440
is the fundamental policy.

491
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,960
These also need manpower.

492
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,640
Manpower?

493
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,359
I wonder

494
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,240
where else in Danzhou can we find

495
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,839
strong workers?

496
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
I know a place.

497
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,759
Let's go.

498
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,000
It's Qinghe Gang, right?

499
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,480
How do you know about Qinghe Gang?

500
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,319
Guess.

501
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:41,798
(Intruders will be dead)

502
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,559
Let me see who

503
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,799
dares to wander around the border of

504
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,640
Qinghe Gang.

505
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:46,880
Brother Shen.

506
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,200
(Shen Changqing, leader of Qinghe Gang)
I, Shen Changqing,

507
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:51,240
am vulgar.

508
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,119
What I hate most is

509
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:53,880
mercenary businessmen.

510
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:54,880
But it's rare

511
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,680
for the Lu family

512
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,200
to be chivalrous among merchants.

513
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,880
This toast is to Princess.

514
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,680
Please.

515
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,039
Did Brother Chuan come all the way

516
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,039
to Danzhou to see me?

517
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,039
How can I be so scheming

518
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:11,960
that know you're in Danzhou,

519
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,079
Then why are you here?

520
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,160
It's because

521
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,319
in the vast Danzhou City,

522
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,640
we can't even find a worker

523
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,400
to build the dam.

524
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,200
So I am thinking

525
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,759
can we find the brothers of

526
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,160
Qinghe Gang in Danzhou

527
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,240
to help us.

528
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,960
It's easy to handle.

529
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:27,960
Chai Guang.

530
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,960
Pass on my orders.

531
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,559
Ask the brothers of Danzhou Branch

532
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,000
to cooperate fully with the Ninth Prince.

533
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,640
(Chai Guang, Second Master of Danzhou Branch)
If they're short-handed,

534
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:34,839
get all the men nearby

535
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,640
as well.

536
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,799
The first toast

537
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,240
is to Your Highness Prince Qing.

538
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,319
Thanks for help Qinghe Gang

539
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,559
kill the renegade Chai Guang.

540
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,720
If not,

541
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,119
Qinghe Gang, the biggest gang in the world,

542
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:44,799
will be

543
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,920
the biggest joke in the world.

544
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,559
Miss Lu.

545
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,039
Why are you laughing?

546
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,759
I'm just thinking,

547
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,640
Qinghe Gang is the biggest gang in the world now.

548
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,359
I'm afraid it's actually the biggest joke in the world.

549
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,319
And Leader Shen,

550
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,400
is the most hypocritical

551
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,759
man in the world.

552
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,599
Brother Shen don't be angry.

553
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,000
She has always been...

554
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,559
Brother Chuan.

555
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,279
Miss Lu has something to say.

556
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,000
Better make your point.

557
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,200
If Leader Shen doesn't understand,

558
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,119
I can

559
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,000
make it clearer.

560
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,839
I suspect that Qinghe Gang

561
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,000
are in thief with Gao Chengxian.

562
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,240
Under the guise of a river bandit,

563
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,720
you rob the relief food,

564
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,839
bully people,

565
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,079
rob the rich to help the poor.

566
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:28,759
Leader Shen,

567
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,480
how clever you are.

568
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,880
Nonsense!

569
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,359
Even if you're Brother Chuan's friend,

570
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,240
you can't frame

571
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,440
brothers of gang at will.

572
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:44,839
Do you have any evidence?

573
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:47,720
Do you know how the river bandits

574
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
get on the boat?

575
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:49,720
They jump out of

576
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,119
the mountain forest by the river.

577
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,079
They're good at Qing Kung.

578
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:52,880
and used to use long swords.

579
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,759
However, river bandits have always
been bold and brave,

580
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,480
using 5 claws rakes to nail and rake the boat.

581
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,480
How can they be so good at Qing Kung?

582
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,079
These people are from Jianghu.

583
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,960
If Leader Shen doesn't believe,

584
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,599
you can go to the robbed ship and have a look.

585
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,839
Check the sword marks

586
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,200
and see whether it is made

587
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,000
by people from Qinghe Gang.

588
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,839
You can tell at a glance.

589
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,200
What about Gao Chengxian?

590
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,279
He suppresses bandits,

591
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,400
and fails every year.

592
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,920
He garrisons Danzhou, a poor place,

593
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,400
and earns so much by corruption.

594
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,279
Do you believe it has nothing to do

595
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,160
with relief food?

596
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:30,880
Please give me something to eat.

597
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,519
Go away!

598
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,279
Neither do we have it.

599
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:32,920
Give me some.

600
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,759
Excuse me.

601
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:42,599
Sorry to disturb you.

602
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,680
Who are you?

603
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:44,920
My master

604
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,559
asked me to give this

605
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:46,680
to the noble in the carriage.

606
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,160
What is this?

607
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,119
Who is your master?

608
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,799
My master said

609
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,759
the noble will know it himself

610
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:54,799
when he sees it.

611
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:55,720
Give it to me.

612
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,240
This handwriting

613
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,160
belongs to Lu Anran.

614
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,079
How can she know in advance

615
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,680
the reason why Your Highness was sent to Danzhou.

616
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:16,558
(Rice)
(Chen's)

617
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,559
How many surprises

618
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,200
does Lu Anran

619
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,640
have?

620
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,400
(To Mu Chuan)

621
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,279
This is?

622
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,440
You pissed Brother Shen off.

623
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,279
And you left me there alone.

624
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,160
You're so unkind.

625
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,240
Good advice goes against ears.

626
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,160
If Leader Shen doesn't listen,

627
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,359
he won't be

628
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:08,000
a hero anymore.

629
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,199
You come Danzhou

630
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,599
not for business, right?

631
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,679
Why do you think so?

632
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,639
You know the details of

633
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,559
loss of relief food.

634
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,360
As well as Qinghe Gang

635
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,400
and what kind of person Brother Shen is.

636
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,920
That's why

637
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,880
you let

638
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,440
Brother Shen suspects it

639
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,480
in the fastest way.

640
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,159
Danzhou is the place where
the Lu family built the port.

641
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,480
It's understandable that

642
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,639
I know the situation here.

643
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,440
But you're too sure.

644
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,960
If you're not shoo-in

645
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,960
and offend Qiinghe Gang,

646
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,719
You Lu Family,

647
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,119
will suffer then.

648
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,159
Besides,

649
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,199
you always act in a proper way.

650
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,320
It's not like

651
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,199
your style today.

652
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,800
Mu Chuan.

653
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,119
Do you really know me?

654
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,079
Do I act openly and honestly,

655
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,960
or am I calculating?

656
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,400
I'm never wrong about people.

657
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,639
I used to think

658
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,079
I'm never wrong about people.

659
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,559
Until I found out that

660
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,159
lies and disguises

661
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,360
can be so real.

662
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:28,880
Now,

663
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,199
I don't even dare to say who I know.

664
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:33,920
Sometimes,

665
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,280
I don't know much about myself either.

666
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,280
You.

667
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,800
Is it because

668
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,199
you don't fully know and trust me,

669
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,760
so you don't tell me?

670
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,760
No.

671
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,239
You helped me to comfort Brother Shen,

672
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,360
you must be thirsty.

673
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,159
Have some water.

674
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,559
Whose letter?

675
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,550
(The letter from Lu Anran)

676
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,679
A girl wrote it to me.

677
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,840
I don't want to see it.

678
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,079
Why do you run so far?

679
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,679
If you come here because of my death,

680
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,159
I should have left Su City.

681
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,679
Sometimes, I think

682
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,960
the evil spirits in the world

683
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,280
are not as cute as evil spirits in mountains.

684
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,880
Their evil thoughts are not

685
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
as clear as the mud

686
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,320
in the field.

687
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,719
Now I always think

688
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,039
it is a big dream.

689
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,639
You're the only one who's as clean as ever.

690
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,320
For the rest of your life,

691
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,639
I only hope you can do what you want.

692
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,440
Be free and safe.

693
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,519
So that's why

694
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:28,559
you don't tell me.

695
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,719
I think you're right.

696
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,719
One should not pretend

697
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:46,639
to know others too well.

698
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,280
What makes Ninth Prince

699
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,239
suddenly recognize it?

700
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,079
The girl who wrote this letter

701
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,559
speaks so nicely.

702
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,000
It makes me surprised.

703
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,639
I didn't expect Your Highness

704
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,239
likes to listen to nice words either.

705
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,280
I am surprised, too.

706
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,519
Who on earth

707
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,960
doesn't want to listen to good words?

708
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,159
Especially those

709
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,000
sincere words

710
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,960
and beautiful sentences.

711
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,480
What's more,

712
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,400
between the lines

713
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,480
reveal her

714
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
true feelings.

715
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,840
When I read it, it makes me feel

716
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,119
warm.

717
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,239
When Your Highness falls in love,

718
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,239
it's the same with

719
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,480
other men.

720
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,800
Facing such sincere concerns,

721
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,440
who can avoid it?

722
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,920
Then you can just stay here and enjoy

723
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,639
the beautiful

724
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,599
and sincere words.

725
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,119
I'll leave you alone.

726
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:47,960
Well.

727
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,320
I want to share

728
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,760
the letter with you.

729
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,000
Why do you leave?

730
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,440
A woman's true heart

731
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,039
can't be

732
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,239
the conversation between you and me.

733
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:55,599
You're so brusque.

734
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,679
She has just turned 15 years old.

735
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,840
Why does she speak in such a mature way?

736
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,119
It's okay for Leader Shen not to listen to me.

737
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,719
But the imperial court won't let

738
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:35,840
Danzhou keep suffering.

739
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,639
As far as I know,

740
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,639
someone from Hanjing is investigating it thoroughly.

741
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,519
If Gao Chengxian affirms that

742
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,119
Qinghe Gang is the evil backstage manipulator.

743
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,599
Leader Shen,

744
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
if you don't think about yourself,

745
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,320
don't you think about Qinghe Gang's

746
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,440
other people?

747
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,920
Are you sure Gao Chengxian

748
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,559
embezzle the relief food?

749
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,119
I'm sure.

750
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,400
No.

751
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,440
I'm still going to

752
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,519
find Gao Chengxian.

753
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,800
Otherwise, when this bastard

754
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,000
reveals me,

755
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,840
I won't even know.

756
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,039
Your Highness.

757
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,880
I have sent people to find out

758
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,280
the rice in these rice shops

759
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,679
are indeed the relief food

760
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,880
from Hanjing.

761
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,960
Those are a batch of

762
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,159
early rice harvested.

763
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,480
It has not been circulated in the market.

764
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,840
It can't be wrong.

765
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,079
She wanted to tell me that

766
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,119
the relief food has something to do with Gao Chengxian.

767
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,000
She led us

768
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,400
all the way to the truth.

769
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,119
How can I not accept the gift

770
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,519
that she tried so hard to send us.
