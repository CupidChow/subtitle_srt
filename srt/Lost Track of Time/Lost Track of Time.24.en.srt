2
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,400
Miss, butler Liu is here.

3
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,400
Your Ladyship,

4
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,560
His Highness has something to discuss with you.

5
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,599
Please go to the study.

6
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,000
I know it.

7
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,840
Holly,

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,120
do you still have

9
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,599
the prescription for Cuiju

10
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,920
last time?

11
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,120
Yes.

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,280
I've been having a cold these days.

13
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,280
Can I have a look?

14
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,480
I'll get a pair of it.

15
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,920
Holly, help butler Liu

16
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,680
and get two pairs of medicine.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,239
I don't need you to serve me now.

18
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,280
Yes, Miss.

19
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,439
Thank you, Holly.

20
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,199
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

21
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,550
(The list of farmers)

22
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,039
Second brother, I've been waiting
for you for a long time.

23
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,319
Why are you here?

24
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,199
Servants!

25
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,400
Open the door!

26
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,680
Servants!

27
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,879
It's useless.

28
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,680
I'm afraid someone

29
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,439
wants us to share a room

30
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,839
and makes up a cheating scene.

31
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,399
If I really break the door today,

32
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,000
I won't prove my innocence

33
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,680
even if I jump into the Yellow River.

34
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,120
What are you doing in the study today?

35
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,680
I came here to confirm a thing.

36
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,040
But it turned out to be a farce.

37
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,959
Now that I'm your sister-in-law,

38
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,759
and we share the same room,

39
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,839
we need to avoid suspicion.

40
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,279
Please turn your back, Your Highness Prince Qi.

41
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,879
Thus, I can feel at ease.

42
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,439
Your Highness. Your Highness.

43
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,240
Why are you in such a panic?

44
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,319
Ms. Lu broke into your study.

45
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,439
What?

46
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,560
And His Highness Prince Qi.

47
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Prince Qi?

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,240
Everyone in the mansion knows that

49
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,759
your study is not allowed
to enter without an order.

50
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,759
If only Ms. Lu breaks into your study,

51
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,279
I'll punish her according to the rules.

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,199
But His Highness Prince Qi is also there.

53
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,240
I really don't know

54
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,920
what to do.

55
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,879
So I can only lock the door,

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,360
and wait for your order when you come back.

57
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
You locked the door?

58
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,079
Your Highness,

59
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,720
I have no choice.

60
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,079
You should know that as Ms. Lu

61
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,040
is eloquent,

62
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,439
she won't admit it.

63
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,279
All right, all right.

64
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:27,879
I'll go and have a look.

65
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,000
Lu Anran,

66
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,120
is this really

67
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,040
the life you want?

68
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,839
I was confused before.

69
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,839
I was puzzled.

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,600
I was even sad and angry.

71
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,439
But now I understand.

72
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,920
No matter what you think,

73
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,439
those good old days

74
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,279
are the most memorable time

75
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,480
in my life.

76
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,079
I did like you.

77
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,839
But now I really let it go.

78
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,120
Lu Anran.

79
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,560
Mu Chuan.

80
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,000
I want you to be happy.

81
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,120
Sincerely.

82
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,040
I'm sorry.

83
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,820
(The list of the farmers)

84
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,399
Your Highness.

85
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,200
Are you sure they broke into the study

86
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,120
without permission?

87
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,320
I saw it with my own eyes.

88
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,279
It's true.

89
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,840
All the servants present can testify.

90
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,759
Get out of the way.

91
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,120
Open the door!

92
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,679
Yes, Your Highness.

93
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,240
Second Brother.

94
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,679
Second Brother, you're finally here.

95
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,120
Otherwise, I don't even know

96
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,200
when I can go out today.

97
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,600
Is there something wrong today?

98
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,440
The last meeting was too hasty.

99
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,039
I wanted to talk about the old days

100
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,879
with second brother this time.

101
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,799
I didn't expect it to be such a farce.

102
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,519
By the way,

103
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,919
let me ask you,

104
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,840
when you came to see me in the study,

105
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,440
was Ms. Lu already here?

106
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,279
There was no one else
when I entered the study.

107
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,759
Lu Anran,

108
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,960
I remember I told you

109
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,679
no one is allowed to

110
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,399
break in the study without orders.

111
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,559
Why are you here?

112
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,799
It was the butler who told me

113
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,679
Your Highness had something to

114
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,679
discuss with me in the study.

115
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,679
I don't know

116
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,039
why I was locked up here.

117
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,279
Your Highness,

118
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,879
Ms. Lu and I

119
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,039
were indeed good friends.

120
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,879
But if my coming to the mansion

121
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,480
becomes the tool

122
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,720
of killing Ms. Lu,

123
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,399
I'm afraid that in the future

124
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,759
I won't be able to
come to the mansion anymore.

125
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,279
I won't be able to face

126
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,399
Second Brother and Ms. Lu anymore either.

127
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,399
Second Brother,

128
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,559
I didn't expect

129
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,480
it's another farce today.

130
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,639
I won't bother you anymore.

131
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,919
Okay.

132
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,360
You go back first.

133
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,120
When I'm free,

134
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
I'll talk with you.

135
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,879
Lu Anran,

136
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,679
you may leave as well.

137
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,279
She can't leave.

138
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,879
Your Highness,

139
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,039
how could you

140
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,960
let them go like this?

141
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,440
Do you know that

142
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,080
the grape vine in Lu Anran's courtyard

143
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,559
was specially transplanted from Su City

144
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,559
by His Highness Prince Qi?

145
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,639
Lu Anran stares at it every day.

146
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,600
I don't believe

147
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,679
there's nothing between them.

148
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,519
Okay.

149
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,039
Even if,

150
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,679
even if

151
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,240
I designed what happened today.

152
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,480
But the two of them

153
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,320
swore to each other before.

154
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,519
Their relationship is ambiguous.

155
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,879
What if they are still
having an affair now?

156
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,840
As Your Highness just let it go,

157
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,279
what about Your Highness's reputation

158
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,919
if others find it out?

159
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,559
Even if you designed it?

160
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,519
Kneel down!

161
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,559
You used such a stupid method

162
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,440
to plot them.

163
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,679
You really think I'm a fool.

164
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,879
Kneel down!

165
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,559
Nanxing.

166
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,279
Yes, Your Highness.

167
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,919
Make Princess kneel down.

168
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,279
Your Highness. Excuse me.

169
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,480
Tell me,

170
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,759
who am I?

171
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,480
You,

172
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,919
you're

173
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,879
Mu Ze.

174
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,799
Who am I?

175
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,360
You,

176
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,919
you're my husband.

177
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,120
Say it again.

178
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,480
You,

179
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,919
you're Prince Qing.

180
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,639
Then tell me,

181
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,840
who are you?

182
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,759
I,

183
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,279
I'm your wife.

184
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,600
Say it.

185
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,879
I am

186
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,200
Princess Qing.

187
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,320
Do you know

188
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,399
what to do

189
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,440
and what not to do now?

190
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,399
I warn you,

191
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,960
Lu Anran is not someone

192
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,360
you can hurt whenever you want.

193
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:08,960
Ninth brother

194
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,759
is not someone you can use

195
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,879
whenever you want.

196
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,200
If I hear such fallacies again

197
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,919
in Prince Qing's Mansion.

198
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,440
Then you will not be

199
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,759
Princess Qing anymore.

200
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,639
Remember it?

201
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,320
Kneel down here.

202
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,759
Think about what I said.

203
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,120
You guys enjoyed

204
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,360
watching the fun.

205
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,159
Kneel down!

206
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

207
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,320
I know I was wrong.

208
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,879
Guards.

209
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,600
Yes.

210
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,399
Drag this old slave away.

211
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,440
Shoot him to death!

212
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,879
Yes.

213
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,559
Your Highness, please spare me.

214
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,519
Your Highness, please spare me.

215
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,240
Your Highness, please spare me.

216
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,559
Nanxing.

217
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,879
Yes.

218
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,200
Let them slap themselves

219
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,080
until they bleed.

220
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,919
Yes.

221
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,519
Slap!

222
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,200
Harder.

223
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,600
I

224
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,159
have told them

225
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,559
not to

226
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,559
get close to your courtyard.

227
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,840
Don't worry.

228
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,559
No one will

229
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,480
bother you anymore.

230
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

231
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:08,960
By the way,

232
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,000
I saw there is

233
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,720
a grape vine

234
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,200
with no grapes in your courtyard.

235
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,000
It looks bleak.

236
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,720
I've prepared

237
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,360
some autumn tints for you.

238
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,080
Come with me.

239
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,679
Planting the grape from Su City

240
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,759
takes a lot of effort

241
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,679
and it's not easy to bear fruit.

242
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,480
But the Autumn Helenium is different.

243
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,679
It's suitable for the time.

244
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,080
And you don't have to take good care of it.

245
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,960
It's easy

246
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,519
to plant.

247
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,480
It doesn't take so much effort.

248
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,879
I believe you will like it.

249
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,559
Everything that needs careful attention

250
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,319
in this mansion is vulnerability.

251
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:08,960
I can't bear

252
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,799
such meticulous care.

253
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
I need to remind you.

254
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,480
As for what I give you,

255
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,119
you'd better keep it well.

256
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,680
Otherwise,

257
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,720
you do not know good from bad.

258
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,440
Today,

259
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,759
I've always been on your side.

260
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,599
Why do you still

261
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,920
look like you're dead?

262
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,039
Why?

263
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,359
Your Highness, you don't believe me.

264
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,119
You just saw through

265
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,319
Xiao Jingque's trick.

266
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,079
I'd like to hear

267
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,920
one more rebuttal from you.

268
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,359
A clean hand wants no washing.

269
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,039
A clean hand wants no washing?

270
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,680
I understand the meaning of this sentence.

271
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,720
You don't rob and dispute.

272
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,000
You're playing cat and mouse with me.

273
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,480
Come and have a look.

274
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,079
Look how beautiful

275
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,000
the autumn helenium is.

276
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,759
Since you can take good care of

277
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,359
such grape vines,

278
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,079
it must be easy to take care of

279
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,559
autumn helenium like that.

280
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,519
I will come to check at any time.

281
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,599
Take good care of it.

282
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,210
(The list of farmers)

283
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,790
(Farmer He in the north of Hanjing)

284
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,870
(The list of farmers)

285
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,830
(The list of farmers)

286
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,780
(A farmer in the north of city)

287
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,319
Holly,

288
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:09,920
take these lists

289
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,799
to Brother Shen.

290
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:12,640
Yes.

291
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,160
While,

292
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,960
I promise you

293
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,839
I won't kill anyone in the future.

294
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,079
And you,

295
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,640
just be Rice Fragrance Hermit.

296
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,880
Second Brother

297
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,559
will try my best not to let you down, okay?

298
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,359
(Second Brother,)

299
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,079
(how can I trust you again?)

300
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,880
Your Highness,

301
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,240
according to the list you gave us,

302
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,400
I've sent people out.

303
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,160
Protect the safety of farmers first.

304
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,079
But we need to catch together with the loot.

305
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,480
So that they can be convicted of their crimes.

306
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,240
Let's split up tonight.

307
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,200
Yes, Your Highness.

308
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,319
I'll tell everyone to get ready.

309
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:02,519
I'll tell everyone to get ready.

310
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,200
What do you think we should do?

311
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,920
Many people died
because of the demolition.

312
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,759
Let's report it to the government tomorrow.

313
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:09,880
What's the use of reporting to the government?

314
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,640
Officials protect themselves.

315
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,240
Who cares if we civilians live or die?

316
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,319
That's right.

317
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,240
What should we do then?

318
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
What can I do?

319
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:18,880
Gosh.

320
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,240
Miss.

321
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,559
It's from my brother.

322
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,680
(The farmers on the list have been rescued.)

323
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,839
That's great.

324
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,039
I asked my brother to keep an eye on them.

325
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,480
But last night, when he was saving farmers,

326
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,759
he met His Highness Prince Qi.

327
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,960
Mu Chuan went to the study a few days ago.

328
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,799
I guessed that he was looking for the list.

329
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:17,759
With his temper,

330
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,880
he can't be stopped by us.

331
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,279
(Lanyue Pavilion)
We can only ask Brother Shen

332
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,200
to protect him.

333
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,440
Your Highness,

334
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,880
last night

335
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,799
two people suddenly came out.

336
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,680
As if they knew what we were going to do.

337
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,960
The people who came back said

338
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:40,000
the troublemakers should be from Jianghu.

339
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,079
People from Jianghu?

340
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,440
What people from Hanjing

341
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,680
and the surrounding area

342
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,799
like to meddle in this kind of business?

343
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,759
And they even came

344
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:50,599
on time.

345
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,480
Your Highness, you mean Qinghe Gang?

346
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,160
It was the butler that told me

347
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,200
Your Highness had something

348
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,039
to discuss with me in the study.

349
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,079
I don't understand

350
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,279
why I am locked up here.

351
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,319
The relationship between
her and Shen Changqing

352
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,400
is really deep.

353
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,119
Your Highness, you mean...

354
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,920
Arrest Shen Changqing

355
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,839
of Qinghe Gang!

356
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,279
Find a way to lure Lu Anran here.

357
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,039
I'd like to see

358
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:20,920
what she will do.

359
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,680
(As something happened to
the tenant farmers,)

360
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,480
(the plan has changed.)

361
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,759
(See you from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.)

362
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,559
(at the yard in Hanjing suburb)

363
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,440
(to discuss it in detail.)

364
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:29,559
Miss.

365
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,440
I think something is wrong.

366
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,319
This jade pendant is my mother's relic.

367
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,839
My brother takes it with him all the time.

368
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,720
Why would he use it as a token

369
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,119
to send a message?

370
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
In that case,

371
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,160
I'm afraid it's a trap.

372
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,440
They can use Brother Shen's

373
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,839
personal belonging to send me a message.

374
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,240
It means Brother Shen

375
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,960
has been controlled by them.

376
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,799
But if they

377
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:02,839
set up a trap with Brother Shen,

378
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,119
Brother Shen

379
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,359
must be safe now.

380
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,480
Don't worry too much.

381
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,519
What should we do next?

382
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,200
As soon as Brother Shen saved farmers,

383
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,319
something happened to him.

384
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,200
It seems that they are trying to
lure me into the trap.

385
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,039
It's Mu Ze.

386
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,480
I'm afraid he's already

387
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,200
suspecting me.

388
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,519
Ask Shan Yue to prepare for the car.

389
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:32,799
Miss, you can't go.

390
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,119
Of course, I should go.

391
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,000
Brother Shen is trapped because of me,

392
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,079
so I have to save him.

393
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:41,920
But,

394
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,759
I can't go alone.

395
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,319
See! What is this?

396
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,480
You just failed to frame my affair

397
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
with His Highness Prince Qi.

398
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,480
Now you took my friend's jade pendant

399
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,079
and sent me a note

400
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,119
to lure me out.

401
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,440
If I really take the bait,

402
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,480
I'll never explain it

403
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,359
even if I jump into the Yellow River.

404
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,079
Lu Anran, stop talking nonsense.

405
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,079
I didn't send this note.

406
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,279
Who else could it be if it wasn't you?

407
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,720
Only you can do

408
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,359
such a thing.

409
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,240
Lu Anran,

410
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,640
who do you think I, Xiao Jingque, am?

411
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,079
If I did it,

412
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,240
I'll admit it.

413
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,759
If I didn't do it,

414
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,279
you can't blame me.

415
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,720
Either you or your brother.

416
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,799
My brother is a general.

417
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,000
Will he frame you?

418
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,200
Don't flatter yourself.

419
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,920
You just want to kick me

420
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,519
out of Prince Qing's Mansion.

421
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,559
Brother and sister are on the same boat.

422
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,920
Your brother stays by

423
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,799
His Highness's side every day.

424
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,599
Of course, he knows

425
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,799
what His Highness hates most.

426
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,039
You failed to frame an affair.

427
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,640
You want His Highness to suspect me.

428
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,079
What a good cooperation!

429
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,039
What are you talking about?

430
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,079
I'm the Crown Princess

431
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,799
of Prince Qing's Mansion.

432
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,759
Will I be slandered by you, a concubine?

433
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,079
Okay.

434
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,599
I'll take you to the

435
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,079
the yard in Hanjing suburb today

436
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,319
to see who is behind this.

437
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,599
Your Highness, what are you thinking?

438
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,880
You've been thinking about it all night.

439
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,000
It's weird.

440
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:03,880
The man in black last night...

441
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,519
It's Brother Shen.

442
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,240
Your Highness Prince Qi! Your Highness Prince Qi!

443
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:49,839
Your Highness,

444
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,119
the note and the token have been sent out.

445
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,720
Your Highness, you can wait for the result.

446
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:56,880
Your Highness,

447
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,880
I want to ask you.

448
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,519
What would Your Highness do

449
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,279
if the one coming is really Lu Anran?

450
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,079
I tried every means

451
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,480
to see Your Highness

452
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,880
because I just want to remind you

453
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,799
to be careful about Lu Anran.

454
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,599
She came back from the dead.

455
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,000
It's strange.

456
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,519
Now she

457
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,559
followed us and came to Hanjing.

458
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,039
What is she going to do?

459
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,319
Lu Xinran did such things.

460
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:28,480
The mansion has become a laughingstock.

461
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,720
Now that you want to marry her sister,

462
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,480
what will people say about you?

463
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,960
People will say that

464
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,519
you lust after a woman badly.

465
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,880
I will never

466
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,799
let a woman

467
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,640
betray me again and again.

468
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,599
Hurry up.

469
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,400
I'd like to see who's there.

470
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,559
Brother?

471
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,480
Why are you here?

472
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,640
Brother,

473
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,039
if the note and jade pendant

474
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:10,799
are to lure her out.

475
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,119
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

476
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:13,759
You don't stay in the mansion.

477
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,079
What are you doing here?

478
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,079
Go back now.

479
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,359
Brother, I know.

480
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,480
You want to avenge my grievances!

481
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
I almost let her escape just now.

482
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,319
Shut up!

483
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,359
That's the case.

484
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,480
General Xiao is a great general

485
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,839
who protects our country.

486
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,599
I can't believe you even
intervene in women's affairs.

487
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:28,720
You deal with me, a concubine,

488
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,160
on behalf of your good sister.

489
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:31,680
If today

490
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,960
I really come here alone.

491
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,160
Won't I fall into

492
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,839
the trap of you two?

493
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,799
Then let your good sister

494
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,359
to tell His Highness,

495
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,079
saying that I had a
private meeting with an outsider.

496
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,160
Your Highness, since I came to the mansion,

497
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,839
you kept targeting me,

498
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,559
humiliating me,

499
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,839
and pouring dirty water on me again and again.

500
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,079
You brother and sister

501
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,279
really think highly of me.

502
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,000
Ms. Lu,

503
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,119
you are the very capable one.

504
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,640
What you did is more than these.

505
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,480
Shen Changqing has confessed to

506
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,440
these trivial matters just now.

507
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,720
You're the one

508
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,799
who disclosed the list of farmers

509
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:08,599
to him.

510
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:10,960
You ordered him to hinder His Highness,

511
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:12,559
didn't you?

512
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,200
You and Shen Changqing

513
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,599
are really congenial.

514
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,839
Holly

515
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,000
is Shen Changqing's sister

516
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,079
and also your confidant.

517
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,799
What a coincidence.

518
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,960
Ms. Lu,

519
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,200
you have to admit it

520
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,359
about what happened today.

521
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,720
I see.

522
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,640
Lu Anran, you're so bold.

523
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
How dare you be a traitor to the mansion?

524
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,279
Why are you smiling, Ms. Lu?

525
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,759
I laugh at your poor skills.

526
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,839
You can only use

527
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,480
such despicable means to deal with me.

528
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,240
It's a pity that I didn't do anything.

529
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,480
What do you want me to admit?

530
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,279
General Xiao, you may not know.

531
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,680
Before I entered the mansion,

532
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,440
I had made a clean break with Shen Changqing.

533
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,039
Who knows when he will

534
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,359
bring trouble to me?

535
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,359
Shen Changqing, what do you think?

536
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,240
She leaves herself clean

537
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,720
when something happens.

538
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,319
Being loyal to

539
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,599
such a heartless woman,

540
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,960
if you really

541
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,559
die because of her.

542
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,599
Don't you think
it's miserable, Leader Shen?

543
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,480
For an impulsive and brainless person like him,

544
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,920
whoever goes with him will be doomed.

545
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,680
If he can sabotage

546
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,720
His Highness's plan,

547
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,960
then General Xiao

548
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,480
have really flattered this fool.

549
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,480
Good for you, Lu Anran.

550
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,079
You live on me while helping others secretly.

551
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:40,599
What nonsense plan?

552
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,720
I have no idea at all.

553
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,000
Besides,

554
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
that place

555
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
is within Qinghe Gang's reach.

556
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
I saw someone was killing people,

557
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
so I went there to save them.

558
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,400
I can do dozens of things

559
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,240
like this within a day.

560
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,400
But Lu Anran,

561
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,079
I really didn't expect,

562
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,000
you can't even speak human language

563
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,920
after you climbed to the high branch.

564
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,839
Originally, I made friends with you

565
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:00,599
to use

566
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,440
Qinghe Gang's power

567
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,319
to deal with the river bandits.

568
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Businessmen value profits.

569
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:04,880
It has been the case since ancient times.

570
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,559
Lu Anran,

571
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,359
I was wrong about you.

572
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,039
So lively.

573
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,880
Your Highness,

574
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,079
I thought what happened today

575
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,880
was just a fight between women.

576
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,279
It's nothing more than
women in the boudoir's

577
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,200
jealousy.

578
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,200
But I didn't expect it is you who did it.

579
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,559
You've never believed in me.

580
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,400
It's very important.

581
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,440
I have to be careful.

582
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,759
But you know,

583
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:46,920
I have nothing left.

584
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,319
You know what kind of determination

585
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,759
I've made to marry you.

586
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,960
I just want to spend the rest of my life

587
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,480
in the mansion in peace.

588
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,119
Is this what Your Highness said

589
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,400
to be honest with each other?

590
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,680
After you broke into

591
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,119
my study without permission,

592
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,240
within a few days,

593
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,599
Shen Changqing

594
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,319
led people to rescue those farmers.

595
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,440
In this world,

596
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,880
how could such a coincidence happen?

597
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,039
How can I trust you?

598
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:13,839
Just because of your

599
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:14,920
statements?

600
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,839
Your Highness, I know what you mean.

601
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,279
If I kill him,

602
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,039
I can dispel Your Highness's

603
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,240
suspicion of me, right?

604
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,759
Let me borrow your sword.

605
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,400
(But I remember,)

606
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,559
my brother is different from others.

607
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,640
His heart

608
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,839
is on the right side.

609
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,519
Ms. Lu can't do it, right?

610
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,240
I said

611
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,559
I will kill him.

612
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,319
Why can't I do it?

Why are you here?

Someone wants to kill us.

Your Highness, how is Leader Shen?

00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,440
The injury is not good.

657
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,079
What should we do now?

658
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,440
Anyone is here?

659
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,000
Leader Shen's injury is getting worse.

660
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,519
Hurry up!

661
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:16,920
Leader!

662
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,679
Leader!

663
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:18,920

664
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:21,920

665

666
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,480
Yes!

667
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,679
Gather all the brothers in the gang!

668
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,159
Avenge on Prince Qing for Leader!

669
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,159
If anything happens to Leader,

670
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,519
we're willing to

671
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,679
die with Leader.

672
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,079
Let's go.

673
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,239
Hold on.

674
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,519
Calm down.

675
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,199
Leader is harmed.

676
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,360
Should we just wait here?

677
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,800
Yeah, are we just waiting?

678
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,079
You're ignorant of

679
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:50,719
what they will do next.

680
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,960
You're also ignorant of

681
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,679
what will happen next.

682
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,320
If you act rashly like this,

683
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:56,719
you will be in danger.

684
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,119
Please rest assured.

685
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:00,880
I will definitely seek justice

686
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,559
for Brother Shen.

687
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,719
I've made you feel wronged.

688
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,079
There's nothing to be aggrieved about.

689
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,920
I volunteered to marry Your Highness.

690
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
But I don't know,

691
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,119
as soon as I enter the mansion,

692
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,519
I have to give up the fate before.

693
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,480
I knew it too late.

694
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,079
I can't blame anyone else.

695
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,440
I'm the one who's too suspicious.

696
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,639
I really didn't expect that

697
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:44,079
the Xiao brother and sister
would come out and make trouble.

698
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,800
Wasn't Your Highness

699
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,960
still forcing me?

700
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,320
They can act like this.

701
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:01,840
It indicates that

702
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,119
Your Highness still
doesn't trust me enough.

703
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,079
How dare I ask for

704
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,199
Your Highness to trust me?

705
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,800
In Your Highness's eyes,

706
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,239
I'm just a person with many misdeeds,

707
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,119
and scheming.

708
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,079
The reason why I don't trust you

709
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,400
is that the past between you and me.

710
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,800
There are too many intrigues.

711
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,119
But I can tell you,

712
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:29,840
from now on,

713
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,159
I won't be affected

714
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,960
by those intrigues and past events.

715
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,760
I'll try to

716
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,480
trust you.

717
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,559
Okay?

718
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,840
Your Highness, you'd better go.

719
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,440
I'm a little tired.

720
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,559
Alright.

721
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,800
Don't think too much.

722
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:50,960
Go to bed early.

723
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,840
Miss, Miss.

724
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,280
Holly.

725
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,840
Go to Qinghe Gang

726
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,599
to find your brother right now.

727
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,639
What happened?

728
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,920
Don't ask any more questions.

729
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,559
Hurry up!

730
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,880
Okay.

731
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,360
Doctor, how is he?

732
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,519
It's a good thing the stab was an inch off.

733
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,280
Otherwise,

734
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,039
even if the God is reincarnated,

735
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,280
he won't be able to save him.

736
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:56,480
Okay.

737
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,360
Thank you, doctor.

738
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,199
He needs to rest
peacefully for three months.

739
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,400
Don't let him

740
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,760
try to be brave again.

741
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:05,599
Send the doctor off.

742
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,800
Yes.

743
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:07,840
Thank you.

744
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,199
Brother.

745
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,159
Brother.

746
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,239
Brother.

747
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,360
Holly,

748
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,039
your brother is fine.

749
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,760
What happened on earth?

750
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,079
Brother.

751
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,360
Your Highness,

752
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,679
how did my brother get hurt?

753
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,199
And Miss,

754
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,000
she's injured too.

755
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,880
Didn't Lu Anran tell you?

756
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:41,599
No.

757
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,840
She asked me to come back quickly.

758
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,760
Nothing else.

759
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,679
Yes.

760
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:50,760
What should she tell you?

761
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,400
The sword on Brother Shen's chest

762
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:55,519
was stabbed by her.

763
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,360
Miss stabbed him?

764
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:07,199
I was pretty sure that I knew her.

765
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,840
Even though she is

766
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,519
unpredictable sometimes.

767
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:13,559
She's still a kind person after all.

768
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,599
But now...

769
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,440
No.

770
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,800
Miss is not that kind of person.

771
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,719
I saw it with my own eyes.

772
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,480
If Miss did stab him,

773
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,719
then there must be a reason for her

774
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:24,639
to stab.

775
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,440
Holly,

776
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,000
look at your brother.

777
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:28,960
Your brother almost died.

778
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:29,960
You're still so foolish and loyal.

779
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,920
Don't you feel sorry to your brother?

780
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,039
Your Highness,

781
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,119
all I know is

782
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,280
Miss went out today

783
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,360
to save my brother.

784
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,440
And I came to you as soon as possible.

785
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
It was asked by Miss.

786
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,639
Today,

787
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,000
Miss suddenly received a letter.

788
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,280
It wants to lure her out to see my brother.

789
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,800
Miss said it was a trap,

790
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:50,679
one that would kill

791
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:51,639
her and my brother.

792
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,000
So Lu Anran

793
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,039
killed him to protect herself.

794
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,239
Can't you tell?

795
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,440
She can do such a cruel thing,

796
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,719
and stabbed straight to his heart.

797
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:07,039
But I can't be

798
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,320
as cruel as her.

799
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,000
The wound on Miss's shoulder

800
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,880
was caused by you, Your Highness?

801
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:23,360
Your Highness Prince Qi,

802
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,639
I really don't know

803
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:28,559
it's because you don't know Miss well,

804
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,599
or our Miss misjudged you.
