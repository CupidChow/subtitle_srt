2
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,480
The fat’s in the fire.

3
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,879
Miss is in trouble.

4
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,640
The fat’s in the fire.

5
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,040
Miss is in trouble.

6
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,239
Miss.

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,000
Miss.

8
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,879
Oh my.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Miss passes out.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,400
Doctor.

11
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,439
Check her, doctor.

12
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,040
I am here.

13
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,760
Miss.

14
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,879
Anran.

15
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:54,560
Anran.

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:54,959
Madam.

17
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:55,879
Anran.

18
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,400
Sis.

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,920
Anran.

20
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:57,879
Miss.

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,519
Anran.

22
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,200
Sis.

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,079
Doctor.

24
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,040
What's wrong with my daughter?

25
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,640
Miss gets seriously poisoned

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,280
in her lungs.

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,959
I am afraid she is hard to come to herself.

28
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,079
How come?

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,319
Anran was still good

30
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:08,919
at night.

31
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
How could she get poisoned?

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,639
The poison spread swiftly.

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
It must be taken through mouth.

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,560
Someone might poison

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,800
Miss's food.

36
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:17,960
Poisoned?

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,960
But we all had the dinner.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,840
Anran.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,680
Why was she poisoned alone?

40
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,240
Right.

41
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,599
Walnut crisp.

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,800
Miss has taken

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,240
the walnut crisp made by Madam.

44
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,919
Walnut crisp.

45
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,120
I made the walnut crisp in person.

46
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,319
I've never left it.

47
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,840
Master,

48
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,439
how could I harm Anran?

49
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,319
How could I, Master?

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,319
Anran is your biological child.

51
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,639
How could you hurt her?

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,639
It had nothing to do with you.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,520
Who did it on earth?

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,719
Anran.

55
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,240
Don't make me worry.

56
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,039
You are fine, right?

57
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,240
Open your eyes and have a look at mom.

58
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,280
Anran.

59
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,039
Anran.

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,240
Master, Madam.

61
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,719
There is still one.

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,159
There is still one?

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,560
Anran.

64
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,840
Miss Xinran.

65
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,199
You came to

66
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,960
our Miss' room tonight as well.

67
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,000
Our Miss invited you

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
to try the walnut crisp,

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,159
but you didn't have a bite.

70
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,280
Later,

71
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,719
we saw Madam off

72
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,879
with Miss Anran.

73
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,800
Only she

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,680
left in the room.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
She absolutely had time and a chance

76
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,599
to poison the crisp.

77
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:30,680
Right.

78
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,680
It must be her.

79
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,800
Miss Xinran

80
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,879
disliked Miss Anran long ago.

81
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,719
You're talking nonsense.

82
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,800
No a shred of evidence.
Don't try to stigmatize me.

83
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,360
You.

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
How dare you are!

85
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,400
You should stigmatize your host!

86
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,199
I am not talkng nonsense.

87
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,240
Master!

88
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,639
Second Madam and Miss Xinran

89
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,400
have long held grudges against Miss Anran.

90
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,680
The rouge they sent

91
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,879
was all poisoned.

92
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,599
As Miss Anran and Madam are kind,

93
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,360
they wanted to maintain family harmony,

94
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,800
so they just punished Aunt Cui.

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,319
Didn't expect

96
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,840
you aggravated it tonight.

97
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,919
Miss Xinran, you are so brutal.

98
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,039
Are you serious?

99
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,439
Master,

100
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,960
don't hear these maids

101
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,159
sowing discord.

102
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,879
Those

103
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,439
were done by Aunt Cui alone.

104
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,759
I know nothing about it.

105
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,199
Aunt Cui is your personal maid.

106
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,120
You have been together
for over two decades.

107
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,519
How could you know nothing about it?

108
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,839
You hid the poison in the Guanyin Statue

109
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,759
you gave me,

110
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,439
which made me get entangled in illness
for more than three years.

111
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,439
I didn't plan to

112
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,800
settle old scores with you.

113
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,360
But why did you injure Anran again?

114
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,959
Master,

115
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,079
you shall do justice for Anran.

116
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,720
What Guanyin Statue are you talking about?

117
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,519
Master.

118
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,279
I will go fetch it.

119
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,519
Anran.

120
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,519
Anran.

121
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,439
That's it.

122
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,600
Second Madam,

123
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,319
do you remember the Guanyin Statue?

124
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,120
You sent it to our Madam

125
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,560
three years ago.

126
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Because during these three years,

127
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,959
the Guanyin Statue
is enshrined on the table.

128
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,720
It is scented by sandalwood all day,

129
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,920
which covers up the smell inside.

130
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,680
What smell?

131
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,519
I don't know anything.

132
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,240
Holly.

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,199
Make it clear.

134
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,800
What is wrong on earth?

135
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,120
Master,

136
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,600
the reason why Madam

137
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,639
is ill for three years

138
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,000
is that Second Madam

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,600
concealed something in the Guanyin Statue.

140
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,360
I believe Second Madam

141
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,480
tries to murder Madam secretly

142
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,759
in silence by doing this.

143
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,639
Then, she can take over internal affairs.

144
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,279
Master,

145
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
I am wronged.

146
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,639
I prayed for this Guanyin Statue

147
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,720
to bring blessing to Madam.

148
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,199
Nonsense.

149
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,759
Master,

150
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,680
our Miss

151
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,160
detected something wrong with the statue,

152
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,560
so she moved it back to her room.

153
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,839
The doctor is here today.

154
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,759
What about

155
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,639
smashing it now

156
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,120
and asking the doctor

157
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
to tell who is true?

158
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,199
It is Aunt Cui.

159
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,319
It must be Anut Cui.

160
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,079
She is always malicious.

161
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,720
When my mom decided to marry dad,

162
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,360
Aunt Cui had already
been in dispute with mom.

163
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,480
She must feel resentment

164
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
and try to frame mom.

165
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,240
Right. Right.

166
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,600
It's Aunt Cui.

167
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,639
It struck me

168
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,560
that we did argue then.

169
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,120
She is proficient in pharmacology

170
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,560
and goes to pharmacies often.

171
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,519
We can go check

172
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,720
at the pharmacies in Su City.

173
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,759
There must be her order
of the root of bidentate achyranthes.

174
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,399
Second Madam,

175
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,079
I didn't mention

176
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,480
what you hid is
the root of bidentate achyranthes.

177
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,319
How do you know it?

178
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,639
You tripped me up?

179
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,800
Master,

180
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,560
our Miss

181
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
broke the Guanyin Statue accidentally,

182
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,680
and discovered the root.

183
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,959
But she knew

184
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,639
Second Madam won't confess for sure.

185
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,199
In case of warning her,

186
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,079
Miss asked us

187
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,480
to buy an identical statue.

188
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,160
Second Madam,

189
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,639
right now,

190
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,240
what is your excuse then?

191
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,879
Liu Mingyu!

192
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,000
How wicked you are!

193
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,079
Dad,

194
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,600
mom is really ignorant about this.

195
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,759
It was all done by Aunt Cui.

196
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,560
Dad.

197
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,160
Master.

198
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,279
All of these

199
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,800
were done by me alone.

200
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,800
None of their business.

201
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,480
Even Xinran knows nothing about it.

202
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
As for the Guanyi Statue,

203
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,639
I asked Aunt Cui

204
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,439
to conceal the root in it.

205
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,240
Lu Anran's walnut crisp

206
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,279
was poisoned by me as well.

207
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,680
Vicious woman!

208
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,079
Mom!

209
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,079
Drag her out.

210
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,480
Beat her with 50 bludgeonings.

211
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,319
Dad. Dad.

212
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,240
I...I...

213
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,319
I beg you, dad.

214
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,120
Lu Anran.

215
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,560
Dad, I plead with you.

216
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,680
Lu Anran.

217
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,959
Dad.

218
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,319
Mom.

219
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,560
Mom.

220
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,319
Master. Madam.

221
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,600
Miss is dying.

222
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,480
Anran.

223
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,240
Miss.

224
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,120
Anran.

225
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,800
Sis.

226
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,560
Miss.

227
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,360
Mom!

228
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,759
Beat her.

229
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,319
Mom!

230
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,160
Keep beating!

231
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,199
Dad.

232
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,839
Dad. Dad.

233
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,480
Dad, open the door.

234
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,919
I plead with you.

235
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,720
Please stop beating.

236
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,879
Mom will die, dad.

237
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,440
Yun. Yun.

238
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,120
Yun.

239
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,399
Beg dad with me.

240
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,279
Ask him to stop.

241
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,159
Dad.

242
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,600
Beg it!

243
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,840
Sis.

244
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,799
How could she do these?

245
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,480
So terrible.

246
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,840
You unfilial son!

247
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,639
Step away.

248
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,840
Dad.

249
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,519
Dad. Please.

250
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,240
Stop beating, please.

251
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,960
Dad, I plead with you.

252
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,720
Tell me!

253
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,799
Dad.

254
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,600
What poison did you give Anran

255
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,879
on earth?

256
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,440
Mom.

257
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,120
Give it up, Lu Qingzhou.

258
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,559
Even though

259
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,879
you know what it is now,

260
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,080
you can't save her life.

261
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,399
Today,

262
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,039
even God can't save her.

263
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,720
Consider the Lu Family first.

264
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,440
The royal family is going to get married,

265
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,960
but the bride dies suddenly.

266
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,399
I fret that the Lu Family

267
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,919
will suffer as well.

268
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,399
Are you forcing me?

269
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,840
I went for broke today

270
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,519
for Xinran exactly.

271
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,039
I bet my life

272
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,240
and the Lu Family.

273
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,080
Lu Qingzhou,

274
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
you have no choice now.

275
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,960
You made wrongdoings again and again.

276
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,799
Unforgivable!

277
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,559
Pass my order.

278
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,399
Never call for a doctor for her.

279
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Offenders

280
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,639
will be disciplined by the family law.

281
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,600
Yes, sir.

282
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,000
Mom! Mom!

283
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,480
Mom.

284
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,320
Dad, please excuse mom.

285
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,440
Mom will die.

286
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,279
Please call for a doctor for mom.

287
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:37,679
Dad.

288
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,639
Xinran.

289
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,720
You can't be that cruel, dad.

290
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,360
Don't go.

291
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,360
Mom. Mom.

292
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,440
Mom.

293
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,559
Girl.

294
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,519
Girl.

295
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,879
Don't cry.

296
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,919
Anran will surely die today.

297
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,399
We won.

298
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,320
All of the Lu Family

299
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,480
will be yours.

300
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,639
The Lu Family's Double Fish Order
will be yours.

301
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,559
Prince Qing will be yours as well.

302
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,440
Miss.

303
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,879
Doctor.

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
(Lu's Mansion)

305
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,399
Miss! Miss!

306
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,519
Doctor, hurry up.

307
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,399
Miss.

308
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,639
Steward.

309
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,559
Master.

310
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,240
Keep going find doctors.

311
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,720
Call for all the doctors

312
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,960
in Su City.

313
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,840
Yes, Master.

314
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,559
Right.

315
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,159
Take men to put up notices in the city

316
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,480
saying as long as one can save Anran,

317
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,200
he can ask for anything he wants.

318
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,600
Master,

319
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,000
it is Miss' last hours.

320
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,600
The priority

321
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,320
is His Majesty's imperial decree.

322
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,919
The bride welcoming team
led by Ninth Prince

323
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,320
is on its way.

324
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,759
If the bride they pick up is...

325
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,519
it will bring the royal

326
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,000
bad fortune.

327
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,039
(Welcome Bride)
So splendid.

328
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,799
What a scene!

329
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,919
Right.

330
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,559
Lavish.

331
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,159
Yes.

332
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,240
True it is.

333
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,159
(Welcome Bride)
Only a wealthy family will do so.

334
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,000
Right.

335
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,990
(Welcome Bride)

336
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,759
Master.

337
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,279
Master.

338
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,120
Master.

339
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,080
The bridal sedan chair
has arrived at the gate.

340
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,600
What should we do?

341
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,440
Master.

342
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,000
Madam is stricken with grief.

343
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,320
Yuzhu has sent Madam

344
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,279
back to the room for a rest.

345
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,639
Young Master

346
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,679
is staying with her.

347
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,840
Stand there.

348
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,120
Today is Miss Anran's wedding day.

349
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,120
How dare you wear this?

350
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,039
How could you?

351
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,759
Dad.

352
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,200
Sister is dying.

353
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,639
I will be the only daughter

354
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,759
of the Lu Family.

355
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,200
Rather than grieving here,

356
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,519
why don't you

357
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,320
think about the solution?

358
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,080
Do you have any other choice?

359
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,559
I can't believe you would be like this!

360
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,919
Princess Qing can only be me.

361
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,320
The daughter of the Lu Family
who gets married

362
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,240
can only be me as well.

363
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,679
Please prepare to see me off.

364
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,159
But we should pretend to the end.

365
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,759
She

366
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,320
must go with me.

367
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,759
Stop your wishful thinking.

368
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:24,879
I would rather die

369
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,200
than be your maid.

370
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,360
His Highness Prince Qing
and Ninth Prince

371
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,960
both know you are the most intimate maid

372
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,480
of Lu Anran.

373
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,120
If you aren't there,

374
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,679
how can we keep pretending?

375
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:38,919
Do you want us

376
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,759
to be exposed at the scene,

377
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,279
which will make all the family suffer?

378
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:46,960
Dad,

379
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,879
the bridal sedan chair has been waiting

380
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:49,879
for long at the gate.

381
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,159
If waiting for longer,

382
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,480
Ninth Prince will doubt
and come in to interrogate us.

383
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,480
Who will manage to save the Lu Family then?

384
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,639
If you don't consider others,

385
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,000
at least consider the Lu Family.

386
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,000
Didn't expect

387
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,320
your mom educated you to be like this.

388
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,400
(Hangde Hall)

389
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,399
Master.

390
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,279
I will go.

391
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,440
I will part company with you.

392
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,399
Also,

393
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,759
from today,

394
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,000
I am dignified

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,600
Princess Qing.

396
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,840
My mom

397
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,240
is Prince Qing's rightful mother-in-law.

398
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,799
Please give treatment to my mom.

399
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,039
If my mom has anything,

400
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,159
I will never

401
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,879
forget you kill my mom.

402
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,559
Shen Lanxi,

403
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,400
at last,

404
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,160
I am the winner.

405
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,500
(Hangde Hall)

406
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,920
Why it's you?

407
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,480
Didn't you die?

408
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,319
Why are you alive?

409
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,759
I went to the netherworld

410
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,279
and King Yama told me

411
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,119
someone would die ahead of me.

412
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,559
We should line

413
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,160
even in the netherworld, right?

414
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,680
How could it happen?

415
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,000
I have poisoned the walnut crisp.

416
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,119
You were dying then for sure.

417
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,960
Before you poisoned,

418
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,759
I asked Holly to change the poison.

419
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,920
Who knows

420
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,200
where you get the poison?

421
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,720
As for the poison,

422
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,400
I will feel at ease
when I have my own.

423
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,519
Are you mad?

424
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,839
Even forsake your own life?

425
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,920
Daddy is soft-hearted.

426
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,039
But you are cunning.

427
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,200
If my life didn't hang in the balance,

428
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,839
how would I be able to

429
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,480
make all your contributions

430
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,680
clear?

431
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,720
You risked your life to kill me.

432
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,200
I did the same.

433
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Second Madam.

434
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,000
But so what?

435
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,200
(Hangde Hall)

436
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,700
(Hangde Hall)

437
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,880
Let's set out.

438
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:03,880
Xinran has been on the bridal sedan chair.

439
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,640
Xinran

440
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,359
is Princess Qing instead.

441
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
But the daughter born
by the first madam is still alive.

442
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,720
The daughter born by the second madam
without the Double Fish Order.

443
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,839
How will it work for her

444
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,799
at the Mansion of Prince Qing?

445
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,720
Will a person as Prince Qing

446
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,640
leave a waste of space by his side?

447
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,920
I will let Xinran enjoy her

448
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,200
Princess Qing dream
for some days.

449
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,400
Here,

450
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,319
more surprises are waiting for her.

451
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,960
Lu Anran.

452
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,440
I am going to kiil you.

453
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,599
Miss.

454
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,559
The casket you ordered yesterday arrives.

455
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,640
Second Madam.

456
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,400
Bon voyage.

457
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,680
Lu Anran.

458
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:10,839
You.

459
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,960
You.

460
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,800
(Mansion of Prince Qing)

461
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,599
Thanks. Thanks.

462
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,839
Everyone.

463
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,920
Everyone.

464
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,759
Today,

465
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,799
you spare the time

466
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,039
to attend my wedding.

467
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,559
I am supposed to

468
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,359
drink with you for longer.

469
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,240
But Princess

470
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,519
married me from afar,

471
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,359
exhausted after a long trip.

472
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,240
I don't want to

473
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,720
keep her waiting for so long.

474
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,359
How about this?

475
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,759
I propose a toast to you

476
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,200
and leave in advance.

477
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,680
But

478
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,440
there must be plenty of good wines

479
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,160
at the Mansion of Prince Qing tonight.

480
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:00,480
Cheers.

481
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,920
Your Highness. Your Highness.

482
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:03,400
Your Highness

483
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,599
has drunk tea for the whole night,

484
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,559
without any wine.

485
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
Must be waiting for this beautiful night.

486
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:10,839
I heard

487
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,000
Her Highness Princess

488
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:14,119
started from scratch following her father.

489
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,200
Has something on the ball!

490
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,799
Here. Here. Your Highness.

491
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,759
I toast Your Highness.

492
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,119
Come on. Come on.

493
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,279
Come on. Your Highness.

494
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:22,200
I toast Your Highness. Cheers.

495
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,799
Here. Here. Here. Your Highness.

496
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,279
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

497
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,240
Ninth brother. Ninth brother.

498
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,599
If they keep toasting me

499
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,759
one after another,

500
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,119
the sister-in-law

501
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,160
you picked up with efforts

502
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,240
will run for real.

503
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,720
Here.

504
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:42,799
Everyone.

505
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,039
It is boring to ask my second brother

506
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:48,000
to drink tea for the whole night.

507
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,240
What about this?

508
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,240
Let my second brother go back

509
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,480
to accompany the bride tonight.

510
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,839
Tonight,

511
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,519
let me fuddle my nose with you.

512
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,480
Really nice of Ninth brother.

513
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,079
Reward me later.

514
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,440
How's it?

515
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:08,720
Could you now leave Second Brother

516
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,960
to enjoy his romantic night?

517
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,000
Okay!

518
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,759
Absolutely.

519
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,039
To Ninth Prince.

520
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:13,599
Leaving.

521
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:14,440
Cheers.

522
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,480
Cheers. Fuddle our noses.

523
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,039
Cheers. Cheers.

524
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:17,960
Fuddle our noses.

525
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,279
I haven't sent my present.

526
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:26,920
Second Brother.

527
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
I am really sorry.

528
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,920
I

529
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,400
should come earlier.

530
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,880
But His Majesty

531
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,279
had been calling my mom and I

532
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,599
to admire

533
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,519
the contraptions imported from South.

534
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,279
I couldn't excuse to leave.

535
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:43,799
Fourth Brother,

536
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,160
your visit to the Mansion of Prince Qing

537
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,000
makes it look resplendent.

538
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,400
You even bring a celebration gift.

539
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:54,960
I am really

540
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,519
flattered.

541
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,680
I am afraid

542
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,440
your wedding banquet

543
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,559
becomes mediocre.

544
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,279
So,

545
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,519
I bring you some rare foods.

546
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,240
Alright.

547
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,640
Take them in.

548
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,440
They were just unloaded from the ship.

549
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,799
I asked someone to carefully select

550
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:16,799
and send them to here.

551
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:20,880
Open it.

552
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,759
What are they? So stinky.

553
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,880
Who made this?

554
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:34,880
What is going on?

555
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,880
As Fourth Brother is pampered

556
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,200
and exalted,

557
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,039
it isn't rare

558
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,119
that you are not tolerant of others.

559
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,119
But you shouldn't waste the food.

560
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,480
Ninth Brother,

561
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,319
I am really sorry about that.

562
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,400
I don't know why these living things

563
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,640
turned into spoiled seafood

564
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,400
when arriving at
the Mansion of Prince Qing.

565
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,200
Did they

566
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:14,480
commit suicide

567
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,799
because they felt humiliated here?

568
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,400
For someone,

569
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,839
even if he gets good luck,

570
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,279
it won't change anything.

571
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,160
He still has to hang out

572
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,039
with these infamously bad soldiers.

573
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,759
What? What?

574
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,559
What are you saying?

575
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,079
Even the freshest river fresh

576
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:37,799
will be spoiled

577
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,720
after a long time.

578
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,079
Fourth Brother.

579
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,480
Even if

580
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,920
you make such a scene today,

581
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,119
you can't make progress by an inch.

582
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,279
You are anxious now,

583
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,720
so you distract yourself here.

584
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,359
We can understand it.

585
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,039
Right?

586
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,400
Yes.

587
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,039
We get it. We get it.

588
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,519
Don't think

589
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I don't get what you mean.

590
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,920
Why is there a living one?

591
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:16,920
Sorry.

592
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,519
My new clothes!

593
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:19,880
Fourth Brother.

594
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,480
Sorry.

595
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,799
It is my new clothes.

596
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:22,960
I don't know

597
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,279
it is still alive.

598
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:24,799
Nonsense.

599
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,799
It is dead.

600
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,880
My incaution is to blame.

601
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,599
Now it is dead for my stamping.

602
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,039
Look.

603
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,079
Wait and see!

604
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,720
Fourth Brother, take care.

605
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,920
You are leaving now?

606
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,680
It is dirty.

607
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:07,960
So funky.

608
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,920
Go wash.

609
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,519
This is your gratitude?

610
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,160
Don't throw them away.

611
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,079
Gave them as fodder to suburban fishermen.

612
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,200
Save your concern.

613
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,240
Leaving.

614
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,870
(Double Happiness)

615
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,680
Congratulations.

616
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,440
I am surprised

617
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,039
to see you

618
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:20,000
sitting here decently

619
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,359
Oh, yes.

620
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,519
Prince Yi came jsut now.

621
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,799
You don't know

622
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,559
he looked

623
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,759
as stupid as a pig.

624
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,759
I think

625
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,240
there will be

626
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,000
a boundless delights

627
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,799
if I confront him afterwards.

628
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:58,279
Here.

629
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,640
Cheers.

630
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,839
I know

631
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,079
we couple

632
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,720
aren't like other couples

633
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,119
who are well suited for each other.

634
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,160
But you need to think

635
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,839
there are so much cooperation

636
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,160
ahead of us.

637
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,559
So, for this glass of wine,

638
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,079
you should drink.

639
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,839
What?

640
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,559
Why do you throw yourself at me now?

641
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,559
You always travel around

642
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,359
and get your hands dirty.

643
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,519
Your hands

644
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,160
don't seem to

645
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
fit your nature.

646
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,799
Delicate.

647
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Tender.

648
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,240
Shouldn't you

649
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,079
confess

650
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,680
Lu Anran's whereabouts?

651
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,039
Sister...

652
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,359
died.

653
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,960
Lingxi?

654
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,759
When sister was about to leave,

655
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,359
she got seriously ill suddenly.

656
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,960
My father called for all the doctors

657
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,200
in Su City,

658
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,720
but still no medinces could help

659
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,519
and she passed away.

660
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,960
Although I didn't stay long

661
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:10,000
in Su City,

662
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,159
but I know well

663
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,360
Lu Anran

664
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,920
isn't a weakling

665
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,400
that will die all of a sudden.

666
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,880
What trick

667
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,519
does you siblings play on earth?

668
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,920
Have you ever

669
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,239
thought about the end

670
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,800
of the Lu Family

671
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,119
when you trick me?

672
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:43,920
As the Lu Family

673
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,960
is a family business with clean hands,

674
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,519
how could we dare to fool the prince?

675
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,519
The royal family's bestowing marriages

676
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,079
is no small thing.

677
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,199
Before sister died,

678
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,920
she left the Lu Family to me.

679
00:34:58,599 --> 00:34:59,239
I also understand

680
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,920
sister's emotion towards Your Highness.

681
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,559
For what sister can do for Your Highness,

682
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,760
I can do the same as well.

683
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:13,960
Okay.

684
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,519
Then tell me

685
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:17,840
what

686
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,320
can you do for me?

687
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,679
Since my sister passed away

688
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,000
and my brother is young,

689
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,719
only I can inherit

690
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,239
the Lu Family's Double Fish Order.

691
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:35,159
If Your Highness
is willing to accept Xinran,

692
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,920
I will supply all

693
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,519
the Lu Family owns

694
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,519
to you as you wish.

695
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,400
Never will I object.

696
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,440
You are so ignorant indeed.

697
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,960
Do you know how many business ships

698
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,840
the Lu Family owns?

699
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,480
Which manager

700
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,079
of the 36 ports will bow to you?

701
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,760
With a single Double Fish Order,

702
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,800
you think you are able to

703
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,519
do whatever you want.

704
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,559
Let me tell you.

705
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,360
The Lu Family will be mine.

706
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,679
Lu Anran

707
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,480
will also be mine.

708
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,639
Your Highness.

709
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,199
But sister is dead.

710
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,519
She won't be back for sure.

711
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,199
Your Highness.

712
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:32,079
Why don't you cherish
the one in front of you?

713
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,440
But the one in front of me
is not the one in my mind.

714
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,280
What's more,

715
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,480
what I hate most in my life

716
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,599
is being arranged.

717
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,760
Your Highness.

718
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,320
I know I am not as intelligent as sister,

719
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,039
but I am also the one

720
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,599
whose life is arranged.

721
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,840
If I don't adore Your Highness sincerely,

722
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,440
why would I yield to be a substitute

723
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,840
from a great distance?

724
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,000
Your Highness.

725
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,320
We both have no choices,

726
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,199
do we?

727
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,159
Listen.

728
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,719
Whether I have choices or not

729
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,920
doesn't depend on you.

730
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,440
For today's issue,

731
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:31,920
I can leave it

732
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,039
for now

733
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,440
considering the Lu Family,

734
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,480
but I won't let it go.

735
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,880
Lu Xinran.

736
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,079
You'd better have a say

737
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,119
in the Lu Family.

738
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,519
Otherwise, I don't care

739
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,119
if I have a wife

740
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,760
who dies at a young age in the mansion.

741
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,760
This word.

742
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,480
Remember it well.

743
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,800
Your Highness. Your Highness.

744
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,480
Your Highness.

745
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,920
Your Highness.

746
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,039
Wait and see.

747
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,559
I will have a say

748
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,280
in the Lu Family.

749
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,559
Miss,

750
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,159
I will go after you.

751
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,159
Ninth Prince.

752
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,079
It's your Miss's big day.

753
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:45,599
What're you doing?

754
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,239
Why do you take a knife?

755
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:48,960
Why do you cry?

756
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,760
Ninth Prince.

757
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,679
Miss is dead.

758
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,000
Then, who is inside?

759
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,800
It's Lu Xinran.

760
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,760
It was she and her mother

761
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,119
who poisoned Miss before she got married.

762
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,280
Miss was at her last breath then.

763
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,159
Lu Xinran knew

764
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,760
the decree didn't specify

765
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,079
which daughter of the Lu would get married.

766
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,320
She also knew

767
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:34,280
for the Lu Family,

768
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,519
Master would agree her to marry at last

769
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,039
for the larger picture.

770
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:43,079
Though I am a maid,

771
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,559
I knew what Master thought.

772
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,239
So, along this way,

773
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,960
I had to pretend with that woman.

774
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,880
But now, the show ends.

775
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,159
Even if I die now,

776
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,320
it won't affect the Lu Family.

777
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:06,840
Can you prove your deep relationships

778
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:07,719
with your Miss

779
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:09,000
even if you do anything rash?

780
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,880
What else

781
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,920
can I do for Miss?

782
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,159
I am going to Su City now.

783
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,800
If someone did poison her,

784
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,639
I won't let her go.

785
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,500
(Dahan River Map)

786
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,400
Miss,

787
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,840
please excuse my gossip.

788
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,280
But I can tell

789
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,039
Ninth Prince's sincere affection to you.

790
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,599
He may be

791
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,320
on his way,

792
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,400
rushing to here now.

793
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,400
If he can't see you,

794
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,639
he must worry about you.

795
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:14,119
If Miss could leave

796
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,159
some word,

797
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,559
maybe,

798
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,440
Ninth Prince could be relieved.

799
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,039
Why do you always think about him?

800
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,760
Because

801
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,480
during the days

802
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,639
when I stay with you,

803
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,400
I know everything

804
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,719
is under your control.

805
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:41,920
But

806
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,360
you get too many things in your mind.

807
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,400
Only when you

808
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,360
stay with Ninth Prince

809
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,360
will you look relaxed.

810
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:25,960
Lu Anran,

811
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,920
when I arrive in Su City,

812
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,800
you must reward me well.

813
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,920
I am toiled.

814
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,320
But you traveled so slowly.

815
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,920
I have been hurrying for a whole night.

816
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,960
Anran.

817
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,800
Anran, you are still alive.

818
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:06,920
Anran.

819
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:14,280
The farmers I know

820
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,920
are still vigorous

821
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,880
even after they plant and sow overnight.

822
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:24,360
Anran.

823
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,559
Anran.

824
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:29,679
Anran.

825
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:30,880
Anran.

826
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,039
Lu Anran!

827
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:37,239
Lu Anran, come out!

828
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:38,599
Anran.

829
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:40,960
Lu Anran.

830
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,639
Lu Anran. Come out.

831
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:45,280
Lu Anran.

832
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:47,440
Mu Chuan, I am leaving.

833
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:07,599
Is it true that you will vanish

834
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,880
when I touch you?

835
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,679
