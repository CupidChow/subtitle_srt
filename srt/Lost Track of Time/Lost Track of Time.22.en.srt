4
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,800
Do you like

5
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,759
the rabbit lanterns outside?

6
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,479
I obviously like them
since they are from you.

7
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,520
That's good.

8
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,560
The jade

9
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,199
is yours

10
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,080
eventually.

11
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,800
The jade is like my heart.

12
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,199
Hope you will cherish it.

13
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,240
And

14
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,120
believe it or not,

15
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,439
what I tell you tonight

16
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,000
is all from my heart.

17
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,560
My desire

18
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,560
to get well along with you

19
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,319
is true as well.

20
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
Thank you for
Your Highness's thinking about me.

21
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,759
I will bear it in mind.

22
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,719
Let's have a drink.

23
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,080
Your Highness never
drinks alcohol, doesn't you?

24
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,920
I can make an exception for you today.

25
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,920
Don't know if you know

26
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,720
why I don't drink.

27
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,040
When I was eight,

28
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,519
I used a glass of poisoned wine

29
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,399
to kill my mother in person.

30
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,199
In fact, Consort Liang

31
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,759
is not my mother.

32
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
(In Memory of Ms. Yao)

33
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,600
Consort Liang used my mother

34
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,439
to become a consort.

35
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,720
But after she was elevated to the consort,

36
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,439
she used a glass of poison

37
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
to kill my mother.

38
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
She also threw her body

39
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,839
into a well.

40
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,759
Consort Liang trampled on my mother

41
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,399
who lived like a servant.

42
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,319
She made my mother's life a living hell.

43
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,240
My mother was like an ant.

44
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,680
I have seen all.

45
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,800
But I thought then,

46
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,360
it was because of the status.

47
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,800
I took it for granted.

48
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,040
Afterwards, I knew my parentage.

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,399
In order to test me,

50
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,879
Consort Liang asked me
to give the glass of poison

51
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,680
to my mother.

52
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,639
I am wrong.

53
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,879
I can't defile His Highness's hands.

54
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,959
She didn't want my hands

55
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,680
to be blotted with my mother's blood.

56
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,040
But it was I who killed her in the end.

57
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,680
So,

58
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,879
whenever I see wine,

59
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,680
it reminds me of my biological mother

60
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,680
dying tragically in front of me.

61
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,120
As for His Majesty,

62
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,480
he knew it all.

63
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,120
However hard I try,

64
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,160
he won't see me in a different way.

65
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,120
Because in his eyes,

66
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,759
I am no more than

67
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,600
the disgrace of his one-time thing.

68
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,959
You said you don't like

69
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,839
my means.

70
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,759
Actually, I don't either.

71
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,399
But I have no choice.

72
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,519

73
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,480

181
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,879
Miss, are you alright?

182
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,080
Pride as Mu Ze is,

183
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,519
he won't be interested in me,

184
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,480
a dead body.

185
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,000
I won the bet.

186
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,000
(Su City)

187
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:34,879
Your Highness.

188
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,679
It's late at night.

189
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,600
You shall go back
to the mansion for a rest.

190
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,960
Your Highness.

191
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,159
You haven't left the workshop

192
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,720
since you were back from bride welcoming.

193
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,759
What about refreshing outside?

194
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,919
The weather changes.

195
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,639
Your Highness Prince Qi.

196
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,039
Your Highness Prince Qi.

197
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,399
Something's wrong.

198
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,600
Your Highness. Look here.

199
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,360
And here.

200
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,080
And here.

201
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,080
Your Highness, what is going on?

202
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,879
Your Highness, the same to this field.

203
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,320
When did it happen?

204
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,519
They were good some days ago.

205
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,480
Since yesterday,

206
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,399
the rice seedlings

207
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,399
started to wilt.

208
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:44,960
What's more,

209
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,000
they fell down batch by batch.

210
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Look sickly.

211
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,320
We don't know what we should do.

212
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,799
Your Highness Prince Qi.

213
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,679
What's wrong on earth?

214
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,120
It's bacterial wilt.

215
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,360
Usually happens
during the late rice filling stage.

216
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,480
Because the rice didn't
enjoy enough water early,

217
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,639
and met hot dry winds.

218
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,000
And we over fertilized.

219
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,159
So, the seedlings wilted extensively.

220
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,360
Can we save them?

221
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,840
If they need water, then we water them.

222
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,519
It's late.

223
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,240
Fertilizers has gone in the earth,

224
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,879
spreading over the fields.

225
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,000
We can only burn them

226
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,159
and take good care of the fields from scratch.

227
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,200
It is An Assuring Rice

228
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,120
cultivated by Your Highness carefully.

229
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,279
The harvest is coming soon.

230
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,200
Why does it happen

231
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,519
in a few days?

232
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,720
Everything has a spirit.

233
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,679
People will change their minds.

234
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
The same for plants.

235
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,639
We have cultivated for over half a year.

236
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,559
We did our best.

237
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,279
Your Highness,

238
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
should we burn them for real?

239
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:40,879
They absorb the same water.

240
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,600
They will get sick sooner or later.

241
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,679
Not ending it when we should,

242
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,240
we will suffer the consequence.

243
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,480
Zhufeng.

244
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,360
Fetch a torch.

245
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,240
Yes, Your Highness.

246
00:15:59,279 --> 00:15:59,840
Well...

247
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
Do you know what rice is?

248
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,759
What is it?

249
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,279
An Assuring Rice.

250
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,000
Do you know what it means?

251
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,279
Enjoy an assuring life
without worrying about famine.

252
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,799
The "An"

253
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,120
is from Anran.

254
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,679
Is growing the rice

255
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,159
in all the fields of Dahan,

256
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,559
seeing them taking roots and sprouting,

257
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,960
equivalent to your footsteps

258
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,440
spreading all over the country?

259
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,679
(So, the name)

260
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,559
(is actually personal for me.)

261
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,799
(This may be)

262
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,200
(our ending.)

263
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,359
Alright. Alright.

264
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,920
Why hasn't His Highness arrived yet?

265
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,279
Princess, don't worry.

266
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,759
His Highness needs to serve the guests.

267
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,000
After the guests leave,

268
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,079
he must

269
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,880
come back to you.

270
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,799
Of course.

271
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,559
This is the gold jade hairpin
His Highness sent me

272
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,440
when I married into the mansion.

273
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,440
Go to his court and
give it to His Highness secretly.

274
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,440
He will know what I mean.

275
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,279
His Highness can't come here.

276
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,240
What?

277
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,480
I heard from
people of His Highness's court

278
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
after Lu Anran entered the gate,

279
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:08,720
she was sent to

280
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,640
His Highness's room directly.

281
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,039
I have checked it in the front court.

282
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,039
His Highness

283
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,440
has gone back to his room.

284
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,799
You.

285
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,440
You.

286
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,720
How can he treat me like this?

287
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,160
Princess, cool down.

288
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,000
His Highness is a man as well.

289
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,759
He just thinks it's fresh.

290
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
His heart is still full of you.

291
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,000
Doesn't he promote Your Highness

292
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,599
as the Crown Princess?

293
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,839
Your Highness is listed

294
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,960
on the imperial genealogy.

295
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,880
Concubines are nothing.

296
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,480
No one will know her name.

297
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,000
It seems I care much about

298
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,480
the title of the consort.

299
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,359
What I want is His Highness.

300
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,759
What I want is his heart.

301
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:01,640
Princess.

302
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,759
Princess.

303
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,359
His Highness. His Highness is here.

304
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:08,839
Princess, see?

305
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,920
His Highness still priotizes you.

306
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,880
He changes his minds.

307
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,359
Wear it for me.

308
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,200
Okay.

309
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,440
Your Highness, I wait you for so long.

310
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,640
Your Highness. Princess.

311
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,799
I will take my leave.

312
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,440
Did Your Highness drink?

313
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,519
Your Highness never drinks, do you?

314
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:46,920
Did Your Highness

315
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,119
drink with Lu Anran?

316
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,160
If you mention her again,

317
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,519
you will be a buzzkill.

318
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
You treat her so well.

319
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,599
You hung rabbit lanterns for her

320
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,759
and drank for her.

321
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,920
What if she doesn't

322
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,839
pay attention to me,

323
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:05,960
the Crown Princess?

324
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,000
What does my princess want on earth

325
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,319
if you say so?

326
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,079
Since I am

327
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,480
the mistress of the Prince Qing's Mansion,

328
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,000
according to the rule,

329
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,759
she should greet me with tea

330
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,519
tomorrow morning.

331
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,599
But I am afraid you will worry her.

332
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
After all,

333
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,519
I got angry with you

334
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,599
because you decided to
marry a concubine.

335
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Now that it's rule,

336
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,279
then tomorrow,

337
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,359
you teach her well.

338
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,599
She is only a concubine.

339
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,839
You don't have to

340
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,519
tread on thin ice.

341
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,519
You can do whatever you want.

342
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,240
Miss,

343
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,960
having the medince,

344
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,559
you won't be pregnant for this life.

345
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,519
I know.

346
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,400
Miss.

347
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,519
Don't you have other choices for real?

348
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:51,920
No.

349
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,519
Have you ever considered

350
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,400
even if there is

351
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,599
a slim chance,

352
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,799
you will be together

353
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,079
with His Highness Prince Qi?

354
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,960
Not every time

355
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,799
will I manage to narrowly escape

356
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:08,880
as tonight.

357
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,839
Are you asking me

358
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,920
to bet against Mu Ze's patience?

359
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,039
There is no chance for me
to stay with Mu Chuan.

360
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,400
I am doing this with courage alone.

361
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,960
If I still think about retreat,

362
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,440

She's been waiting since one hour ago.

Pretentious.

399
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,400
Now that she is anxious
to greet me with tea.

Nanny.

401
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,079
Steam the tea cup.

Only in this way

403
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,160
can she show her sincerity.

404
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,279
I will go prepare now.

405
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,200
Greet Princess.

406
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,839
The tea is here.

407
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,400
Why? Unwilling to do so?

408
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,799
I don't dare to be unwilling.

409
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,960
Bring the tea with your hands
to show your sincerity.

410
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,839
As a concubine,

411
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,400
you even don't know this rule?

412
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,599
Princess, please have the tea.

413
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:34,599
Older sister Lu,

414
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,799
you look tired.

415
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,519
Didn't you sleep well last night?

416
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,960
Right though.

417
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,240
Afterall, you tried hard
to marry into the mansion.

418
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,880
But His Highness

419
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,559
didn't think about you at all.

420
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,319
Are you disappointed?

421
00:26:59,119 --> 00:26:59,920
Bold.

422
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,279
You dare to throw the tea
that should be served Princess.

423
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,039
Are you cursing Princess?

424
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,039
Don't you kneel down for the apology now?

425
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,000
It's all fragments.

426
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,359
Don't try to bully her.

427
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:09,960
Holly.

428
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,240
No offense.

429
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,799
Since you are disobedient...

430
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,519
No what disobedient.

431
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,400
Miss.

432
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,799
It's my fault.

433
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
Please Princess punish me.

434
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,359
Lu Anran, are you mad?

435
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,559
You are kneeling yourself.

436
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,519
I didn't force you.

437
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,440
It is I who threw the cup by accident,

438
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,720
which terrified Princess.

439
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,240
Please Princess punish me.

440
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,599
I...

441
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,319
You...

442
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,680
Aren't you powerful?

443
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,440
Why are you submitting to me now?

444
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,960
Do you have a scheme?

445
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,440
You...

446
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:17,880
Go away.

447
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,680
Don't make my eyes dirty.

448
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

449
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,160
Look at her.

450
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
Such a whammy.

451
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,680
Xiao Jingque clearly meant to
put Miss through the mill.

452
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,720
How could Miss hold back?

453
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,440
Today's punishment

454
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,839
seems to be jealous Xiao Jingque's

455
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,920
making use of the greeting.

456
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,480
In fact,

457
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,440
Mu Ze wants to alert me by this.

458
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,680
Is it because

459
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,240
Miss let Prince Qing down yesterday,

460
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,279
and he uses the opportunity
to strike you now?

461
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,279
Yes.

462
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:14,759
He wants me to know

463
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:17,000
whom I should obey

464
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,440
and bow down to in this mansion.

465
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,640
If I don't get hurt,

466
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,799
how do I back off

467
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,039
when I face Mu Ze later?

468
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,559
How do I use him

469
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,559
to avenge Lingxi's death?

470
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,839
Later?

471
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,279
Can we meet Prince Qing for sure?

472
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,160
He passes by here every day

473
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,200
after he finishes practicing the sword.

474
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,200
Lu Anran.

475
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,319
What's wrong with your legs?

476
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,119
I apologize for my disrespct.

477
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,319
Please Your Highness punish me.

478
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,279
Here. Sit.

479
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,519
I didn't notice the road carefully.

480
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,480
I fell down accidentally.

481
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,079
I think the injuries

482
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,920
are caused by edge tools.

483
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,440
Fell down by accident.

484
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:32,960
What?

485
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,759
Are there pieces of china on the floor?

486
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,359
Maybe because the stones on the ground

487
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,839
are too sharp.

488
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,480
Lu Anran.

489
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,079
Do you think

490
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,720
your words

491
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,720
are for the bigger picture?

492
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,119
But in my eyes,

493
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,160
you aren't appreciating
my good intention.

494
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,480
Do you know what I mean?

495
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,519
I am not thinking about
the bigger pitcture.

496
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,519
I hope

497
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,160
you could throw a tantrum

498
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,200
like common women instead.

499
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
I have the ability

500
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
to do the justice for you

501
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,480
and redress your grievance.

502
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,279
Today's punishment

503
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,880
is from you originally.

504
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,079
Should I ask for Your Highness

505
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
to punish yourself?

506
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,200
You are not silly.

507
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,039
What are you doing?

508
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,839
I have known that

509
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,799
it's not like Su City,

510
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,680
or on ships,

511
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,559
where I can do whatever I want.

512
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,759
In this mansion,

513
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,599
the only one I can rely on

514
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,240
is Your Highness.

515
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,799
I really feel confused

516
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,160
after listening to your words.

517
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,759
Where do your means

518
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,119
and schemes go?

519
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,640
If I really enjoy outstanding means,

520
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,920
how could I come down to this?

521
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,720
How could

522
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,160
Lingxi

523
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,400
die in Princess's hands?

524
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,920
So, I am frightened.

525
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,960
I fret I will not be able to awake

526
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,759
if I fall asleep.

527
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:19,839
I tell you.

528
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,519
Now that you are

529
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,240
my woman nowadays,

530
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,440
without my orders,

531
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,000
no one will hurt you by an inch.

532
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:29,920
Remember it?

533
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,519
Nanny.

534
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,480
If His Highness

535
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,799
knows about this thing,

536
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,759
will he think

537
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,920
I am evil?

538
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,960
Don't worry, Princess.

539
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,119
Your punishment

540
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,119
is originally what His Highness wants.

541
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,519
How will His Highness criticize you?

542
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,079
As Princess is elevated your status,

543
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,279
during these days,

544
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,839
many people sent presents.

545
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,440
Why not have a look?

546
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,240
You could also help His Highness

547
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,839
know whom he should socialize with.

548
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,240
This is the serious business.

549
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,000
Right. Right.

550
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,160
You are right.

551
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,279
Bring them

552
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,400
in now.

553
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,319
Yes, Your Highness.

554
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,000
(Lanyue Pavilion)

555
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,200
Miss, take care.

556
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,039
Wait a minute.

557
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,000
Here. Miss.

558
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,440
I didn't expect Prince Qing

559
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,200
would apply the medicine
for Miss in person.

560
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,480
He wants

561
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,720
a meek concubine.

562
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:02,839
I don't mind

563
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,119
pretend it sometimes.

564
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,519
I need to incite

565
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,039
flighty Xiao Jingque

566
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,519
to make a scene in my court.

567
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:13,920
Holly.

568
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,559
Have you sent the gift

569
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,760
I asked you to give Princess

570
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,960
yesterday?

571
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,519
Rest assured, Miss.

572
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,880
Miss's present

573
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,719
is no worse than noblewomen's

574
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,960
when they are placed together.

575
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,679
For what she likes,

576
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,840
I know it so well.

577
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,599
The icy jadeite from Jiaodong.

578
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,159
Your father as Assistant Minister of Works

579
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,039
manages the greatest jade store

580
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,400
in Jiaodong.

581
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,440
So lavish he is this time.

582
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:39,039
Holly,

583
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,840
go tidy up

584
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,559
the ground under the grape trellis.

585
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,360
(Lanyue Pavilion)

586
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,559
Otherwise, Princess

587
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,239
will have no place to kneel down later.

588
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,159
Remember to remind Shan Yue

589
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,719
to invite His Highness Prince Qing.

590
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,920
This show

591
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,880
can't start without him.

592
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,159
Relax, Miss.

593
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,599
Princess, look.

594
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,719
You could pick up your favorite one.

595
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,440
For the rest,

596
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,320
I will save them in the storeroom.

597
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,639
Later,

598
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,519
I will list the gifts.

599
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,000
You could have a look.

600
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,199
This is nice.

601
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,079
It enjoys high transparency
with glittering effect.

602
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,239
It's a rare treasure.

603
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,119
Looks good?

604
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,440
Since Princess is gorgeous,

605
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,599
whatever you wear will
add to your attraction.

606
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Your Highness Princess.

607
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,960
Butler Liu.

608
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,079
Princess, this is edible bird's nests

609
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,559
made by the chef.

610
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,480
It is done just now.

611
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,360
I especially offer you
to nourish your skins.

612
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,039
My brother said

613
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,920
although your son isn't talented,

614
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,559
he still has abilities.

615
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,360
In the barracks,

616
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,280
my brother gave him a great job
which is responsible for purchasing.

617
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,599
As for the future,

618
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,519
he should depend on himself.

619
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

620
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,239
You and General Xiao

621
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,400
are both our family's benefactors.

622
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,840
I will do whatever you want

623
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,159
at whatever costs.

624
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,360
Butler, please get up.

625
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,199
Thank you, Your Highness.

626
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,639
Princess,

627
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,079
there is a thing.

628
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,599
I don't know if I should say.

629
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:37,159
Just tell me.

630
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,400
Princess must watch out for the concubine.

631
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,519
This morning, after you punished her,

632
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,360
she didn't go back to her court

633
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,079
but she met His Highness in the garden.

634
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,159
His Highness still
applied the medicine for her personally.

635
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,519
She does go to great lengths.

636
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,599
No wonder

637
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:57,840
she knelt down herself.

638
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,880
It turns out she tortured herself
and went to His Highness

639
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,920
to seek for pity.

640
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
She used such means
right after she married.

641
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,440
Princess,

642
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,079
you should give her a lesson.

643
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,679
Let's go.

644
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,199
Call your hostress out.

645
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,599
What are you doing?

646
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,400
Get out.

647
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,320
Bold.

648
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,119
Get out of here.

649
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,159
As she marries into the mansion
as a concubine,

650
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,199
everything

651
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,360
belongs to the Mansion of Prince Qing.

652
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,679
The maids

653
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,960
are all outspoken.

654
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:25,360
The maids taught by Ms. Lu

655
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
all don't behave themselves.

656
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,360
Go away.

657
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,039
Miss!

658
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:38,960
Let me go.

659
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,079
Miss!

660
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:47,800
Princess.

661
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,880
I think I didn't offend you.

662
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,760
Why do you come to my court

663
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,840
and humiliate my maid like this?

664
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,960
If you have a word,
please say it directly.

665
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,760
Lu Anran,

666
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,880
don't you know what you have done?

667
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,559
Did you report me

668
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,280
to His Highness again?

669
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,159
Your Highness,

670
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:07,679
please

671
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,960
save our Miss.

672
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,000
It is said that

673
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Ms. Lu Anran is decisive and intelligent.

674
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,559
You run business

675
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,360
and build waterways.

676
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:23,920
You even sail with shipmen.

677
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:25,719
Can rival a man.

678
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,920
Why couldn't you stand it

679
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,119
when I asked you to kneel
on broken tea cup?

680
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,360
Princess.

681
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,880
I don't know what you mean.

682
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,239
If you feel agrrieved,

683
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,960
you could tell His Highness.

684
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,760
You don't need to come to my court

685
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,800
to slander me.

686
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,960
Miss.

687
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,679
You are still talking tough.

688
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:55,079
People in mansion

689
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,119
are crystal clear about

690
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,840
what you have done.

691
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,719
You are princess.

692
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,159
I will obey you naturally.

693
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,599
But I will never allow

694
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,719
someone to accuse me baselessly

695
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,840
and bully me.

696
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:09,920
You even talk back?

697
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,679
Miss! Miss!

698
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,000
Xiao Jingque.

699
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,360
Our Miss is at least Ms. Lu.

700
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,760
How can you be so cruel to her?

701
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,079
So what if she is Ms. Lu?

702
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,800
I am Princess Qing.

703
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,320
You can report me to His Highness

704
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,119
if you dare to.

705
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:27,480
Ms. Lu,

706
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,000
I especially

707
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,480
picked the tenderest bamboo stick for you.

708
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,440
When I fight you with this
after soaking in water,

709
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,599
you will feel itchy and painful.

710
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,599
However,

711
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:40,320
it won't leave scars on you.

712
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,639
This time, even if Ms. Lu

713
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:45,239
reports it to His Highness,

714
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:48,280
he won't care about

715
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,159
the wounds that are like mosquito bites.

716
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,800
Stop!

717
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,119
Your Highness.

718
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,199
Your Highness.

719
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:01,639
Miss.

720
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,119
It's not what you saw.

721
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,000
She knows pretentiousness the most.

722
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,159
She pretends to be innocent and pitiful.

723
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,840
She was arrogant just now.

724
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,760
It's not what I saw.

725
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,119
Then, I want to make sure if

726
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,159
the stick

727
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,559
falls to her body itself

728
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,199
and the blood on her knees

729
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,239
caused by herself.

730
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:25,840
Your Highness.

731
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:26,920
Because Ms. Lu

732
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,360
disrespected Princess first.

733
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,639
Princess just warned her
with a little punishment.

734
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,679
Warned her with a little punishment.

735
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,119
Warned her with a little punishment.

736
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,480
Warned her with a little punishment.
Warned her with a little punishment.

737
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:38,199
Did warn her with a little punishment.

738
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,000
Princess,

739
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,800
I am only a concubine.

740
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,000
I know I should respect you.

741
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,800
You complain I steal your thunder.

742
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,480
You can't stand
there is one more woman in the mansion.

743
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,239
I can understand.

744
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,719
Even after you pushed Lingxi to the ground,

745
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,880
causing her to bleed to death.

746
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,199
I didn't ask for

747
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,519
an explanation from you.

748
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,079
Bleed to death?

749
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,480
But...

750
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:07,920
But she was disrespectful.

751
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,840
She contradicted me again and again.

752
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:12,360
I just pushed her slightly.

753
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,800
I don't know she is dead.

754
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,480
Right. Pushed slightly

755
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,400
and you killed someone.

756
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,639
It was I who killed her accidentally.

757
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,239
Please punish me if Your Highness wants.

758
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,440
Princess.

759
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:30,360
Do you know

760
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,880
Lingxi grew up with me.

761
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,800
We are like siblings.

762
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,159
But she died in my court.

763
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,519
It's not because I don't care

764
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,280
but because I know about the status.

765
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,960
I know His Highness doesn't like

766
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,280
intrigues in the harem.

767
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,719
I have so tolerated it.

768
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,519
Why do you still act like this?

769
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,199
Xiao Jingque,

770
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,239
I allow you to master the harem.

771
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,800
This is how you do it?

772
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
No, Your Highness.

773
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,159
I-I am wronged.

774
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,719
I didn't mean it.

775
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,840
Lingxi is dead.

776
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,559
She can't come back.

777
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,639
I don't want to engage

778
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,320
the things

779
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,400
between Princess and Your Highness.

780
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:06,039
I am tired. Please excuse my leave.

781
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:17,400
Your Highness,

782
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,679
there is a thing.

783
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,960
I think you should

784
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,280
ask Princess personally.

785
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,159
Where did Princess get the bracelet

786
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,000
she wears?

787
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,440
What...

788
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,519
What's wrong with the bracelet?

789
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,159
It is made in Jiaodong.

790
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:38,280
Made of icy jadeite.

791
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,840
It boasts high transparency
with rarely-seen glittering effects.

792
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,159
When I shipped to Jiaodong,

793
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,400
I am lucky to have had a look at it.

794
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:45,960
With the bracelet's quality,

795
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,639
you can buy

796
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:48,960
ten private houses of the Lu's Mansion.

797
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,920
This is a gift

798
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,360
sent by a noblewoman in Hanjing.

799
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,519
I don't know it is so valuable.

800
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,519
Can't Lingxi's life

801
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,360
and the mansion's reputation

802
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,239
compare with

803
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:04,679
Princess's transient delight?

804
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,119
Holly.

805
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,280
Yes, Your Highness.

806
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:12,320
Where did Lingxi die?

807
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,000
Your Highness,

808
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,320
right under the grape trellis.

809
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,760
Here. Come here.

810
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,400
Kneel down.

811
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:35,840
