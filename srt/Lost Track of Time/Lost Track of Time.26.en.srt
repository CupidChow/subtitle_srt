2
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,840
Brother,

3
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,599
I heard that in the morning court today,

4
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
His Highness Prince Qi impeached you.

5
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,439
They said you ordered the garrison
to beat and kill tenants.

6
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,640
Is it true?

7
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,000
It's okay now.

8
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,920
Can't you trust my brother's men?

9
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,560
They took

10
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
all the blame.

11
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,879
As for His Majesty,

12
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,439
he just scolded me

13
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,079
for not being restrained properly.

14
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,920
It's just a few months' salary.

15
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,879
Their Highnesses have always been close brothers.

16
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,840
Prince Qi is so confused.

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
It's not like he doesn't know

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,400
that Brother is helping His Highness.

19
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,599
Because of this,

20
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,159
they have broken off friendships.

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
What?

22
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,400
It's because His Highness
indulged him too much.

23
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,439
That's why Prince Qi

24
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,879
is so unscrupulous.

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,919
It's a pity that I didn't take the chance

26
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,680
to kill him this time.

27
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,919
But Brother,

28
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,439
he is the prince.

29
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,479
Isn't it too risky?

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,080
Don't worry.

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,919
I'm not stupid.

32
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,560
I just want to force Lu Yun to do it,

33
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,199
and then find an excuse,

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,520
saying that

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,159
Prince Qi brought people to
make trouble in the army,

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,800
and Lu Yun knew that

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,439
Prince Qi injured his sister,

38
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,520
so he did it in a hurry.

39
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,199
In this way,

40
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,520
we can kill Prince Qi

41
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,199
and Lu Anran smoothly.

42
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,360
I see.

43
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,639
But brother,

44
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,479
don't take risks like this in the future.

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,960
If something happens,

46
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,120
what should we do?

47
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,360
Got it.

48
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,199
I have to save my life

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,719
to protect you.

50
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,439
Speaking of Lu Anran,

51
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,120
she has been having a hard time recently.

52
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,479
Not only was she stabbed

53
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,199
by His Highness Prince Qi,

54
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,360
a trusted maid also

55
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,680
left the mansion.

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,919
She even made a scene before she left.

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,759
It really cheered people up.

58
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,000
Sister,

59
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,080
maybe we can take this opportunity

60
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,800
to kill Prince Qi.

61
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
And Lu Anran.

62
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,879
Doctor, how is my brother?

63
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,000
It's nothing serious.

64
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,879
He'll wake up in a couple of days.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,680
Thank you.

66
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,560
Fine, fine.

67
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,519
It's because Leader Shen

68
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,319
is lucky enough.

69
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,519
He didn't hurt the vital part.

70
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,079
I'll get going.

71
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,000
Thank you for your hard work.

72
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,439
Miss,

73
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,879
someone is looking for you outside the door.

74
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,879
One should be treated differently

75
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,720
after three days.

76
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,600
Who would have thought that

77
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,160
once a maid in the mansion

78
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,720
now becomes the head

79
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,639
here.

80
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,399
General Xiao, you're too serious.

81
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,519
It's just that my elder brother
is ill in bed now,

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
so I'm just taking care of some chores.

83
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,519
You really can't say I'm "head".

84
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,160
I wonder

85
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,600
how is Leader Shen's injury now?

86
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,120
General Xiao,

87
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,399
you and I have no friendship.

88
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,399
There's no need to bother

89
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,439
and greet me here.

90
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,439
If there's something, please be frank.

91
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,839
Okay.

92
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,079
Then I won't beat around the bush.

93
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,639
Why did Leader Shen fall into a coma?

94
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,000
You know it better than I do.

95
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,759
Girl,

96
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,439
don't you

97
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,600
want justice

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,319
for your brother?

99
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,399
Lu Anran stabbed my brother,

100
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,160
so she deserves to die.

101
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,680
But on that day,

102
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,600
who tied my brother up there

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,040
and tempted us into it?

104
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,839
General Xiao, do you think

105
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,560
I don't know?

106
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,399
His Highness Prince Qing

107
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,040
and I really want to

108
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,879
test Lu Anran.

109
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,160
However,

110
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,439
we didn't do anything

111
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,600
to Leader Shen.

112
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,360
If it weren't for Lu Anran

113
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,000
selling his friends for glory,

114
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,680
how could it have come to this?

115
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,079
General Xiao asked me to come here today.

116
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,480
Do you still want to

117
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
test Lu Anran?

118
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,199
This woman

119
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,040
is too shrewd,

120
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,120
too malicious,

121
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,879
and resourceful.

122
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,040
If she is still alive,

123
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,839
it won't do us any good.

124
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,639
Now that Miss Holly

125
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,160
has stepped into the world of Jianghu.

126
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,879
Don't you have any idea of

127
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,519
avenging him?

128
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,720
What do you want to do, General?

129
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,920
Although Lu Anran

130
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,360
did it watertight,

131
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,560
she

132
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,600
has a fatal weakness.

133
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,360
That is

134
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,600
His Highness Prince Qi.

135
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,519
As long as you

136
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,759
help me kill Lu Anran,

137
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,079
I promise,

138
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,399
for what your gang has done recently

139
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll let bygones be bygones.

140
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,759
I didn't expect that a great general

141
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
would use his personal relationship,

142
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,920
and such despicable means

143
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,879
to deal with others.

144
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,480
It's really eye-opening.

145
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,519
Miss Holly,

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,440
I didn't say that

147
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,279
they had an affair.

148
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,440
A general can abandon

149
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,279
the integrity of soldiers,

150
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
but Holly can't disgrace

151
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,279
Qinghe Gang.

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
I have my own way to deal with Lu Anran.

153
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,679
General. Please go back.

154
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,519
You.

155
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,600
You'd better

156
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,879
appreciate my kindness.

157
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,960
I'll not see you off.

158
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,000
By showing me these,

159
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,720
what do you want to do?

160
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,919
I want justice.

161
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,399
Xiao Ying's henchmen
have been brought to justice.

162
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,279
Prince Yi

163
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,279
has been punished.

164
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:36,960
There's no need to discuss

165
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,519
this matter anymore.

166
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,840
Stop fooling around.

167
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,559
Your Majesty is the emperor of Dahan.

168
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,399
But why

169
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,720
do you ignore

170
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,039
their sufferings and grievances?

171
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,399
It seems that you really want

172
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,320
justice.

173
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,000
Then let me ask you.

174
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,399
Where is justice?

175
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,159
Justice is written in the law,

176
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,840
and in the hearts of the people.

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,519
If, as you said,

178
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,399
justice is written in the law,

179
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,600
why don't you go to the Ministry of Penalty?

180
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,679
Why didn't you ask the Third Division?

181
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,720
Why do you come to my Imperial Study?

182
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,600
Because you know in your heart,

183
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,799
justice

184
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,039
is in my hands.

185
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,639
I hope

186
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,000
you can understand

187
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,279
the real justice

188
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,519
is not determined by God,

189
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,120
but by the emperor.

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,600
You should think about it.

191
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,240
If you want real justice,

192
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,720
you should consider

193
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,080
taking that seat.

194
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,400
(Xiao)

195
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,830
(Xiao)

196
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:33,919
Your Highness,

197
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,480
Xiao Ying is not in the barracks.

198
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
I just heard that

199
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,480
he went to Qinghe Gang.

200
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,240
The head of Qinghe Gang

201
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,200
is Ms. Lu's

202
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,039
maid,

203
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,799
Holly.

204
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,879
He went to see Holly?

205
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,399
But I didn't

206
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,399
find out the details.

207
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,080
The person I asked

208
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,519
didn't make it clear.

209
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,840
Xiao Ying is too selfish,

210
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,960
he may not be loyal.

211
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,840
From now on,

212
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
we have to be more careful.

213
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,679
Yes.

214
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,759
Miss,

215
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,600
it seems the fish has taken the bait.

216
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,080
People following Xiao Ying
came back and said

217
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,159
when he came out of Qinghe Gang,

218
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
he seemed to be very angry.

219
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,159
It doesn't matter.

220
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,480
The angrier he is,

221
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,799
the more he won't let it go.

222
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,320
But you still have to

223
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,840
remind Holly to be careful.

224
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,000
She should give in at the right moment.

225
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,279
Don't hurt Qinghe Gang.

226
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,200
Yes.

227
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:44,559
Well,

228
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,120
Miss.

229
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,039
Just say what you want to say.

230
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,360
Xiao Ying is a general.

231
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,159
If what we're doing

232
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,120
doesn't work out,

233
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,240
wouldn't it be a big disaster?

234
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,799
If we keep treading as on eggs,

235
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,639
how can we deal with Xiao Ying?

236
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,240
However...

237
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,919
Xiao Ying and Mu Ze

238
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,159
are already at loggerheads.

239
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,279
Only by making him feel that Xiao Ying

240
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,200
is out of control,

241
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,000
can we have a chance to kill him.

242
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,759
Although Xiao Ying holds the capital army,

243
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,879
if it can't be used by himself,

244
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,279
for Mu Ze,

245
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,279
he won't give it to anyone else.

246
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,960
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

247
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,279
Then,

248
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,679
what about His Highness Prince Qi?

249
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,919
He stabbed me.

250
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,840
This time I took advantage of him.

251
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,159
We're even.

252
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,759
Brother, you mean,

253
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,679
they do have an affair.

254
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,519
That maid,

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,279
was hiding something,

256
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,399
but her

257
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,879
expression betrayed her.

258
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,200
However,

259
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,799
she didn't agree to work with me.

260
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,399
It makes me

261
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,720
admire her a little.

262
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,039
Brother,

263
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,120
don't just admire her.

264
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,120
What should we do next?

265
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,679
Although she looks like

266
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,600
a tough guy,

267
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,000
now,

268
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,159
Qinghe Gang is leaderless.

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,440
She's just a little girl,

270
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,799
as long as I use some means

271
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,600
she must come to me.

272
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,679
Brother,

273
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,759
you must hurry up recently.

274
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:27,960
His Highness's attentions

275
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,039
are on Lu Anran.

276
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,320
I have to show

277
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,240
that I am broad-minded.

278
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,440
I can't say anything.

279
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,200
It's killing me.

280
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,720
I'm anxious, too.

281
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,200
After all, Prince Qi

282
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
is still staring at me.

283
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:47,960
(Qinghe Court)

284
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,159
Something bad happened.

285
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,440
What are you doing?

286
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,519
What are you doing?

287
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,639
Some people went to
the barracks to report that

288
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,200
in the name of helping people,

289
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,799
Qinghe Gang robbed houses,

290
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,960
burned, killed, and pillaged.

291
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,679
They are the evil of this place.

292
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,600
Before we figure it out,

293
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,559
no one is allowed to
go in or out of Qinghe Gang.

294
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,200
Bullshit. Who reported it?

295
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,879
Ask him to confront us.

296
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,759
Guys, let's fight with them!

297
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,080
Let's go! Let's go!

298
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,919
Don't move.

299
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,080
I want to see your general.

300
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,159
I knew you'd come to me.

301
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,840
General Xiao, what do you want?

302
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,480
I've already told you.

303
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,039
As long as you let me get the evidence

304
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,639
of Lu Anran and Mu Chuan's affair,

305
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,559
I'll withdraw my troops immediately.

306
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,679
Wait, wait.

307
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,159
Wait.

308
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,799
What's wrong?

309
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,639
Is the vegetable for

310
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,960
Ms. Lu?

311
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:04,759
Yes.

312
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,840
Let me see whether it's fresh or not.

313
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,279
There's nothing to see here.

314
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,360
Hurry up.

315
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,639
I'll get someone to move the vegetables.

316
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,240
Okay.

317
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,340
(Meet you at a private house in the western suburb at 15:30.)

318
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,519
They really communicate through

319
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,720
the vegetables

320
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,840
sent to Lu Anran's court daily.

321
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,879
What a good idea.

322
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,600
If General hadn't

323
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,720
extorted a confession from Holly,

324
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,720
who could find out?

325
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,920
Nanny,

326
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,240
put this letter back.

327
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,559
If this pair of lovebirds
don't keep an appointment,

328
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,039
how can we catch them red-handed?

329
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,680
Yes.

330
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,519
Your Highness.

331
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:30,720
Your Highness.

332
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,799
It's been so long.

333
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,920
Why are you still ignorant of the rules?

334
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,680
I have something important to tell you.

335
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,880
What is it?

336
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,279
Today, the chef mistakenly

337
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,759
took back Ms. Lu's

338
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,559
vegetables.

339
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,839
And a huge scandal

340
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,000
breaks.

341
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,240
Your Highness.

342
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
How is Brother Shen?

343
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
He hasn't woken up yet.

344
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,559
But the doctor said

345
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,920
he's fine now.

346
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,920
Holly, come on.

347
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,160
Why are the soldiers outside here?

348
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,279
Xiao Ying

349
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,319
knows Your Highness

350
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,160
hasn't given up on investigating him.

351
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,799
So...

352
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,279
He surrounded this place but didn't move.

353
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,759
Obviously, he is trying to

354
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,599
make a deal with me.

355
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,559
Holly, don't worry.

356
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,799
It doesn't matter if you say it directly.

357
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,079
He asks you to meet him at a private house

358
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,599
in the western suburb at 15:30.

359
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,319
Take good care of Brother Shen.

360
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,200
I'm sorry,

361
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,359
Your Highness Prince Qi.

362
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,200
(Qinghe Court)

363
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,720
Shan Yue,

364
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,759
I need your cooperation later.

365
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:42,920
Don't worry.

366
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:43,720
Leave it to me.

367
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:30,839
Help!

368
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,359
Help!

369
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,519
Help!

370
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,799
Help!

371
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,799
Help!

372
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,000
Anran!

373
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,240
Someone is putting incense in the room.

374
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,400
I'm afraid I'll be dizzy.

375
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,680
So I pricked myself with a hairpin.

376
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,000
In order to protect me,

377
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,039
Shan Yue fights with them.

378
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,680
I took advantage of the chaos to run out.

379
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,000
Your Highness,

380
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,200
there must be something fishy.

381
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:20,720
Let's go.

382
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,599
Go in first.

383
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,000
Shan Yue.

384
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:31,720
Shan Yue.

385
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,160
Where is the bad guy?

386
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,920
I don't even see a shadow.

387
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm afraid he hears

388
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,799
the sound outside,

389
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,079
and jumps out of the window.

390
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
What's going on?

391
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,279
That's the case.

392
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,519
Your Highness,

393
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,720
Lu Anran and Prince Qi

394
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,400
must have a private meeting here.

395
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,359
Unfortunately, we arrived early.

396
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,319
So, they use the ruse of self-injury.

397
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:11,920
Your Highness,

398
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,680
I am a man who is not married yet.

399
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,519
It's fine for you to make up

400
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,720
some erotic history before.

401
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,920
What you just said

402
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
not only slanders Ms. Lu,

403
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,319
but also ignores His Highness Prince Qing's

404
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,119
face.

405
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,359
If you just say it without thinking,

406
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,119
it would be too disgusting.

407
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,599
If I wronged you before,

408
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,359
you should

409
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,039
avoid suspicion more.

410
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,480
So suspectable.

411
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:39,799
Your Highness,

412
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,680
they just can't forget each other.

413
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,720
Ninth Brother,

414
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
why are you here?

415
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,039
Xiao Ying asked me to come.

416
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,920
Your Highness Prince Qi,

417
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,279
you always think of yourself as a gentleman.

418
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,279
Unexpectedly,

419
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,319
you're such a dirty person.

420
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:12,440
Xiao Ying,

421
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,400
you're really in time.

422
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,319
Holly?

423
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,119
Holly,

424
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,279
why are you here?

425
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,880
Good question, Ms. Lu.

426
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,319
If it weren't for your former confidant,

427
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,079
how can we know that

428
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,759
you secretly collude with His Highness Prince Qi.

429
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Holly,

430
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,319
why are you with Xiao Ying?

431
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:52,640
Didn't you say he wanted to

432
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,400
make a deal with me?

433
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,880
Your Highness, I didn't say that.

434
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:02,559
Ms. Lu has always been skilled,

435
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,839
so I specially brought Holly here today

436
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,400
to prevent you from denying it.

437
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,640
Holly, tell us the truth.

438
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,799
Lu Anran killed my brother.

439
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,559
Today, even if I risk my life,

440
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,759
I will reveal her true colors.

441
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,359
Your Highness Prince Qing,

442
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,319
before she entered the mansion,

443
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,119
he fell in love with His Highness Prince Qi.

444
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,160
After the Lu Family loses
power and influence,

445
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,519
she has no choice but to join you.

446
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,839
But she's still attached

447
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,599
to His Highness Prince Qi.

448
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,640
She even asked us

449
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,559
to use the food truck to
deliver the message for her

450
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,759
to deceive the public.

451
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,680
Your Highness,

452
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,920
you are too indulgent.

453
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,000
That's why Prince Qi

454
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,119
did such an immoral thing.

455
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,319
As for my inner disputes,

456
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,640
you are quite clear about it.

457
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,359
I dare not.

458
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,960
I put Lu Yun in your army,

459
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,680
but you made him kill ninth brother.

460
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,759
I'm just thinking of you.

461
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,319
How dare you kill my ninth brother?

462
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,519
You really don't

463
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,559
respect me.

464
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,480
Xiao Ying went to Qinghe Gang.

465
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,000
This person is too selfish

466
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,319
he may not be loyal.

467
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,400
Your Highness,

468
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,799
General Xiao took advantage of your suspicion

469
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,720
to kill His Highness Prince Qi and me.

470
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,200
Not only can he get rid of

471
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,359
His Highness Prince Qi's entanglement,

472
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,759
but he can also help his good sister

473
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,160
to kill me, her most hated person.

474
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,599
Kill two birds with one stone.

475
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,720
Holly,

476
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,599
you said Xiao Ying's garrison

477
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,279
surrounded Qinghe Gang.

478
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,119
He is not to make a deal with me,

479
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,319
but to force you

480
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,319
and threaten me, right?

481
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,759
Your Highness, isn't it strange

482
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,079
if Holly wants to avenge me,

483
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,480
why didn't she tell the so-called affair

484
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,680
between His Highness Princess Qi and me

485
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,519
on the day she left the mansion?

486
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:57,839
Instead, why does she have to go around

487
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,000
in such a big circle to find General Xiao?

488
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,519
Xiao Ying,

489
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,640
did you

490
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,680
really surround Qinghe Gang?

491
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:05,920
Yes, I did.

492
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:06,839
But,

493
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:07,880
I did it

494
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,400
to make Holly tell the truth.

495
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,720
Holly,

496
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,720
as long as you tell the truth,

497
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,400
for what happened today,

498
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,079
I will let bygones be bygones.

499
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,480
Your Highness Prince Qi,
I tricked you into coming here.

500
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,359
I'm sorry to you.

501
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,000
But I really have no choice.

502
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,400
Xiao Ying said that if
I don't cooperate with him,

503
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,599
he will kill everyone in the Qinghe Gang

504
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,720
with any excuse.

505
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Your Highness Prince Qing,

506
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
the truth is,

507
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,079
what I said today is not true.

508
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,039
The food truck.

509
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,400
The secret affair.

510
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:52,960
It's all made up by Xiao Ying.

511
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,759
He asked me to say it .

512
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,920
He forced me to say it.

513
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,599
Nonsense!

514
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,400
General Xiao,

515
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,880
you failed to kill me before.

516
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,599
Now you're using such

517
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,240
despicable means to frame me up.

518
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:06,079
Do you deserve to be a general?

519
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,200
Your Highness, I think I have to advise you

520
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,759
Xiao Ying is unfaithful and unjust.

521
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,960
He even dares to make use of Your Highness.

522
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,279
In the future,

523
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:13,559
will he fight for your great cause

524
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,680
for Your Highness?

525
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,599
Lu Anran.

526
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,920
I'll kill you.

527
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,440
Brother!

528
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,480
Brother! Brother!

529
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,160
Your Highness.

530
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,240
You're still not going to tell me, are you?

531
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,519
What do you want me to say, Your Highness?

532
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,720
Tell me about what happened today.

533
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,319
Your Highness has saved Holly before,

534
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,839
but I falsely accused Your Highness today,

535
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,160
humiliating Your Highness
in front of everyone.

536
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,279
I deserve to die.

537
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,799
Please punish me, Your Highness.

538
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:29,839
Holly,

539
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,359
you know what

540
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,079
I want to ask.

541
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:39,960
You and Lu Anran

542
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,039
used to be so close.

543
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,359
Why did you act like this today?

544
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,119
Didn't you trust her very much?

545
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,319
Just because of what Your Highness said,

546
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,160
she sacrificed my brother

547
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,240
to save her life.

548
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,680
Okay.

549
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,799
It seems that

550
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,359
you hate her very much now.

551
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,359
Yes.

552
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,440
So you cooperate with

553
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,359
Xiao Ying's action today,

554
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,200
accusing Lu Anran and me

555
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,400
to get back at her?

556
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,200
No.

557
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,319
Xiao Ying coerced me.

558
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,799
Coerced by him.

559
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,319
Why did you expose him in public?

560
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,240
If you insist on accusing him,

561
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,119
you can solve the Qinghe Gang's problem,

562
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,759
and also revenge for Brother Shen.

563
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,759
Isn't that killing two birds with one stone?

564
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,839
Now you've exposed him.

565
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:42,960
You can't

566
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,119
do good for any side.

567
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,000
Your Highness,

568
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,400
I'm just a little maid.

569
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,960
In the face of such a situation,

570
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,200
how can I

571
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,240
be so thoughtful?

572
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,759
It's not that you're thoughtless,

573
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,519
but that you know

574
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,319
the one who's going to win today

575
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,680
can keep Qinghe Gang safe,

576
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,480
can keep you safe as well.

577
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,200
So you cooperated with her,

578
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,000
and put on a play.

579
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,599
You drove her to a desperate situation,

580
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,359
and then washed her out again.

581
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:17,920
My second brother's monstrous anger

582
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,359
must be nowhere to put it.

583
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,640
As it happens,

584
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,440
Xiao Ying has a grudge against him originally.

585
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,319
What's more, it's a trap to kill him today.

586
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,279
How could my second brother
let him go so easily?

587
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,960
Your Highness, don't push me anymore.

588
00:31:58,599 --> 00:31:59,400
Lu Anran.

589
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:05,400
You scheme everyone.

590
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,440
Even me.

591
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,680
Shut up!

592
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,160
Shut up!

593
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,920
Shut up! Shut up!

594
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,440
I'll ask my brother

595
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:01,799
to kill all of you!

596
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,799
All of you!

597
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,720
Where is my brother?

598
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,759
I want my brother.

599
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,519
I want my brother!

600
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:19,960
Don't laugh!

601
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,519
You! Shut up!

602
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,400
Brother.

603
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,839
I want my brother.

604
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,160
No.

605
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,160
No.

606
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,039
No.

607
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,640
No.

608
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,160
No.

609
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,480
Princess, don't be nervous.

610
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:01,599
I

611
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,319
won't do anything to you.

612
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,679
Tomorrow is Double Ninth Festival，

613
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,039
I will take you to the height

614
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,079
to enjoy chrysanthemums.

615
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,000
Look at you now.

616
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,960
It's a disgrace to Prince Qing's Mansion.

617
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,840
Freshen up.

618
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,679
By the way,

619
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,440
don't you miss your brother very much?

620
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,920
General Xiao

621
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,039
will go with us tomorrow.

622
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,440
Happy?

623
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,119
You'd better wear the hairpin I give you.

624
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:00,599
Brother.

625
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,960
What did you say? Brother.

626
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,920
Brother, say something.

627
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,639
Brother.

628
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,320
Brother, I was wrong.

629
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:12,079
Don't leave me.

630
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,519
Brother.

631
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,639
I was wrong.

632
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,519
Brother.

633
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,000
Brother.

634
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,000
I was wrong.

635
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,039
Don't go.

636
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:32,639
Don't leave me alone.

637
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,800
Your Highness, something big happened today.

638
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,800
I'm sure you won't think of it.

639
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,679
The dam is closing soon.

640
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,039
Any mistakes are not allowed.

641
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,400
What's going on?

642
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,679
The dam is in good condition,

643
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,079
so it will be opened on time
for acceptance check.

644
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,559
Then what is it?

645
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,039
Xiao Ying is dead.

646
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,440
Your Highness,

647
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,960
why aren't you surprised at all?

648
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,280
Do you know how he died?

649
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,679
How did he die?

650
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,719
He climbed high and fell to his death
at Double Ninth Festival.

651
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,639
As a general,

652
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,159
he doesn't die in battle.

653
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,800
But he climbed a mountain and fell to death.

654
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,239
It makes me laugh my head off.

655
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,079
Who knows who will take over

656
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,559
thousands of troops
in the suburbs of Hanjing?

657
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:14,960
I'm afraid those two

658
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
will spare no efforts to fight for it.

659
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,039
(Xiao Ying tortures citizens.)

660
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,719
(He deserves to die a thousand times,)

661
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,599
(but dies)

662
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,440
(for such a reason.)

663
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,320
(How ridiculous.)

664
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,320
(Two people)

665
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,480
(whom I cherish the most in my life.)

666
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,639
(It's harder and harder for me to see them through.)

667
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,559
(How can I)

668
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,840
(protect what I want to protect)

669
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,480
(in my life?)

670
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,199
Chuan,

671
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,599
how is the water conservancy project

672
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,639
going recently?

673
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,719
As usual.

674
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,280
This month,

675
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,199
the dam will be completed.

676
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,360
Before the flood season comes this year,

677
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,480
it can be put into use.

678
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,440
Xiao Ying slipped and died a few days ago.

679
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,639
His death is sudden.

680
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,360
The Hanjing garrison

681
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,760
is leaderless.

682
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:14,920
Your two brothers

683
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,719
are also competing for this position.

684
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,119
In your opinion, who should I give it to?

685
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,840
Father, it's your belongings.

686
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,440
You should decide for yourself.

687
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,519
If I want you to decide,

688
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,400
who do you want to give it to?

689
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,719
Seems like you're the same as me.

690
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,280
You also know

691
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,760
what your two brothers want.

692
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,119
Prince Qing is close to Xiao Ying.

693
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,000
Xiao Ying's sister

694
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,440
is married to Prince Qing.

695
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,320
He gains everything with hard efforts,

696
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,280
so he doesn't want to give it to others.

697
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,039
And if Prince Yi

698
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,039
gets the garrison of Hanjing,

699
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,320
with his characters,

700
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,480
he will be more arrogant.

701
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,880
It seems Father has made up your mind.

702
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,519
You've decided

703
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,679
the most suitable candidate for sure.

704
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,880
You're the one I want.

705
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,599
The army is the weapon of a country.

706
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
If someone with too much selfishness gets it,

707
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:20,320
there will be endless troubles.

708
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,119
And you don't mean to do that,

709
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,960
and are eligible as well.

710
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
In my heart,

711
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,679
you are the most suitable one.

712
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,360
Your Highness Prince Qi.

713
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,960
Father,

714
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,559
as you know,

715
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,719
I have no intention of
getting involved in this court battle.

716
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,679
I just want to build my water conservancy,

717
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
and be the keeper of

718
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:03,920
Peace Granary.

719
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,079
Do you not want to accept

720
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,239
my decree?

721
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,719
Or you don't want

722
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,480
this seat

723
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
I told you before.

724
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,480
I know you are open-minded by nature,

725
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,599
and long for a free life outside the palace.

726
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,639
But what a person wants in his life

727
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,719
will not always be the same.

728
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,760
Chuan,

729
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,960
between the freedom you want

730
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:33,360
and what you want to protect,

731
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,760
you'll definitely

732
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,840
have to make a choice one day.

733
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,159
Well,

734
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,519
you can take this decree first.

735
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,320
You can reply to me

736
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,920
when you have made up your mind.

737
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,159
Your Highness Prince Qi.

738
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,199
I don't want to

739
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,119
wait too long.

740
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,280
Brother.

741
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:35,800
Brother.

742
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:36,880
Brother.

743
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:37,960
Brother, you're awake.

744
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:40,719
Are you feeling better?

745
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,800
Qing,

746
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,519
don't worry.

747
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:51,320
I won't die.

748
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,000
Why are you here?

749
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:59,880
After you were stabbed that day,

750
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,360
Miss asked me

751
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,639
to pretend to break up with her.

752
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,360
I can

753
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,800
go back to Qinghe Gang

754
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,679
to take care of you.

755
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,880
Didn't you mistake Lu Anran?

756
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:11,599
Miss is grateful to me

757
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,119
for saving me.

758
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,840
I know exactly

759
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,599
what kind of person she is.

760
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,079
That's good.

761
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,679
However,

762
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,880
Miss will not care about

763
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,760
whoever in the world misunderstands Miss.

764
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,719
But Prince Qi...

765
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,360
Brother Chuan?

766
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,320
What did he do?

767
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,199
On the day Miss stabbed you,

768
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,199
Prince Qi happened to see it.

769
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,719
He thought she really wanted to kill you.

770
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,159
He even stabbed Miss.

771
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,639
The sword

772
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,880
was stabbed at Miss's body,

773
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,800
also,

774
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,880
at her heart.

775
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,559
Chuan stabbed Lu Anran?

776
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,599
Silly boy.

777
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:09,519
Well,

778
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,159
Qing,

779
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:12,480
help me up.

780
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:14,920
Brother, you just woke up.

781
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:16,559
What are you going to do?

782
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,199
I'm going to see Chuan.

783
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:19,719
Brother,

784
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:21,880
She won't let us

785
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,840
tell His Highness Prince Qi.

786
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:24,679
She doesn't want His Highness to get involved.

787
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,280
Things have already happened.

788
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,400
And all of you

789
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,920
are self-righteous,

790
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,079
with a little girl's temperament.

791
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,000
Chuan is

792
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,800
a man.

793
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,039
How does he feel about

794
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,440
letting you girls

795
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,159
lie to him?

796
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,480
Besides,

797
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,320
can't you see

798
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,400
they love each other?

799
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:48,280
But I promised Miss

800
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,880
I won't tell him.

801
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,360
No buts.

802
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,239
You've promised your Miss,

803
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,559
while I take care of my Chuan.

804
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:54,400
It's not a conflict.

805
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,360
Brother.

806
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,719
Brother, don't move.

807
00:42:58,519 --> 00:42:59,280
All right, brother.

808
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,639
Don't move.

809
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,320
I'll ask someone to invite
His Highness here tomorrow.

810
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:03,880
You can talk to him tomorrow.

811
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,400
You may all leave.

812
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:31,400
Yes.

813
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,519
You.

814
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,719
The injury...

815
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:54,840
Your Highness, don't worry.

816
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:56,639
It's just a flesh wound.

817
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,719
Is it really just a flesh wound?

818
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,960
I remember how you

819
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,320
got hurt.

820
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,960
You would say something before.

821
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:08,840
But now,

822
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:10,599
you're so calm.

823
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,880
Are you

824
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,920
completely disappointed in me?

825
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:24,199
Your Highness, if you say so

826
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,199
you really hurt me.

827
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,039
This mansion

828
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,679
belongs to Your Highness.

829
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:31,800
I still have to rely on Your Highness.

830
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:34,119
But I make Your Highness suspicious.

831
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:35,559
Let others take advantage of it.

832
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:37,559
This is indeed my fault.

833
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,840
I don't want you to be so sensible.

834
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,280
I know.

835
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:45,880
I suspected you many times,

836
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,880
and almost got you killed.

837
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,079
If it were Xiao Jingque,

838
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:50,480
she,

839
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:51,519
she would have turned Prince Qing's Mansion

840
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:52,519
upside down.

841
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:53,480
But you...

842
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,760
And your wound.

843
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:07,559
If others are in a dangerous situation,

844
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:08,679
they will cry at least once.

845
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:10,000
You're so calm,

846
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,559
because you've never

847
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:12,480
put hope on me,

848
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,159
right?

849
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,480
Your Highness, you know very well.

850
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,840
The royal mansion

851
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,920
is the place that torments people.

852
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:22,360
Some are tired.

853
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,920
Some are insane.

854
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:26,280
It's just their own cultivation.

855
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,119
I didn't want you to cultivate with hair

856
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:31,800
by marrying you back.

857
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,320
What do you want me to do?

858
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:49,880
Scold you for not
distinguishing right from wrong,

859
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,760
and being too suspicious,

860
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,320
and trying to kill me many times?

861
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:53,480
Or secretly shed tears,

862
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,559
lament the injustice of fate,

863
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:55,360
and cry with you,

864
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,519
saying that I used to
shine my heart on the moon,

865
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:58,000
but the moon shines on the ditch?

866
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,159
Mu Ze,

867
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,280
I've abandoned

868
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,559
what I cherish the most

869
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:02,960
and I'm willing to
be locked up in this mansion.

870
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
What do you want me to do?

871
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:06,480
What do you give me back?

872
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,519
You only give me endless damage.

873
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
But now,

874
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:12,599
you want me change back into

875
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:13,400
an innocent girl

876
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,840
like Xiao Jingque.

877
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:17,199
It is you that ruined my innocence!

878
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:18,599
It is you that ruined

879
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:19,679
my trust in you.

880
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,800
Impossible!

881
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,440
We can never go back.

882
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:34,880
Alright,

883
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,079
I know

884
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,519
you're so angry

885
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,840
because you still care about me.

886
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,360
To be honest,

887
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:55,840
among these days,

888
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:58,360
today is the happiest day,

889
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:00,280
I'm aware that

890
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,159
Xiao Jingque and his brother
have been hurting you.

891
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:04,960
But now I promise you,

892
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,960
I will let the whole mansion know

893
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,519
who is the mistress of this mansion.

894
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:11,800
Go freshen up now.

895
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,679
Come to the mansion in two hours.

896
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:16,840
I'll prove it to you.
