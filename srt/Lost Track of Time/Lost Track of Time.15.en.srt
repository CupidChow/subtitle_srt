00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,200
(Peace Granary)

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,840
Go.

4
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,840
So it's closing.

5
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,080
Write something.

6
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
Peace Granary.

7
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,120
Then,

8
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,879
Peace and food security.

9
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,080
May people in Dahan live a secure life

10
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,479
without hunger.

11
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,639
Rice stock here

12
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,919
is no longer needed

13
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,520
and the granary should be
closed for good.

14
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,400
Happy granary closure.

15
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,599
Happy closure.

16
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,159
Mu Chuan.

17
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,520
I want to do something.

18
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,680
What?

19
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:43,800
Lu Anran.

20
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,560
Take a rest.

21
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,439
OK. Leaving.

22
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,400
Leaving.

23
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,700
(Peace Granary)

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,840
I'm so happy.

25
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,520
Haven't been happy like
this for so long.

26
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,120
Happy because of what?

27
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,240
Because of you.

28
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,240
Seeing what you've done,

29
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,800
it's like all those schemes
and conspiracies

30
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,159
are kept away.

31
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,040
Here is another world.

32
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,680
One that makes one happy.

33
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,279
If

34
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,680
this is your utopia,

35
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,639
you're always welcome here.

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,639
Mu Chuan.

37
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,879
Now your National Granary

38
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,160
is no longer waste paper

39
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,079
on His Majesty's desk.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,079
Have you ever thought about
leaving Hanjing?

41
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,040
The National Granary plan

42
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,319
should be complemented
with water conservation

43
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,720
to really benefit all people.

44
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,199
Father is having people

45
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,319
peruse my plan now.

46
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,279
When the water conservation
in the suburban area

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,240
is finished,

48
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,240
I'll leave Hanjing.

49
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,160
I don't know how to face

50
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,399
what Second Brother is doing now.

51
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,439
Maybe leaving

52
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,399
is a better choice.

53
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,240
Then I'll be leaving

54
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,040
ahead of you.

55
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,399
Really?

56
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,839
That I'm leaving

57
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,800
makes you so happy?

58
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,639
No. It's not that.

59
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,879
You're finally willing to

60
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,240
get yourself out of

61
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,199
the mire of Hanjing.

62
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,040
I'm happy for you.

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,759
Well I guessed so.

64
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,319
The wider world

65
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,399
is where you belong.

66
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:49,879
Anran.

67
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,759
You said

68
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,839
I should wait.

69
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,480
Is it time now?

70
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,759
So

71
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,879
you'll wait for me this time.

72
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,160
Once for each of us.

73
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,240
Fair.

74
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,600
OK.

75
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,600
I'll wait for you.

76
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,319
Why are you here?

77
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,000
I told you

78
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,839
not to waste time on this.

79
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,319
It's pointless.

80
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,240
I know.

81
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
In your eyes,

82
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,759
I'm just an accident

83
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,120
of your alliance with the Lu family.

84
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,959
Now I'm just an object

85
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,680
of adornment in the house.

86
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Now that you know,

87
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,800
why do it?

88
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,319
Isn't it

89
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,680
all in vain?

90
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,680
But even

91
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,920
an old object

92
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,120
can receive

93
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,480
care from the owner.

94
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,639
But I

95
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,439
am a woman.

96
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,759
As rootless as duckweed.

97
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,160
Now I'm Your Highness's wife.

98
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,879
Whether you like it or not,

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,879
I should fulfill

100
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,200
my duties as a wife.

101
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,000
So,

102
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,480
this is your duty,

103
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:37,759
right?

104
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,039
My elder sister didn't become your wife.

105
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,799
And by chance,

106
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,519
I became the tie

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,799
that connects the royals
and the Lu family.

108
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,639
But what

109
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,960
can a tie do?

110
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,480
Only keeping to its own duties.

111
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,000
You're trying to

112
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,480
remind me

113
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,639
that now you're

114
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,000
in the Mansion of Prince Qing as my wife,

115
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,080
whatever conflict

116
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,279
you have with Lu Anran,

117
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:27,840
I couldn't

118
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,679
do anything to you.

119
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,559
Right?

120
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,639
Your Highness, don't
misunderstand me like that.

121
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,480
Though I'm just a mistake

122
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,960
that came at a wrong time,

123
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,200
I still hope

124
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,080
that you can look at me.

125
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,679
He's the Emperor.

126
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,559
I'm just a mistake.

127
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,320
To long to see him another time is like

128
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,639
waiting for the impossible to happen.

129
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
What is this you made?

130
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,639
The weather

131
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,240
is unpredictable these days.

132
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,120
I see Your Highness

133
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,519
always wears thin clothes.

134
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,039
So I made the ginger soup

135
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,279
to keep off cold.

136
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,480
It's considerate of you.

137
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,720
OK.

138
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
If there's nothing else,

139
00:10:58,879 --> 00:10:59,720
you may leave.

140
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,440
Lu Xinran,

141
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,600
you brazen woman.

142
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
What did you put

143
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
in the soup?

144
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,360
I...

145
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,799
I just put in

146
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,039
some medicine for
strengthening body.

147
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,200
Your Highness.

148
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,960
Move aside. Move aside.

149
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,600
Your Highness.

150
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,879
I know

151
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,720
why you did this.

152
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,559
You want a chance

153
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,559
to improve your status.

154
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,960
Don't you?

155
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,000
No. Your Highness.

156
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,600
I have no choice.

157
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,799
Otherwise, as a woman,

158
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,759
I wouldn't

159
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,080
do such a thing.

160
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,279
Your Highness.

161
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,080
In this cold place,

162
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,600
I have to find a reason

163
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,320
to survive.

164
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,279
Let go.

165
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,159
Let go of me.

166
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,679
Your Highness.

167
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:35,960
Your Highness.

168
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,000
Please.

169
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,919
Give me a child.

170
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,559
Your Highness.

171
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,919
Please.

172
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,000
Guards.

173
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:42,840
Your Highness.

174
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,480
Guards.

175
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,720
Get off.

176
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,679
Guards.

177
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,399
Your Highness. Your Highness.

178
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,240
Please.

179
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,799
Just look at me.

180
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,639
Your Highness.

181
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,120
Please, Your Highness.

182
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,039
Guards.

183
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,000
Guards.

184
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,919
Your Highness.

185
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,039
Guards.

186
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,440
Your Highness. Your Highness.

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,120
Your Highness. Are you all right?

188
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,480
Listen.

189
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,159
If it's an assassin here,

190
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,120
I'd be dead by now.

191
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,039
I apologize.

192
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,039
Take her away.

193
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,639
I don't want to see her.

194
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,360
Go. Go.

195
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,960
Come on.

196
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,080
Your Highness.

197
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,159
Your Highness. Please.

198
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,559
Go.

199
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,679
Your Highness. Please don't.

200
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:20,919
Your Highness.

201
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,320
No.

202
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,600
Your Highness.

203
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,879
Don't.

204
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,039
Your Highness.

205
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:25,879
Your Highness.

206
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,919
Your Highness.

207
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,320
Please don't.

208
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,360
Second Brother.

209
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,480
Second Brother.

210
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:50,679
Here.

211
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,799
Come on, sit.

212
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,159
Come, sit.

213
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,600
The...

214
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,320
Absurdities in the family

215
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,399
finally find you.

216
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,279
A bit shameful.

217
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,840
I'm not laughing at you.

218
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,919
Not in my face.

219
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,440
But behind my back, I know.

220
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,600
What?

221
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,279
Wanna say something?

222
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,840
Second Brother.

223
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,039
Marriage is a card you play.

224
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,320
Women you meet

225
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,679
naturally

226
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,840
take you as a sanctuary.

227
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,559
With such schemes going on,

228
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,440
how can there be true love?

229
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,759
True love.

230
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,840
You're dealing with

231
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,000
imperial court conflicts every day.

232
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,679
Always mindful.

233
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,279
Without peace

234
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,559
or ease.

235
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:01,919
If back home,

236
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,200
you have to deal with

237
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,159
more schemes

238
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,080
among jealous women, how annoying.

239
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,080
Royal marriages

240
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,679
are no more than

241
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,240
means to secure status.

242
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,679
If you want to seek

243
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,360
true love in it,

244
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,519
aren't you asking for too much?

245
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,759
But Second Brother,

246
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,399
I still hope you'll be happy.

247
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm a worldly person.

248
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,799
What I hope for

249
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,879
is company for every meal,

250
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,559
in all seasons.

251
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:46,679
But I think you're

252
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,440
also entitled to

253
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,720
such simple happiness.

254
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,080
When you put political
intrigue behind you,

255
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,919
you can at least come home,

256
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,200
lower your defense,

257
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,799
and talk with someone heart-to-heart.

258
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,759
What you said today

259
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,879
made me

260
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,039
really happy.

261
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,320
Maybe only you

262
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,639
in this world

263
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,639
would say that to me.

264
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,320
But I think

265
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,039
love is like bubbles

266
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,120
in this world.

267
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,759
It's illusional.

268
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,480
Power, instead,

269
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,679
gives people a sense of security.

270
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,440
What is the end of power?

271
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,159
Second Brother.

272
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,799
Solitude comes with high status.

273
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
OK.

274
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,519
I'll consent to whatever you say.

275
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,399
All yours.

276
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,320
If I meet someone

277
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,519
who truly loves me,

278
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,720
I'd try to taste the worldly joy

279
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,240
you just described.

280
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,000
OK?

281
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,039
Little bastard,

282
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,320
you're not here

283
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,679
to just say that, are you?

284
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,480
Of course not.

285
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,720
Today the first batch of warehouses

286
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
of Peace Granary closed.

287
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,400
I know you were too busy

288
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,079
to come.

289
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,079
So I took this

290
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,799
to give you.

291
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,759
Congratulations.

292
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,440
But it doesn't

293
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,079
look like your handwriting.

294
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,720
It's by Lu Anran.

295
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:32,599
Miss.

296
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,279
Lu Xinran must be

297
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,200
so pissed right now.

298
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,839
I have to drink something

299
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:37,640
to celebrate.

300
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,480
Miss.

301
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,559
Cuicui said

302
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,519
Lu Xinran

303
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,759
tried to drug Prince Qing.

304
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,880
Now she's locked up in her room

305
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,440
and can't go out.

306
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,480
I never admired

307
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,119
Lu Xinran.

308
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,480
But today I do.

309
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,559
Couldn't believe she did that.

310
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,559
Seriously.

311
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,759
This has been spread

312
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,559
all over the Prince Qing's Mansion.

313
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,279
She lost face, big time.

314
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,039
Now she can't

315
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:14,880
go around boasting

316
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,680
her title as Princess Qing.

317
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,279
Let all the absurdities

318
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,039
end soon.

319
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,519
Cuicui.

320
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,039
What's the sound out there?

321
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,079
His Highness is marrying
a new concubine.

322
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,160
Miss Xiao.

323
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,920
I think,

324
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,400
it's the music played on the wedding.

325
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,000
Wedding,

326
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,480
a woman's

327
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,079
happiest moment.

328
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,680
But I never had it.

329
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,440
Miss.

330
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,039
Wear this hairpin today?

331
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,160
Maid.

332
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,160
I want this.

333
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,839
Miss.

334
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,599
According to the ritual,

335
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,240
double head phoenix hairpin

336
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,559
can only be worn by the wife of a prince

337
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,640
or someone

338
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,960
of a higher rank.

339
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,000
Lu Xinran did such an ungraceful thing.

340
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,079
How long do you think His Highness

341
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,480
is going to keep her?

342
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,759
I'll be the wife sooner or later.

343
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,880
Just a hairpin.

344
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,720
Why can't I wear it?

345
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,000
From now on,

346
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,400
I'll let every aristocrat

347
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,640
in Hanjing know

348
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,759
that I'm the real mistress

349
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,240
of this family.

350
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,000
Everyone,

351
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,519
I just arrived here.

352
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,279
Please forgive me

353
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,000
if I made any mistake.

354
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,200
Mrs., you're being modest.

355
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,160
Go ahead.

356
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,920
The concubine of Prince Qing

357
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,519
is quite showy.

358
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,000
Look at the hairpin she wears.

359
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,200
That's not for her rank.

360
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,680
But it's strange.

361
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,039
Princess Qing

362
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,960
has never made an appearance.

363
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,319
Right.

364
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,039
Princess, what's wrong?

365
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,680
The vegetable is sour.

366
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,400
Can't you smell?

367
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,400
Dare you take such rubbish to me.

368
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,160
Do you think I'm dead?

369
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,319
Princess, I'm sorry.

370
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,400
Those dramas

371
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,240
are not totally baseless.

372
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,359
The cold palace

373
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,559
is indeed cold.

374
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:23,920
What's that for?

375
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,000
Is there anything

376
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,240
worth playing the music

377
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,119
all the time?

378
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,640
The maid who took the meal here said

379
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,039
His Highness

380
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,119
invited aristocrat ladies in the city

381
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,240
to announce Xiao's status.

382
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,880
Invited aristocrat ladies in the city?

383
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,759
Yes.

384
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,119
The feast

385
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,440
is hosted by Xiao.

386
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,799
It's as if

387
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,839
she's the mistress.

388
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,960
Xiao Jingque.

389
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:01,079
I've been here for so long.

390
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,440
Yet none of the aristocrats in the city

391
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,440
knows what Princess Qing

392
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,559
looks like.

393
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,400
Who knows

394
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,519
that for my entire life,

395
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,559
no one

396
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,480
ever asks about me.

397
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,759
It was like that when I
was in the Lu family.

398
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,279
Now the same

399
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,960
when I'm here.

400
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,839
Xiao is a girl

401
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,240
from a general's family at most.

402
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,440
Or actually,

403
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,559
just the sister of a brute man.

404
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,839
What does she know?

405
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,279
Princess is gentle and kind.

406
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,680
When those ladies see you,

407
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,599
they'd know

408
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,599
that you're the only

409
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,079
true mistress here.

410
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:18,640
Yes.

411
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,599
You're right.

412
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,119
You're right.

413
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,400
If there's any need,

414
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,559
just tell me.

415
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,160
Sis,

416
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,599
I'm only late for a few minutes.

417
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,400
You started the feast in a rush.

418
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,000
Other ladies would think

419
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
that people from Prince Qing's Mansion

420
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,200
know no etiquette.

421
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,880
Who is this?

422
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,799
Don't know.

423
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,480
Should be Princess Qing.

424
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,519
Why's she here?

425
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,279
Money talks.

426
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,079
Lu Xinran has nothing

427
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,680
except money now.

428
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,279
She does some things

429
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,519
way better than me.

430
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
What're you doing here?

431
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,200
His Highness is humble.

432
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,279
Dedicated to assisting His Majesty.

433
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,599
And thus we seldom

434
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,559
socialize.

435
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,599
Hope you

436
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:48,599
won't mind.

437
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,000
Thank you, Princess.

438
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,200
Cuicui.

439
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,559
Time's short.

440
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,119
We prepared some gifts.

441
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,440
Hope you'll like them.

442
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,559
Thank you, Princess.

443
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:04,759
Thank you, Princess.

444
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,359
It's the first time we meet, sis.

445
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,400
This is a gift for you.

446
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,319
Hope you'll like it.

447
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,160
A branch?

448
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,519
Are you trying to humiliate me

449
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,480
with this?

450
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,480
Birds fly far away

451
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,279
and make a name for themselves.

452
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,440
I give you a golden branch

453
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,559
for you to rest on.

454
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,119
Why don't you understand

455
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,680
my intentions?

456
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,440
Don't think I'm stupid.

457
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,839
You're implying that I'm not worth this title.

458
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,160
Among all of us here,

459
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,599
you're the only person

460
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,880
who has no right to talk about

461
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,599
who's worth it.

462
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,759
With such noise,

463
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,920
you're losing His Highness's face,

464
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,680
don't you know?

465
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,279
You're just a daughter of a boatman.

466
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,440
An unwanted wife in the house.

467
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,359
Came here to make a scene

468
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,400
and tried to take my place.

469
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,319
How ridiculous.

470
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,240
Who's taking whose place?

471
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,559
You're a concubine.

472
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,359
Know no etiquette.

473
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,319
Affront your superior.

474
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,359
The double head phoenix hairpin

475
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,759
is not for you.

476
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,319
Stop.

477
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,440
Your Highness.

478
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,839
She's bullying me.

479
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,039
Why're you here?

480
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,559
We have a feast today.

481
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:10,079
And I'm the mistress here.

482
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,039
Your Highness

483
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,440
asked a strange question.

484
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,559
Lu Xinran.

485
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,480
Do you know

486
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,599
the consequence?

487
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,960
Your Highness.

488
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,559
You'll let me live.

489
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,519
Without me, the Lu family
and the Prince Qing's Mansion

490
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,240
will lose the closest

491
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,599
connection.

492
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,319
Do you think Lu Anran

493
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,799
will continue to work for you then?

494
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,160
Everybody,

495
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,640
Princess is ill

496
00:28:59,039 --> 00:28:59,880
and unsound.

497
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,319
Please don't take offence.

498
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,640
Guards.

499
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,039
Take Princess away.

500
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,119
OK.

501
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:10,720
Let go.

502
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,240
I can walk.

503
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,359
Even an

504
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,480
unsound Princess Qing,

505
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,039
I'm still Your Highness's

506
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,079
true wife.

507
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,400
The only true mistress

508
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:25,119
in the family.

509
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,720
As long as I'm alive,

510
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,799
all other birds or foxes

511
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,440
are only concubines.

512
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,279
Their kids

513
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,880
should call me mother.

514
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,039
Mr. Cai.

515
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,119
Mr. Cai.

516
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,440
What's up?

517
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,200
Mr. Cai.

518
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,880
Go check Princess please.

519
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,599
I'm afraid she's going to
do something silly.

520
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,279
What happened?

521
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,519
She'd cry out loud

522
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,480
whenever

523
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,680
such things happen.

524
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,200
But she's now so quiet.

525
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,440
It's weird.

526
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,920
I'll go check on her.

527
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,039
The way His Highness looks at me,

528
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:32,359
it's as if I'm the most

529
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,559
abominable person in the world.

530
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,079
But what did I do wrong

531
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,440
today?

532
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,799
In this family,

533
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,319
I'm the only Princess Qing,

534
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,799
right?

535
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,319
In such situations,

536
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,759
calm is the most important.

537
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,640
His Highness is giving back

538
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,039
to the Xiao family with today's feast.

539
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,480
Your Highness shouldn't do that.

540
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,160
I just want them to know.

541
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,680
Just once.

542
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,599
Once.

543
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,400
That I'm not nobody.

544
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,240
Nor am I

545
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,039
an unwanted concubine.

546
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,039
I'm the rightful Princess Qing.

547
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,079
You'll only hurt yourself

548
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,400
being so stubborn.

549
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,880
Why do you have to do that?

550
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,039
Why no one sees me?

551
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,200
Why?

552
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:54,799
At least,

553
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:57,480
I see you.

554
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,480
I chose the wrong person.

555
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,759
What're you two doing?

556
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,240
Look, everybody.

557
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,359
It's our Princess.

558
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,160
Ew.

559
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,119
How shameless.

560
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,880
Yes.

561
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,519
What do we do?

562
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,680
If I were her, I'd be so ashamed.

563
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,559
Yes.

564
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,719
Everything is finally

565
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,880
over.

566
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,960
See for yourself.

567
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,159
It's spread

568
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,519
across the whole city.

569
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,079
Even those in the harem,

570
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,159
those who seldom go out

571
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,760
know this.

572
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,719
This is...

573
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:43,719
This is

574
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,880
the good wife you ask for
with your military merit.

575
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:47,840
Father.

576
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,639
I know I'm wrong.

577
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,519
Bludgeon both of them

578
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,800
to death.

579
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,039
Father.

580
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,000
Please think twice.

581
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,920
If we kill them,

582
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,239
then we're admitting

583
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,880
that the rumor is true.

584
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,119
It's disgracing us.

585
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,239
So tell me,

586
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,440
what do you want to do?

587
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,119
Cai Wangjing assaulted the Princess.

588
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,719
The Princess refused him and fought hard.

589
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,880
But she knew it brought shame
to the royal family.

590
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,039
She couldn't face her conscience,

591
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,159
and thus left.

592
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,639
OK.

593
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:29,079
Father. Father.

594
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,280
Go in.

595
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,079
Nanxing.

596
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,599
Nanxing.

597
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,280
Nanxing.

598
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,159
I'm begging you.

599
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,360
Let me see His Highness.

600
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,239
With what you did,

601
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,000
you dare beg to see His Highness.

602
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,480
Nanxing.

603
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,440
It's not like that.

604
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,840
Nanxing.

605
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,079
Someone's behind it.

606
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:54,280
Please let me see His Highness.

607
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,760
Please let me see His Highness.

608
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,239
Nanxing.

609
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,000
Nanxing.

610
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,440
Let His Highness be careful.

611
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,639
Someone's behind this.

612
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,960
Please let me

613
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,800
see His Highness.

614
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Nanxing.

615
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,320
I'm Princess Qing.

616
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,199
I'm Princess Qing.

617
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,480
I'm Princess Qing.

618
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,400
I'm Princess Qing.

619
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,239
I'm Princess Qing.

620
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,119
I'm the real Princess Qing.

621
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,199
His Highness.

622
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,760
Come in.

623
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,719
His Highness suffered
from such humiliation,

624
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,719
The Lu Family should take up the responsibility.

625
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,719
We're willing to remove
all companies in Hanjing

626
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,559
to make up for this.

627
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,239
Now I'm the same

628
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,639
as the Lu family.

629
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,880
A laughing stock

630
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,199
in Hanjing.

631
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,400
All your companies

632
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,559
are visited by no one.

633
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,199
The impact on Lu's water transport

634
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,639
is yet unknown.

635
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,599
How're you going to make it up to me?

636
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,280
Your Highness, please

637
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,360
don't be mad at the Lu Family.

638
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,559
I'll take full responsibility.

639
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,559
And fulfill my duty in the future.

640
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:27,840
To assist Your Highness.

641
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,519
You think your family

642
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,920
has not brought enough

643
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,159
shame for me?

644
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,719
Lu Anran.

645
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,280
As long as your family

646
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,679
is in Hanjing,

647
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,559
those gossiping women

648
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:55,400
will laugh at me.

649
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,239
As long as your family

650
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,280
appears in Hanjing,

651
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,719
you're reminding everyone

652
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,400
of what a joke

653
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,519
there was in the Prince Qing's Mansion.

654
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,760
I understand what Your Highness means.

655
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,840
I'll move all companies of our family

656
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,039
from Hanjing as soon as possible.

657
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,440
The capital port

658
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,440
will be taken over.

659
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,159
When our family

660
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,480
removes all our presence here,

661
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,039
rumors will fade away one day.

662
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,239
Good.

663
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,559
You may leave.

664
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,679
Thank you, Your Highness.

665
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:39,840
Lu Anran.

666
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,800
Anything else, Your Highness?

667
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,559
You know what I regret more

668
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,800
than the Lu Family?

669
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,360
Please enlighten me, Your Highness.

670
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:12,480
Leave.

671
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:32,920
Go.

672
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,159
Go away.

673
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,880
You all want to harm me.

674
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,199
I'm not eating.

675
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,880
It's poisonous.

676
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,599
Miss. Miss.

677
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,119
She's so dramatic.

678
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:44,599
I...

679
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:45,079
Get off.

680
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:46,760
If this goes on,

681
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,840
we'll be dead

682
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,199
before we go back to Su City.

683
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,320
Miss.

684
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,360
The food we sent in

685
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,920
was all smashed by Lu Xinran.

686
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,280
If she didn't eat,

687
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:55,840
I'm afraid...

688
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,760
Let her be.

689
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,000
She can starve to death if she wants.

690
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,559
Give it to me. I'll go.

691
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,559
Poisonous.

692
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:03,920
I'm not eating.

693
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,599
I'm not eating.

694
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,400
Get lost.

695
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,280
Leave.

696
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:19,639
Bitch.

697
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,800
Why don't you kneel?

698
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,800
Princess.

699
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,679
Prince Qing asked

700
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:29,079
the cooks to make it.

701
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,800
Don't you want to try?

702
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,320
He asked them in person?

703
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,480
Really.

704
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,719
Really?

705
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,079
No.

706
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:57,360
No.

707
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,000
It must be sour.

708
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,960
It must be sour.

709
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:03,599
You had sour meal before?

710
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,000
You all bully me.

711
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:08,519
Nobody cares about me.

712
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,079
You all bully me.

713
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,119
Don't you always think

714
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,199
I'm showy

715
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,199
in front of His Highness?

716
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,000
Now I'm ordered

717
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,280
to send food to you.

718
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,440
You should be happy.

719
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,480
Right?

720
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,159
Xinran.

721
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,639
We're sisters.

722
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,000
But we've come to this.

723
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,679
Maybe past

724
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,280
privilege blinded me.

725
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,079
And made you suffer.

726
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:21,480
Or maybe you're

727
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,119
evil in nature

728
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,079
beyond help.

729
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,400
But anyway,

730
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,039
the Lu Family is safe

731
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,760
thanks in part to you.

732
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:36,159
Our problem

733
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,440
will never be solved.

734
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,519
But it doesn't matter.

735
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,519
We don't have to

736
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,360
be forgiven in this life.

737
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:47,679
Right?

738
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,599
The scandal spread

739
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,039
like a plague in Hanjing.

740
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,719
The Lu Family was looked
down upon by aristocrats.

741
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:20,840
Its reputation plummeted.

742
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,159
Lu Anran

743
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,639
finally got rid of

744
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:24,960
attention from the imperial power.

745
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:28,440
The plan she started

746
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,599
on the night of Flower Festival in Su City

747
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,079
finally came to an end.

748
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,960
However, when she thought

749
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,760
the Lu Family could

750
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,360
stay out of it,

751
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:40,360
fate

752
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:43,119
has sown roots of danger

753
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,840
where she doesn't know.
