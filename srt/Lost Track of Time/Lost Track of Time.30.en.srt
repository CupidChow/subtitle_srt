2
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,120
You were this nasty on the wedding too.

3
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,239
The same trick

4
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,079
can't fool one twice.

5
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,120
You're thinking too much.

6
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,239
I simply don't care.

7
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,680
Why?

8
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,719
The night

9
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,760
I married you,

10
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,879
I drank something

11
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,599
to make sure

12
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,680
I'll never have a child.

13
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,519
Why?

14
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,280
Because

15
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,120
I don't want to have your child anymore.

16
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,040
Lu Anran.

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,040
I never even lay my hand on you.

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,280
Why do you hate me so much?

19
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,920
Why?

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,520
What a pity.

21
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,479
You'll never understand.

22
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,520
Lu Anran.

23
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,280
You might not believe me.

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,639
I used to tell you

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,039
that I'd love to

26
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,360
marry you

27
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,120
and grow old

28
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,240
together.

29
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,879
Make you

30
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,080
the happiest woman in the world.

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
Everything I said,

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,159
either from hatred or love,

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,000
was true.

34
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:35,960
But you?

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,639
Everything you said was a lie.

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,439
Why?

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,159
Mu Ze.

38
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,560
You're still excusing yourself.

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,400
It's all

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,360
your own doing.

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,240
Shut up.

42
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,120
Shut up.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Second Brother has soldiers along.

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,639
Must be conspicuous.

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,300
(Workshop)

46
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,159
Now,

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,919
hiding is the top priority.

48
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,639
Spots on Thunder Mountain

49
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,400
are dangerous

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,360
and hard to invade.

51
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,960
Take a few people with you
and check them out.

52
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,680
OK.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,599
Come with me.

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,360
Your Highness.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,439
Well...

56
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,159
Miss said in a dangerous situation,

57
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,960
everything in the mansion
can be discarded

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,439
except this lantern.

59
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:49,879
Your Highness.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
The day Miss left,

61
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,520
she told me one thing.

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,039
She said

63
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,560
if everything went well
with Your Highness,

64
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,000
I should tell Your Highness

65
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,280
not to give in

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,319
if forced to make a choice.

67
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,639
She would rather

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,599
die for the noble cause

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,680
than repeat

70
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,639
the tragedy.

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,319
Your Highness.

72
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,080
Please keep the lantern

73
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,960
for Shan Yue.

74
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,680
Shan Yue will follow Zhufeng and others

75
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,199
to find Miss.

76
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,560
Follow me. Quick.

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,120
Hyah.

78
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:36,920
Hyah.

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,759
Hyah.

80
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Lu Anran.

81
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,240
You're right.

82
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,399
I'm born a joke.

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,879
To avoid being looked down upon,

84
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,319
and gain recognition,

85
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,079
I tried everything.

86
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,160
But in the end,

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,279
I'm just a joke.

88
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,439
Now I'm at the end of my rope.

89
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,759
I can't change anything about the ending

90
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,040
that I have nothing.

91
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,720
But there is still one thing

92
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,439
I can decide for myself.

93
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,600
That is how I'm going to

94
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,120
end my life.

95
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,680
Have a good sleep.

96
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,399
When you're awake,

97
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,519
everything will be over.

98
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,040
Your Highness.

99
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,839
I was on the patrol just now.

100
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,439
Someone is approaching

101
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,519
here.

102
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,240
If we don't leave,

103
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,959
we'll be exposed.

104
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,879
Leave?

105
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,040
Where can I go?

106
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,279
I'll forever bear

107
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,720
the name of a traitor,

108
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,199
and lead a life

109
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,240
of secrecy and shame.

110
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,759
I can't stand

111
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,079
one day like that.

112
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm not afraid of death.

113
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,279
I'm afraid of a shameful death.

114
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,720
I've been a proud fighter all my life,

115
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,480
yet I've been entangled

116
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,560
in the intricated conspiracies

117
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,399
of the imperial court

118
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,399
for too long.

119
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,040
I almost forget what it feels like

120
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,279
to be on the horseback

121
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,519
and fight for life.

122
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,279
So,

123
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,560
I'm not going to flee today.

124
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,279
I'm prepared

125
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,439
to fight till the end.

126
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,240
You used to follow me

127
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,639
and fight on the warfare.

128
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,680
Because we wanted to survive.

129
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
But today

130
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,240
I want death.

131
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,879
Everyone here

132
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,720
has a family.

133
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,600
You don't have to

134
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,920
shoulder the infamy with me.

135
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,319
So,

136
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,680
go back, you all.

137
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,120
Nanxing wants to follow Your Highness.

138
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,360
I wish to die standing,

139
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,160
instead of kneeling to survive.

140
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,519
Your Highness.

141
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,519
You saved my life

142
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,839
on the warfare.

143
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,360
Wherever you go,

144
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
I follow.

145
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,839
I fear no death.

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,600
I, too, want to follow Your Highness.

147
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:33,559
Me too.

148
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,480
OK.

149
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,480
Then, tonight, follow me

150
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,440
to attack the capital.

151
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,399
Yes.

152
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,159
Hoofbeats.

153
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,639
Your Highness. There's candlelight.

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,720
Go.

155
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,519
Lu Anran.

156
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,639
Lu Anran.

157
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,840
Wake up.

158
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,480
Lu Anran.

159
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,360
Lu Anran.

160
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,360
Are you alright?

161
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,240
Mu Chuan. Why are you here?

162
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,600
Where's Mu Ze?

163
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,360
I heard hoofbeats

164
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,639
approaching the capital.

165
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,960
No.

166
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,240
Mu Ze is attacking the capital.

167
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,840
Your Highness.

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,039
All soldiers have assembled.

169
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,080
Ready to attack.

170
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,360
Nanxing.

171
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,039
Once we set off,

172
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,000
you and I are rebels.

173
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,440
We'll forever be despised by people.

174
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,360
You've

175
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,320
made up your mind?

176
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,960
Be it survival or death

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,919
I'd gladly accept.

178
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,080
Nanxing can't serve the country in this life.

179
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,279
But I know I should be
loyal to my master.

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,879
My only master

181
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,720
is Your Highness.

182
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,720
I will fight

183
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,639
till the end of my life.

184
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
Fight

185
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,960
till the end of my life.

186
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,759
Fight

187
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,240
till the end of my life.

188
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,879
Fight

189
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,480
till the end of my life.

190
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,879
Good.

191
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,039
Fight till every drop of blood is shed.

192
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,960
Prince Qing.

193
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,759
How greedy you are.

194
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,360
Dare usurp the Emperor's power.

195
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,879
Put down your weapons

196
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,840
and surrender.

197
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,159
I

198
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,240
come

199
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,480
with no intention to go back.

200
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,480
Prince Qing.

201
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,600
You brought it onto yourself.

202
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,000
Fight.

203
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,720
Hyah.

204
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,399
Shoot.

205
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,679
Protect His Highness.

206
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,279
Stop.

207
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,759
Second Brother.

208
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,600
Stop.

209
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,639
If this arrow shoots,

210
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,600
I will be hurt.

211
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,039
His Majesty is here.

212
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,879
Mu Ze.

213
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,200
What do you want to say?

214
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,720
To me,

215
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
you're just

216
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,360
the Emperor of all people.

217
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,440
Never,

218
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,240
never a father.

219
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,200
You always treat me

220
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,919
in the way of an Emperor.

221
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,279
Without any love.

222
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,279
Father.

223
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,759
Second Brother

224
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,840
is not here to take your position.

225
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,720
He just

226
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,039
wants to end his life.

227
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,440
Don't beg him.

228
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,200
Second Brother.

229
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,960
He gave me life.

230
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,759
Today I'll give back

231
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,680
my body and blood.

232
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,759
Let them go.

233
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,440
Second Brother.

234
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,640
Second Brother. Where are you going?

235
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,000
Second Brother.

236
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,759
Second Brother.

237
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,480
Second Brother.

238
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,119
Second Brother.

239
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,319
Mom.

240
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,880
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,759
I can't

242
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,519
take you out.

243
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,279
Ninth Brother.

244
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,680
Promise me.

245
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,640
When I'm gone,

246
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,720
bury me

247
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,960
with my Mom.

248
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,000
Ninth Brother.

249
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,200
Your...

250
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,839
Your

251
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,799
An Assuring Rice.

252
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,039
I haven't

253
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,119
tasted it.

254
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,440
I really

255
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,200
want to taste it.

256
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,759
It's sprouting.

257
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll take you there some day.

258
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,519
OK.

259
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,160
Ninth Brother.

260
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,240
Do me a favor.

261
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,119
Kill me.

262
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,400
No.

263
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,119
No.

264
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,079
No.

265
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,279
No.

266
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:12,640
Ninth Brother.

267
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,519
Ninth Brother.

268
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:40,799
No.

269
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,640
No.

270
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,720
No.

271
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:44,559
No. Second Brother.

272
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,000
Second Brother.

273
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,759
Second Brother.

274
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Second Brother.

275
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:50,839
His Majesty.

276
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,759
Prince Qing tried to kill His Majesty.

277
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,119
This is against the ethics.

278
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,640
Death is not enough as punishment.

279
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:58,279
Such a rebel

280
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:59,759
should have his skin and bones removed

281
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,880
as a warning to all people.

282
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,920
Right. Your Majesty.

283
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,720
Rebellion is a serious crime.

284
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,839
Your Highness is merciful

285
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,160
sparing the lives

286
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,319
in the Prince Qing's Mansion.

287
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,440
But if Prince Qing does not

288
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,880
get proper punishment,

289
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,240
people will find it unjust.

290
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,119
His Majesty.

291
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,319
His Majesty.

292
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,759
In history, rebels

293
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,759
always got severe punishment.

294
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,200
Your Majesty shouldn't be soft on him.

295
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,559
I agree.

296
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,920
I agree. I agree.

297
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,720
I agree.

298
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,519
You're right.

299
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
I'm thinking,

300
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,240
should I let his carcass
be thrown in the wilderness

301
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,119
and eaten by predators,

302
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,480
or hang it on the capital gate

303
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,039
and lash it in front of all citizens?

304
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,920
I'm also thinking,

305
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,480
that day when a new
emperor was announced,

306
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,079
some of you were the fastest

307
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,880
to kneel before him.

308
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,640
What should I do with you?

309
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,799
This crime

310
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,680
is as serious as rebellion.

311
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,960
Please don't, Your Majesty.

312
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,480
Please don't, Your Majesty.

313
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,720
Prince Qing did something wrong.

314
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,920
But he's my son after all.

315
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,359
Miss.

316
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,359
Shall we close the door

317
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,720
to the Prince Qing's Mansion?

318
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,240
The door can be closed.

319
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,200
But can what happened

320
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,240
just end

321
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,440
like this?

322
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,279
Prince Qing is dead.

323
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,880
Prince Qi

324
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,920
will soon be the Crown Prince.

325
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,799
He'll be the future Emperor of Dahan.

326
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:13,680
Miss and Lu Family

327
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,359
will have no worry.

328
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,240
Is that kind of cage

329
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,880
what he wants?

330
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,039
Where are you going, Miss?

331
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,359
I want to take a look at the
mansion one last time.

332
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,200
Ninth Brother.

333
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,119
I secretly drew

334
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,440
a sand table in the court yard.

335
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:57,680
You'll be surprised

336
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,240
when you see it.

337
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,480
What is a sand table?

338
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,920
It's for battle use.

339
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,440
I don't understand.

340
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,400
I only know,

341
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,039
if it's in the court yard,

342
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,559
the flowers and grass

343
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,960
probably won't live.

344
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,240
You

345
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,720
know nothing other than eating

346
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,519
and growing plants.

347
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Follow me and take a look.

348
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:21,920
Go.

349
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,400
