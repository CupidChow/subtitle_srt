=Lost Track of Time=
=Episode 28=

2
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,040
Stop it.

3
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:36,680
Oh my.

4
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,640
She isn't Lu Anran.

5
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,700
(Jiangyun Court)

6
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,519
Your Highness,

7
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,799
I sent people

8
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,799
to search all over the reach

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,959
but we didn't find

10
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,719
Ms. Lu.

11
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,840
Should we extend the searching range?

12
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,239
No need.

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,200
She won't be back anymore.

14
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,479
What's wrong with Your Highness?

15
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,919
Anran.

16
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,159
Thank God you didn't leave.

17
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,680
Thank God you didn't leave.

18
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,960
Since I promised to wait for you,

19
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,680
how will I go back on my word?

20
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,159
Believe me.

21
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
I can't do it.

22
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,159
Why?

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,199
You pretended to die to fool me.

24
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,960
Although I was angry,

25
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,479
I have to admit

26
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,439
I can't face the pain

27
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,759
of losing you.

28
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:46,759
So,

29
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,319
how can I leave alone

30
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,599
without you?

31
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,159
Believe me.

32
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,960
It's almost done.

33
00:02:59,159 --> 00:02:59,759
Yes.

34
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,280
But I thought

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,080
as Ninth Brother tried so hard,

36
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,159
he must have considered

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,159
all the future worries for you.

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,039
How would you stay?

39
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,680
Thank God you didn't leave.

40
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,319
Princess.

41
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,919
You shall pull yourself together.

42
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,039
All is meaningless.

43
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,319
Even if it is for General,

44
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,080
you can't keep being distressed.

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,360
Otherwise,

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,080
who will avenge General's death?

47
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,240
I am incapable.

48
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,840
I am incapable.

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,800
There will be a way, Princess.

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,599
Today,

51
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,800
I heard an old story.

52
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,520
His Majesty knew about

53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,560
the affair between Prince Qi and Lu Anran.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,800
Even more, in order to strike Lu Anran,

55
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,319
he took over the shipping.

56
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,039
What if

57
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,279
His Majesty knows

58
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,079
nowadays

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,759
she is two-timing the siblings,

60
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
disturbing the peace of the mansion?

61
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,560
Even incriminated General to death.

62
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,480
Will His Majesty

63
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,600
forgive her?

64
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,240
Right.

65
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,600
This time,

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,680
I will let them

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,519
be buried with my brother.

68
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,199
Your Highness.

69
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,600
The meeting might

70
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,240
be ended now.

71
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,759
Where are the officials going?

72
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,399
It may be His Majesty

73
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,839
keep them to discuss
in the Imperial Study.

74
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,000
Your Highness,

75
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,319
where are you going?

76
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,199
Your Highness.

77
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,120
Your Highness!

78
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,480
Your Highness.

79
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,560
Where are you going?

80
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,319
Your Highness!

81
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,360
Your Highness.

82
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,240
Your Highness,
you are banned from entering.

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,439
Your Highness!

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,759
Who is it? Stop there.

85
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,360
The imperial court is a critial place.

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,639
You are forbidden from entering
without notifications.

87
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,639
- Stop there.
- Stop there.

88
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,000
I am Princess Qing.

89
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,120
I am Princess Qing.

90
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,439
Your Majesty.

91
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,360
(Get back.)

92
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,079
(Your Majesty!)

93
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,160
Your Majesty!

94
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,439
I have a complaint.

95
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,160
(I have a complaint, Your Majesty.)

96
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,759
My brother was killed.

97
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,040
(Your Majesty!)

98
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,560
(Your Majesty!)

99
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,240
(Your Majesty!)

100
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,639
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,639
My brotehr was wronged.

102
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,879
Your Majesty!

103
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:37,680
Your Majesty!

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,360
Wait a second.

105
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,439
Xiao Jingque

106
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,560
greets Your Majesty.

107
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,600
Father-in-law.

108
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,639
After Lu Anran married into
the Prince Qing's Mansion,

109
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,560
she not only still has feelings

110
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,480
for His Highness Prince Qi,

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
but also sows discord

112
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,480
between my brother and
His Highness Prince Qing

113
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,360
with the pampering of His Highness.

114
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,480
My brother wanted His Highness

115
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,920
to see through her,

116
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,800
but...

117
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,639
but he was plotted by the wicked woman

118
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,800
and killed by His Highness personally.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,199
Please cool down, Your Majesty.

120
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,480
Good. Prince Qing.

121
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,160
Good. Lu Anran.

122
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,279
You lied to me.

123
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,839
You didn't keep me in your mind at all.

124
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,879
There you off now.

125
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,120
I

126
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,199
will give you an explanation.

127
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

128
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,039
Watch out for Prince Yi closely.

129
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,519
The garrison of
Hanjing and the surrounding area

130
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,559
can't fall to him.

131
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,919
Yes, Your Highness.

132
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,600
(Your Highness.)

133
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,159
Come in.

134
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,919
Your Highness, Eunuch Li is here.

135
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,399
Calling on Your Highness
and Ms. Lu to the court now.

136
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,399
Your Highness!

137
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:24,720
Your Highness.

138
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,960
What for?

139
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,879
Why are you always

140
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,759
so dramatic?

141
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,519
What's happening again?

142
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,399
Eunuch Li beside His Majesty

143
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,600
send someone to pass a word,

144
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,679
calling on you to the imperial court now.

145
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,279
Eunuch Li.

146
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,159
What does Eunuch Li need me for?

147
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,799
His Majesty called on

148
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,039
His Highness Prince Qing and Ms. Lu today.

149
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,559
It's said that Xiao Jingque

150
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,759
broke into the Imperial Study today

151
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,440
and leaked why Xiao Ying died.

152
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,519
(If Father knows the death of Xiao Ying)

153
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,440
(is related to Lu Anran,)

154
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,440
(he won't let her go for sure.)

155
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:23,960
I

156
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
greet Father.

157
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,919
There you up.

158
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,240
Thank you, Father.

159
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

160
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,879
Prince Qing,

161
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,679
do you have anything

162
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,559
to tell me?

163
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,919
I don't know which one

164
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,559
Father refers to.

165
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,200
You think you can cover up

166
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,720
what happened at the Double Ninth Festival

167
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,480
and fool everyone, don't you?

168
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,840
What does Father mean?

169
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,360
I have no idea.

170
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,759
Please Father be explicit.

171
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,279
You are still pretending to be bewildered.

172
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,559
Guards.

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

174
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,399
As Lu Anran lured her master,

175
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,120
drag her out for execution.

176
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,039
Yes, Your Majesty.

177
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,360
Father.

178
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,399
What do you mean, Father?

179
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,279
Lu Anran knows nothing at all.

180
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:31,840
Father.

181
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,720
All is nothing to do with her.

182
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,080
Father.

183
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,440
Father, please investigate it. Father.

184
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,480
I plead guilty. Father.

185
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:49,639
I plead guilty.

186
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,639
Wait.

187
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,600
Xiao Ying

188
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,279
was killed by me.

189
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,480
As for this issue,

190
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,039
Lu Anran is ignorant.

191
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
Please Father let Lu Anran go.

192
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,440
Take her back.

193
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,360
Prince Qing.

194
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,080
Do you forget

195
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,840
Xiao Ying is my courtier,

196
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,080
not your family servant?

197
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,320
You can kill him as you wish?

198
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,200
I didn't mean to kill him.

199
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,039
But he schemed to hurt Lu Anran

200
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,279
again and again.

201
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,919
He also got Ninth Brother involved.

202
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,080
I killed him by accident

203
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,480
in the situation.

204
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,360
Your Highness,

205
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,879
what are you finding on earth?

206
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,960
Lu Anran, right?

207
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,320
As such,

208
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,799
what you have done

209
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,320
is all for the relationships.

210
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,080
It seems that

211
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,519
I misjudged you.

212
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,960
You killed

213
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,559
Xiao Ying easily.

214
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,840
That is to say,

215
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,559
you married his sister

216
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,399
not because

217
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,039
he was a general of a garrison.

218
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,480
I have never

219
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,639
planned to form a clique.

220
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,960
Won't you

221
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,000
compete for the leadership of the garrison

222
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,080
with Prince Yi for your own gains?

223
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,240
Everyone in the imperial court
knows about Prince Yi's personality.

224
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,679
If Prince Yi

225
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,039
takes over the garrison,

226
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,519
I am afraid he will cause trouble.

227
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,279
Father.

228
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,799
I never offer suggestions
for personal gains.

229
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,200
What a nice word.

230
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,879
There you two up.

231
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,080
Thank you, Father.

232
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

233
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,559
It seems that you have figured it out.

234
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:09,879
Then, afterward,

235
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,679
I think

236
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,639
it's not a tough choice for you.

237
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,960
Do you see the two tables

238
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,399
in front of me?

239
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,440
I see them.

240
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,039
If in the future,

241
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,679
you stay at your own place
as Prince Qing at ease,

242
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,840
then take that seat.

243
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,399
You can enjoy
all the delicacies on the table

244
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,559
as you wish.

245
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,600
I will guarantee you a wealthy life.

246
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,440
But if you don't satisfy Prince Qing

247
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,720
and want to achieve
the position of Crown Prince

248
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
beside me,

249
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,759
then go up here.

250
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,080
Drink the glass of wine

251
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,120
on the table.

252
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,039
It doesn't matter you like her.

253
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,279
I also had

254
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,679
such affections.

255
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,600
It's like

256
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,600
fans in summers

257
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,039
and fires in winters.

258
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,720
Refreshing.

259
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,960
Can't stop using them.

260
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,120
Can't leave them for a while.

261
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:46,799
However,

262
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,840
when in springs and autumns,

263
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,039
they will be worthless.

264
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,039

♪No one can bind me up♪

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,300

353
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,079
Chuan,

354
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,599
don't mess around.

355
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,559
I am not going to mess around.

356
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,319
I come to here today

357
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,000
to present something

358
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,839
to Father.

359
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,119
What is it?

360
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,400
Chuan,

361
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,200
do you know

362
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,400
what you decide today

363
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,079
will have a cascading effect.

364
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,640
Have you figured it out?

365
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
I haven't figured it out.

366
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,200
I have never figured it out

367
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,519
whether I should

368
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,279
elude reality

369
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,480
to be an incompetent coward

370
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,640
or I should grab power

371
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,079
to become
the last sort of person I want to be.

372
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,480
I naively assumed that

373
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,200
there would be

374
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
a third way.

375
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,839
But I have no idea about

376
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,160
where it is.

377
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,160
Chuan,

378
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,319
You have figured out nothing

379
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,480
before you broke into here.

380
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:58,440
It seems that

381
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,000
you also came for this woman.

382
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,480
Did Father have someone

383
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,559
you want to protect?

384
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,359
I have.

385
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,039
I have someone

386
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,440
I will endeavor to safeguard regardless.

387
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,960
I always thought

388
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,440
there must be someone
in the imperial court

389
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,839
who shares the same minds with me.

390
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,039
Only I strive forward with him

391
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,720
will I see a bright outlook.

392
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,720
But I was wrong.

393
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,720
I can't give what I strive for

394
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,119
to others.

395
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,640
During my trip to Danzhou,

396
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,559
I have seen civilians struggling.

397
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,119
During my work for the imperial examination,

398
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,359
I have witnessed scholars suffering.

399
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,880
The more I see,

400
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,279
the more helpless I feel.

401
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,079
Father once said,

402
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,039
only grasping

403
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,359
the supreme power

404
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,519
can one

405
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,599
make the rules in the world.

406
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,319
Second Brother also said

407
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,039
if one can't control others,

408
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,559
he will only be under control.

409
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,039
Now that I can't stand seeing

410
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:22,839
the one I want to protect

411
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,559
becoming

412
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,759
sheep to the slaughter,

413
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,160
then,

414
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,279
let me

415
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,920
make endeavors to be the ruler.

416
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,240
You said so much.

417
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,640
It turns out you have
figured it out eventually.

418
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,279
I want to ask for the justice

419
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,160
from Father today.

420
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,359
Say it.

421
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,839
Don't know if Father can promise me.

422
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,960
The critical imperial court

423
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,079
that drives away the evil
and ushers in the good

424
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,319
should not come down to
a place for execution.

425
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,400
No one should die

426
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,759
in the imperial court

427
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,079
when he has not yet been convicted.

428
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,079
Okay.

429
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,279
I promise you.

430
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:20,799
Present it.

431
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,720
Announce it.

432
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,920
Ninthr Prince Mu Chuan

433
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,319
is well-behaved,

434
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,920
moral and sagely

435
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,680
with great performance,

436
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,319
winning my favor.

437
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,359
Therefore, I especially bestow you
General Huaihua and the leadership

438
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:57,200
of the garrison in Hanjing and
the surrounding area with 30 thousand soldiers.

439
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,279
Respect it.

440
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,000
I

441
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,640
accept the imperial edict.

442
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,039
(Now that I can't stand seeing)

443
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:25,839
(the one I want to protect)

444
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,559
(becoming)

445
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,960
(sheep to the slaughter,)

446
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,200
(then let me)

447
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,000
(make endeavors to be the ruler.)

448
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,039
(Life waxes and wanes)

449
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,079
(with gains and losses.)

450
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,160
(In the twinkling of an eye,)

451
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,160
(I am afraid I can only)

452
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,960
(live in this small world.)

453
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,240
Lu Anran,

454
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,240
what do you mean on earth?

455
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,000
So many things happened today.

456
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:25,359
But you seem like

457
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,279
nothing happened.

458
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,960
Are you disgusting me?

459
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,839
Your Highness,

460
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,240
what are you saying?

461
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,039
Now in your eyes,

462
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,839
I am no more than

463
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,920
a stray dog, right?

464
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,039
It's normal for you to be enraged

465
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,599
because you lose your lifelong desire

466
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,960
in one day.

467
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,359
How can I ridicule Your Highness?

468
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,119
You still say you aren't mocking me.

469
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,920
Everyone is laughing at me.

470
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,200
The position within easy reach

471
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,240
is the lifelong desire

472
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,319
for me.

473
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
But for the other,

474
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,160
it's at his fingertips.

475
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,519
Lu Anran,

476
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:12,920
are you regretful

477
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,880
to marry me?

478
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,359
I only ask for a safe Lu Family.

479
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,720
I don't desire for anything else.

480
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,599
Since His Majesty guaranteed Your Highness

481
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,799
a prosperous life,

482
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,400
I will gain what I want as well.

483
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,079
Gain what you want.

484
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,680
I would rather not receive

485
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,440
the insulting charity!

486
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,000
Lu Anran,

487
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,359
do you think

488
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,759
I choose to sacrifice you

489
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,359
to linger on for the rest of my life?

490
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,319
I tell you.

491
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,480
Don't underestimate

492
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,920
your position in my mind.

493
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,559
I also tell you

494
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,240
I will bear in mind

495
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,559
today's disgrace.

496
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,400
For all that humiliated me,

497
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,960
I will ask them to repay me their lives.

498
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,720
You

499
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,680
have a good rest.

500
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,200
Your Highness.

501
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,799
What are you doing, Your Highness?

502
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,680
You are disappointed
because Lu Anran and I

503
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,359
are back alive,

504
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
aren't you?

505
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,319
Never mind.

506
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,400
I still have a second chance
even when failing for once.

507
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
As long as I am alive,

508
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,839
I will use every method

509
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,160
to avenge my brother's death.

510
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,839
You are the generals' offspring indeed.

511
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,880
So brave you are.

512
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,000
I did look down on you.

513
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,240
But I am afraid

514
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,039
you don't have a chance.

515
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,400
Your Highness.

516
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,160
Please kill me
if Your Highness want to kill someone.

517
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,720
It is I who instigated Princess

518
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,920
to report it.

519
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,160
It's all my fault.

520
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,960
Princess is just a child.

521
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,839
She knows nothing, Your Highness.

522
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,279
Your Highness.

523
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:23,920
Nanny.

524
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,119
Don't beg him.

525
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,880
The Xiao Family has no one that fears death.

526
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,039
The Xiao Family has no one that fears death.

527
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,680
Nice word.

528
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,880
Instead, I don't believe

529
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,759
the Xiao Family can be so hard-hearted.

530
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,559
Nanny!

531
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:48,799
Nanny!

532
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,799
(For all that humiliated me,)

533
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,039
(I will ask them to repay me their lives.)

534
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,279
Nanny.

535
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,000
I told you early

536
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,920
if you behave yourself,

537
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,240
after I become the emperor,

538
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,359
your Xiao Family

539
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,759
will enjoy honorable merits
of accompanying the emperor.

540
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,920
And you

541
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,720
will be the rightful empress.

542
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,559
But what a pity.

543
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,920
You choose to confront me.

544
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,240
Don't blame

545
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
my ruthlessness.

546
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,880
The honorable merits
of accompanying the emperor?

547
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,599
You treat me so cruel.

548
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:32,359
If you really get the position,

549
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:35,240
will our Xiao Family be able to survive?

550
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,359
It seems you know me well.

551
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,720
I only hate my blindness.

552
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,599
I thought you are righteous.

553
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,319
It's so funny.

554
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,680
My brother didn't like
the partisan wrangle.

555
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,559
It is I that wanted to marry you.

556
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,119
Seeing from now,

557
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,400
your good intentions toward me
when we were young

558
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,519
are full of schemes.

559
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,279
Keep going.

560
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,079
What else do you want to say?

561
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,519
Speak

562
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,440
all your words from your heart.

563
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,559
Take it as my last blessing

564
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,160
to you.

565
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,279
Mu Ze,

566
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,920
do you believe

567
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,319
in this mansion,

568
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,279
only I truly loved you?

569
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,039
But you don't deserve it.

570
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,640
For your life,

571
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,680
no one will love you anymore.

572
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,880
It's punishment from God.

573
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,880
Stop, Your Highness.

574
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,079
Princess is pregnant.

575
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,480
Please Your Highness think twice.

576
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,200
Princess grieves excessively

577
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,359
and is very depressed.

578
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,519
She needs to rest for days.

579
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,559
Okay.

580
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,880
There you off.

581
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:20,759
Yes, Your Highness.

582
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,680
Xiao Jingque,

583
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,960
I tell you

584
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,160
this is my child.

585
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,079
If you dare to

586
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,119
do anything else,

587
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,480
I will make you a living hell.

588
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:35,839
Then, Your Highness'd better

589
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,200
not stay here.

590
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,000
Your will only disturb

591
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,799
me and my kid.

592
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,640
Don't be ungrateful.

593
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,319
Why did you save me?

594
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,279
Fell for him

595
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,119
wholeheartedly.

596
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,880
Thought that you could save him back.

597
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,119
But didn't expect
your family to be torn apart.

598
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,440
Princess looks like

599
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,880
my old acquaintance.

600
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,639
So, I took pity on you instantly.

601
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:18,760
No more than this.

602
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,119
Lu Anran,

603
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,119
your stay by Mu Ze's side

604
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:31,960
is actually

605
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,360
for trying to deal with him.

606
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:40,960
Right?

607
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,880
Then, work harder.

608
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,719
Don't let me down.

609
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,119
The wheel of destiny

610
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,960
made Mu Chuan

611
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,400
oppose Mu Ze.

612
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,079
All changed suddenly

613
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:15,440
in the imperial courts.

614
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:17,320
However,

615
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,760
there wasn't a jubilant soul

616
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,800
for the gain and the loss.

617
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,079
Miss,

618
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,440
His Highness Prince Qi's letter.

619
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,159
Let's go back and take the measurements

620
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,079
before we come again.

621
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,480
Okay.

622
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,300
(Satin and Silk)

623
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,519
Your Ladyship, please have a look.

624
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,320
If you like it,

625
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,760
I can take it down for you to have a check.

626
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,599
Here. Let me do it.

627
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,239
Your Ladyship, why not go inside

628
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,320
and take the measurement?

629
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,559
Wait for me outside.

630
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,159
Yes.

631
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,000
This way, please, Your Ladyship.

632
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,920
Your Highness, I will take my leave.

633
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,600
♪Hiding all promises♪

634
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,900
♪No need to tell it to anyone♪

635
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,500
♪Silently hide the surprise♪

636
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,679
How are you doing?

637
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,519
We shouln't meet

638
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,800
under the circumstance.

639
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,599
It's so risky for you to do so.

640
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,440
I know.

641
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,840
You fret I will die again.

642
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,480
But I don't want to wait any longer.

643
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,199
What are you going to do?

644
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,679
I wasted so much time.

645
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,599
I missed so much time with you.

646
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,079
If all this will definitely happen,

647
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:45,239
as a man,

648
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,840
I have no reason to avoid again.

649
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,079
So, I am not intended to give in any longer

650
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,480
in the court afterward.

651
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:51,760
I will voluntarily

652
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,000
push all to happen sooner.

653
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,719
But it's too risky.

654
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,960
Which one of what you have done

655
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,800
isn't risky?

656
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,000
I only hope it will end

657
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,239
sooner.

658
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,280
You can thus

659
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,679
see the light again sooner, right?

660
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:16,599
If you do such,

661
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,119
you will make Mu Lin feared.

662
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,480
He is a psycho.

663
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,239
I am not an ignorant boy.

664
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:24,920
Since I determine

665
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
to sit on that place,

666
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,599
I have to make some choices, right?

667
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,719
I haven't seen

668
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,519
your fierce and decisive look indeed.

669
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,199
You will face it sooner or later.

670
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:57,159
Your Majesty, the Chinese New Year's Eve
is around the corner.

671
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,119
Do we hold the Lighting Ceremony

672
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,079
according to the old custom this year?

673
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,280
Please Your Majesty make it clear.

674
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,079
Hold it like the last year.

675
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,599
Yes, Your Majesty.

676
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,280
Don't know if Your Majesty has a choice

677
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,000
for the one that lights the light.

678
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,840
I volunteer

679
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,519
to lead the officials to light the light

680
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:27,440
and pray for Your Majesty and Dahan

681
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,559
on the Chinese New Year's Eve.

682
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:30,920
Chuan,

683
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,840
you always don't like

684
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,719
such boisterous activities.

685
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:37,159
Why do you volunteer this year?

686
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,480
Ninth Brother,

687
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,199
are you too anxious?

688
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,159
You just become General Huaihua

689
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,400
for a few days.

690
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,519
You seem like

691
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,400
you are too anxious to wait.

692
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,880
So Shameful.

693
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,440
Why does Fourth Brother say so?

694
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,079
Since Fourth Borther

695
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,519
lights the light every year,

696
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,639
you can let me do it for once

697
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,559
this year.

698
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,960
I think

699
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,519
Ninth Brother has built
the water conservancy in the western suburb

700
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:10,039
and cultivated new rice this year.

701
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,159
These all are

702
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,199
benefits for civilians nationwide.

703
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,000
Ninth Brother is the best choice

704
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,480
for lighting the light
at the Lighting Ceremony.

705
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,440
Father.

706
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,559
All right.

707
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,559
Deal.

708
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,079
On the Chinese New Year's Eve,

709
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,840
Prince Qi will lead you

710
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,679
to light the light and pray.

711
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,639
Your Majesty is wise.

712
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,840
Can't believe it!

713
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,800
Not only can't I light the light,

714
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:44,760
but also I should

715
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,920
hold the Lighting Ceremony.

716
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,559
Your Highness.

717
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:47,239
Such a whammy.

718
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,000
Had I known it,

719
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,519
I wouldn't have
undertaken the job in previous years.

720
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,000
Go find Father

721
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
to refuse it.

722
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I quit!

723
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,360
Your Highness,
we should not only hold it,

724
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,639
but also hold it well.

725
00:40:58,559 --> 00:40:59,639
Are you pulling my leg?

726
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,360
Your Highness,

727
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:03,400
don't you see it clearly?

728
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,800
Who is your real rival on earth?

729
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,400
Do you mean

730
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:11,960
Ninth Brother?

731
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,199
For your past battles

732
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,320
with Prince Qing,

733
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,840
His Majesty at most sat back

734
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,360
and was diplomatic.

735
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,639
Nowadays, His Majesty's intention

736
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,239
is very obvious.

737
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:26,599
His most favorite choice is Prince Qi.

738
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,679
The dog that seldom barks
bites hard the most.

739
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,440
Ninth Brother keeps silent for years

740
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,519
but won His Majesty's favor instead.

741
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,400
So, for the Lighting Ceremony,

742
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,880
we should

743
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,599
hold it well.

744
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:45,920
How?

745
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:49,679
That's it.
