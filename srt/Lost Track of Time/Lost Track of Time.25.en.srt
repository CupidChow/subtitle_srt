2
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,599
Miss.

3
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:49,640
It's cold outside.

4
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,959
Don't catch a cold.

5
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,040
What about

6
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,959
waiting in the room?

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,159
If he's fine,

8
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,760
she should be back now.

9
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,200
But why doesn't she arrive?

10
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,879
Maybe she is getting held up.

11
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,000
Miss.

12
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,240
Miss, rest assured.

13
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,639
My brother is fine now.

14
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,000
Holly,

15
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,560
I am sorry.

16
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,719
Never mind.

17
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,759
It's all right.

18
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,879
It's all right.

19
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,520
As for Prince Qi,

20
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,120
don't we have to send someone

21
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,199
to deal with it for real?

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,039
We don't know if Shen Changqing
manages to survive now.

23
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,159
There are only a few farmers
on Ninth Brother's side.

24
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,400
As long as they haven't caught
the ones who made it,

25
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,400
they won't trace it back to us.

26
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,240
But if His Highness Prince Qi

27
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
brings people to my...

28
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,319
Leave him alone.

29
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,360
Till he calms down,

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,800
I believe

31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,759
he won't go to great lengths

32
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,080
after considering our relations.

33
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,680
Okay.

34
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,000
Right.

35
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Princess Qing

36
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
is still young.

37
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
She is pampered and willful.

38
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
As her elder brother,

39
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,400
you should teach her.

40
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,759
Never

41
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,919
let family intrigues

42
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,960
hinder our great cause.

43
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,840
Don't interfere in things

44
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,400
she shouldn't mind.

45
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,159
Your Highness, bet on me.

46
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,000
Women

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,479
will only run around in circles

48
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,120
in limited places.

49
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,319
It's far less essential

50
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,919
than what we are striving for.

51
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,120
As for this,

52
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,159
I am never confused.

53
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,360
That's good.

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,159
Your Highness, I will take my leave.

55
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,120
Holly,

56
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,199
you told me before.

57
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,519
Your brother's heart is on the right side.

58
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,120
My attack

59
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,319
might avoid the vital part.

60
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,639
Miss,

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,079
even if you don't tell me about this,

62
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,920
I still believe in you.

63
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,639
But it was still risky.

64
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,839
I didn't see Mu Chuan

65
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,959
for long,

66
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,480
so I had to take the risky move.

67
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,920
Mu Chuan

68
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,040
was just late for a while.

69
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,720
But I really didn't expect

70
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,360
His Highness Prince Qi

71
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,199
would...

72
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,759
It's not his fault.

73
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,680
Very upsetting.

74
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,279
Miss,

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
I am sorry.

76
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Never mind.

77
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,120
There you off.

78
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,079

Since Lu Anran relinquished all

107
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,160
to marry into the mansion,

108
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,439
she has been

109
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,439
mulling over the potential crises and harm

110
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,519
for every single day.

111
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,519
But she only missed this stab

112
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,759
a hurt

113
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,759
that made her feel deeply painful

in this lonely night.

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,159
Miss, how is your injury?

116
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,120
You shall change the dressing
for times today.

117
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,159
Or, your injury will fester.

118
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,559
Not that serious.

119
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,159
Miss, you can't be careless for sure.

120
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,559
It's a stab after all.

121
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,879
Actually, the wound is not deep.

122
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,120
He didn't mean to hurt me.

123
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,480
He did it on impulse

124
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,919
in that situation.

125
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,879
But I am afraid after this issue,

126
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,480
Mu Chuan and Mu Ze

127
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,559
won't be as intimate

128
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,679
as before.

129
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,240
His Highness Prince Qi

130
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,440
repected Mu Ze like he was his father.

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,960
Under the circumstance now,

132
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,159
I fret His Highness Prince Qi

133
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,639
is sorrowing as well.

134
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,600
Innocent Mu Chuan enjoyed a peaceful life

135
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,960
and has been deceived by Mu Ze till now.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,639
It's about the time

137
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,120
for him to see through the person.

138
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,000
But

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,240
His Highness is so kind.

140
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,720
He needs to face such a cruel reality.

141
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,200
I feel bad for him.

142
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,279
After this issue,

143
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,919
Xiao Ying won't just stop there.

144
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,360
With Mu Chuan's character,

145
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
he won't give up.

146
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,039
Miss,

147
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,159
what should we do next?

148
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,440
Mu Ze and Xiao Ying

149
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,639
are not dumb.

150
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,519
We can use the opportunity

151
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,919
to make a comprehensive plan.

152
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,679
Maybe we can
kill two birds with one stone.

153
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,919
Miss, you want me to leave the mansion?

154
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,879
After yesterday,

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
I am afraid Xiao Ying

156
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,679
can't tolerate me because of his sister.

157
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,480
Instead of watching out for him
all the time,

158
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,679
I would rather give him
a knife voluntarily.

159
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,879
Miss means

160
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,279
I am the knife?

161
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:22,960
Yes.

162
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,840
It's reasonable for you
to break up with me

163
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,000
because I harmed Brother Shen.

164
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,639
If you still stay by my side,

165
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,200
it will arouse suspicion instead.

166
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,559
But Miss,

167
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,279
if I leave,

168
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,759
you will be alone in the mansion.

169
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,519
Trust me.

170
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,960
Miss, Prince Qing is here.

171
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,320
My mansion doesn't need

172
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,039
someone like you.

173
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,919
Get out of here.

174
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,840
Lu Anran, don't touch me.

175
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,799
I will leave myself.

176
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,399
Lu Anran,

177
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,559
my brother still in a coma
with the severe injury

178
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,639
is all because of you.

179
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,919
I was really blind then

180
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,759
to follow you.

181
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,600
You are so ungrateful.

182
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,360
Were it not for me who saved you,

183
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,480
I fret you would

184
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,360
go astray early.

185
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,600
You are really eloquent,

186
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,320
turning things upside down.

187
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,759
I was fooled by you as a result.

188
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
I fooled you,

189
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,039
a worthless maid.

190
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,080
Ridiculous.

191
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,039
I, Lu Anran,

192
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,120
never force others.

193
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,799
Since you can't
go through thick and thin with me,

194
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:29,720
then leave.

195
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,639
I wasted my efforts on you.

196
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,000
It really disgusts me
when thinking from now.

197
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:40,720
Stop.

198
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,639
As a simple servant,

199
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,519
you dare to criticize your hostess.

200
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,519
If I let you go like this,

201
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,279
isn't it a laughingstock

202
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,679
of the Mansion of Prince Qing?

203
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,320
How does Your Highness
want to address her?

204
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,039
Execute her?

205
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,759
Thanks for Your Highness's support.

206
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,639
It is easy to kill her.

207
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,799
However, we don't know
whether her brother is dead or alive now.

208
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,320
What if he comes to himself?

209
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,600
I don't want there is always someone
trying to avenge on me.

210
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
If that is the case,

211
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,120
I can protect you naturally.

212
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,600
I pricked him

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,080
and sent his sister back.

214
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,919
We are even.

215
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,679
As Your Highness is busy,

216
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,279
you don't need to spare your time for me.

217
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,440
I just want to

218
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,759
live in peace afterwards.

219
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,799
Please Your Highness allows me.

220
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,039
Get out.

221
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,559
How is your injury?

222
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,600
Instead of worrying about me,

223
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,480
Your Highness had better
go check His Highness Prince Qi.

224
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,559
His Highness Prince Qi pricked me.

225
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,360
The more upset he feels to me,

226
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,720
the more disappointed
he feels to Your Highness.

227
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,960
Relax.

228
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,240
You don't understand the relations

229
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,399
between Ninth Brother and me.

230
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
True, I don't know it.

231
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,080
Your Highness,

232
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,720
why not have a look
in Xiao Ying's barracks?

233
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,639
I heard from Holly

234
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,000
His Highness Prince Qi has brought people

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,080
to catch the murderers.

236
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,200
General said without orders,

237
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,360
you can't enter
the military camp as wishes.

238
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,759
Your Highness Prince Qi,

239
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,960
please leave.

240
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,799
Your general are really on a high horse.

241
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,919
In that case,

242
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,080
I won't set you in a pickle.

243
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,480
The farmers in the suburb verified that

244
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,879
the criminals are harbored

245
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,039
in the garrison of
Hanjing and the surrounding area.

246
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
We hope General Xiao could assist us

247
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,120
to seize the criminals
to improve military discipline.

248
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,000
Seize the criminals
to improve military discipline.

249
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,840
Seize the criminals
to improve military discipline.

250
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,919
Stop yelling. Stop yelling.

251
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,120
No noise here.

252
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,519
Seize the criminals
to improve military discipline.

253
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:17,039
Seize the criminals
to improve military discipline.

254
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,399
Open the door.

255
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,840
Your Highness Prince Qi.

256
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Please.

257
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
(Win Every Battle)

258
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,240
Your Highness Prince Qi

259
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,360
claimed that

260
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,120
the criminals are in my garrison.

261
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
But I don't know

262
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:04,960
if Your Highness Prince Qi

263
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,159
has concrete evidence.

264
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,799
But I don't know

265
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,480
if I am counted as the evidence.

266
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,840
General Xiao's desire

267
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,879
to kill Shen Changqing

268
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,320
was witnessed by me.

269
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,639
The farmers behind me

270
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,320
were also on the spot.

271
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,200
They saw the murderers
who showed their faces by accident.

272
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,000
Please General Xiao

273
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,159
asks all the soldiers out

274
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,480
for the civilians to identify.

275
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,759
Your Highness Prince Qi,

276
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,559
before you do this,

277
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,759
don't you consider

278
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,840
His Highness Prince Qing?

279
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,480
No matter who it is,

280
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,399
as long as he disregards
the law and human life,

281
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
he should be punished accordingly.

282
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,399
As Your Highness Prince Qi
ignores all as such,

283
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,480
don't you

284
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,720
think about the result?

285
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,720
Xiao Ying, you dare.

286
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,919
His Highness Prince Qi is the prince.

287
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,559
You should be so rampant!

288
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
Do you want to rebel?

289
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,519
Look.

290
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,320
Where is it?

291
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,559
A drill hall.

292
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
It's normal

293
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,639
to drill here.

294
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,000
But you instead,

295
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,399
regarding yourself as
His Highness Prince Qi's attendant,

296
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,840
are crying foul first

297
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,039
and shouting arrogantly.

298
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,679
Don't chop logic with...

299
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,200
Zhufeng.

300
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,639
It's so funny.

301
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,360
General Xiao,

302
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,960
murder cases

303
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,720
are beyond my reach

304
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,519
originally.

305
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,600
Just because Mansion of Hanjing's Mayor

306
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,320
is suppressed by your authority,

307
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
so they don't dare to send people here.

308
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,960
so I decide to meddle in myself.

309
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,639
Since I am here today,

310
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,960
I must ask for a conclusion.

311
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,279
With General's posture,

312
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:54,759
are you going to

313
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,320
start a war with me?

314
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,799
As General is the pillar of our country,

315
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,600
you won't be that bewildered, right?

316
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,480
Your Highness Prince Qi makes it serious.

317
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,359
Since you are exalted,

318
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,480
I don't dare to hurt Your Highness.

319
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,400
But people in the back

320
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,799
are not the same!

321
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,000
(Win Every Battle)

322
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,200
They broke into the barracks,

323
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,680
spread rumors and made a scene.

324
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,359
I am afraid His Majesty

325
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,799
won't blame me

326
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,039
if I shoot them now.

327
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,279
Let's fight with him!

328
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,880
- Slow down. Slow down.
- Battle with him!

329
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,440
The unruly multitudes.

330
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,599
Shoot.

331
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,680
Safeguard the civilians.

332
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,600
(Xiao)

333
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,559
General Xiao

334
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,799
is also a military
that protects the country.

335
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,400
Won't you worry you will

336
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,640
incur punishment and bad karma

337
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,440
when you harm innocent civilians?

338
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,960
They aren't the innocent civilians.

339
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,200
They all are thieves with full of schemes

340
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,160
who want something else.

341
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,440
Shoot arrows!

342
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,000
The civilians came with me

343
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,559
and got hurt because of me.

344
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,119
If you dare to keep shooting,

345
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,559
step over my dead body

346
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,240
first!

347
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,720
If I pass away here,

348
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,119
you and all your relatives

349
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,279
must suffer the extreme penalty

350
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,240
without a survival.

351
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,440
Don't trust his groundless words.

352
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,599
Raise up your arrows.

353
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,440
Raise up!

354
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:11,960
Great.

355
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
They don't dare to.

356
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,960
Then, you do it.

357
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,200
Arrow!

358
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,160
Your Highness Prince Qi,

359
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,839
bring it on.

360
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,920
Your Highness, watch out!

361
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,319
Xiao Ying,

362
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,559
how dare you are!

363
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
You even dare to kill Ninth Brother.

364
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,680
You really don't bear me

365
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,440
in your mind.

366
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,079
His Highness Prince Qi
is digging it up like this

367
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,720
and catching the murderers in my garrison.

368
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,839
He doesn't keep Your Highness and I

369
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,920
in his mind instead.

370
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,400
You take Lu Yun as the scapegoat.

371
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,359
I know what you are thinking.

372
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,720
I tell you

373
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,279
for this score,

374
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,960
I will settle it with you later.

375
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,519
Ninth Brother, leave here now.

376
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,160
Leave here now.

377
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,240
As for the deaths in the suburb,

378
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,359
I will give you an explanation.

379
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,279
I don't want any explanation.

380
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:42,960
I have heard so many

381
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,759
explanations.

382
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:47,559
Are you really going to

383
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,119
confront me for these people?

384
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,240
These people.

385
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,000
Second Brother,

386
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,720
I know your plans
are weightier than great mountains,

387
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,559
but are the lives of these people

388
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,160
lighter than feathers?

389
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,240
From ancient,

390
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,319
achievers don't bother about trifles.

391
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,039
Where do you think

392
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,640
did the white bones come

393
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
in histroy?

394
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,599
Second Brother,

395
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,680
stop using

396
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
the rhetoric of reasons

397
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,400
to sugarcoat

398
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
your selfish desires.

399
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,400
No one should

400
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,680
sacrifice

401
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,519
for others' thoughts.

402
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,640
Ninth Brother.

403
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,759
Living in the world,

404
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,079
it's already hard for us
to stick to our principles.

405
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,640
It's even harder

406
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,359
to stick on the right road.

407
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,200
Second Brother,

408
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,079
for what you have done to Ninth Brother,

409
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,279
I will bear them in mind forever.

410
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,759
But now,

411
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,880
I must be loyal to myself.

412
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,759
General Xiao,

413
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,319
if you don't hand over murderers now,

414
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,000
today,

415
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:40,880
I won't stop

416
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,720
unless one of us dies.

417
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,839
Prince Qi,

418
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,000
why should you force me?

419
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,359
Xiao Ying.

420
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,480
Hand over.

421
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,720
I want you to hand over!

422
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:29,680
Bring them on!

423
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:54,960
Your Highness.

424
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,359
It's them.

425
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:55,920
It's him.

426
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,559
It's them.

427
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,319
That's it.

428
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:57,880
It's them.

429
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,039
Exactly.

430
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,279
It's them.

431
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,200
I will take him as well.

432
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,839
Now!

433
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,200
(Xiao)

434
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,319
Since General can
adopt heavy-handed approaches,

435
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,880
why do you need to rely on a host?

436
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,640
In my opinion,

437
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,920
you can depend on yourself now.

438
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:56,799
Is Prince Qing

439
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,000
really going to bind me up

440
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,839
and send me to His Majesty?

441
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,640
I also need to sit still for death.

442
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,359
How powerful General Xiao is.

443
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,680
How can a few tiny soldiers

444
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,920
identify you?

445
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,720
I did it for you.

446
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,119
As long as there is a slim chance,

447
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,680
I should obliterate it.

448
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,319
It seems that

449
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,759
you did

450
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:24,880
think about me.

451
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,200
Sure.

452
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,400
General Xiao,

453
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,240
I put Lu Yun in your garrison.

454
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,640
But you used him to kill Ninth Brother.

455
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,279
You did it also for me?

456
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:49,880
Xiao Ying.

457
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,079
Your taking it upon yourself

458
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,559
has already viewed me as nothing.

459
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,240
As such,

460
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,039
I won't push you.

461
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,000
Your Highness makes it serious.

462
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,599
I am sorry that I arrogated to myself.

463
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,599
I just didn't want

464
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,000
Prince Qi to spoil your great cause.

465
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,599
So, I had to do this.

466
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,200
I warn you.

467
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,160
If you dare to

468
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,799
get Ninth Brother involved again,

469
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,359
I have a ten thousand ways

470
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:25,960
to make your life a living hell.

471
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,160
Yes, Your Highness.

472
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,920
Thank Your Highness

473
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,079
for taking Young Master
out of the barracks.

474
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,400
I just fulfill my promise

475
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,160
to her.

476
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,400
No more than this.

477
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,119
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

478
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,300
(Lu Guang Tong)

479
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,160
Young Master.

480
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,759
(All changes for sure.)

481
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,359
(The Lu Family's bustling warehouse)

482
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,119
(becomes so dreary now.)

483
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,720
(Anyway,)

484
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,240
(Lu Anran,)

485
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,799
(we're even now.)

486
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:24,720
Sis.

487
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,519
Yun.

488
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,039
Alright. Alright.

489
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,039
Come. Let me have a look.

490
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,720
Sis.

491
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,359
Alright. Come. Let me have a look.

492
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,839
Okay. It's good if you are back.

493
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,720
It's good if you are back.

494
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:44,640
Sis,

495
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,799
I am wrong.

496
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,400
You didn't allow me to join the army.

497
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,680
But I didn't listen to you.

498
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,519
And caused so much trouble as a result.

499
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,359
Yun,

500
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,039
there are many things

501
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,240
I can't explain to you.

502
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,200
But it's not your fault.

503
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,799
Come. Get up now.

504
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,279
And the things about Second Sister.

505
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,160
Luckily, Dad wrote to me.

506
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,480
Second Sister

507
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,839
has done so many bad things to you.

508
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,359
I...

509
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,279
She almost buried you to death.

510
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,960
I knew nothing.

511
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,720
I even talked to you like that.

512
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:28,759
I...

513
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,039
It's okay. Yun. It's fine.

514
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,319
That's history.

515
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,319
Never mind. Come on. Get up.

516
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,079
Come.

517
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,200
Come. Have a seat.

518
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,160
Let me take a look at you.

519
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,599
Sit.

520
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,319
Sis,

521
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,240
let's go back to Su City.

522
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,000
Hanjing is like a jungle.

523
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,799
Let's leave here, shall we?

524
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:57,480
Yun,

525
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,200
only I stay in Hanjing

526
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,559
can I keep you and Dad safe.

527
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,880
Don't overthink it.

528
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:05,519
I stay here

529
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,759
naturally because I have my own duties.

530
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,599
All right. Yun, be good.

531
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,440
I believe in Sis.

532
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,160
Doing so,

533
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,640
you must have your own reasons.

534
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,279
I will listen to you.

535
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:24,759
Shan Yue,

536
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,440
send Young Master back to Su City now.

537
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,640
In case of future worries.

538
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,079
Yes, Miss.

539
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,240
Yun,

540
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,319
take good care of Dad
when you arrive home.

541
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,319
Wait for me. I will definitely go back.

542
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,599
You must go back.

543
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,400
I will listen to you.

544
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,559
I will take good care of Dad.

545
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,640
Leave now.

546
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,640
Sis, you shall take care.

547
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:24,920
Mu Chuan,

548
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:26,960
thank you.

549
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,720
Your Highness.

550
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,400
Don't move.

551
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,160
Let me hug you for a while.

552
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,039
Your Highness,

553
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,920
aren't they for kids?

554
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
It's broken.

555
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,440
Why does Your Highness still keep it?

556
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,720
My mother's death once struck me hard.

557
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,920
I couldn't make a voice

558
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,039
for a long time.

559
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,480
It's Second Brother that
had been staying with me.

560
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,359
He made these gadgets to cheer me up.

561
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:18,960
If I don't tell you

562
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,160
it's a carrot,

563
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,839
you will think

564
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,799
it's a stick, won't you?

565
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,440
And this.

566
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,799
It's an apple.

567
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,279
It's round indeed.

568
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,839
You can tell it, right?

569
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,279
A teacup.

570
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:44,440
I guess

571
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,839
it is made of a broken apple

572
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:46,559
and he dug a hole in it.

573
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,519
But it's already difficult

574
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,400
for Second Brother.

575
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:12,840
For this bird,

576
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,159
it's the best one he ever made.

577
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,679
Do you know what it is?

578
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,719
A swallow.

579
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:31,159
You feel

580
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,000
I am funny, right?

581
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,480
Why did I learn to make such a thing?

582
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,639
Let me tell you.

583
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,159
When Ninth Borther was young,

584
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,800
he especially liked

585
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,840
the wooden bird I made.

586
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,639
He loved playing it.

587
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,320
And I am adept at

588
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,719
making this sort of bird.

589
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,800
Don't beat Second Brother.

590
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,679
But unfortunately,

591
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,719
when he was able to speak,

592
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,519
I didn't make them anymore.

593
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,079
Your Highness.

594
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,599
Why do you look at me in this way?

595
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,159
Are you mocking me?

596
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,719
You are laughing at

597
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,840
my feeling sorry for myself alone.

598
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,880
Reaping what I sowed.

599
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,639
In your mind,

600
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,480
I am only a person

601
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,679
who will do anything for his goals.

602
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,159
Right?

603
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,199
If I say no,

604
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,159
will I seem too hypocritical?

605
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,480
You are frank indeed.

606
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:53,280
This world

607
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,360
is preposterous anyway.

608
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,559
Yes.

609
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,280
Power and status

610
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,400
can't be exchanged

611
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,159
with virtue and morality.

612
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,360
Those innocent men of virtue

613
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,760
will only die
on the road to enlightenment.

614
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,440
While Your Highness

615
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,960
is the one who makes history.

616
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,639
So absurd.

617
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,199
I think it's absurd as well.

618
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,239
During these years, I took them

619
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,119
wherever I went.

620
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,119
Thinking that Second Brother and I

621
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,519
are striving for our common ideal

622
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,639
in the harsh situation

623
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,159
together,

624
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,639
I won't feel tired any longer.

625
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,599
Your Highness.

626
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,800
Although

627
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,119
His Highness Prince Qing

628
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,360
does go too far sometimes,

629
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,159
he always treats you well.

630
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,480
I am done with him.

631
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:05,840
But you look like

632
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,679
you still care about

633
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,559
His Highness Prince Qing.

634
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,920
Because I respect him
like he is my father.

635
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,599
So, I can't lie to myself.

636
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,360
If he walks a right path,

637

even with trials and tribulations ahead.

640
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,280
But nowadays,

641
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,880
he is no different

642
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,800
from devils and demons.

00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,079
I still remembered

646
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,719
I asserted to you this morning

647
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,079
that Ninth Brother treated me

648
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,360
differently from others for sure.

649
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,700
♪To be a king and to lose

650

651
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,239
I know it well.

652
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,440
It's really tough

653
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,079
to tread this road.

654
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,559
But I didn't expect

655
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:17,719
Ninth Brother to be so brutal.

656
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,000
With Mu Chuan's character,

657
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,639
even if he doesn't walk this road,

658
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:25,880
it's hard for him to benefit you.

659
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,440

666
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,599
And have never thought about

in this world,

677
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,840

I depend upon Your Highness.

How will I divide the cake?

685
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,119
It's up to you.

686
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,840
Lu Anran, you are so intelligent.

687

But I tell you

688
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,760
I have heard so many

such smart words.

690

I have had enough.

691
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,480
Ninth Borther is silly instead.

692
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,840
He would give me the whole cake.

693
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,039
And told me

694
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,920
he still got one.

695
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,800

have the cake without worries.

When I saw him,

698
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,760
he almost died of starvation.

699
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:51,559
So, I determined

700
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,679
I want nothing from him.

701
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,800
And for this life,

702
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,079
I won't allow anyone to hurt him.
