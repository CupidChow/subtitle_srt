2
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,120
Your Highness,

3
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,480
Ms. Lu went shopping

4
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
a few days ago,

5
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,439
and bought a dress.

6
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,400
Then went back to the mansion
in less than an hour.

7
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,640
Shopping?

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,439
Yes.

9
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,319
Did you keep looking at her

10
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,640
all the time?

11
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,200
When she was in the shop,

12
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Ms. Lu and the shopkeeper

13
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,959
went to the back room to try on the clothes.

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,239
It's inconvenient for me to enter.

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,159
How is it going with Prince Yi?

16
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,040
Everyone in Prince Yi's Mansion

17
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,280
is busy preparing for

18
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,920
the Lighting Ceremony.

19
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,159
There are a lot of goods
coming in and out of the mansion,

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,400
One of which is very suspicious.

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,520
What is it?

22
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,560
Phosphor powder.

23
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,280
It is transported

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,439
with the lanterns.

25
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,840
I've sent people

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,159
to keep an eye on them.

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,439
It seems that Prince Yi

28
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,919
has run out of patience.

29
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,719
He wants to attack ninth brother

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,560
at the Lighting Ceremony.

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,080
Your Highness, what about us?

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,759
If his methods

33
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,639
can work,

34
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
I would have been killed long ago.

35
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,639
However,

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,719
it's rare for him to bother.

37
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,639
In that case,

38
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,919
I can make use of it.

39
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,080
Yes.

40
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,599
Father,

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,439
this is?

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,039
Have a seat.

43
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,039
These are your favorites.

44
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,919
So I asked the Imperial Kitchen to cook.

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,120
You

46
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,000
haven't had dinner with me for a long time.

47
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,919
By the way,

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
the melon from Myanmar.

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,280
I asked them to pick the best.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,800
You can try it first.

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,039
Thank you, Father.

52
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,159
What?

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
Doesn't it taste good?

54
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,159
It's delicious.

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,400
Greet Your Highness.

56
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,879
I'll take my leave now.

57
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,719
This is for you.

58
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,839
The account book of Prince Qing's Mansion.

59
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,279
Xiao Jingque exists in name only now.

60
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,519
I'll leave these accounts

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,000
to you.

62
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,120
No, I can't.

63
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,360
Don't refuse.

64
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,319
It's New Year's Eve tonight.

65
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,639
I'm going back to the palace

66
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,879
to stay with my father for the New Year.

67
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,759
So I can't accompany you today.

68
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,079
Okay.

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,839
Follow me.

70
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,920
It's all for you.

71
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,720
Like it?

72
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,040
You may leave now.

73
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,600
Yes.

74
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,319
You didn't leave with ninth brother

75
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,399
but chose to stay that day.

76
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,639
I hope you can take this place

77
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,120
as your home.

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,519
And treat me

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,759
as your family, too.

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,160
Anran,

81
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,959
Father has always hated me.

82
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,000
And now ninth brother

83
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,839
has left me too.

84
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,879
You will never betray me,

85
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,120
right?

86
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,120
Your Highness,

87
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,160
what's wrong with you today?

88
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,639
Maybe I feel a little emotional

89
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,839
when it comes to festivals.

90
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,879
Anran,

91
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,720
don't go anywhere.

92
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,160
Wait for me.

93
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,240
I believe

94
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,040
a good day for you and me

95
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
will be here soon.

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,000
Wait for me, okay?

97
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,959
Miss,

98
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,639
it's time to eat.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,560
Miss.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Miss.

101
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,279
What are you doing?

102
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,720
Half a month ago, the mansion

103
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
bought 600 kilo muskmelons from Myanmar.

104
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,839
But why did they buy so many?

105
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,600
He has always been thrifty.

106
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,079
In the past festivals,

107
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,560
even if it needs money,

108
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,000
he never spent so much.

109
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,199
It's reasonable if it's
gold, silver, and jade.

110
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,319
Why did he buy so many melons?

111
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,399
Speaking of this,

112
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,600
I remember that

113
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
the brothers at the wharf recently

114
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,639
complained to me that

115
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,720
Prince Yi bought some melons from Myanmar

116
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,040
for Lighting Ceremony.

117
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,480
It's really strange.

118
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,319
What?

119
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,000
- Your Excellency Wu.
- Your Excellency Wu.

120
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,920
Your Highness Prince Qi.

121
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,360
How have you been?

122
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,519
Your Highness, the poison
has been put into the lantern.

123
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,519
As long as Prince Qi lights the light,

124
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,639
he will inhale it into the body.

125
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,360
In less than two hours,

126
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,800
ninth brother will be dead.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,799
Your Highness, wait and see.

128
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,080
Your Highness Prince Qing.

129
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,159
Your Highness Prince Qing.

130
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,960
Everything is ready,

131
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,399
Your Highness. Be careful.

132
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,759
6,000 kilo fireworks.

133
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,559
Miss.

134
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,399
The gunpowder in the fireworks is all gone.

135
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,200
Prince Qing wants to?

136
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,480
Want to rebel for real?

137
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,279
No way.

138
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,679
I must go to the palace.

139
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,960
Give me your badge for entering the palace.

140
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,919
What are you going to do?

141
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,279
Mu Ze rebels.

142
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,120
His Majesty is here.

143
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,840
Long live Your Majesty!

144
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,840
The Lighting Ceremony starts now.

145
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,720
Please light the lights.

146
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,679
Stop!

147
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:56,600
Due to something in the mansion,

148
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,080
I couldn't make it to the ceremony in time.

149
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,039
Please let me in.

150
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,120
All right. Go in.

151
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,639
Your Majesty. The lights are up.

152
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,480
Your Highness Prince Qi,

153
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,879
please light the lamp eye.

154
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,919
God bless Dahan.

155
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,559
Wish Dahan good luck in the coming year.

156
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,240
Peace for all seasons.

157
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,039
May Dahan have good luck in the coming year.

158
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,679
Peace for all seasons.

159
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,120
May Dahan have good luck in the coming year.

160
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,519
Peace for all seasons.

161
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,799
May Dahan have good luck in the coming year.

162
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,320
Peace for all seasons.

163
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,639
Peace for all seasons.

164
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,919
Now that the poison

165
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,279
has already been in Prince Qi's body.

166
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,600
After we light the candles,

167
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,799
kindle the phosphorus powder.

168
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,960
Then the whole light array

169
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,559
will burn up and he'll die without proof.

170
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,879
We need to be closer to Father.

171
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,120
Or we may get myself into trouble.

172
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,240
Your Highness Prince Qing.

173
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,080
Excuse me, everyone.

174
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:33,840
Please.

175
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,759
Your Highness Prince Qing.

176
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,120
Good luck in the Spring Festival.

177
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,120
I wonder

178
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,320
whether I can have a word with you?

179
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,679
Okay.

180
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,240
Excuse me,

181
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,039
we'll leave now.

182
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,480
Excuse me.

183
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:10,960
New Year's Eve this year

184
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,840
is different from previous years.

185
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,559
We can't go home to eat dumplings,

186
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,559
because

187
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,120
we have to stay with Father tonight.

188
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,919
It's fine.

189
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,159
Let's meet again some other day.

190
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,399
Your Highness Prince Qing,

191
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,120
I still have some things to deal with.

192
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:28,519
I'll go now.

193
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,720
Run!

194
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,880
Fire!

195
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,920
Run!

196
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,720
Put out the fire!

197
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,920
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

198
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,559
You'd better leave.

199
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,400
No.

200
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:56,960
Your Majesty.

201
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
I'd like to see

202
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,920
what on earth they're up to.

203
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,799
Help!

204
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,640
Run!

205
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,839
Put out the fire!

206
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,039
Father!

207
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,000
Father!

208
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,960
Ninth brother,

209
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,880
don't go there.

210
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,279
Protect Father!

211
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:33,640
Ninth Brother, be careful!

212
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:51,799
Father!

213
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,359
Fourth Brother.

214
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,039
Do you know why

215
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:21,920
Prince Yi died?

216
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,400
Because he knew

217
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,519
the lantern would fall in advance.

218
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,799
He hid beside Father.

219
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,799
Do you know why he knew

220
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,200
the lantern would fall?

221
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,680
Because he put phosphorus powder and poison

222
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,920
in your lantern.

223
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,319
He tried to poison you to death.

224
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,240
But I changed the poison.

225
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,440
You know all this?

226
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:49,640
Yes.

227
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,319
I know all of it.

228
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,079
Why didn't you stop him?

229
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,359
If I stop him,

230
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,039
from making such a scene,

231
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,160
how can I blow Father and him up?

232
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,559
Then why did you save me?

233
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,319
I promised you,

234
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,279
I won't let anyone

235
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,000
hurt you in this life.

236
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,440
Including myself.

237
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,039
Don't move.

238
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,640
Don't move.

239
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,160
Don't move.

240
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
What on earth is going on?

241
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,480
Everyone has seen

242
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,359
there is a sudden accident
at the Lighting Ceremony.

243
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,039
Father died unfortunately.

244
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,440
His Majesty has passed away.

245
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:17,640
Your Majesty.

246
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,839
And Prince Yi

247
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,279
has passed away as well.

248
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,680
But the foundation of the Great Han Dynasty,

249
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,640
cannot be shaken.

250
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,039
So,

251
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,400
the most important thing right now

252
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,440
is to support the new emperor.

253
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,200
Announce it to the world on another day.

254
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,039
Everyone,

255
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,079
what do you think?

256
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,319
Prince Qing is gorgeous

257
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,599
with both talent and morality.

258
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,440
In the time of stress,

259
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,200
and the nation is in turmoil,

260
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,359
Your Highness Prince Qing

261
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,880
please put the country first.

262
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,880
Bold anti-thief.

263
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:49,319
You are really my good son.

264
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,599
Your Highness Prince Qing.

265
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,200
Father.

266
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,279
Mu Ze.

267
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,519
That day in the main hall,

268
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,519
I let you off the hook.

269
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,720
I didn't expect you to be ungrateful.

270
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,680
You're so ambitious.

271
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,519
If I had known today,

272
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,920
I should have killed you then.

273
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,640
Grateful?

274
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,680
What do you want me to thank you for?

275
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,920
Thank you for humiliating me,

276
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,079
forcing me to poison

277
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,160
the woman I love.

278
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,480
Or thank you for

279
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,079
giving me peace for a while

280
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,720
like giving alms to beggars?

281
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,240
If you hadn't done all the tricks,

282
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
and been so scrupulous,

283
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,359
how could it be like this today?

284
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,839
It's all because of you!

285
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,279
No one is born to

286
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,160
rebel.

287
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,400
I used to be passionate,

288
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,039
and wanted to be loyal to my country.

289
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,839
You're the one who misunderstands me.

290
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,119
In your eyes,

291
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,440
everything I do is wrong!

292
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,200
But you forgot one thing!

293
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,200
I'm just like him,

294
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,119
we are all your sons!

295
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,640
We're all your natural sons!

296
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,640
But why did you insult me?

297
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,440
Nonsense!

298
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,599
You traitor! Traitor!

299
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,200
Mu Chuan.

300
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,800
Mu Chuan.

301
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,720
Anran.

302
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,039
Second Brother!

303
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,160
Shut up!

304
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,279
Guards!

305
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,160
Kill him on the spot!

306
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,440
Your Majesty.

307
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,759
Do you have someone

308
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,720
you want to protect before?

309
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,480
I have.

310
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,039
I have the one whom

311
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,559
I need to try my best to protect.

312
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,680
Let them go.

313
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,519
Get out of the way.

314
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:33,880
Get out of the way!

315
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,240
Your Majesty.

316
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,559
Is there any problems?

317
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,599
After investigation,

318
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,240
the muskmelon Prince Qi ate

319
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,920
has the smell of gunpowder.

320
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,480
It's Prince Qing.

321
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,839
He replaced the muskmelon

322
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,319
Prince Yi sent to the palace,

323
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,559
and put the gunpowder into it.

324
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,640
Now,

325
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,519
the gunpowder is buried under the table.

326
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,519
Xiao Jingque!

327
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,400
Let's go.

328
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,279
Let's go.

329
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,440
Xiao Jingque!

330
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,720
There's no time. Come with me.

331
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,039
Mu Ze.

332
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,279
Where else do you want to escape to?

333
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,480
You did all the tricks,

334
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,599
but you ended up harming everyone.

335
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,319
This is your retribution.

336
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,160
No matter what happens,

337
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,720
come with me first.

338
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,519
Don't come over.

339
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,920
Leave with you?

340
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,640
And being labeled as an anti-thief,

341
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,279
hiding for the rest of our life?

342
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
Don't forget.

343
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,720
Our Xiao family

344
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,880
are all loyal.

345
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,559
How could I

346
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,519
humiliate the family,

347
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,440
and shame the ancestors and sects.

348
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,559
But don't you forget

349
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,720
you're still pregnant.

350
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,880
Don't come near me!

351
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,720
The child

352
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,880
is also the descendant of the Xiao family.

353
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,119
How could he be willing

354
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,720
to be labeled as an anti-thief

355
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,839
when he is born?

356
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:52,799
Mu Ze,

357
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,119
my whole life

358
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,000
is ruined by you.

359
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,599
The entire Xiao family

360
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,759
paid a painful price

361
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,240
because of my stupidity.

362
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,039
When I loved you sincerely,

363
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,960
you trampled my feelings on the ground.

364
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,640
And now because of the baby

365
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,680
I have,

366
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,119
you become so pretentious.

367
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,799
It really makes me sick.

368
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:18,920
Your Highness,

369
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,240
if we don't leave now,
the pursuing forces will come soon.

370
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:24,680
Before I die,

371
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,799
I can still see

372
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,240
your failure.

373
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,039
I have no regrets in my life.

374
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,240
Xiao Jingque.

375
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,759
Xiao Jingque!

376
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:42,880
Xiao Jingque!

377
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,460
(Mansion of Prince Qing)

378
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,359
Stay alert at all times.

379
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:06,160
Yes.

380
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,279
Lu Anran,

381
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,079
why did you betray me?

382
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,279
How did Your Highness know?

383
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,160
Using trying on clothes as an excuse

384
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,680
to avoid Nanxing.

385
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,000
It's really a good idea.

386
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,720
It's a pity that the bones of

387
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,880
that shopkeeper are not tough enough.

388
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,200
She confessed everything after a few hits.

389
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,440
So the account book

390
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,240
was also left by you to test me,

391
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,119
right?

392
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:50,880
Yes.

393
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,839
I just want to give it a try.

394
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,119
I want to know

395
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:57,359
when ninth brother was in danger,

396
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,279
will you risk your life

397
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,119
to save him.

398
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,279
But the truth turns out that

399
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,440
it's better not to try.

400
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,240
I was thinking

401
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,639
if you're willing to lie to me,

402
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,039
I wish you could

403
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,360
lie to me for the rest of your life.

404
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:14,599
Let me live in

405
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,800
a beautiful deception all my life.

406
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,000
I'm willing to be cheated.

407
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,239
Since you and ninth brother love each other,

408
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,079
why did you marry me?

409
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,960
You could have run away with him

410
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,159
and left here.

411
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,280
Why did you come back?

412
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,559
What on earth are you doing this for?

413
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,239
Because what I once cherished

414
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,079
was also destroyed by you.

415
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,039
Your mother's death is an accident.

416
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,280
As for your father,

417
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,440
you fooled me first.

418
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:57,039
I marry you into Prince Qing's Mansion,

419
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,440
and treat you sincerely.

420
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,559
Why do you hate me so much?

421
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,559
From the very beginning,

422
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:07,960
you've been scheming against
me and the Lu family.

423
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,599
Now you're asking me,

424
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,159
why don't I have any sincerity?

425
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:13,840
Mu Ze,

426
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,599
you're so ridiculous.

427
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,559
That's the look in your eyes.

428
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,960
Since we met in Su City,

429
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,559
you use this look to see me.

430
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,000
What are you looking at?

431
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,239
Do you really want to know?

432
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,280
What on earth are you looking at?

433
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:43,719
You are a man who can do whatever

434
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,400
to get to a high position.

435
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,679
I just want to see how you fail.

436
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,119
Because you don't deserve that position.

437
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,000
I don't deserve that position?

438
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,840
You mean Mu Chuan is a good match,

439
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,039
right?

440
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:04,920
We just have

441
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,639
the different background.

442
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,000
Father prefers him,

443
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,239
so do you!

444
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,639
Mu Ze,

445
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,119
since you handed me

446
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,280
that poisoned wine.

447
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,480
You should know that

448
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,199
he is different from you.

449
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,679
I don't have a choice!

450
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,239
You think I don't want to be like him?

451
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,639
Become a handsome gentleman.

452
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,320
I also want to walk

453
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,480
confidently in the world

454
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,880
without shame and guilty.

455
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,679
But what I did

456
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,760
is just a copycat

457
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,199
in Father's eyes.

458
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,800
You thought you have no choice.

459
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,280
The truth is you choose

460
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,719
power and desire every time.

461
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,840
You hurt others and kill people.

462
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,239
It's all your choice.

463
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,760
Fate is a cruel joke.

464
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,960
You want those who don't love you

465
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,440
to be sincere to you.

466
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,519
Xiao Jingque loves you that much,

467
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,199
but you abandoned her like nothing.

468
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,239
Mu Ze,

469
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,440
you're so pitiful

470
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,840
like a beggar now.

471
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:57,960
Shut up!

472
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,840
Don't you know

473
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,000
what will happen

474
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,880
if you really piss off a man.

475
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,440
I know I won't have your heart

476
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,400
in my life.

477
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,039
But today, your body

478
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:09,840
is mine.

479
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,119
It must be mine!

480
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,880
(No matter how lowly I am,)

481
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,119
(it's you that gave birth to me.)

482
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,280
(I'm the same as ninth brother.)

483
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,360
(I'm also your child.)

484
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,519
(Why do you look down on me like that?)

485
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,480
Father,

486
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,679
I just found a chamber of secrets

487
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,079
in the study of

488
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,360
Prince Qing's Mansion.

489
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,039
I've already brought the stuff.

490
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,159
If it's something

491
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,599
outrageous,

492
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,599
then don't show it to me.

493
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,480
Let him be.

494
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,840
Bring it here.

495
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,000
These should belong to

496
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,599
Second Brother's biological mother.

497
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,559
Set up a mourning hall,

498
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,360
and worship her secretly.

499
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,800
Unfilial son.

500
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,199
He tried his best

501
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,559
to collect evidence of corruption

502
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:25,800
of officials from various departments.

503
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,719
It's nothing more than

504
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,079
threatening them to form an alliance.

505
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,880
Second Brother handed over them

506
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,239
to the ministries according to the law.

507
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,000
But Prince Yi has so many eyes and ears.

508
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:38,360
The evidence gradually

509
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:39,840
becomes useless.
