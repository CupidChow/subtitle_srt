2
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Mr. and Mrs. Lu.

3
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,000
Mr. Cai.

4
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,879
What's special

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,000
about today?

6
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,719
We're here for the proposal.

7
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,239
Proposal?

8
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:06,760
Sit.

9
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,400
Someone

10
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,280
get me Xinran.

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,280
Have a seat.

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,360
Mrs. Lu.

13
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,039
Mr. Cai.

14
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Have a cup of tea.

15
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,759
Come here.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,879
Mr. Cai.

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,120
What a surprise.

18
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,960
Yesterday

19
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,520
you mentioned something important

20
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,080
and it turned out to be the proposal.

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,240
Mrs. and Miss.

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,639
Today I'm here

24
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,439
to propose on behalf of Prince Qing.

25
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,639
Prince Qing.

26
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,879
Propose to whom?

27
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,719
If I understand it right,

28
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,080
it's me.

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,960
Anran?

30
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,319
Anran.

31
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,719
Are you confused?

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,960
Made a mistake?

33
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,159
No.

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm proposing to her.

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,919
Anran.

36
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,800
Isn't he the bodyguard

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,680
of Mr. Cai?

38
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,680
Mrs. Lu.

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,319
His Highness came to Su City

40
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,199
in disguise.

41
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,039
Low-profile.

42
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,919
So he pretended to be a bodyguard

43
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,000
to avoid attention.

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,919
This is Prince Qing.

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,120
Prince Qing.

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,080
Mr. and Mrs. Lu.

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,000
Lu Anran and I were each other's

48
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,919
love at first sight.

49
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,280
Hope you can

50
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,439
let her

51
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,719
marry me.

52
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,599
Prince Qing

53
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,199
likes our daughter.

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,639
It makes us proud.

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,199
But

56
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,039
she always

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,120
makes her own decisions.

58
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,960
We need to hear

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,280
her opinion.

60
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,280
Father, mother.

61
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,919
I would like to marry him.

62
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,400
Anran.

63
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,280
It's no small thing.

64
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,680
You've made up your mind?

65
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,879
Mother.

66
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,319
Father.

67
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,759
I would like to marry Prince Qing.

68
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,079
And accompany him all life

69
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,639
whatever happens.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
(Dahan River Map)

71
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,000
Father.

72
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,639
Father. Look.

73
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,920
If our Lu Family wants to
expand the canals,

74
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,319
the 36 ports

75
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,519
are far from enough.

76
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,839
Here.

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
Here, and here.

78
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,560
We should set up ports
as soon as possible.

79
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,959
Before other

80
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,920
trading companies do.

81
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,040
Anran.

82
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
the business we have today

83
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,000
is enough for me.

84
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,879
I only hope

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
our family

86
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,480
is safe.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,800
Father.

88
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,480
I know what you want to say

89
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,480
and what you're worried about.

90
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,639
Then why...

91
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,319
Ferocious predators

92
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,680
don't give up hunting

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,839
because the prey runs away.

94
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,600
It stimulates

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,959
their desire to conquer instead.

96
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,439
Father, rest assured.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,519
I know what I'm doing.

98
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,560
Now

99
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,120
we have the best option before us

100
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,639
to keep our family safe

101
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,879
and get rid of this conundrum.

102
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,439
You've always been a free spirit.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
I believe you.

104
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,000
I just hope

105
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,240
you'll take good care of yourself.

106
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,319
If it's too dangerous,

107
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,959
remember

108
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,199
the whole Lu Family

109
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,160
is at your back.

110
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,079
We can always fight it out, anyway.

111
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,279
Thank you, father.

112
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,839
Crying. Crying.

113
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,000
All you do is crying.

114
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,920
When they get married,

115
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,879
Lu Anran will be a royal member

116
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,000
and forever be a higher class than us.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,519
I know.

118
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,959
You like Mr. Cai.

119
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,079
If Lu Anran

120
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,600
marries his bodyguard,

121
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,399
I won't say anything.

122
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
But now,

123
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,160
it means you'll be lower than her.

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,680
How can I have the peace of mind

125
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,959
if you marry him?

126
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,959
What else can I do?

127
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,600
Prince Qing

128
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,759
proposed to her today

129
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,120
in front of everyone.

130
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,120
Do you think he wants to marry her

131
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,439
because they love each other?

132
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,759
Why else?

133
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,000
Prince Qing tried hard

134
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,160
to make Lu Anran like him.

135
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,800
Playing the bodyguard

136
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,519
to approach her.

137
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,560
Could he really be attracted

138
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,040
to her looks?

139
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,199
It's the Double Fish Order

140
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,040
and the Lu Family that attracted him.

141
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,680
But Prince Qing

142
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,959
for whatever reasons

143
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:39,920
is going to

144
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,439
marry her.

145
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,639
Now that he is not

146
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,319
falling for Lu Anran.

147
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,439
Say,

148
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,959
if the Lu Family

149
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,600
has only one daughter and that's you,

150
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,720
how would he choose?

151
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,079
Mother.

152
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,000
Miss.

153
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,720
The Ninth Prince has been waiting.

154
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,759
The Lu Family is indeed wealthy.

155
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,240
I almost lost my way

156
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,160
in this big courtyard.

157
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,480
If you did,

158
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,160
how did you not

159
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,240
get lost in the Imperial Palace

160
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,399
when back to your room every night?

161
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,480
You'll know when you're there.

162
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,759
It looks huge.

163
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,399
But everyone is actually

164
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,759
bound up in a small place.

165
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,000
And can't move.

166
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,399
You know.

167
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,080
I met Second brother yesterday.

168
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,879
What's wrong?

169
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,840
You look a bit upset.

170
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,799
Just hard to believe

171
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,039
that someone like you

172
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,759
is willing to be trapped there.

173
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,559
Must love my Second brother so much

174
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,399
to make such a sacrifice.

175
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,399
He's lucky.

176
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,919
Though I'm willing,

177
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,399
it doesn't mean

178
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,240
I have any true feelings for him.

179
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,639
Just a transaction.

180
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,039
A transaction?

181
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,960
No.

182
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,639
For what reasons?

183
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,519
Why exchange something

184
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,360
with your happiness?

185
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,080
I used to believe

186
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,799
that as long as the Lus
don't take a side,

187
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,120
we can stay out of it.

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
The fact is, I'm too silly.

189
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,440
Managing such
developed water transport

190
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,600
means the Lu Family

191
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,840
is putting itself in danger.

192
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,080
No other choice.

193
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,159
If I don't choose him,

194
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,159
should I choose Prince Yi instead?

195
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,240
What about Second brother?

196
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,480
Does he not have true feelings?

197
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,679
The heart of a ruler

198
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,840
is the coldest.

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,320
He has chosen a path

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,480
that allows for no feelings.

201
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,960
How can there be no other choice?

202
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,759
No, there isn't.

203
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Is this for me?

204
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,879
What?

205
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,919
You also think

206
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,480
I'm just

207
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,720
a tacky person?

208
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
Don't want to be my friend?

209
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,879
No, no.

210
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,679
It's a wedding gift.

211
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,200
For you.

212
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,039
Here you are.

213
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,679
This bracelet

214
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,240
is exquisite.

215
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,000
I had little time

216
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,360
so I bought it

217
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,799
in a random store in Su City.

218
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,480
Hope you'll like it.

219
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,840
The South is famous for silverware.

220
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,759
When I was there,

221
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,960
I helped an old monk

222
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,360
manage his field properties.

223
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,960
He gave me this.

224
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,960
And said it can keep one safe.

225
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,799
Why is he lying?

226
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,039
Well,

227
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,759
time to say goodbye.

228
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,480
OK.

229
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:39,960
Anran.

230
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
If there's anything you need,

231
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,679
I can help you, too.

232
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,000
I know.

233
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,039
Thank you for your wedding gift.

234
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,799
I'll cherish it.

235
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,519
Your Highness.

236
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,519
Your Highness.

237
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,559
The rain's too heavy.

238
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,639
Take an umbrella.

239
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,480
Your Highness.

240
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,200
Your Highness.

241
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,000
Your Highness.

242
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,240
Miss.

243
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,639
Has he left?

244
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,200
Yes.

245
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,759
Miss.

246
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,600
His Highness seems worried for you.

247
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,399
If he knows your trouble,

248
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,360
he'll probably try everything
he can to help you.

249
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,080
The less he knows, the better.

250
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,600
When I return to Hanjing,

251
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,600
I'll ask Father

252
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,799
to get us married.

253
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,720
It's not easy

254
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,799
to get him to agree.

255
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,960
Take care.

256
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,480
The wedding is in half a year.

257
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,919
Before that,

258
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,440
we must clear things up

259
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,320
in our house.

260
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,279
Miss.

261
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,399
You're checking all the ledgers

262
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,600
in broad daylight.

263
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,480
Isn't it a bit obvious?

264
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,919
If I don't,

265
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,360
how can I force them

266
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,279
to reveal themselves?

267
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,279
Miss. Look.

268
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:28,879
Miss.

269
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,360
Your sister asked me to

270
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,919
send Yipintang rouge to you.

271
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:36,840
OK.

272
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,039
She must be

273
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,480
up to no good.

274
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,200
Don't accept it.

275
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,320
Why not? It's a gift.

276
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,759
At least you should know

277
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,320
what exactly

278
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,240
she's up to.

279
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,919
Right?

280
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,480
OK. I'll go take it.

281
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,440
Hold on.

282
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,919
Smile. Be friendly.

283
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:01,840
Coming.

284
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,440
Miss.

285
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,920
Let me take a look.

286
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,359
Miss.

287
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,119
I used to work at a pharmacy.

288
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,200
I know something about medicine.

289
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,599
There is castor in it.

290
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,000
Though it's not lethal,

291
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,160
if you use it for a long period,

292
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,480
your face will be ruined.

293
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,720
I knew it.

294
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,079
Anran.

295
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,400
Mother is here.

296
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,079
Dongqing, Lingxi.

297
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,079
Put away the ledgers.

298
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,240
Yes.

299
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,480
Anran.

300
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,119
Mother, you're here.

301
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,720
I made

302
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,279
your favorite walnut cookies.

303
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,319
Have it later.

304
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,559
Thank you, Mother.

305
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,599
I'll have it later.

306
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,799
You look better now.

307
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,799
Are you still coughing?

308
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
No, I'm feeling better.

309
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:05,920
I have been taking the medicine

310
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,240
you gave me.

311
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,920
And pretend to be coughing
in front of Liu,

312
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,680
as you told me to.

313
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,880
Medicine from her

314
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,920
was dumped into the flower pot.

315
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,000
Good.

316
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,400
Oh.

317
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,240
I heard Liu

318
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,799
sent you

319
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,400
lots of things

320
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,599
as gifts for your marriage.

321
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,240
Yes, Madam.

322
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,200
Just now

323
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,319
she sent poisonous rouge here.

324
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,519
Poisonous rouge?

325
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,319
Look, Madam.

326
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,759
This vicious woman.

327
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,720
No. Take this.

328
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,440
Let's go to your father

329
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,240
right now.

330
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,880
Mother, mother.

331
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,119
No need to hurry.

332
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,640
Liu and her daughter

333
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,039
are best at playing the victim.

334
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,319
Father will forgive them.

335
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,079
I already have an idea.

336
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,920
You can just wait and see.

337
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,480
Mother.

338
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,279
It's been seven, eight days.

339
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,599
Why it is nothing happened

340
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,759
to Lu Anran?

341
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,319
How...

342
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:55,039
How did Aunt Cui take care of it?

343
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,880
It's strange.

344
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,960
Shen Lanxi

345
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,920
looks better these days.

346
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,559
But she's still coughing a lot.

347
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,759
Something's off.

348
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:13,960
She's not as close to me

349
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,000
as she used to.

350
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,559
Did Lu Anran find anything?

351
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,799
I heard

352
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,319
she sent maids to

353
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,559
check the expenditure of every one.

354
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,599
I don't think anything's gone wrong.

355
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,319
I greeted her today.

356
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,359
And saw the bodhisattva figure

357
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,680
being worshipped there as usual.

358
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,359
Second Madam. Second Madam.

359
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,880
First Madam is investigating
the entire house.

360
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,240
She took Aunt Cui.

361
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
What is this?

362
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,519
Second Madam

363
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,319
sent lots of rouge over.

364
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,400
I broke it accidently.

365
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,279
So I asked the person at the rouge store

366
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,119
to put it back together.

367
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,480
But she said

368
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,440
the rouge had a strange smell

369
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:03,720
and believed

370
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,599
there's castor in it.

371
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,200
Castor is poison.

372
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,519
Why do you want to harm Anran?

373
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,000
It's impossible. Sister.

374
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,480
Why would I?

375
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,200
I see her

376
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,960
as my own daughter.

377
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,519
Mother.

378
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,680
I don't think Second Madam

379
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,559
would do that.

380
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,839
It must be Aunt Cui

381
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,000
who did it in secret.

382
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,119
Right?

383
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,039
I checked the ledgers lately.

384
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,039
And found Aunt Cui had kept some money

385
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,119
to herself while buying things.

386
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,920
This is nothing big.

387
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,400
I don't want to do anything with you.

388
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,680
But why do you hate me so?

389
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,839
Aunt Cui.

390
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,599
You're an old maid here.

391
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,960
As long as you tell us

392
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
who asked you

393
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,319
to do this,

394
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,119
I will let you off.

395
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,799
Aunt Cui.

396
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,160
How can you poison Anran?

397
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:55,960
You should know

398
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,680
that Xinran and I

399
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,640
sent it to Anran.

400
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,400
How are Sister and Anran

401
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,839
going to think about us

402
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:05,799
now that you did this?

403
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
Yes. Aunt Cui.

404
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,319
She's my sister.

405
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,440
How can you harm her?

406
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,519
Yes.

407
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,799
I tried to harm Miss.

408
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,160
She checked my spending first.

409
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,799
I bought the rouge

410
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,920
and put in grounded castor.

411
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,400
I want to poison her

412
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,319
and stop her from investigating.

413
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:42,920
Aunt Cui.

414
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,079
Do you know

415
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,920
what punishment you'll receive

416
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,839
once you confess?

417
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,039
I'm asking you one last time.

418
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,279
Did anyone ask you to do this?

419
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,079
No need to ask again.

420
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,319
I did it

421
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:58,000
all by myself.

422
00:21:58,839 --> 00:21:59,839
No one else was involved.

423
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,680
Aunt Cui

424
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,440
took cash from the family

425
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,599
in the name of buying supplies.

426
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,720
To hide the misdeed,

427
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,759
she even poisoned the First Daughter.

428
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,079
Afterwards

429
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,559
she showed no regret.

430
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,200
She should be subject to the family rule

431
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,039
and take fifty bludgeonings.

432
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,240
Yes.

433
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,599
She knew it.

434
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
She knew it all.

435
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,640
She knew everything.

436
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,119
Mother.

437
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,799
If it was someone else that got caught,

438
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,920
we would have been revealed.

439
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,200
Lu Anran

440
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,079
didn't really want to check the ledgers.

441
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,039
She just

442
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,359
used it as an excuse

443
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,839
to drag us down.

444
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,519
Even if she didn't succeed,

445
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,599
she gave us a warning.

446
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,720
She and her mother

447
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,000
has declared hostility towards us.

448
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,240
But now that they are prepared,

449
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,279
it'll be harder

450
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,240
for us

451
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,599
to do something.

452
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,440
Mother, what do we do?

453
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,319
What do we do?

454
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,519
You panic just because of this?

455
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,960
Useless.

456
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,920
I'm worried for Aunt Cui.

457
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,440
She came here with me when I married.

458
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:30,920
I have to

459
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,000
revenge.

460
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,480
Mother.

461
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,519
Xinran.

462
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,480
Remember.

463
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:46,240
You'll be a royal one day.

464
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,519
From now on,

465
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,160
we don't compete with them

466
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,400
in the house.

467
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:59,359
Let them enjoy themselves
for a few more days.

468
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,480
When the wedding day comes,

469
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,519
the Lu Family

470
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,279
will only have one daughter left.

471
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,720
The Double Fish Order will be yours.

472
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,440
Prince Qing

473
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,519
will be yours as well.

474
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,400
(The war in the North)

475
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,240
The North invaded the border of Dahan.

476
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,599
Mu Ze led an army to fight.

477
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,039
There on the frontline

478
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,039
was a hard battle.

479
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:50,200
After over half a year of battle,

480
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,359
Mu Ze finally came back with victory.

481
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,759
With the victory,

482
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,640
he asked for a wedding.

483
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,000
(Lu's Mansion)

484
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,160
Your Highness.

485
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,319
I still think

486
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,599
that Miss Lu

487
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,799
is only worthy as a concubine.

488
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,240
Your wife should be

489
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
chosen from a more famed family.

490
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,000
A victory for the Lu Family.

491
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,680
It feels not worthwhile.

492
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,400
A victory for the Lu Family
is not worthwhile.

493
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,759
But the Lu Family plus Lu Anran

494
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,799
is worth it.

495
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,200
Your Highness

496
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,839
has fallen in love with her for real?

497
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,039
Dahan has intricate water transport.

498
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,920
As long as we control
the water transport,

499
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,079
we control the lifeblood of Dahan.

500
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,839
Be it military, political,

501
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,119
livelihood, or economical issues,

502
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
everything hinges on the
Lu Family's waterway.

503
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,319
Do you think I'm the same

504
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,440
as Prince Yi?

505
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,559
Short-sighted

506
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,200
and see their money only?

507
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:54,519
No, far from it.

508
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,640
The most important

509
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,000
is the Double Fish Order she owns.

510
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,680
It must be hers for a reason.

511
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,799
Based on her understanding of ships,

512
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,160
she must be able

513
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,759
to improve on battleships.

514
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,319
If she can assist me,

515
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,119
the victory this time

516
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,200
would be small.

517
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,400
How wise.

518
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,119
I'm short-sighted indeed.

519
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,839
You must be tired all the way here.

520
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,920
Please take this.

521
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,440
Thank you.

522
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,680
Prince Qing

523
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,039
is so in love with Miss.

524
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,079
He put himself in danger in the North,

525
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,839
only to make you

526
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,440
his rightful Princess.

527
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,480
He even argued at the court

528
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,880
with His Majesty for you.

529
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,279
Miss.

530
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,160
Please don't let him down.

531
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,920
Thank you for your advice.

532
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
Shouldn't be Ninth Prince
here for the proposal?

533
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,359
Isn't he in Su City?

534
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:01,640
Yes, he is.

535
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,680
But he's currently

536
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,519
at a hotel.

537
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,200
He's busy with
preparations for the wedding.

538
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,279
So he didn't come.

539
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,799
Luckily, the sick seedlings
were taken out in time.

540
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,680
All in this batch have sprouted.

541
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,480
It's been sunny these days.

542
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,720
But fortunately, not too hot.

543
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,200
They're growing so well.

544
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,599
Then we can have the peace of mind.

545
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,160
This batch

546
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,720
yielded more rice ears

547
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
than any previous year.

548
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,119
Oh.

549
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,559
The next period is important.

550
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,119
Don't water too much.

551
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,039
Or they'll get suffocated.

552
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,319
Tell you.

553
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,000
It'll be difficult to
handle rotten seedlings.

554
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,960
Yes, yes, yes.

555
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,720
Rice Fragrance Hermit's mind

556
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,880
is on the field the moment he comes.

557
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,400
Rice in Su City

558
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,440
is going to be a harvest this year

559
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,359
thanks to your instructions.

560
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,519
Miss Lu.

561
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,680
Look at this year's rice.

562
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,559
Growing so well.

563
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,720
Can I steal him for a moment,

564
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,400
please?

565
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,559
Of course.

566
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:07,599
I'll leave you.

567
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,920
Su City has

568
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,319
the best possible environment.

569
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,279
Just the right amount of
sunshine and rain.

570
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,559
With frequent trade,

571
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,279
the rice price has been stable.

572
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,200
It must be

573
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,839
thanks to you in a way.

574
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,119
Mu Chuan.

575
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,680
You said I could turn to you

576
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,839
if I needed help.

577
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,160
Is it still effective?

578
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,559
Yes.

579
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,559
Anything you need,

580
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,359
just tell me.

581
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,599
I will do everything I can

582
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,640
if it's within my power.

583
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,200
What is troubling you?

584
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:26,880
Well,

585
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
you've been to

586
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,599
many places these years.

587
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:31,880
You must know

588
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,799
lots of...

589
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,000
Lots of what?

590
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,720
Tell me.

591
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,160
Just tell me.

592
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,799
You're an expert on farming, right?

593
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,680
I want to ask a favor

594
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,480
for the old farmers.

595
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:56,960
Can you come here

596
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,880
every year,

597
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,799
and instruct them?

598
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,519
Just that?

599
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,119
Just that.

600
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,160
I thought it'd be something big.

601
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,359
Su City's environment

602
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:15,119
is suitable for research on
new types of rice.

603
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,519
I wanted to ask you

604
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,119
to talk to the farmers for me.

605
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,599
Let them join me

606
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,599
in the research.

607
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,359
No problem.

608
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,759
I'll make sure of it.

609
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,119
Deal.

610
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,920
It's inappropriate of me.

611
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,920
Your hands

612
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,920
will confer blessings to all people.

613
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,319
How can I tarnish them

614
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,400
with my selfish requests?

615
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,799
Miss.

616
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,519
Did you ask Ninth Prince

617
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:31,319
for the Gelsmium elegans?

618
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,839
I couldn't.

619
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,839
This is special poison.

620
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,079
It's because you were out of your means

621
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,839
that you sought him out.

622
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,720
But the wedding is around the corner.

623
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,319
What are you going to do?

624
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,279
I'll find other means.

625
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,680
As for Mu Chuan,

626
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,079
forget it.

627
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,880
The candle is burning out.

628
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,160
I'll go change one.

629
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,920
Holly, wait.

630
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,279
Put the stand down.

631
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,599
Today's memorable

632
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,680
because I get to see you.

633
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,799
I'd love you

634
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:56,880
always and forever.

635
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,720
What kind of girl do you like?

636
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,119
She's unlike other girls,

637
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:21,920
proper ladies.

638
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,039
She's smart and cute.

639
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,160
When she talks about her ambitions,

640
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,519
her eyes shine.

641
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,079
The first time I met her,

642
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,759
She was gorgeous

643
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,519
in the sun.

Your Highness.

659
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,719
Holly.

660
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:48,880
It's late.

661
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,360
Anything happened to your Miss?

662
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,639
Please help us.

663
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,000
Find Gelsmium elegans and Snow Cicada.

664
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,800
I'm just a maid

665
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,719
and can offer you nothing.

666
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:57,880
I can only offer my life.

667
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,559
If Your Highness can help us,

668
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,119
I'd do anything.

669
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,159
Get up please.

670
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,559
I don't like other people

671
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:05,440
to kneel and beg me.

672
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,599
Get up.

673
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,159
Your Highness.

674
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,840
I'm a poor person.

675
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
Those bastards

676
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,400
didn't let me go.

677
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,480
I didn't want to

678
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,960
bring trouble to Miss and the Lu Family.

679
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,320
I heard Gelsmium elegans

680
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,639
is very effective.

681
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,199
But if Snow Cicada is taken

682
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,239
within three hours,

683
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,280
it won't cause any harm

684
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,400
to the body.

685
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,639
You want to scare them off with it?

686
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:34,760
Yes.

687
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,199
You want it for yourself?

688
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:41,840
Yes.

689
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,119
You're a bad liar, Holly.

690
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,960
You don't even dare to look at me.

691
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,840
Is there any difficulty for your Miss?

692
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
(Lu's Mansion)

693
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,600
(Lu's Mansion)

694
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,199
Your Highness.

695
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,480
What's wrong?

696
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,199
It's not been a long time.

697
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,119
Yet you don't look like

698
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,719
bold girl in the field anymore.

699
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,559
What?

700
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,920
Why does the bride look sad?

701
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,920
I'm a well-known

702
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,280
delightful face in the Su City.

703
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,840
I have nothing to do with
sadness all my life.

704
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,960
Lu Anran.

705
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,119
If there's a path

706
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:44,920
where you don't have to

707
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,000
sacrifice your happiness

708
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,159
to save your family,

709
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:49,920
will you choose it?

710
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,519
I know

711
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:58,360
you can have both.

712
00:37:59,239 --> 00:37:59,800
So,

713
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,800
I never dreamed about that.

714
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:06,159
You've never thought

715
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,400
I'm a prince, too.

716
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,360
Maybe,

717
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,519
I can help you, too.

718
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,000
Your marry Second Brother

719
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,599
for protecting your family.

720
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,880
But it's difficult to avoid
enemies on the court.

721
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,880
If I ask Father

722
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,760
to let your Lu Family and I

723
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,039
reform the Dahan water transport

724
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:31,920
and expand farmlands,

725
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,239
your family and I would be one.

726
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Even if someone wants

727
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,239
to take a share of the
Lu Family's water transport,

728
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,679
he'll have to

729
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,079
be careful not to offend me.

730
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,840
Then,

731
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:43,119
you can

732
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,199
do what you want.

733
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,000
And I'll solve

734
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:49,400
what troubles you.

735
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,639
If you told me this earlier,

736
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,760
I might have really considered it.

737
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,760
But now

738
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,440
how can I

739
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,800
drag you into this?

740
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,320
Your Highness,

741
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:10,079
are you telling me to go back
on my wedding promise?

742
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:15,840
I just don't want you to

743
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,119
betray your heart.

744
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,079
Easy for Your Highness to say.

745
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,840
Now the Empress's order is here.

746
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,280
If I regret it,

747
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,679
what would happen to my family?

748
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,239
Are you caring for me,

749
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,039
or trying to put me in danger?

750
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,559
Are you serious?

751
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,960
You're from the royal family.

752
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,519
You can follow your heart.

753
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,639
But we're just common people.

754
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:42,800
All we can think about

755
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,239
is how to survive under

756
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,199
the influence of authority.

757
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:45,880
Lu Anran.

758
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,960
If what I said

759
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,519
affronted you,

760
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,320
you can scold me.

761
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,679
You don't have to

762
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,639
make your words as hurtful as a knife.

763
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,960
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

764
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,480
Thanks for reminding me.

765
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,039
But I don't know

766
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,239
what kind of person you are.

767
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,239
What is different between

768
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,519
you and your Second Brother,

769
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,400
or Prince Yi?

770
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,119
You think I'm the same as them.

771
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,320
Want to use your family?

772
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
The blue one is Gelsmium elegans.

773
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,599
The white one is Snow Cicada.

774
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,519
Don't confuse the two.

775
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,599
Miss.

776
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,079
Holly.

777
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,039
You asked him for these?

778
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,000
They are

779
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,599
important to you.

780
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:19,920
I don't want

781
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,920
your plan to fail.

782
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,199
Nor do I wish

783
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,239
you to feel guilty towards him.

784
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:26,559
So I took it upon myself.

785
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,280
You can punish me.

786
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,360
Cut the tie for good.

787
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,840
Let the wish burn to ashes.

788
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,760
Maybe

789
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,360
it's not a bad thing.

790
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,679
Miss, Miss Xinran is here.

791
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,519
Sister, I'm here for you.

792
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,079
OK.

793
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:55,480
Madam.

794
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:56,960
First Madam.

795
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,440
Sister.

796
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,800
Walnut cookies made by Mother.

797
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,039
Come over and have a taste.

798
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:03,599
Come on.

799
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,599
Come on.

800
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:09,760
Have one.

801
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,719
Oh.

802
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,559
You didn't see

803
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:14,400
my wedding gown.

804
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,480
Come and have a look.

805
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:24,079
Sister,

806
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,000
look.

807
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:27,639
It's a wedding gown sent
by the royal family.

808
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,280
I've never seen one.

809
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:31,480
The embroidery. The texture.

810
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:32,920
How amazing!

811
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,920
Sister,

812
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,320
you're lucky.

813
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,360
Sister,

814
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,280
you'll have the same luck.

815
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,280
You two

816
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,480
have a good chat.

817
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,719
I'll go check again

818
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:47,760
the dowry list.

819
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,880
Mother, let me see you out.

820
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:53,840
Sister.

821
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,679
Wait for me there.

822
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:55,360
I'll be right back.

823
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:23,719
Sister.

824
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,440
Have some cookies.

825
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:30,920
Sister.

826
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,360
I had too much at dinner.

827
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:35,159
I can't

828
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,679
eat any more.

829
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:40,119
I'll take a walk in the garden.

830
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,159
It helps with digestion.

831
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,000
These cookies.

832
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:45,199
You can have them all.

833
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:46,800
What a pity.

834
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,639
Enjoy the cookies.

835
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:55,360
Goodbye.

836
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:08,840
Mother.

837
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,920
I saw Lu Anran

838
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,079
eat the cookie.

839
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:14,559
There won't be any problem this time.

840
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,159
Lu Anran is not going to live through tonight.

841
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,719
Tomorrow, you'll be the only daughter

842
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:25,920
of the Lu Family.

843
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,199
Help!

844
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,559
Somebody help!

845
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,280
