2
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,640
Well, it's getting late.

3
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,480
Go back and rest early.

4
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,159
I,

5
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,519
I'm leaving.

6
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,800
Thank you for the fireworks.

7
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,039
This is the most special gift

8
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,479
I've ever received.

9
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,199
Your Highness Prince Qi likes it.

10
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,520
It is my pleasure.

11
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,639
And the story you told

12
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,639
was wonderful.

13
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,560
I'll share my story

14
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,479
with you next time.

16
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,719
What's wrong?

17
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,800
Now that I remember,

18
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,120
I haven't opened your present yet.

19
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,879
It's okay.

20
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,479
Open it when you get back to your room.

21
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
You must have put a lot of thoughts

22
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,840
into this gift.

23
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,639
I'll keep it well.

Your Highness,

76
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,720
what is it?

77
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,040
Miss Lu is here.

78
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,680
Miss Lu says

79
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,079
she has something important to tell you.

80
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,759
She's waiting in the study now.

81
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,879
Your Highness.

82
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,240
Miss Lu, why are you here

83
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,600
late at night?

84
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,600
It has been three days.

85
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,879
I'm here to tell you my choice.

86
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,079
Miss Lu has forsaken your essential part.

87
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,360
You'd rather give up

88
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,879
your Lu Family's shipping

89
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,439
than marry me.

90
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,279
Now, the Lu Family

91
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,680
is a cooperative merchant
of the royal family.

92
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,360
Miss Lu,

93
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,720
haven't you already made your choice?

94
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,600
I'll marry you.

95
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,319
If I marry you as Your Highness's concubine,

96
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,279
as you wish,

97
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,519
Your Highness,

98
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
please set the Lu Family free.

99
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,160
What are you scheming again?

100
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,160
Fought over and over again.

101
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,319
Your royal family has got everything.

102
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,519
His Majesty threatened me

103
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,399
with my father's life.

104
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,720
You also send people to monitor the Lu Family.

105
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,840
Do I have a choice?

106
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,639
The dangerous time

107
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,879
when knives and axes hang,

108
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,799
I've had enough.

109
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,759
Your Highness,

110
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,919
if I marry you as you wish,

111
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,399
from now on,

112
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,879
please keep our Lu Family safe.

113
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,960
Do you really think so?

114
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,360
Tie our hair and be the couple.

115
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,559
This is my perseverance.

116
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,919
Your Highness, please keep your word.

117
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,000

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,039
(in this world,)

120
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,600
(you only have the body left.)

121
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,879
Up a little bit more.

122
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,840
Look. Is it here?

123
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,480
Clean it carefully.

124
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,120
Yeah, yeah, a little higher.

125
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,320
Okay.

126
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,840
Be gentle.

127
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,559
Don't break it.

128
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,039
Higher. Higher.

129
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,399
Today is our Miss's

130
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,399
happy day.

131
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,320
Be careful.

132
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,120
Higher.

133
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,279
Happy event?

134
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,840
Whose happy event?

135
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,679
Your Highness Prince Qi.

136
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,240
Miss Lu Anran.

137
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,799
Your Highness Prince Qi, don't you know?

138
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,679
Our Miss is getting married.

139
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Who will she marry?

140
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,200
His Highness Prince Qing.

141
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,200
Lu Anran, come out!

142
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,039
Your Highness Prince Qi.

143
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:08,679
Lu Anran!

144
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,240
This is Miss's boudoir.

145
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,399
You can't break in.

146
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,240
You ask her to come out.

147
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,440
Miss says it's tried to prepare for
the wedding today.

148
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,159
She wants to see no one.

149
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,799
Please don't make me
in a pickle, Your Highness.

150
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,840
Today I'll make!

151
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,960
Lu Anran!

152
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Your Highness, Your Highness.

153
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,120

155
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,679
Lu Anran!

156
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,279
Lu Anran, come out!

157
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,840
Lu Anran!

158
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
Why do you marry my second brother?

159
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,080
Miss.

160
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,840
Prince Qi is going crazy.

161
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,080
Go and see him.

162
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,919
Lu Anran!

163
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,080
Did someone force you, Lu Anran?

164
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,200
Lu Anran!

165
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,559
If you have something hard to say,

166
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,360
you tell me!

167
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,399
I'll help you solve it!

168
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,240
Let go of me!

169
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,399
Lu Anran!

170
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,600
Come out.

174
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,759
Lu Anran,

175
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,919
why are you going to marry my second brother?

176
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,120
Lu Anran!

177
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,759
Let go!

178
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,000
Lu Anran!

179
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,480
Lu Anran!

180
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,279
Your Highness Princess Qi.

181
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,039
Holly.

182
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,080
Where's Lu Anran?

183
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,360
Miss asked me to send you a word.

184
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,120
Life after surviving a disaster.

185
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,879
As time passes,

186
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,480
I finally know who I really love.

187
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,679
Your Highness, please go back.

188
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,840
Love whom?

189
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:31,399
Does she really love

190
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,240
my second brother?

191
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,279
Your Highness, if you're
really for the good of her,

192
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,799
don't move forward.

193
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,840
Miss is going to

194
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,360
marry soon now.

195
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,279
She's going to be
the person of Prince Qing's Mansion.

196
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,320
Your Highness, if you break into

197
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,720
your sister-in-law's boudoir,

198
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,759
with so many people watching you,

199
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,559
how can Miss behave

200
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,559
in the future?

201
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,159
Holly,

202
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,480
you're Lu Anran's confidant.

203
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,000
You must know her mind.

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,639
Tell me,

205
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,360
tell me what's wrong with her?

206
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,080
How can she become
quite a different person overnight?

207
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,639
Your Highness Princess Qi,

208
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,279
there is no woman in the world

209
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,000
will make fun of

210
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,960
one's life-long event.

211
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,600
Your Highness is Miss's bosom friend.

212
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,000
So, you should understand that

213
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,159
Miss only follows her own heart

214
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,159
and makes decisions.

215
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,799
If she wants to marry him,

216
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
she really wants to marry him.

217
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,559
No one can change it.

218
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,799
Along the way,

219
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,519
Holly can see

220
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,799
your affections for Miss.

221
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,240
But Miss only regards

222
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,399
Your Highness as bosom friend.

223
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,879
Bosom friend?

224
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,000
Who wants to be her bosom friend?

225
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,000
Can't she see

226
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
how much I want to marry her?

227
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,600
To get married,

228
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,519
one needs to know each other.

229
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,519
Miss has someone in her heart.

230
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,240
Your Highness, if you keep
pestering her like this,

231
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,120
it will only make you suffer more.

232
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:18,480
Holly.

233
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,720
Holly, she...

234
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,519
Does she really want to marry my second brother?

235
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,039
Miss really figured it out.

236
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,639
As things have come to this,

237
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,720
there is no turning back.

238
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,159
Your Highness, please go back.

239
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,919
She figured it out.

240
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,759
She figured it out.

241
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,480
She figured it out, but I can't.

242
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,279
I can't figure it out.

243
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,639
I can't figure it out.

244
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,639
Miss.

245
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,440
Miss, go and stop

246
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,480
His Highness Prince Qi.

247
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,759
He'll leave if it's late.

248
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,200
Don't go out.

249
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,480
Why, Miss?

250
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,879
You're already

251
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,159
so sad.

252
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,879
Why do you still

253
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,440
reject His Highness Prince Qi?

254
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,639
Don't you see that

255
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,519
he is so sad?

256
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,480
Lingxi, remember that

257
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,360
Prince Qi and I have no feelings for each other

258
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,480
from beginning to end.

259
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,000
From now on,

260
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,159
you must be careful of what you say and
do in Mansion of Prince Qing.

261
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,360
But you went on a spring outing

262
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,720
with Prince Qi yesterday.

263
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,000
You even

264
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,480
prepared fireworks for him.

265
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,320
Miss,

266
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,840
look at this rabbit lantern.

267
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,120
His Highness Prince Qi made this

268
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,559
for you personally.

269
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,759
You had been watching it all night.

270
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,120
I've never seen you

271
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
love a toy

272
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,000
so much.

273
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,159
And this.

274
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,599
This is the bracelet
His Highness Prince Qi gave you.

275
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,759
You wear it all the time.

276
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,880
Miss.

277
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,880
You are so fond of Prince Qi.

278
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
Why do you marry Prince Qing?

279
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,720
Don't say any more.

280
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,359
Miss, why do you

281
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,880
become like this?

282
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,759
After the hair-pinning ceremony,

283
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,440
you've become a different person.

284
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,880
You weren't like this before.

285
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,319
Now you tell

286
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,440
everything to Holly.

287
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,400
You think I don't understand anything.

288
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,839
Yes, I don't understand.

289
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,839
But at least I can see it clearly

290
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,799
that you like His Highness Prince Qi.

291
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,599
Did I tolerate you

292
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,720
too much?

293
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,920
Now you don't even listen to my words.

294
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Lingxi, let me tell you.

295
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,599
Whoever I like. Whoever I hate.

296
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,119
Whoever I marry.

297
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,480
It all has nothing to do with you.

298
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,599
You're not my Miss.

299
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,039
Our Miss wouldn't

300
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,519
talk to me like that!

301
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,920
I have a way out.

302
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,839
Wait for me.

303
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:38,799
Okay?

304
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,200
I'll wait for you.

305
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:47,720
Anran.

306
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,680
you said before

307
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,119
let me wait.

308
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,640
Did I almost get it?

309
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,119
(Why?)

310
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,079
(Why do you become different)

311
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,319
(after one night?)

312
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,039
(Lu Anran,)

313
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,559
(do you really love second brother?)

314
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,200
(Then what am I to you?)

315
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,440
Your Highness Prince Qing.

316
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,319
Is there anything else you need?

317
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,519
Your Highness has covered everything.

318
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,799
Lack for nothing.

319
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,559
If you need anything else,

320
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,799
you can tell Nanxing at any time.

321
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,440
Your Highness,

322
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:34,839
can I not live

323
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,799
in your mansion?

324
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,680
You and I haven't got married yet.

325
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,440
Are you going to separate with me now?

326
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:50,440
I just don't want to

327
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,400
fight for your favor

328
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,599
with people in your mansion.

329
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,759
I've agreed to marry you.

330
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,319
I just want to have some peace and quiet.

331
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,440
Peace and quiet?

332
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,440
Let me tell you,

333
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,599
the Mansion of Prince Qing,

334
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,359
is not a nunnery.

335
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,720
It's not a place for you to cultivate yourself,

336
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,200
nor to live a peaceful life in old age.

337
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
Can you understand?

338
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:30,799
Look at me.

339
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,680
You...

340
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Do you really want nothing?

341
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
I just want the Lu family

342
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,880
to be safe.

343
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:50,839
If Your Highness can

344
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,480
fulfill your promise to me,

345
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,880
then I'll behave myself,

346
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,279
being Your Highness's concubine.

347
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,559
Behave yourself?

348
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,319
In fact,

349
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,640
I don't want you

350
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,680
to behave yourself.

351
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,400
Instead, I hope

352
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:12,640
you can want something from me.

353
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,519
My court is connected with the backyard

354
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,640
of Your Highness's Mansion.

355
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,359
It's just a wall apart.

356
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,200
After I break it,

357
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,160
I will continue to live here.

358
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,119
Okay.

359
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,880
You can stay here.

360
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,720
But you have to

361
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,599
walk in the

362
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,960
back door of Mansion of Prince Qing.

363
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,200
After all, you're a concubine.

364
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,680
Since you are a concubine,

365
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,000
you must know the rules of being a concubine.

366
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,680
I'll definitely

367
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,799
take Your Highness's wishes.

368
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,119
To satisfy Your Highness.

369
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,519
That's good.

370
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:04,720
Also,

371
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,440
in just a few days,

372
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,519
you'll be the person of
the Mansion of Prince Qing.

373
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,480
I can do whatever you want.

374
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
But you have to

375
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,720
clearly deal with your relationship

376
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,200
between you and ninth brother.

377
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,160
I have made it clear

378
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,000
with His Highness Prince Qi.

379
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,480
Why do I think

380
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,119
it's not enough?

381
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,519
You know ninth brother's feelings

382
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,240
to you most clearly.

383
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,640
It's no use running away.

384
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,279
Think of a way

385
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,359
to let ninth brother give up on you.

386
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,559
Do you hear me?

387
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,279
Don't let me see your tears

388
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,559
in the mansion.

389
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,920
Otherwise,

390
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:12,640
I might

391
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,759
take back my intention to marry you.

392
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,079
And lose the mood to torture you.

393
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,279
By then, I'll have to torture

394
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,680
your beloved younger brother.

395
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,559
Stop drinking.

396
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,640
How much did you drink?

397
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,000
The wine is good,

398
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,119
but you can't drink like this.

399
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,759
Chuan,

400
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,279
if there's something wrong,

401
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,599
tell me.

402
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,880
Let me help you, okay?

403
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,799
Brother Shen,

404
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,519
I'm here to

405
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,920
have some peace and quiet.

406
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,359
Come here to have some peace and quiet?

407
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,319
It's raining so hard outside.

408
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,799
Why don't you take an umbrella?

409
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:41,920
They told me that

410
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,519
when you came

411
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,400
you were like a water ghost.

412
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,119
Wait,

413
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,559
I'll make ginger soup for you.

414
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,839
Brother Shen,

415
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,359
have you ever liked someone?

416
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,359
What nonsense are you talking about?

417
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,519
I only have brothers in my heart.

418
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,480
Brother Shen, you know what?

419
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
I,

420
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,039
with sincerity,

421
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,240
treat a person.

422
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,759
She asked me to wait for her.

423
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,559
She said she had a way out.

424
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,319
She asked me to wait.

425
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,240
Then I wait.

426
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,799
I think until now,

427
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,240
we've been through so much.

428
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,599
I think it's long enough.

429
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,400
When I reached out to her,

430
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,839
what I caught was still a bubble.

431
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,920
It disappeared in an instant.

432
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,000
All right, all right.

433
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,279
I know you're sad.

434
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,160
All right, all right.

435
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,119
Brother Shen,

436
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,000
I've been thinking about it.

437
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,519
Did I do something wrong?

438
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,359
You didn't do anything wrong.

439
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,039
I want her to forgive me.

440
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,480
But I don't know

441
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,599
why I made a mistake once,

442
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,640
she's getting married soon.

443
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:43,519
Chuan,

444
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,359
is the girl you just said

445
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,400
Miss Lu?

446
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,519
No more Miss Lu.

447
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,759
Wait, wait, wait.

448
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,279
Make it clear.

449
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,759
Why there's no more Miss Lu?

450
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,000
Is Miss Lu dead?

451
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,640
She's not dead.

452
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,160
My heart is dead.

453
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,559
No, you can't drink any more.

454
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,599
Give it to me.

455
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,039
You're drunk.

456
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,519
You can't drink any more.

457
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,599
Let go of me.

458
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,720
Look at you now.

459
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,160
You're like mud.

460
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,640
Don't be stubborn with me.

461
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,319
Let's talk about it when you're sober.

462
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,119
Don't be a scoundrel.

463
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:22,839
Stand up.

464
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,200
Chuan.

465
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,599
Chuan.

466
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:30,759
Chuan...

467
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,400
Chuan.

468
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,799
Let's go back to bed.

469
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,039
Stand up.

470
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,279
Look at you.

471
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,559
Such a high fever!

472
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,839
Get up. Get up.

473
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,440
Anyone?

474
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,839
Call Doctor Liang!

475
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:55,799
Doctor.

476
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:56,400
Leader.

477
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,160
How is he?

478
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,599
His Highness Prince Qi

479
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,920
caught a cold.

480
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,720
I'll prescribe two medicines

481
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,839
for dispelling cold and fever.

482
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,079
Be careful these days.

483
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,519
Don't let him drink like this again.

484
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,480
If he keeps drinking like this,

485
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,119
he'll be sick even if he doesn't get sick.

486
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,079
I see.

487
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,519
Thank you, doctor.

488
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,799
Goodbye.

489
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,920
Please.

490
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,039
You're

491
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,599
trapped by love.

492
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Drink down sorrow.

493
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:40,920
I have sent someone

494
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,960
to look for Miss Lu.

495
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,960
She'll be here soon.

496
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,240
Leader.

497
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,160
Where is she?

498
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,680
She didn't come.

499
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,880
Didn't come?

500
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,160
Well.

501
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,759
When she heard it was
His Highness Prince Qi that wanted to see her,

502
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,440
she wouldn't even open the door.

503
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:01,960
I wonder how His Highness Prince Qi

504
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,480
offended Miss Lu?

505
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,039
They must have been fighting like hell.

506
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,359
Why are you still standing here?

507
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,519
Go and find her again.

508
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,079
If she doesn't come, His Highness will die.

509
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,279
Stupid.

510
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,640
Lu Anran.

511
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,319
Lu Anran.

512
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,519
Lu Anran, wait for me.

513
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:32,880
Wait a little longer.

514
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:36,839
Slow down.

515
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,839
Madam, slow down.

516
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Be careful.

517
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,119
Slow down.

518
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,640
Ms. Xiao,

519
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,640
His Highness is working.

520
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,039
Please wait for a moment.

521
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,359
Your Highness,

522
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,400
I have something important
to tell Your Highness.

523
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,799
Please let me in.

524
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
Let her in.

525
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,079
What are you doing?

526
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,240
The mansion

527
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,000
is full of happiness characters.

528
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,720
The red satin brocades are everywhere.

529
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,680
The servants are all saying

530
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,000
Your Highness is going to have a concubine.

531
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,000
Is it true?

532
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,799
It's true.

533
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,759
Your Highness, is the one Lu Anran?

534
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,720
Marrying her is a stopgap.

535
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,240
Stopgap?

536
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,519
The Lu family has been taken away by

537
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,279
His Majesty.

538
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,039
What's the use of Lu Anran?

539
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,720
My decisions now

540
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,799
need

541
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,640
you to question?

542
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,400
I'm doing this

543
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,440
for your sake.

544
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,759
For my sake?

545
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:11,920
Do you think I'm ignorant?

546
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,200
You just don't want to

547
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,880
have one more woman

548
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,839
to compete for favor

549
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,319
with you.

550
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,039
Xiao Jingque,

551
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,519
no matter what,

552
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,960
you're from the general clan.

553
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,319
You'd better not to use these tricks

554
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,279
which are often used by small families.

555
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Tricks?

556
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,759
I use tricks

557
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,160
all because I love you.

558
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,119
Lu Xinran did such a scandal.

559
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,200
The mansion has become a laughingstock.

560
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,440
Now that you want to marry her sister.

561
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,359
What will people say about you?

562
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,440
People will say that

563
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,039
you are terminally addicted to women.

564
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,200
Your Highness,

565
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:57,920
you married Lu Xinran

566
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,200
with your military exploits.

567
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,480
His Majesty already thought that

568
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,599
you only care about love.

569
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,000
Now you're going to marry
woman from the Lu Family again.

570
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:07,880
His Majesty will think that

571
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,000
you're bewitched by tenderness,

572
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,360
and can't bear the heavy responsibility.

573
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,440
Xiao Jingque!

574
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,719
You're outspoken!

575
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,760
I've tolerated you enough.

576
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,039
I've given you all the honor I should give you.

577
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,079
You are so greedy.

578
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:22,880
Your Highness,

579
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,000
don't you

580
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,519
care about my feelings at all?

581
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,199
Piss off.

582
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,519
If Lu Anran enters the mansion,

583
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,199
I won't

584
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,159
make her live a happy life.

585
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,039
Your Highness,

586
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,440
why are you here in person today?

587
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,400
If there's something important,

588
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,199
just let me know,

589
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:18,159
and I will visit you in person.

590
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,039
I know that

591
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,079
General Xiao is busy with official duties.

592
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,679
If I hadn't

593
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,199
personally visited you,

594
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,239
I'm afraid General Xiao

595
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,880
may forget

596
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,400
something important.

597
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:33,159
Recently, the war
started again at the border.

598
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm busy working with the Ministry of War

599
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,960
to make a crusade plan.

600
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,519
As for the movement of Prince Yi's party,

601
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,159
I really have no time to pay attention to it.

602
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,159
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

603
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,760
Those stragglers and
disbanded soldiers in the south

604
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,440
perhaps didn't expect that

605
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:51,159
their dying struggle would make

606
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,960
General Xiao who is thousand miles away

607
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,519
to study the war situation

608
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,599
night and day.

609
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:56,840
General Xiao,

610
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,639
do you think

611
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,679
there're not my agents in your army?

612
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,039
Your Highness,

613
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,719
you fought on the battlefield before.

614
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,960
You should understand that

615
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,280
the situation at the border changes rapidly.

616
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:10,400
We can't take it lightly.

617
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,440
General Xiao,

618
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,119
you came back to Hanjing for more than a month.

619
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,039
You're a fast learner

620
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,360
of steering clear of the crucial point

621
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,199
which are often used by officials

622
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,679
in the imperial court.

623
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,400
General Xiao,

624
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,960
we fought on the battlefield together

625
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,000
for many years.

626
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,440
Let's get straight to the point.

627
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,599
I don't want to get
involved in the party struggle.

628
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,199
Just because of

629
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,320
our friendship,

630
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,599
I married my sister

631
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:40,760
into Prince Qing's Mansion.

632
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,400
My sister loves Your Highness.

633
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,440
But

634
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,559
how did Your Highness treat Jingque?

635
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,400
And treat the Xiao Family?

636
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,760
I see.

637
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,360
Then I would like to ask

638
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,280
General Xiao,

639
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,679
what do you want to fight for your sister?

640
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,639
I only have one sister.

641
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,480
I certainly want to give her the best.

642
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,280
As long as I can do it,

643
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,400
I will give all she wants.

644
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,760
Then,

645
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:15,360
what about the Crown Princess of Prince Qing?

646
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:17,960
Then,

647
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,280
what about the troops assigned to the south?

648
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,480
Of course,

649
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,400
they'll be back as scheduled.

650
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,280
From tomorrow on,

651
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,760
Xiao Jingque

652
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,239
will be mistress of Prince Qing's Mansion,

653
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:32,920
The Xiao Family

654
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,400
is willing to serve you

655
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,000
for your career.

656
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,000
Miss Lu,

657
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,320
His Highness Prince Qing knows you

658
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,239
like rabbit lanterns.

659
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,760
These are specially

660
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,599
arranged by His Highness.

661
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,800
Look at the rabbit lanterns in the yard.

662
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:50,960
They are much more meaningful

663
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,639
than the red lanterns

664
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:52,880
for weddings.

665
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,840
Thank His Highness for me.

666
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:57,440
We'll leave now.

667
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,400
Just let me know if you need anything.

668
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:29,880
Miss.

669
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,599
Yesterday

670
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,519
what I said were very rude.

671
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,360
Every word was stuck

672
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,639
in His Highness Prince Qi's heart.

673
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,360
He looked really sad.

674
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,760
Did we have to do this?

675
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,079
Yes, we must.

676
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,079
I hesitated before.

677
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:48,559
I even dreamed about

678
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,960
making the best of both worlds in the future.

679
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,800
As a result, it ended up
being slandered on all sides

680
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,679
without ends.

681
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,079
Mu Ze is ruthless.

682
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,360
Marrying him is like

683
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,320
walking on ice.

684
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,039
I can't leave any flaws.

685
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,880
I can't let anyone

686
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,000
hold my weakness.

687
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,800
At first,

688
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,239
I didn't understand either.

689
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,480
Why do you hate Prince Qing so much?

690
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,159
You even risked

691
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,079
your own life.

692
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,599
But along the way with you,

693
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:23,000
I saw what a horrible person

694
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,039
Prince Qing is.

695
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,559
Once you have connections with him,

696
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,760
you can't get rid of him

697
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,800
even if you cut your flesh and bones.

698
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,360
We can't let

699
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,880
people like him get what he wants.

700
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,280
For what he made me lose,

701
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,519
I want him to return them

702
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,079
one by one.

703
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:40,880
Lu Anran.

704
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,119
Brother.

705
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,760
Why are you here?

706
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
I'm here to tie up your Miss.

707
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,719
Miss Lu,

708
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,840
you've been angry

709
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,079
for too long,

710
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,639
I sent someone to invite you three times.

711
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,360
You didn't come.

712
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,119
Leader Shen,

713
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
if His Highness Prince Qi asked you

714
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,639
to come to me,

715
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,639
then there's no need to bother.

716
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,800
I won't see him.

717
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,239
No way.

718
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:12,599
You have to see him even if you don't want to.

719
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:13,960
Miss Lu,

720
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:15,639
you didn't see what Chuan

721
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:16,360
is like now.

722
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
He was caught in heavy rain,

723
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,000
and the fever hasn't receded.

724
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,639
He's still talking nonsense in bed.

725
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,320
I can't feed him even a drop of medicine.

726
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,400
You don't know,

727
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,599
even so,

728
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,840
he's calling

729
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,159
your name all the time.

730
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:33,239
He's a man.

731
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,280
what's wrong with getting caught in the rain?

732
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:35,880
Holly.

733
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,280
get a doctor for your brother

734
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,679
to treat His Highness Prince Qi.

735
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,239
Get what doctor?

736
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,719
If it works

737
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,960
do I still have to come here?

738
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,159
Even a rough man like me

739
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:44,880
can tell

740
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,840
Chuan is suffering from anxiety.

741
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,400
You are the antidote to this anxiety.

742
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,280
Brother, go back now.

743
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,719
Stop messing around.

744
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,440
Don't pull me.

745
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,159
I'm not done yet.

746
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,280
Miss Lu,

747
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,840
I don't care what happened

748
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,559
between you two.

749
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,079
But you can't

750
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,000
punish him like this.

751
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,599
All the people in the world

752
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,440
who are not blind know

753
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,199
Chuan's affection for you.

754
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,400
Why are you the only one who's ignorant of it?

755
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,159
I'm determined to take you with me today.

756
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,480
You come with me,

757
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,880
or I'll kidnap you.

758
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,800
Make your own choice.

759
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,960
I'll go with you.

760
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,480
You have to face what you have to face.

761
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:29,920
Miss Lu,

762
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,119
there's something that

763
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:33,679
I have to tell you.

764
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,760
Though Chuan travels everywhere

765
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,079
and is free and unrestrained.

766
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:38,800
Seems that he doesn't care

767
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,360
no matter what you do to him.

768
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:41,679
But he has

769
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:42,639
his own difficulties.

770
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,440
He grew up in a royal family,

771
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:47,000
but he lost his mother in his early years.

772
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:48,480
He can't tell anyone

773
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,559
about these pains in his heart.

774
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,079
Brother Shen,

775
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,000
actually, I don't want to be a prince.

776
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,480
Only with you,

777
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,599
I'm free.

778
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,840
I can just be Mu Chuan.

779
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,119
Brother Shen,

780
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,199
can you stop

781
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,440
calling me Your Highness in the future?

782
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,639
From now on, you will be my Chuan.

783
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:15,719
Ever since we got to know each other,

784
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:17,920
you're the first one

785
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
whom he's been so sweet to.

786
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:08,119
