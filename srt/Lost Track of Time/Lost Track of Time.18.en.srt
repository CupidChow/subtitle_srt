=Episode 18=

2
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,159
Then.

3
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,920
What's Miss Lu's answer?

4
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,879
I will never marry you as a concubine,

5
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,519
nor will I do even if I die.

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,200
Then do you want Lu Yun

7
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,799
to spend the rest of his life

8
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,040
in the military army?

9
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,480
This is his choice.

10
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,519
I have nothing to say.

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Have you forgotten, Your Highness?

12
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,280
Lu Yun is not my biological brother.

13
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,000
His biological mother almost poisoned me.

14
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,159
And her biological sister,

15
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,120
wanted to kill me for many times.

16
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,159
I don't have to sacrifice

17
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,640
the happiness of my life for him.

18
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,439
Don't you regret it?

19
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,640
I am indeed

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,759
a selfish person.

21
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,560
It's just out of

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
the concern of a senior sister.

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,319
So I hope

24
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,360
he can take a stable path.

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,439
But now I've figured it out,

26
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,479
everyone has his own destiny.

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
If he really wants to be a soldier,

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,879
I can't stop him.

29
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,280
Let him be then.

30
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,639
It's necessarily a good thing

31
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,080
to make contributions to the nation.

32
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,360
Do you really think so?

33
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,879
This is my answer to Your Highness.

34
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,159
I won't disturb Your Highness to rest.

35
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,639
(Good for you, Lu Anran.)

36
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,199
(You can always give me)

37
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,560
(unexpected answers.)

38
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,400
Miss.

39
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,680
Madam has passed away

40
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,639
for 49 days.

41
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,719
If she were alive,

42
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,520
she definitely would not want to see you

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,919
be sad for her.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,840
We should see Madam off well.

45
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,400
Don't let her

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,520
worry about you anymore.

47
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,000
(In memory of Shen Lanxi)

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,759
Dad, it's getting cold.

49
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,479
Let me burn it.

50
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,039
In case of catching a chill here.

51
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Just let me stay with your mother.

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,759
Father,

53
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,079
take Xinran and mom

54
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,879
back to Su City.

55
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,079
Hanjing

56
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,480
is not a safe place.

57
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,519
I don't want you

58
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,000
to walk on thin ice.

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800
What about you?

60
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,240
I will definitely go back.

61
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,800
But not now.

62
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,279
I understand what you're thinking.

63
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,959
You're doing this for
the good of the Lu family.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,360
But you did your best.

65
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,879
We can't defeat them at all.

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,560
It's better to take this opportunity

67
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,759
and go back with me.

68
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,680
Let's guard the family together.

69
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,240
Stay well for the rest of our lives, okay?

70
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,240
After entering Hanjing,

71
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,319
one can't just go back if one wants to.

72
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,279
Now Yun is still in the army.

73
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,199
After I make Yun give up his idea

74
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,160
of joining the army,

75
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,160
I'll take him back to Su City.

76
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,480
Our family can be reunited.

77
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,519
Father, take my mom back first.

78
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,079
You are safe now.

79
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,560
Only then can my heart be stable.

80
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:10,959
Be careful.

81
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,800
How are you feeling, Dad?

82
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,959
I drank the medicine you made yourself.

83
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,319
Much better.

84
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,199
Take care on your way, father.

85
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,040
When you arrive in Su City,

86
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,720
be sure to send me a letter
to check in with me.

87
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,279
After I leave,

88
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,759
you must take good care of yourself.

89
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,959
Don't hurt yourself

90
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,560
for the sake of others.

91
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,000
I will wait for your return

92
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,319
in Su City.

93
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,879
General Xiao, what are you doing?

94
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,639
We received a report,

95
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,399
saying Lu Qingzhou is
in close contact with the North.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He is suspected of treason and
collaboration with the enemy.

97
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,439
Nonsense.

98
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,920
My Lu family is innocent.

99
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,839
Innocent or not,

100
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,160
we'll find out after searching.

101
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,000
What are you doing?

102
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,920
Get off.

103
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,480
Don't move.

104
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,160
Get off.

105
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,399
Don't move! Put it down!

106
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:22,639
What are you doing?

107
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,279
Search carefully.

108
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,319
Yes.

109
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,399
Lingxi.

110
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,759
Lingxi.

111
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,680
Lingxi, are you ok?

112
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:34,639
General.

113
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,639
Take him down.

114
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,639
Yes.

115
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,800
Master Lu, you're so greedy.

116
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,720
The Lu family is extremely rich.

117
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:49,920
How dare you

118
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,240
try to sell arms privately in the North?

119
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
The secret letter is here.
Do you admit it?

120
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,040
Lu Qingzhou,

121
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,800
sells arms privately in the North.

122
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Connives with the enemy
and betrays the country.

123
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,519
This is the first crime.

124
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,199
In the name of Your Father-in-law,

125
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,120
he privately monopolizes
salt and iron among the people.

126
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,920
This is the second crime.

127
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,920
He deliberately delays military supplies,

128
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,560
restores grain privately and
raises its price unreasonably.

129
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
This is the third crime.

130
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,360
The evidence is conclusive, and
the crimes are unforgivable.

131
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,720
The whole family

132
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,399
should be executed.

133
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,720
Should the whole family be executed?

134
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,120
Take him away.

135
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,160
Wait.

136
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,279
Miss Lu,

137
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,040
don't interfere with official duties.

138
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,360
Once you're imprisoned,

139
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,759
under the whole world,

140
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,080
no one can

141
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
save Master Lu.

142
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,840
A clean hand wants no washing.

143
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,720
Anran,

144
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,399
don't worry about me.

145
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,120
What should we do?

146
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,000
(From the past until now,)

147
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,080
(there's only one mole in the mansion.)

148
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,279
(The brazier is still warm.)

149
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,559
(I don't think she left long ago.)

150
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,440
I'll look for her in the barracks.

151
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,679
Maybe it's not too late.

152
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,720
Lingxi, wait for news at the mansion.

153
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,559
Holly,

154
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,320
Please ask your brother

155
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,080
and brothers in gang

156
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,960
to help us look for her.

157
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,440
Okay.

158
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,100
(The next one is your brother.)

159
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,440
Hyah!

160
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,759
Hyah!

161
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,890
(Xiang Yun Court)

162
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,240
How is it going?

163
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,559
I've been to the military camp.

164
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,840
The guards said they hadn't seen her.

165
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,600
Then where can she go?

166
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,000
It's been four hours.

167
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,639
Is Holly back?

168
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,639
She doesn't... No way.

169
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,120
We can't just wait.

170
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,320
I'll go ask His Highness Princess Qi for help.

171
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,720
Lingxi.

172
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,279
What?

173
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,080
You're not surprised to see me.

174
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,080
Lu Xinran,

175
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,320
you pretend to be insane
every day in the mansion.

176
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,919
In fact, you've already planned

177
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,840
all these, haven't you?

178
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,720
If I don't act like a fool,

179
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,360
how can I get rid of my shame?

180
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,240
How can I

181
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,440
avenge my mother?

182
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,240
You killed my mother.

183
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,480
That's right.

184
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,039
I really want to thank you.

185
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,679
You sent me to Prince Qing's Mansion.

186
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,279
Otherwise, how would I know

187
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,519
Mu Ze was selling salt and iron privately.

188
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,279
That's why there was a riot
at the wharf that day.

189
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:28,840
Madam,

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,720
I just made the final handover

191
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,679
at the wharf.

192
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,159
But suddenly two groups of people came,

193
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,519
saying that one of the goods

194
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,240
belonged to them.

195
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,440
They quarreled strongly,

196
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,639
and are about to start a fight.

197
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,200
Mom,

198
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,919
do I look good?

199
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,200
Looks good.

200
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,240
Give me a hug. Give me a hug.

201
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,559
Then I knew it,

202
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
here's my chance.

203
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,440
Don't touch me, Lu Xinran.

204
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,919
Don't touch me!

205
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,279
Lu Xinran!

206
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,279
Don't touch me!

207
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,279
Lu Anran,

208
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,840
you killed my mother.

209
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,440
How can I let your mother

210
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,639
live in this world and enjoy happiness?

211
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,279
What about father?

212
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,000
He...

213
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,919
He only has eyes for you,

214
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,399
He can't wait to give you

215
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,159
all the best things in the world.

216
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
But what about me?

217
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,919
Just because I'm not born by
the first madam.

218
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,919
so he loves you more.

219
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,679
Servants all love you more.

220
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,080
Even Lu Yun admires you more.

221
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:01,879
Lu Xinran,

222
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,360
you're still making excuses today

223
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,279
to excuse yourself.

224
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,080
Shut up!

225
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,799
What I've done

226
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,440
is forced by you.

227
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,960
So what if

228
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,120
I'm Princess Qing?

229
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,679
Even Mu Ze has eyes

230
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,360
only for you.

231
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,240
Why?

232
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,399
Why?

233
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,559
Why?

234
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,840
I want you to tell me why?

235
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,519
No one

236
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,759
spares a glance at me.

237
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,720
Lu Anran,

238
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,360
do you like the place

239
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,440
I chose for you?

240
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,240
I'll bury you in this place,

241
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,399
and put on this red dress for you.

242
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,480
I'll make you not to

243
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,039
reincarnate forever.

244
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,440
No matter in heaven or hell.

245
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,759
You and your mother

246
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,600
will never see each other again.

247
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,080
Cover the coffin.

248
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:08,919
Hyah!

249
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,279
Hyah!

250
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,840
Hyah!

251
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,799
Miss Lu.

252
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,679
Miss.

253
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,320
Miss Lu. Miss Lu.

254
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,039
How is it? Brother.

255
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Young master has been staying

256
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,200
in the military camp.

257
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:55,879
That note

258
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,080
must be Lu Xinran's trap.

259
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,759
Where did Miss go?

260
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,759
Don't be too anxious.

261
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,039
I asked all the brothers in the gang

262
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,120
to come out and look for her.

263
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,599
Go back and wait for the news.

264
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,839
Let's keep looking.

265
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,920
Miss Lu.

266
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:08,960
Miss Lu.

267
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,839
Miss Lu.

268
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,319
Miss Lu.

269
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,599
Miss Lu.

270
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,559
Miss Lu.

271
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,000
Where are you?

272
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,279
Miss Lu.

273
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Your Highness, please have some tea.

274
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,559
You did a good job.

275
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,839
I didn't expect that

276
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,400
you would have such a strategy.

277
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,759
When I saw the note,

278
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,079
to be honest, I was a little surprised.

279
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,240
As a girl from the Lu Family,

280
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,279
I'm not necessarily worse than Lu Anran.

281
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,079
I just want you to see

282
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,799
Lu Anran's real face.

283
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,319
In order to capture

284
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,759
Lu Anran's weakness for me.

285
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,680
I can't believe

286
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,880
you can frame your biological father.

287
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,680
A married daughter

288
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,759
is just like spilled water.

289
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,359
As I'm married to Your Highness,

290
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,079
of course, I'm on His Highness's side.

291
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,119
From what you said,

292
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,440
I think you're very sensible.

293
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,079
Your Highness,

294
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,880
since I give you a hand.

295
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,200
Can I ask you for a reward?

296
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:26,920
Tell me what you want.

297
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,119
What I want

298
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,920
has always been Your Highness's heart.

299
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,440
Making an alliance with Lu Anran,

300
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,519
you aim at the wealth of the Lu family

301
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,119
and Lu Anran's wisdom.

302
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,480
But on your way,

303
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,039
the most important thing is

304
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,319
the loyalty of the people around you.

305
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,680
Can't what I did today

306
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,000
prove that

307
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,920
I'm better than Lu Anran?

308
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,599
And more suitable to stay by your side?

309
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,799
Come on.

310
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,160
Sit here.

311
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,480
Since you deal with Lu Anran for me,

312
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,400
aren't you afraid that Lu Anran

313
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,480
will retaliate against you?

314
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,200
So she doesn't have to come back.

315
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,119
Doesn't have to come back?

316
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,599
What do you mean?

317
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I sent her to the place

318
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,119
where she should go.

319
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,680
Lu Xinran,

320
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,759
you

321
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,039
framed your biological father,

322
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,640
and murdered your sister.

323
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,480
Tell me,

324
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,519
will your sincerity

325
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,880
become a sharp edge

326
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,160
on my bed

327
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,759
one day?

328
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,519
As Your Highness is so kind to Xinran,

329
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,920
Xinran is reluctant to hurt you.

330
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,039
Then tell me,

331
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,720
now everyone

332
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,039
in Hanjing knows

333
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,240
I have divorced

334
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,960
my own princess.

335
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:57,559
And the princess has become

336
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,640
an insane woman.

337
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,279
How can you

338
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,240
get back to Prince Qing's Mansion?

339
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,079
Your Highness,

340
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,720
I've already made up my mind.

341
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,279
As Lu Anran,

342
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,960
I can remarry into Prince Qing's Mansion.

343
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,720
So that everything can
go back to where it was.

344
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It seems that you've really

345
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,920
arranged me

346
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,079
perfectly.

347
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,599
Okay, from tomorrow on,

348
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,079
you're the mistress of Prince Qing's Mansion.

349
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,640
By the way,

350
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,920
what did you do with Lu Anran?

351
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,640
You must dispose of it cleanly.

352
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,559
If you leave something behind,

353
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,839
there will be endless troubles.

354
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,000
I buried her.

355
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,119
Okay,

356
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,240
you're really smart.

357
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,000
Your Highness.

358
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,680
Tell me where Lu Anran is.

359
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:06,920
Your Highness.

360
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,319
Lu Anran set you up many times.

361
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,880
She even killed Mr. Cai

362
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,079
who helped you along the way.

363
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,240
I help you kill her

364
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,920
because I'm afraid of
getting your hands dirty.

365
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,279
Shouldn't you be happy?

366
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,359
How to deal with Lu Anran?

367
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,519
It's up to me.

368
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,680
As Lu Anran set you up,

369
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,079
do you still want to

370
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:32,960
keep her alive?

371
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm warning you,

372
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,599
I don't have that much patience.

373
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,319
If you don't tell me,

374
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,319
I have a hundred ways

375
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,240
to make your life worse than death.

376
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,519
Mu Ze,

377
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,559
I'll never tell you

378
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,480
where she is even if I die.

379
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,119
You're just a daughter
born by a concubine.

380
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,000
You lost all your reputation,

381
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,559
and chastity.

382
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,119
It's useless to keep

383
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,079
this face.

384
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,039
Or I scratch it?

385
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,359
I'll take you to her.

386
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,880
Stop.

387
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:18,799
Help.

388
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,920
Help...

389
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,039
Did you hear anything?

390
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,240
I didn't, Your Highness.

391
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,359
Help.

392
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,279
H-Help.

393
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,880
It's already 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., right?

394
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,960
She has been missing for six hours.

395
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,960
As Miss Lu is a lucky woman, she will be fine.

396
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,440
We will definitely find her.

397
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:02,799
Your Highness,

398
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,279
we and the brothers of Qinghe Gang,

399
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,519
have searched the area outside the city

400
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,839
for several times.

401
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,000
Let's go back to the city and have a look.

402
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:17,519
Let's go.

403
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,160
Let's go back to Lu's Mansion and have a look.

404
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:29,920
Hyah!

405
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,480
Don't beat around the bush.

406
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,920
Tell me where Lu Anran is.

407
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,480
Mu Ze,

408
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,079
I'm sincere to you.

409
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,920
Why don't you believe me?

410
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,119
Since I entered the mansion,

411
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,279
have I ever plotted

412
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,440
against you once?

413
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,480
Even if you don't care about me

414
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,599
at all.

415
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,720
Even if you step on me again and again

416
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,359
and humiliate me.

417
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
I abandoned

418
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,400
the Lu Family to stand in front of you.

419
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,720
And plead with you to have mercy on me.

420
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,519
Sincerity?

421
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,640
For what's in

422
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,519
your sincerity,

423
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,920
you are the one knowing it the most.

424
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,640
Who doesn't want imperial power and wealth?

425
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,279
You are much greedier than me.

426
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,079
Don't compare me to you.

427
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,279
Those dirty things you did

428
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,880
are so shameful.

429
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,680
Dirty?

430
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,519
I'm not cleaner than Lu Anran.

431
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,720
Lu Anran is so nice.

432
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,160
Pretends to be noble,

433
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,079
and stays out of the human society.

434
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,039
That's because

435
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,480
she has everything.

436
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,119
Tell me where Lu Anran is.

437
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,799
I can spare your life.

438
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,880
See.

439
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,960
No one has ever wanted to

440
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,400
hear me complain these.

441
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,599
Mu Ze,

442
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,559
in fact, we are

443
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,640
the same.

444
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,279
From beginning to end,

445
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,640
we love ourselves the most.

446
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,319
But you and I are different.

447
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,519
At least I'm willing to face

448
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:39,880
my own desires.

449
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,920
And you?

450
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,559
You obviously love Lu Anran,

451
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,359
but you torture her and suspect her.

452
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,440
Admit it.

453
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,039
In front of her,

454
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,680
you feel inferior like a dog.

455
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,440
You're talking nonsense!

456
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,039
Do you know

457
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,160
why women can detect

458
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,680
when men change their minds?

459
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,519
People,

460
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,880
have two eyes.

461
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,359
But they can only look at one place.

462
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,759
In your eyes,

463
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,240
Lu Anran is the only one.

464
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,960
Ask you one last time,

465
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,240
where is Lu Anran?

466
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,799
I won't tell you

467
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,319
where the person you love most is.

468
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,920
This is my revenge on you.

469
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,079
Lu Xinran.

470
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:49,839
Lu Xinran.

471
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,319
It's not that easy for you to die.

472
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,400
Tell me where Lu Anran is.

473
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,000
Otherwise,

474
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,720
I'll make your life worse than death.

475
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,920
At this point,

476
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,880
you're still caring about Lu Anran.

477
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,319
Wait and see, Mu Ze.

478
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,920
From the sky to the earth.

479
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,240
From heaven to hell.

480
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,680
I'll make Lu Anran

481
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,799
can't be reborn forever.

482
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:32,780
(East Gate)

483
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,359
It's almost dawn.

484
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,079
Leader Shen and others went to search

485
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,759
for so long, but they haven't found yet.

486
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,240
Holly,

487
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,480
will Miss can't

488
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,880
come back?

489
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,599
Nonsense!

490
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:48,640
His Highness Prince Qi

491
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,039
and Qinghe Gang are all looking for her.

492
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,839
I'm sure there will be news soon.

493
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,079
I'll look for it, too.

494
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,039
Wait a little longer.

495
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,599
If anything really happens to her,

496
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,680
I'll go with her.

497
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,960
After I arrive at hell,

498
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,599
I'll tell King of Hell that

499
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,319
he can't let Lu Xinran and her mother

500
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,079
continue to bully Miss.

501
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,079
Stop crying.

502
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,000
It's too early to say that.

503
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,559
Where is Lu Xinran's room?

504
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,279
Over here.

505
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,359
Your Highness,

506
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,599
where on earth is Miss?

507
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,240
Here, too.

508
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,599
What is Lu Xinran going to do?

509
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,960
Your Highness, here's another one.

510
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,480
Do you know what I was thinking

511
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,519
when I was dying?

512
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,079
I was thinking,

513
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,440
that's too bad.

514
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,279
The last time we saw each other,

515
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,279
we were all red-faced.

516
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,680
If I die like this,

517
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:40,720
the ending seems

518
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,839
not to be happy.

519
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,039
Maybe you still

520
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,400
have some regrets in your heart.

521
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,000
(Fate)

522
00:30:58,839 --> 00:30:59,599
(gave me)

523
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,359
(the chance to start over.)

524
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,839
(Why am I obsessed with this?)

525
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,119
(Why can't I let go of everything?)

526
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,880
(And be with you forever.)

527
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,400
Brother Chuan.

528
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:30,599
Brother Chuan.

529
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,319
Brother Shen.

530
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:32,359
Here we come.

531
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,440
Your Highness.

532
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,599
Is here the place?

533
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,960
Eleven meters under the ground,

534
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,880
combined with
any amount of mysterious curses.

535
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,039
This,

536
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,960
this is the most sinister

537
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,839
place in Hanjing.

538
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:51,599
Sir,

539
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,319
are you sure it's here?

540
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,599
This is the area.

541
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,880
Here it is.

542
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,759
Here it is. Start digging.

543
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:02,920
You three,

544
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,680
go get the tools.

545
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,319
The rest of you,

546
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,519
dig this area!

547
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,400
Yes. Leader.

548
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:07,599
Over there.

549
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:08,799
Go over there!

550
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,519

It doesn't matter.

I'll wait for her to wake up.

Your Highness, don't worry.

586
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,159
If Miss wakes up

587
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,840
and sees Your Highness like this,

588
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,079
I'm afraid she will blame us.

589
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,880
One accident after another
happens to the Lu family,

590
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,159
how can I not worry about her?

591
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,480
By the way,

592
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,639
what happened to Lu Xinran?

593
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,039
Why an insane woman

594
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:22,719
can do evil

595
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,119
under the eyes of so many people?

596
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,840
Your Highness, may I have a word with you?

597
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,239
Your Highness,

598
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,159
this is the current situation
of the Lu family.

599
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,119
I'll figure out a way

600
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:45,039
to solve this.

601
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,000
I know the innocence of the Lu family

602
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,760
better than anyone else.

603
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,719
But the difficulty in this matter is that

604
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,920
the person who framed the family is dead.

605
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,119
It's also just a dispute inside a family.

606
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
It can be regarded as a family matter,

607
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,360
but also can be seen as

608
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,760
a state matter.

609
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,239
Holly.

610
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,239
Take good care of your lady.

611
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,239
I'll go back and freshen up,

612
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,039
and go to the palace to meet His Majesty.

613
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,360
His Majesty appreciates

614
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:09,800
many good deeds of the Lu family.

615
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,920
I believe that after I explain it to him,

616
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,800
he will understand.

617
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:22,760
If your lady wakes up,

618
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,360
you must tell her,

619
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:25,880
don't worry.

620
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:27,880
I'm here no matter what happens.

621
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,599
Yes, Your Highness.

622
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,159
Your Highness Prince Qing,

623
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,039
Miss is still in a coma.

624
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,440
I'm sure it's hard

625
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,920
for her to talk to Your Highness now.

626
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,559
Why don't Your Highness go back first?

627
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,800
When Miss wakes up,

628
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,519
I will inform Your Highness
as soon as possible.

629
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,440
Get out of my way.

630
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,920
Leader Shen's sister

631
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,920
is quite arrogant.

632
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,400
But don't worry,

633
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,960
I won't embarrass

634
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,760
a woman who just survived.

635
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,760
Also,

636
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:26,400
don't get in my way.

637
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,119
And you?

638
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,679
You obviously love Lu Anran,

639
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,440
but you torture and suspect her.

640
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,360
Admit it.

641
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,199
In front of her,

642
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,679
you feel inferior like a dog.

643
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:31,960
Why are you here?

644
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,119
Why are you so nervous

645
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,239
when you look at me?

646
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,079
I really underestimate you.

647
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,199
Not only did you set me up,

648
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,559
fooling me around,

649
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,320
you also seduced

650
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,360
ninth brother silently.

651
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,519
He is so fascinated.

652
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,360
The prison of Hanjing

653
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,000
is really cold.

654
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,760
Your father suffers a relapse

655
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:13,800
in the prison.

656
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,400
He is painful.

657
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,480
What do you think will he consider

658
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,199
if he knows

659
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,760
all of this

660
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,440
was caused by his own daughter?

661
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,039
I've always heard from others that

662
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:32,320
if you want to kill a snake,
catch its weakness.

663
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,880
The brother is not your biological one,

664
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,000
but the father is your biological father.

665
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,440
Tell me,

666
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,039
do I

667
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,920
catch your weakness this time?

668
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,400
Mu Ze,

669
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,920
apart from these despicable methods,

670
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,800
what else do you know?

671
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,480
How shameless.

672
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,480
I've told you long ago.

673
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,119
There is

674
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:56,960
no difference between good and bad means.

675
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,239
As long as I can achieve my goal,

676
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,039
I can do everything.

677
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:10,960
Lu Anran,

678
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,760
your father colludes with the enemy
and commits treason

679
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,320
by connecting with the North privately.

680
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,519
Is he framed?

681
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:22,559
Or is he really unfaithful?

682
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,000
It depends on your choice.

683
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,760
Judging from the way you look at me,

684
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,079
you won't marry me for sure.

685
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,440
Then I can remind you,

686
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:40,840
now I'm willing to let you be

687
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,079
the concubine of Prince Qing's Mansion.

688
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,960
If you really make me angry,

689
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,119
I can make you

690
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,599
the dog of Prince Qing's Mansion.

691
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,440
You can have a try if you don't believe.

692
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,679
Why do you have to marry me?

693
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,840
Because I hate you.

694
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,079
All the way here, you rack your brain to

695
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:05,039
kill my right-hand men.

696
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,280
You almost made it.

697
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,119
I,

698
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:11,320
want to use the means you hate the most

699
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,679
to get back at you.

700
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,960
To torture you.

701
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,920
I want to make your life worse than death.

702
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,519
Regret what you did.

703
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,360
Let go of me!

704
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,119
Listen carefully.

705
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,239
I'll give you three days

706
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,280
to think about it.

707
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,800
Think about it carefully.

708
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,679
I won't marry you even if you kill me.

709
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:34,760
What?

710
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,199
Let me tell you,

711
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,519
even if you're a ghost,

712
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,800
you should be a ghost of
Prince Qing's Mansion.

713
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:43,400
Remember it.
