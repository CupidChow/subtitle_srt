=Episode 2=

2
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,650
(Mansion of Prince Qing)

3
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
(Five years later)

4
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,599
Lingxi.

5
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,319
Why hasn't His Highness come back yet?

6
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,280
It's sister's birthday today.

7
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,959
The Princess says don't rush him.

8
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,400
The birthday comes every year.

9
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,799
Highness is busy with business.

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,079
Don't bother him.

11
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,359
Highness married you

12
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,599
only for 5 years, now he

13
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,920
marries Xiao Jingque as a concubine.

14
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,599
We Lu Family

15
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,840
give him money and boats

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,079
when needed.

17
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,959
He disappoints you.

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,640
Now people prefer the pen to the sword.

19
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,959
Over so many years,

20
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,599
Xiao Ying is the only one

21
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,040
who is brave and battlewise.

22
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:05,920
His Highness will definitely

23
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,879
make people like Xiao Ying

24
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,000
under his command.

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,159
I thought

26
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,560
Mr. Cai

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,759
lied to me.

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,199
I didn't expect

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,719
it was you who agreed to marry

30
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,840
Xiao Ying's sister.

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,039
Since His Highness chose this path,

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,280
it's impossible to

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,360
not marry others.

34
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,560
Earlier or later.

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,599
There's no difference.

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,719
I'm satisfied as long as

37
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,479
he loves me.

38
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,560
Mother!

39
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,439
Yu.

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,840
It's perfect timing.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,520
Meal is ready.

42
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,800
Sit down. Yun.

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,919
Come here.

44
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,120
It's all you like.

45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,960
Yun, have meals.

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,800
(Yu, Lu Anran's son)
Don't be picky.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,479
It's so lively here.

48
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,199
Princess.

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,759
Happy birthday.

50
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,319
This is the parrot specially

51
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,439
(Xiao Jingque, King Qing's concubine)
picked for you.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,360
Please take it.

53
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,280
You're thoughtful.

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,759
It's so beautiful.

55
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,319
If Little Prince teaches it well,

56
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,960
it may learn to speak.

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,319
Spring grasses rest after 5 years.

58
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,319
There're no roads ahead now.

59
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,240
Xiao Jingque!

60
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,439
You're too arrogant.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,080
Why did you teach the parrot

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,439
these words?

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,520
Don't get me wrong.

64
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,840
How can I control

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,840
what an animal says.

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,280
If it's not you,

67
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,800
who else could it be?

68
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,360
It parrots

69
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,199
your bad ideas.

70
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,280
Sister,

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,960
she must be severely punished today.

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,759
I'm here to give

73
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,120
gifts to the Princess.

74
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,680
If Princess

75
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,719
punishes me for this,

76
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,560
what will people think of you

77
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,240
when others know it.

78
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,360
Lingxi.

79
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,400
Take Yu away.

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,960
Yes.

81
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,639
Princess is really generous.

82
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,759
Highness has been saying it.

83
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,240
Icy jadeite from Jiaodong.

84
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,680
Assistant Minister of works's father-in-law

85
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,479
is in charge of

86
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,719
the biggest jade market in Jiaodong.

87
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,120
They're generous this time.

88
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,879
Gold hairpin with jade.

89
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,199
This hairpin

90
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,759
should be in the palace of the former dynasty.

91
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,519
The old lady in Head of the Secretariat's Mansion

92
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,759
is the deceased
emperor's younger sister.

93
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,680
She loves handicraft using kingfisher's feathers for ornament.

94
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,560
Kneel down.

95
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,480
What?

96
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,360
Yun.

97
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,079
Lu Anran, you treat me like this,

98
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,160
aren't you afraid His Highness will come

99
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,959
and punish you?

100
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,800
I will not care about

101
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,720
what a bird says.

102
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,639
But if what you did

103
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,800
gets His Highness into trouble,

104
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,839
and gets us into trouble,

105
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,920
I'll kill you.

106
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,360
What do you mean?

107
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,920
The bracelet,

108
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,439
the hairpin,

109
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,319
and the brocade on you

110
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,480
are all from ladies of

111
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,600
Hanjing officials, right?

112
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,639
Do you know why

113
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,800
they sent you these?

114
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,879
The court is investigating

115
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,000
long-standing abuse and eliminating corruptions.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,519
Minister of Works is

117
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,920
the source of evil.

118
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,480
Do you want His Highness to die

119
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,480
by taking their gifts?

120
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,720
But these

121
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,519
are their gifts for me.

122
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,920
To congratulate a concubine?

123
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,839
Do you think your Xiao family

124
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,839
is strong enough?

125
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,360
You're really vain.

126
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,839
Return all the gifts.

127
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,839
And give them

128
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,240
double gifts in return.

129
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,079
When things are done,

130
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,480
shut yourself up and reflect yourself.

131
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,000
Xinran, Yun.

132
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,920
Sit down and eat.

133
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,279
I think,

134
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,839
the punishment is too light.

135
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,199
If you don't

136
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,439
find out today

137
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,680
I wonder what kind of calamities

138
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,120
she may induce.

139
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,439
Being pleased by others,

140
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,839
she forgets herself.

141
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,279
Xiao Family is Highness's right-hand man.

142
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,759
Just touched in passing.

143
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,240
Yun,

144
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,519
why are you in a daze?

145
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,959
I don't want to eat.

146
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,160
Sister,

147
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,120
I'm going to fight in North.

148
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,040
Are you kidding me?

149
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,360
Do you know

150
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,839
how dangerous the North is?

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,480
You're the only male in the Lu family.

152
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,680
You have to think about

153
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,639
our mother and father.

154
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,920
Everyone has parents.

155
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,519
I don't want to

156
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,000
fight the rogues and

157
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,319
catch the river bandit

158
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,360
in the name of Princess Qing all my life.

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,879
A man should

160
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,040
make contributions.

161
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,480
And I also want to

162
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,879
to help two brothers-in-law.

163
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,439
I'll surely go North.

164
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,720
I will take care of myself.

165
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,680
I'll achieve a great success,

166
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,519
and be your most reliable backer.

167
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,240
Our Yun's ambition is far and wide.

168
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,120
You long for the hot-blooded battlefield.

169
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:55,839
And want to be

170
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,519
a great general who
fights against the enemy.

171
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,800
Then you shouldn't be trapped

172
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,120
in small places like the capital.

173
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,319
I'll definitely live up to

174
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,279
sister's expectations.

175
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,480
I will never come back

176
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
without winning the battle.

177
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,160
Come,

178
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,759
here's to you.

179
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,000
Yu,

180
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,120
look at this vine.

181
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,360
Is it good or not?

182
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,839
Yes.

183
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,519
When the pulp grows,

184
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,160
we will have grapes every day.

185
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,199
Ok.

186
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,199
Yu.

187
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,800
Father.

188
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,879
Father, why are you so late?

189
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
My mother and I

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
have been waiting for a long time.

191
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,160
It's my fault.

192
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,000
Can you help me

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,040
comfort your mother?

194
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,199
Don't listen to him.

195
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,319
I just received the new picture

196
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,600
from the shipyard.

197
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,360
Yu asked me to play with him,

198
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,839
so I just finished half of it.

199
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,279
Is the boat

200
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,399
that can fight?

201
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,040
It's called wheel boat.

202
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,120
Both sides

203
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,079
are equipped with wooden leaf wheels

204
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,959
which need stepping by men.

205
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,519
The speed is ten times

206
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,800
higher than average boats.

207
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,000
I know.

208
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,680
You always thought for me.

209
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,360
But after all,

210
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
it's your birthday today.

211
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,199
You should

212
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,319
take a good rest.

213
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,560
Do you remember it?

214
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,600
Of course.

215
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,279
See,

216
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,600
this is for you.

217
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,600
It's so beautiful.

218
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,959
Highness,

219
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,360
Mrs. Xiao fainted.

220
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,920
Madam, His Highness is here.

221
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,639
Your Highness,

222
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,360
you're finally here.

223
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,159
Congratulations, Your Highness.

224
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,639
Mrs. Xiao is pregnant.

225
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,759
she should rest for a few days.

226
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,080
Thank you, doctor.

227
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,799
Now,

228
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,279
you're pregnant.

229
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,279
Then,

230
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,440
rest early.

231
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,679
Your Highness,

232
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,039
sister locked me up.

233
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,159
Our child is not feeling well.

234
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,960
No need to be confined.

235
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
Rest assured and
take care of your child.

236
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,120
It's getting late.

237
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,720
Have an early rest.

238
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,039
Your Highness.

239
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:24,879
Your Highness.

240
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,850
(Five months later)

241
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,240
General Xiao

242
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,120
wiped the north enemies out.

243
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,759
Now you are pregnant,

244
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,000
Prince Qing must be happy

245
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,879
when he knows it.

246
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,360
Be careful.

247
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,240
Unfortunately

248
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,720
I am just a concubine.

249
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,080
Even if this child is favored,

250
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,960
he is born of concubine.

251
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:02,720
Aunt,

252
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,519
fly a kite with me.

253
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,720
Show me your hand.

254
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,519
Can't you see me walking?

255
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,840
What if I fall down?

256
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,600
Why are you so naughty?

257
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,480
Please forgive him, Madam.

258
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,039
Little Prince didn't mean to.

259
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,039
If anything happens Madam's belly,

260
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,720
you and your Master

261
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,039
are to blame.

262
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,200
Madam!

263
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,759
I will tell father

264
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,200
you bullied me.

265
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,120
When younger brothers and sisters are born,

266
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,480
I won't make it easy for them.

267
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,879
Don't take it personally, Madam.

268
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Children say what they like.

269
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll take Little Prince back.

270
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,080
Don't cry, Little Prince.

271
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,159
Let's go fishing.

272
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,759
Does he just say what he likes?

273
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,279
Shan Yue.

274
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,840
The wood must be fireproofed.

275
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,679
It's for fighting.

276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,799
If the enemy wants to attack with fire,

277
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:20,639
we can't

278
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,120
fulfill their wish.

279
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,559
According to

280
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,879
Princess's order,

281
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,519
We tried to simulate the battle

282
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,879
from all angles.

283
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,559
We have located the suitable position

284
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,600
and covered it with a layer of iron.

285
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,080
Then it will be

286
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,399
fireproof.

287
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,480
It's getting late.

288
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,159
Why don't you go back first?

289
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,799
Okay, you keep working.

290
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,679
I'm going back.

291
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,320
Don't worry, Princess.

292
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,919
What are you doing?

293
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,879
Why did you put Yu'er in a shroud?

294
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,360
Princess.

295
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,120
It's all my fault.

296
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,399
Little Prince said he wanted to fish.

297
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,519
When I went back to get the bait,

298
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,399
he fell into the pool.

299
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,039
When I come back,

300
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,320
Little Prince...

301
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,679
I'm sorry to you.

302
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,000
I will die to apologize.

303
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,559
I'm sorry to you.

304
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,200
Yu.

305
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,200
I will die to apologize.

306
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,720
Yu.

307
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,559
Yu.

308
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,279
Mom comes back, Yu.

309
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,240
Yu.

310
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,960
Open your eyes.

311
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,600
Okay?

312
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,919
Yu.

313
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,679
Yu has always been obedient.

314
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,480
He won't go to

315
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,279
dangerous places alone.

316
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,519
How could he die?

317
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,399
Little Prince bumped into Mrs. Xiao

318
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,799
carelessly,

319
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and got beaten up.

320
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,559
I'm afraid that Little Prince

321
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,519
conflicted with Mrs. Xiao,

322
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,840
so I took him to the pond to play.

323
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,799
Yu.

324
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,279
It's all my fault.

325
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,200
I shouldn't have brought Little Prince

326
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,679
to the pond.

327
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,039
Yu.

328
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,440
My good boy.

329
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,279
Yu.

330
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,440
Yu.

331
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,080
Wake up, Yu.

332
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,080
Yu.

333
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,879
Yu.

334
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:35,879
Mom is back.

335
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,840
Yu.

336
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,720
Princess.

337
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,519
I...

338
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,759
I saw Mrs. Xiao walked from

339
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,639
the back of the rockery

340
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,840
when Little Prince was drowned.

341
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,440
She looked very flustered,

342
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,080
and almost tripped over a stone.

343
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,679
Xiao Jingque, I'm going to kill you.

344
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,159
Lu Anran!

345
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,759
Are you crazy?

346
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,759
I'm pregnant

347
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,000
with His Highness's child.

348
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,720
What about my son Yu?

349
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,919
Your Highness, help me!

350
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,320
Stop!

351
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,879
Lu Anran, are you crazy?

352
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,600
When Yu was drowned,

353
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,799
I really saw Xiao Jingque

354
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,120
in Moxuan Temple.

355
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,879
I even came to her

356
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,360
and cursed her.

357
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,120
Her name should be

358
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,279
on the merit book.

359
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,480
Xinran,

360
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,240
swear it.

361
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,360
You really saw her

362
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,919
in Moxuan Temple today.

363
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,720
Otherwise,

364
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,919
you'll never have a child,

365
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,960
and live a hard life.

366
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,360
I swear,

367
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,360
if I lied today,

368
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,720
I'll die in my boots.

369
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:25,960
Have no child,

370
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,200
and live hard.

371
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,399
How could it be?

372
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,240
Why not her?

373
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,159
His Highness has found out

374
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,360
the death of Yu

375
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,799
was an accident.

376
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,320
It's Mother Yun's carelessness that

377
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,759
results in Yu falling into the water.

378
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,679
Spring and Mother Yun

379
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
are like sisters,

380
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,879
so they lied.

381
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,799
They are already

382
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
flogged to death by His Highness.

383
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,919
But my son Yu,

384
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,600
can never come to life.

385
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,480
He'll never come back.

386
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,480
If it wasn't she,

387
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,600
who can I revenge to?

388
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,840
Today, brother's family letter

389
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,200
says he has burned

390
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,240
the enemy's grain camp successfully.

391
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,159
Now,

392
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,879
Your Highness can rest assured.

393
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,399
With your brother's support,

394
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,159
I've had a lot of success.

395
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,600
Your Highness.

396
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,240
I don't know

397
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,799
what mistake I made.

398
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,759
Murdering Little Prince.

399
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,480
Isn't it a mistake?

400
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,960
Hasn't Your Highness found out the truth?

401
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,759
Second daughter of Lu

402
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:05,960
can testify for me.

403
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,920
Why do you think

404
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,960
Lu Xinran testifies for you?

405
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,160
That's because I want to protect you.

406
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,599
I know very well

407
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,640
the royal children

408
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,119
always die earlier than

409
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,400
average children.

410
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,400
I don't care

411
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,640
losing a few children.

412
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,200
But it doesn't mean

413
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,559
you can do whatever you want.

414
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,160
Your Highness.

415
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,079
I know I'm wrong.

416
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,279
I know I'm wrong.

417
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,519
I am pregnant with

418
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,359
your child.

419
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:40,880
I won't dare anymore.

420
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,640
Your Highness.

421
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
I know I was wrong.

422
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
I know I was wrong.

423
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,839
You should pay for

424
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,519
your wrong doings.

425
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,480
What price

426
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,720
are you willing to pay?

427
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,119
Yes.

428
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,720
I heard that

429
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,960
there're many soldiers

430
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,839
in Xiao Family's courtyard.

431
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,000
What does it mean?

432
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,599
Your Highness.

433
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,880
Brother is loyal to you.

434
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,680
All the secret soldiers in our mansion

435
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,960
all for protecting Your Highness

436
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,200
in the future.

437
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,440
If Your Highness doesn't leave us,

438
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,519
my brother and I

439
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,039
are willing to send all soldiers

440
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,759
to you.

441
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,440
Alright.

442
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,559
Your hand got burned

443
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,799
carelessly today.

444
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,240
Rest in the yard.

445
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,319
Bear in mind,

446
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,640
don't bother Princess.

447
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,920
Or next time,

448
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,960
I can't catch the sword from her.

449
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,000
You leave first.

450
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,000
Don't do that.

451
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,799
The matter of Yu

452
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,799
was an accident.

453
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,519
Mu Ze,

454
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,359
it is your own son who died.

455
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,160
How could you be so calm?

456
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,440
Now,

457
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,799
I suspect

458
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,480
whether you loved Yu,

459
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,480
whether you loved me before.

460
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,759
In order not to immerse herself in

461
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,519
Yu's death,

462
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,839
Lu Anran has been

463
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,559
in the shipyard all day.

464
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,319
Finally,

465
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,359
after 5 months, the wheeled boat

466
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,359
entered the water successfully.

467
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:13,960
Princess.

468
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,000
The boat has successfully entered the water.

469
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,680
Nice.

470
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,559
Do soldiers of

471
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,599
Dahan can use

472
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,880
new wheeled boat afterwards?

473
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,839
His Highness will surely be happy

474
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,440
when he knows it.

475
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,519
Princess,

476
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,559
the new wheeled boat now

477
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,119
has entered the water successfully.

478
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,000
You have no excuses to

479
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,960
hide here.

480
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,599
Little Prince has passed away for half a year.

481
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,440
His Highness has found out the truth.

482
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,039
Why do you still blame him?

483
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
If you keep

484
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,079
staying away from His Highness,

485
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,519
he will be taken by

486
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:45,680
that tiresome Sparrow.

487
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,240
If it can be taken away,

488
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,920
then it doesn't belong to me.

489
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,359
Prince Qing, congratulations.

490
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,359
Congratulations, Second Brother.

491
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:57,720
Congratulations for the birth of son.

492
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:58,640
Come on.

493
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,480
Let me hug you.

494
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,079
You naughty boy,

495
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,400
we haven't met for a long time.

496
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,680
You must be working

497
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,039
in the field every day.

498
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,839
I'm used to it.

499
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,559
Since you come, stay for

500
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,559
a few more days, and chat with me.

501
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,960
Keep boasting of it.

502
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:16,920
Annoying.

503
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:17,839
They fear that

504
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,960
people don't know a son was born.

505
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,279
Princess.

506
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,720
Do you really not go to the front hall

507
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,880
and lower that Sparrow's arrogance?

508
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,200
If you don't show up,

509
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,839
guests

510
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,799
really think she is

511
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,119
the mistress of Mansion of Prince Qing.

512
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,240
It's shameful to be jealous.

513
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,599
If you want to, do it yourself.

514
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:34,720
But

515
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,480
if she keeps being arrogant,

516
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:36,759
who else in the mansion

517
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:37,640
remembers Yu?

518
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,480
Princess.

519
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Sorry.

520
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,559
I...

521
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,599
It's my fault.

522
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,160
It's my fault.

523
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,480
It's OK.

524
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,000
Clean up this place.

525
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,240
I'm going to the garden for some air.

526
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,720
You're comfortable.

527
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,480
Lying here in the sun.

528
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,000
Why are you here alone?

529
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:03,960
They are so hypocritical,

530
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,519
saying a child without eyebrows

531
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,200
can definitely be a talent

532
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,599
in the future.

533
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,640
This is for you.

534
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,759
It's other's one-month-old feast.

535
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,359
Why did you give me a gift?

536
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,319
The South is rich in silver.

537
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,160
When I traveled there,

538
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,759
I helped an old monk

539
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,920
to arrange his farmland.

540
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,319
Then he forced me to have it.

541
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,079
He said

542
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,440
it is to ward off evil and keep safe.

543
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,279
Just keep it.

544
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,240
The old monk you met

545
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,519
must be an aristocrat.

546
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,880
This bracelet is pure in color.

547
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,079
White and smooth.

548
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,160
It is definitely from

549
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,039
a civilian.

550
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,400
Then you should keep it.

551
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,640
This bracelet is not only precious,

552
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,759
but under incense with
the old monk

553
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:17,759
in the temple for many years.

554
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:19,400
It must be blessed.

555
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,000
You don't have to

556
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,440
comfort me obliquely.

557
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,559
I've also experienced

558
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,680
the pain of the death of the beloved.

559
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,319
But I figured it out.

560
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,920
The world is so beautiful.

561
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,519
Since we are

562
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,559
the ones who live.

563
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,880
Why not enjoy

564
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,799
the green mountains and rivers,

565
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,319
taste delicious food for them.

566
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:47,759
To live

567
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:48,839
a better life.

568
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,519
When we meet them again,

569
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,039
we can tell it

570
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,200
to them.

571
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,880
I'll keep the bracelet.

572
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,279
Thank you very much.

573
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,640
Are you...

574
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,279
Are you still blaming second brother?

575
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,319
I just don't get it.

576
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,359
Why am I the only one

577
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,640
who is sad?

578
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,000
So you two

579
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,200
are resting here.

580
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,359
Second brother.

581
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,319
We are a family.

582
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,400
Don't care much about rules.

583
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,079
Have a seat.

584
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,319
This is?

585
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:40,680
Ninth brother is kind-hearted.

586
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,079
He gives me to ward off evil.

587
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,839
Is it from travelling again?

588
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,400
I'm so jealous.

589
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:48,720
You're so lucky.

590
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:49,559
Every time you travel,

591
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,359
you will bring some rare things.

592
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,640
Just borrow other's things as the gift.

593
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,960
I'm homeless and jobless.

594
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,519
I must cherish it.

595
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,799
Homeless and jobless?

596
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,920
From what you said,

597
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,240
do you want to start a family now?

598
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,799
Second brother,

599
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,319
don't do what those matchmakers do.

600
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,640
I can't do,

601
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,880
but,

602
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,960
second sister-in-law can do this.

603
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:21,839
Ninth brother,

604
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,319
do you like any girl?

605
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
I don't like girls.

606
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,720
You don't like girls?

607
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,039
I.

608
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:27,519
No.

609
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,799
Well, I...

610
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,119
I don't like anyone.

611
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
In this case,

612
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,880
you must love someone.

613
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,799
Well,

614
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,079
you naughty boy.

615
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,559
How dare you cheat me?

616
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,640
Tell us.

617
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,799
I want to know

618
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:52,920
what kind of girl

619
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,680
caught your eyes.

620
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,039
She...

621
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,799
is not as gentle as

622
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,359
other girls.

623
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,319
She is quick-witted.

624
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,880
When she talks about her ambitions,

625
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
her eyes glow.

626
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,839
The first time I met her,

627
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,200
she was under the sun.

628
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,880
The sunlight makes her more charming.

629
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,279
Which girl?

630
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,519
Ask your second brother to help you

631
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,519
and propose to her.

632
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,279
Okay.

633
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,839
I planned to

634
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,960
find her after

635
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,319
I finished farming.

636
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,599
But

637
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,079
she's married to someone else.

638
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,839
What a pity.

639
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,240
The fate is shallow.

640
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,640
Ninth brother.

641
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,960
Don't just focus on

642
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,880
the farmland afterwards.

643
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,400
When you meet a girl you like,

644
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,799
don't miss her anymore.

645
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:18,839
Second brother,

646
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,079
why are you depressed

647
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,119
on the big day?

648
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,119
You were here too.

649
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,440
Your second sister-in-law

650
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,359
is still sad about

651
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,519
Yu's death.

652
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,960
She is aloof from me now.

653
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,480
I don't know

654
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,640
when she can

655
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,519
forgive me.

656
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,359
Second brother,

657
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,119
second sister-in-law

658
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,279
asked me a question just now.

659
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,599
What did she ask?

660
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:46,880
Second sister-in-law asked me

661
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,920
why she is the only one who is sad.

662
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,720
Since we are

663
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,640
the ones who live,

664
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,279
why not enjoy

665
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,319
the green mountains and rivers,

666
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,559
taste delicious food for them.

667
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,400
When we meet them again,

668
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:12,519
we can tell it

669
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,559
to them.

670
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,680
Princess, your mood

671
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,079
looks better today.

672
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,359
Because I got good comforts.

673
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,119
The moon is so pretty tonight.

674
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,119
I live in the world,

675
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
while my son died.

676
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,480
It's cold in autumn now,

677
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,119
hope my son can be warm.

678
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,680
It is...

679
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,480
It is His Highness's handwriting.

680
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:02,640
Princess.

681
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,440
Seems His Highness

682
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,799
hasn't forgotten Little Prince.

683
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,119
Where are you going?

684
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,680
You remember Yu.

685
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,880
Why didn't you tell me?

686
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,680
I only care about myself.

687
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,599
I thought you

688
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,640
had forgotten about Yu.

689
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,640
Yu is also my son.

690
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,279
How could I forget him so easily?

691
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,039
Anran.

692
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,559
We pull through

693
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,119
and get here.

694
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,240
Now for me,

695
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,519
I only have you.

696
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,920
Do you know

697
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,519
you're the only family

698
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,119
to me in my mind.

699
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,759
After Yun comes back,

700
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,839
I'll take Father and Second Madam

701
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:24,799
to Hanjing.

702
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,319
Our family will be reunited.

703
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,400
The good news has arrived.

704
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,839
Yun is on his way back.

705
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,480
He'll be here in a couple of days.

706
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,359
News arrived.

707
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,119
Highness.

708
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,680
General Xiao has returned.

709
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,680
But General Lu died.

710
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:44,759
He led the pioneers,

711
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,920
pursued the enemy for thousands miles,

712
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,759
but was ambushed.

713
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:49,319
They fought for 7 days

714
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,839
and died of exhaustion.

715
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,400
We only have this.

716
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,279
Princess, please restrain your grief.

717
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,240
Nonsense!

718
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,559
It is not

719
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,480
on the report.

720
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,679
Your Highness.

721
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,440
According to General Xiao,

722
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:40,239
General Lu had a chance to come out.

723
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,119
But General Qin's reinforcements

724
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,079
didn't arrive on time.

725
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,199
So General Lu died.

726
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,920
The reason why we didn't report

727
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:48,280
is we worried the military would be disorganized.

728
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,119
Yun will live up to

729
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,559
sister's expectations.

730
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,719
I'll never come back

731
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,039
without winning the battle.

732
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,280
Doctor.

733
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:35,960
How is she?

734
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,880
Your Highness.

735
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,719
Princess's symptom

736
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,639
is irregular pulse.

737
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,960
And,

738
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,880
she has been depressed for a long time.

739
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,960
She was stimulated today,

740
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,239
the situation becomes worse.

741
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,840
I...

742
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,960
I'm afraid

743
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,519
I can do nothing.

744
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
Unless...

745
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Unless what?

746
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,320
Unless there's Wedelia wallichii Less.

747
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,400
However,

748
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,239
it is used up

749
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:09,920
last year.

750
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,719
Where can I get it?

751
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:13,639
I'll find it.

752
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,400
I heard there're some in Shixiu Mountain.

753
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,920
Draw a picture of it.

754
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,119
I'll pick some.

755
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,880
Wedelia wallichii Less prefers

756
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,639
shadow and damp,

757
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,000
so they grow on the cliff in the shade.

758
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,559
If Your Highness goes...

759
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,039
No problem.

760
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,840
Draw it.

761
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,280
Yes.

762
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,639
Your Majesty.

763
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,760
Prince Yi ignored the danger of war,

764
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,679
asked General Qin Yekuo

765
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,960
(Major General, Xiao Ying)
to delay deliberately.

766
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:01,960
They impeded the reinforcements

767
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,199
(Emperor Jing, Mu Shenghong)
to help the front troops.

768
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,199
As a result, they all died.

769
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,840
There's irrefutable evidence.

770
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,360
Witness and evidence are all there.

771
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,880
Your Majesty.

772
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,440
Please give justice to soliders

773
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,159
who died in vain.

774
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,500
(Fourth Prince, Mu Lin)

775
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,599
(Fourth Prince, Mu Lin)
Please get to the bottom of it, Father.

776
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I was wronged.

777
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,119
Uncle

778
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,360
must be framed.

779
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,000
The letter brought by

780
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,800
soldiers is from

781
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,440
General Qin.

782
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,800
How can others frame him?

783
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,239
Mu Lin.

784
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,719
How bold you are!

785
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,599
I was really wronged.

786
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,639
It must be someone who framed me.

787
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:42,639
Since General Qin is

788
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:45,400
Prince Yi's uncle,

789
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,920
it is hard to believe

790
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,079
if Prince Yi says that

791
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,880
he's ignorant of it.

792
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,360
This is

793
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,920
found in

794
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,119
General Lu's camp.

795
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,000
General Lu

796
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:00,320
has the evidence of Prince Yi's

797
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,840
embezzling money.

798
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:05,079
This is the reason

799
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,239
why Prince Yi and General Qin

800
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,559
don't send troops to

801
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,639
help General Lu.

802
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,719
This is a whole army.

803
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:21,360
As a prince,

804
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,519
you regard soldiers' life

805
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,079
as rubbish,

806
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,280
and embezzle money.

807
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,320
You are insatiable.

808
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,960
It's outrageous.

809
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,239
Father.

810
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,360
Father, please investigate it, father.

811
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
How dare you!

812
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,360
The evidence is irrefutable.

813
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,079
Why are you making excuses?

814
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,599
It's you.

815
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:43,480
It's you.

816
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,199
It must be you who framed me.

817
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,280
How can you compete with me?

818
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,159
You have nothing.

819
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:52,960
You can only use

820
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,039
the worst means like this.

821
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:55,920
I never thought

822
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,760
to compete with you.

823
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,280
I'm ignorant of

824
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,800
what happened today.

825
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,239
Now your second sister-in-law

826
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,400
fainted because of death of her brother.

827
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:06,559
She hasn't woken up yet.

828
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,199
How dare you pour

829
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,800
the dirty water on me?

830
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,400
You!

831
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,199
Father.

832
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,079
Father!

833
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,159
I'm here to summon you.

834
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,000
Remove Mu Lin's throne of Prince.

835
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,719
Lock up him in Prince Yi's Mansion.

836
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,400
Never step out of

837
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,400
Prince Yi's Mansion without imperial edicts.

838
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,679
Father.

839
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,199
Please think twice.

840
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:40,880
Father!

841
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,280
You!

842
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,480
Your eyes are dim.

843
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,800
You're ignorant.

844
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,519
Your Highness, don't be ridiculous.

845
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,599
Shut up.

846
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,239
I'm the right one

847
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,119
for the Crown Prince.

848
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:55,679
Punish me?

849
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,400
Are you going to

850
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,119
let people like him,

851
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,239
who has no mother,

852
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,599
no background to govern Dahan?

853
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,920
Soldiers. Soldiers!

854
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,360
Who dares to touch me?

855
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,039
I'm the Crown Prince's candidate!

856
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,119
Who dares to touch me?

857
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:14,760
Let go of me!

858
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:15,719
Let me go!

859
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,519
I should be the Crown Prince!

860
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:19,719
Let go of me!

861
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,480
Don't move.

862
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,639
Let me go!

863
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,719
I should be the Crown Prince!

864
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,880
Let go of me!

865
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:31,239
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

866
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:31,880
Father!

867
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,239
Call Imperial Doctor Jiang.

868
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:45,719
Prince Qing.

869
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,719
What do you have to say?

870
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,480
There's one thing

871
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,639
that needs your help.

872
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,239
Stand and say it.

873
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:56,800
(The Empress, Lin Wanzhen)

874
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,360
Mother.

875
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,719
My natural mother's

876
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,079
status is low

877
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
and she passed away eariler.

878
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,800
Growing up in this big imperial palace,

879
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,119
I suffered from

880
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,719
indifference and contempt.

881
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:12,440
Luckily,

882
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,280
you bring me up.

883
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,079
You and Chuan

884
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,679
were not born of me.

885
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,920
Both of your

886
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,320
natural mothers

887
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,159
passed away.

888
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,480
You two stayed with me all the time.

889
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,760
I have already regarded you

890
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,320
as my own children.

891
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,039
I also know

892
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,760
you want to be

893
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,760
the Crown Prince

894
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,039
these years.

895
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,760
Now,

896
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,800
Mu Lin is not

897
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,519
Prince anymore.

898
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,719
I will persuade your father

899
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,360
to decide the Crown Prince

900
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,199
as soon as possible

901
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,239
when he becomes better.

902
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,039
Mother.

903
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,159
Actually, I have thought about it.

904
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,960
Father fell ill suddenly this time,

905
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,760
so he didn't impose any sanctions against General Qin.

906
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,679
And Mu Lin,

907
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:09,880
though he is not Prince now,

908
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,039
his power

909
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:13,119
in the court still exists.

910
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,320
If Imperial Noble Consort

911
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:17,400
says some good words for him when father is awake,

912
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,760
Then Mu Lin

913
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,880
can be back on his foot again.

914
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,599
There's a turning point for him.

915
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,320
Go ahead.

916
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:28,159
What do you want to do?
