2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,540
(February, The Third Year of Jinghe
Hanjing City)

3
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,560
The bubbles of imperial power

4
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,199
and wealth burst.

5
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,400
Mu Ze,

6
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,520
for the highest power,

7
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,439
how many people have you killed,

8
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
causing devastating bloodshed?

9
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,919
Hadn't I embarked on the road with you,

10
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,759
I couldn't have turned into your accomlpice,

11
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,360
suffering such consequences.

12
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,500
(A Decade Ago
Su City)

13
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,039
Miss,

14
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,639
did we make it?

15
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,199
Yes.

16
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,199
Sure enough,
if we make mines with cows' bladders,

17
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,159
the mines won't leak anymore.

18
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:02,919
They are more explosive

19
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,960
than before.

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,479
Miss, you are so intelligent.

21
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,599
With the mines,

22
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,840
we won't be afraid
of river robbers any longer.

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,159
You dare to make a scene

24
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,520
on the river of the Lu Family.

25
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,919
Do you think I am powerless?

26
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,400
I decide to name my mines

27
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,439
River Dragon.

28
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,319
Do you think it sounds mighty?

29
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,280
Yes.

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,599
Miss. Miss.

31
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,800
Something's wrong over there.

32
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,400
Seems to be river robbers stealing a boat.

33
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,840
Miss.

34
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,159
We don't have enough men here today.

35
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,280
We'd better run.

36
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,080
Why run?

37
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,400
Shan Yue, go full steam ahead.

38
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,680
Alright, I can try my River Dragon.

39
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,599
Go ahead.

40
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,680
Run now. Run.

41
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,960
Are you alright?

42
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,319
I didn't expect the robbers on this reach

43
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,079
to be so powerful.

44
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,639
They can compare

45
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,839
with martial arts masters.

46
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,439
Do you get hurt?

47
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,279
No.

48
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,519
I planned to give my hands,

49
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,279
but I was almost killed

50
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,399
by the robbers.

51
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,600
Thank you for saving me.

52
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:41,920
It is nothing.

53
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,360
Miss.

54
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,439
Miss.

55
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,160
Hold back tears.

56
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,360
Sorry.

57
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,639
She is easy to get emotional.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,639
The robbers of this reach are aggressive.

59
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
Have you lost anything?

60
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,279
No.

61
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,560
Thank you for your help.

62
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,759
Nothing at all.

63
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,480
I just threw

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,360
some River Dragons.

65
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,240
Shan Yue,

66
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,279
send these two River Dragons

67
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:14,839
to them

68
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,720
as a present for our meeting.

69
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:17,639
Copy that.

70
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,040
Take them. Don't make me awkward.

71
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,319
Could you tell me

72
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,879
which martial club do you learn from?

73
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Don't get me wrong.

74
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,120
Since I think he is adept at martial arts,

75
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,639
I want to invite his master

76
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,879
to teach my flawed sailors,

77
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,319
in case they are bullied.

78
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,199
My master passed away.

79
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,079
He couldn't help you now.

80
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,439
It's pity.

81
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,439
How about you join us?

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,680
Enjoy double salary,
food and shelter,

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,240
and two days off every week.

84
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,120
Miss,

85
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
we have urgent business.

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,720
Alright.

87
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,120
I don't like to push others either.

88
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,279
If we meet in the future,

89
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,639
do consider my advice.

90
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,040
Let's go.

91
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,279
Mr. Cai,

92
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,759
can you tell

93
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,759
which shipping business they are?

94
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,680
The double fish patterns on the sails

95
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,480
might be the sign of the Lu Family,

96
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,560
the biggest business in the Su City.

97
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,360
Is she Lu Anran?

98
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,399
Right.

99
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,040
It's her.

100
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,000
(Lu's Mansion)

101
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,519
Go. Go. Go.

102
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,040
Mom. Mom. Mom. It hurts.

103
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,800
(Shen Lanxi, First Madam of the Lu Family)
Tomorrow is your hair-pinning ceremony.

104
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,399
I got held up

105
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,399
on my way.

106
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,480
Ouch. It really hurts.

107
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,480
But Mom,

108
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,160
let me tell you,

109
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,759
during my trip to the south,

110
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,279
I found there is just a gorge

111
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,560
between South and Dahan.

112
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,800
If we can tunnel

113
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,839
through the gorge,

114
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,399
there will be a channel

115
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,759
between South and Dahan.

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,800
Shipping speeds

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,839
can at least double.

118
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,680
We can save costs by at least two times.

119
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,079
You, a girl,

120
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,399
talk about money all day.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,079
Do you know

122
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,680
your dad started to prepare

123
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,800
for your hair-pinning ceremony

124
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,879
since last month?

125
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
Look at you.

126
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,600
Dirty from head to toe.

127
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,000
Hurry up. Wash your clothes.

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,439
Stop.

129
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,439
Even hide from us.

130
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,800
Why can't we look at you?

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,879
Sis, you are back.

132
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,560
Let me have a look.

133
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,279
(Lu Yun, Young Master of Lu Family)
I bruised.

134
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,160
Embarrassed.

135
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,920
Yun.

136
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,120
Who did you fight with again?

137
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,839
The grandson of Ministry Councillor Sun.

138
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,600
A hefty man with an ugly face.

139
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
He said Lu Family had no power

140
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,920
but money.

141
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,639
Then, I threw a punch at him.

142
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,000
For his words,

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,439
just listen

144
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
but not to bear them in mind.

145
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,480
Must bear them in mind.

146
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
What did I teach you?

147
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,560
If you don't mess with me,
I won't do it back.

148
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,560
If you mess with me,

149
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,439
I will do it hundred times
more harshly in return.

150
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,240
Anran,

151
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,040
how can you teach your brother like this?

152
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,480
Yun is the only son

153
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,720
of our family.

154
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,519
Mom,

155
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,919
boys can't grow up

156
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,799
without fights.

157
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,600
What if after he grows up,

158
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,519
he becomes a playboy,

159
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,600
causing trouble?

160
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,440
Right?

161
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,279
You.

162
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,600
Anran's back.

163
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,559
Sis.

164
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,559
First Madam.

165
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,679
Yun, you get spirit.

166
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,639
I support you.

167
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,679
Yun. Yun.

168
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,000
Yun, where do you go?

169
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,000
(Liu Mingyu, Second Madam of Lu)
(Lu Xinran, Second daughter of Lu)

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,799
Sister, look at Yun.

171
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,960
He goes to the martial club every day.

172
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,279
Doesn't like studying.

173
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,879
He even can't count.

174
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,399
His future will be gloomy.

175
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,679
Never mind.

176
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,960
Second Madam, relax.

177
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,000
Yun said

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,720
he wanted to be a great general.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We can't bury

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,120
such an ambition.

181
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:09,879
What's more,

182
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,120
the Lu Family still has me.

183
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,279
Sister,

184
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,519
haven't you recovered form the cough?

185
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:22,039
I got better some days ago.

186
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,159
I don't know what's wrong with me recently.

187
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,919
I might have caught a cold.

188
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,320
Never mind.

189
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,399
Sister.

190
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,879
Let me hold you back to your room for a rest.

191
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,720
Anran.

192
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,120
You might be tired
since you just came back.

193
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,159
Take a shower and go to bed early tonight.

194
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,879
Tomorrow will be tough
as the hair-pinning ceremony will kick off.

195
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,159
Okay. Mom, Second Madam, excuse me.

196
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,799
Have a good rest.

197
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:46,919
Rest well.

198
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,360
Let's go, Lingxi.

199
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,679
Let's go.

200
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,720
Here, First Madam.

201
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,480
Miss,

202
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,440
the zhuanghua satin
embroidered with gold threads suit

203
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,639
Second Madam prepared for you

204
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,600
looks really exquisite.

205
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,559
Miss

206
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,879
must shine bright then.

207
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,600
It would be better

208
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,720
if my mother

209
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,080
could attend my ceremony.

210
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,519
She turned well

211
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,679
some days ago.

212
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:22,600
Why does she

213
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,879
cough badly today?

214
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,279
Madam

215
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,240
can't recover from the illness

216
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,279
in a minute.

217
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,240
The doctor has been sent.

218
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,279
The doctor said it is windy at the wharf.

219
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,120
Madam had better
have a rest at the mansion.

220
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,440
How is it?

221
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,919
Lu Qingzhou is interested

222
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,039
the Dayu Country's river map

223
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,519
sent by Your Highness.

224
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,759
But he said

225
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,039
although the neighbor's map is good,

226
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,320
his daughter

227
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,279
would travel south soon

228
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,279
to explore new seaways.

229
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,840
His daughter once said

230
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,720
good as others' maps are,

231
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,200
they can't compare with

232
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,480
each inch of roads she walked on.

233
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,759
So that every mountain and hill

234
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,039
are in her mind.

235
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,840
It seems that the daughter of Lu Family

236
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,559
boasts foresight indeed.

237
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,159
I had better

238
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,759
make preparations

239
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,759
for meeting this Miss Lu.

240
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,279
Miss Lu.

241
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,320
Miss Lu.

242
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,600
Miss Lu.

243
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,320
Miss Lu.

244
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,200
(Lu Qingzhou, Master of Lu Family)
Miss Lu.

245
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Miss Lu.

246
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,399
Why hasn't she arrived?

247
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:45,679
She might be here soon.

248
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,320
Dad.

249
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,559
Anran.

250
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
Why are you so late?

251
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,600
Dad.

252
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,879
Stop criticizing me.

253
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
I went to see mom.

254
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,360
The special guests are all here.

255
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,279
Let's start it.

256
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,919
Okay.

257
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,799
Dear all, today is my daughter's birthday.

258
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,279
Thank you for your coming afar.

259
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,879
With the first glass of wine,

260
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,879
I want to propose a toast to you.

261
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,519
You are welcome, Master Lu.

262
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,320
With the second glass of wine,

263
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,559
I want to propose a toast
to the special guests from the Mansion of Prince Qing.

264
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
I really appreciate

265
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,519
that my daughter is honored
to receive congratulations

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,039
from His Highness Prince Qing.

267
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,759
Never mind, Master Lu.

268
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,039
The Double Fish Order.

269
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,600
Yes. Right.

270
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,480
True.

271
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,720
The Double Fish Order.

272
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,519
You are eighteen this year.

273
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,879
Technically, your hair-pinning ceremony
is long overdue.

274
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,960
But I am reluctant to see you get married,

275
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,360
so it is put off till now.

276
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,320
The Double Fish Order.

277
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,759
Take it as my present

278
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,279
for your birthday.

279
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,759
With the Lu Family as your backup,

280
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,840
you will never be inferior

281
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,120
even after you tie the knot.

282
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,879
Flags!

283
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:40,639
Happy birthday to Miss Lu!

284
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,559
Wish you all the best!

285
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,639
Bravo!

286
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,559
Bravo!

287
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,360
These 36 flags

288
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,039
are sent by

289
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:50,879
36 port managers.

290
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,600
From today,

291
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,840
all the fleets from the 36 ports

292
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,600
are yours.

293
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
I leave the Lu Family

294
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,240
to you now.

295
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,039
I will live up to your expectation.

296
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,360
Bravo!

297
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,080
Wait a minute.

298
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,720
Big brother,

299
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,879
(Lu Yan, Second Master of Lu)
you are so biased.

300
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,519
Although Lu Yun is the son of Second Madam,

301
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,840
he is the only son

302
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,080
of the Lu Family after all.

303
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,919
How can you

304
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,799
let a green girl

305
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,799
to master the Lu Family?

306
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
I believe it is evident to all

307
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,919
that big sister's contribution

308
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,759
to the Fu Family's business.

309
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,039
I will be the first champion

310
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:32,799
if dad decides

311
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
to pass the family business to big sister.

312
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:35,200
You.

313
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,080
Sis, leave it alone.

314
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,480
Brother-in-law

315
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,960
always has a strong sense of justice.

316
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,440
I really appreciate it.

317
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,919
Yun was brought up

318
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,240
by First Madam.

319
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,159
Xinran and Anran are close sisters.

320
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Even though in the future

321
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,759
Anran takes charge of the Lu Family,

322
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,120
she will also take good care of us.

323
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,399
We know it well.

324
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,759
We have never conceived other thoughts.

325
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,320
Uncle, you are right.

326
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,039
The Lu Family isn't owned

327
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,919
by me alone.

328
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,600
But if uncle thinks

329
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,120
that we are grabbing fortunes,

330
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,399
then I am afraid you don't know

331
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,679
the reason why I travel

332
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,360
through the mountains and rivers

333
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
of Dahan.

334
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,519
Also, you dismiss

335
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,360
the strong bonds

336
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,320
among we siblings.

337
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,799
No matter it is channel widening,

338
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,759
converting wetland to farmland,

339
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,279
or port establishment,

340
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,559
connecting more trade routes,

341
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,879
we aim to

342
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,440
help more people earn bread.

343
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,879
This is the big family business

344
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,480
the Lu's son and daughters
should strive for instead.

345
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
The family business not only involves me,

346
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
but also involves you all.

347
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,679
Bravo!

348
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,039
Enjoy.

349
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,200
Please.

350
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,039
Anran.

351
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,279
What's wrong with your neck?

352
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,559
Dad. Second Madam.

353
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,519
I don't feel well.

354
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,840
I want to have a rest in the room.

355
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,799
Go back right now.

356
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,960
I do get erythema

357
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,639
at the right moment.

358
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,600
The feast is already over.

359
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,480
I didn't expect

360
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,159
Miss Lu hasn't left yet.

361
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,480
What brings you here?

362
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,000
I am here to celebrate your birthday

363
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,919
following my master.

364
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,919
But I didn't expect

365
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,320
the enthusiastic girl

366
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,679
on the ship last day

367
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,600
was Miss Lu.

368
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,799
Your master

369
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,080
must come for the Lu Family, right?

370
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,519
Prince Yi came before

371
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,879
followed by Prince Qing now.

372
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,919
Since they have time
to scramble for resources,

373
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:57,840
why don't they have time

374
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,200
to deal with flood problem?

375
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,519
As Dahan was built up by the waters,

376
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,079
it will often be troubled by floods

377
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,599
which are natural disasters.

378
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,799
The government officials are like sieves,

379
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,599
sifting rice for disaster relief

380
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,920
from top to bottom.

381
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,079
When the rice reaches victims,

382
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,559
they can only see rice bran.

383
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,759
I think this is a man-made disaster.

384
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,720
For natural disasters,

385
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,680
the best solution is to prevent them.

386
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,960
Disaster relief

387
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,039
is the last method.

388
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,680
It is just a palliative measure

389
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,880
before it's too late.

390
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,440
Then what do you think we should do?

391
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,720
The whole Dahan boasts lots of rivers.

392
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,519
Naturally, we should take advantage of them.

393
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,720
Working on hydraulic engineering
and river rebuilding.

394
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,240
For one thing,

395
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,640
we can make use of canals.

396
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,839
For another,

397
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,880
we can prevent farmland

398
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,119
from floods.

399
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,160
Then we can cope with the root cause.

400
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,680
I believe this is

401
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,119
why Miss Lu and Master Lu

402
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,839
merged 36 ports.

403
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,519
But I think

404
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,000
flood control

405
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,440
is the matter of the court.

406
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,119
If the Lu Family can collaborate

407
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,119
with the court,

408
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,559
I believe

409
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:08,599
Miss Lu

410
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,119
can realize your dream
as soon as possible.

411
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,319
I believe in myself

412
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,599
than in the court.

413
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,200
But as you are knowledgeable,

414
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,720
you don't bow

415
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,119
to be a chess piece, do you?

416
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,400
A great man

417
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,400
can't submit to others for long.

418
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,759
You are a man indeed.

419
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,240
Right,

420
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
since I am here to celebrate,

421
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,119
I can't ignore your birthday present.

422
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,720
As Miss Lu is well-informed,

423
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
please don't mind

424
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,359
this dowdy box of dried flowers.

425
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,519
This is the best present

426
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,559
I have received today.

427
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,599
Stop touching.

428
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,000
Or, it will be scratched.

429
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,480
Here.

430
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,960
This is Yurong Cream
for relieving itching.

431
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,200
The feast is over.

432
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,599
My master might need me now.

433
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,160
I have to go.

434
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,200
Little bodyguard,

435
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:51,799
are you sure

436
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,400
you are not going to stay
and be my bodyguard?

437
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,599
I am expensive.

438
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,799
I am able to afford.

439
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,400
Okay. Let me consider it.

440
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,519
What is your name on earth?

441
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,680
I will tell you next time.

442
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,839
There might not be a next time.

443
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,319
There will be one for sure.

444
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,319
I am leaving.

445
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,759
Mr. Cai, please

446
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,400
help me tell His Highness Prince Qing

447
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:27,680
that the Lu Family
appreciates Prince Qing's favor.

448
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,160
But because

449
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,599
I am just a village man

450
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,640
who only thinks about river business

451
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,920
but nothing else.

452
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:35,880
Master Lu,

453
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
one's opportunities are changeable.

454
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,640
Sometimes, you should

455
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,680
leave some room for yourself.

456
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,119
Thank you for your advice.

457
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,400
But I have run business

458
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,039
stubbornly for years.

459
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,039
I am really sorry.

460
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,559
I got

461
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,680
what you mean.

462
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,359
I will convey your meaning

463
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,200
to His Highness Prince Qing completely.

464
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,240
The Lu Family doesn't desire for wealth,

465
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,200
but safe and sound.

466
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,039
Hope His Highness Prince Qing

467
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,200
could understand.

468
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,119
Master Lu, you are overthinking.

469
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,480
His Highness Prince Qing
is kind and considerate.

470
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,160
He won't force you.

471
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,640
Little sister, why are you here?

472
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,480
Sister, why are you here then?

473
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,720
I am waiting for Mr. Cai's little guard.

474
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:32,039
You are not yourself these days.

475
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,119
Is it because of that little guard?

476
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:36,920
Is the withered flower box

477
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,480
on your bed

478
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,400
sent by that little guard?

479
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:46,839
Mr. Cai,

480
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,799
please.

481
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,119
Mr. Cai.

482
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,200
Miss Lu.

483
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,119
Is Mr. Cai leaving?

484
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,519
I have talked it over with Master Lu.

485
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:58,640
I have to collect my things

486
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,559
in the inn now.

487
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,960
Please excuse my leaving.

488
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,960
Let me see...

489
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,319
Let me see Mr. Cai off.

490
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,000
Mr. Cai, this way, please.

491
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,000
After you.

492
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,559
Mr. Cai.

493
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:20,400
Are you

494
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
leaving Su City tomorrow?

495
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,720
Yes. I will set out tomorrow.

496
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,119
Miss Lu,

497
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,759
are you looking for someone?

498
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,799
No big deal.

499
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,559
Well,

500
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,079
doesn't your little bodyguard

501
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:36,880
come today?

502
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,279
Do you ask for him?

503
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,319
Never mind.

504
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,319
I can ask him to come.

505
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,519
It's okay. It's okay.

506
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,599
I just asked you by the way.

507
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,519
Bon Voyage.

508
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,200
Farewell.

509
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,200
Miss Lu.

510
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,279
Miss Lu.

511
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,759
Something's wrong.

512
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,000
Something went wrong.

513
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,359
Stop pulling.

514
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,680
Stop pulling.

515
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,519
Go.

516
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,000
Your highness, hurry up.

517
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,480
We can't hold on any longer.

518
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,640
If you don't
pull the rice seedlings with roots,

519
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,279
they will harm the innocent in the fields.

520
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,640
If you keep going,

521
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
we innocents

522
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,079
will suffer instead.

523
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:30,240
Don't worry.

524
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,039
After I manage to save the field,

525
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,039
I will save you.

526
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,240
Miss Lu is here.

527
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,839
Miss Lu.

528
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,759
Miss Lu, please help us.

529
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,519
Please help us, Miss Lu.

530
00:23:59,079 --> 00:23:59,759
Please help us.

531
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,680
Look at him.

532
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,160
Miss Lu.

533
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,880
Catch him.

534
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,839
You dare.

535
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,519
This is...

536
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,200
This is Ninth...

537
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,680
Don't say it.

538
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,400
Don't talk.

539
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,039
Come here.

540
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:14,880
All right. All right.

541
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,240
Let me beat you bastard.

542
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,599
Alright, I have stopped resisting.

543
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,279
Why do you catch me so hard?

544
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,240
Look at your red face.

545
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:30,720
Miss Lu.

546
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,119
This is the brat.

547
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:33,400
He pulled all of the rice seedlings

548
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,000
we just grew.

549
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,799
The rice seedlings are sick.

550
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:37,880
You are sick.

551
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,480
Nowadays,

552
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
rich playboys don't have fun

553
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,720
in casinos or brothels,

554
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,519
but play mud in fields.

555
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,119
You even bring magistrates' attendants

556
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,279
to bully farmers

557
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,480
who live on the field here.

558
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:46,920
No.

559
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,640
Have you dug a pit?

560
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,599
You like playing mud, right?

561
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,640
Let you live it up.

562
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,160
Take him away.

563
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,960
Why don't you let me finish my words?

564
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,079
You can't put them back.

565
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,440
Sorry. Sorry.

566
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,680
He is too arrogant.

567
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,640
Beat him hard.

568
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,759
Let's go.

569
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,000
You brat.

570
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,880
Beat him.

571
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,720
Go.

572
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,400
It doesn't matter
if you want to fight with me.

573
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,839
But can we deal with the field first?

574
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,559
He looks alien.

575
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,279
Not like libertines from cities.

576
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,079
Capture him.

577
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,480
It's okay. It's okay.

578
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:23,640
Thank you, brother. Thank...

579
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:24,960
Shan Yue.

580
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:25,880
Shan Yue.

581
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,359
Stop it.

582
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,799
To convince followers,
you should convince the boss first.

583
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:32,480
I am sorry.

584
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,279
What do you want on earth?

585
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,319
Bro,

586
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,200
open the rice seedlings
from the center.

587
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,359
Have a look at what is inside.

588
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,759
Rice seedlings are rice seedlings.

589
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,359
What else?

590
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,519
Right. What?

591
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,039
Take a look.

592
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,039
What is he doing?

593
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,680
True.

594
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,839
There is a spider web.

595
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:48,960
Let me have a look.

596
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,319
What? A spider web?

597
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,160
I didn't see a spider web.

598
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,599
Bring me the other rice seedlings.

599
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,119
Miss Lu,

600
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,119
these are sick seedlings.

601
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,799
They are more yellow than normal ones.

602
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,599
The severe ones will rot.

603
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,079
It can't eat
even if you turn them into rice.

604
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,400
The reason why I stopped

605
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,880
the man

606
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,200
from growing the seedlings
back to the field

607
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
is that the illness,

608
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,160
as humans contain smallpox,

609
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,920
will infect

610
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,279
through rice seedlings.

611
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,279
Once the virus reaches water,

612
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:17,119
the whole farmland will be destroyed.

613
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,519
What should we do?

614
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,000
What are we going to do?

615
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,480
Pull them with roots

616
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,279
and burn them all.

617
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,519
What do we eat if we burn them?

618
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,160
Please don't worry.

619
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Don't worry now.

620
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,400
I am sorry

621
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,039
for what I have done.

622
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,279
The farmers are innocent.

623
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,519
They responded instinctively

624
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,279
when seeing their fields being destroyed.

625
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,960
But I embarrassed you

626
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,720
without learning about your reason.

627
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,519
I apologize to you.

628
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:40,400
Never mind.

629
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,720
But these rice seedlings,

630
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,559
I might have to bother you...

631
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,880
Well, magistrate.

632
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,480
Let me go. Now.

633
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:47,759
Here.

634
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,480
So many farmers.

635
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,559
Please bring your followers

636
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,720
to help them address it.

637
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,119
Well.

638
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:58,599
- Thank you.
- Follow me.

639
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,480
Come with me.

640
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,119
Please farmers get your hands dirty.

641
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,079
Do a favor.

642
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:02,759
Hurry up.

643
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,640
Every one, check it out.

644
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,319
Check it out.

645
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:12,400
Sorry, bro.

646
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,319
The farmers

647
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,279
were headstrong.

648
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,279
Why do they

649
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,559
obey a girl now?

650
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,000
Were it not for Miss Lu's

651
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,839
channel establishment

652
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,039
that redirected three branches to Su City,

653
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,160
how could they enjoy broad fields?

654
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,759
This is

655
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,599
mud

656
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,200
formed by floods.

657
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,160
Can't they admire

658
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,240
Miss Lu?

659
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,839
Were they done by her alone?

660
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,079
What is your name?

661
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,119
Lu Anran from Su City.

662
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,359
Miss.

663
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,519
I planned to treat him.

664
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,279
But he disappeared

665
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,039
when we finished pulling the seedlings.

666
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,119
Maybe this is

667
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,680
what a hidden master looks like.

668
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,440
Sis,

669
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,599
where did you go?

670
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,599
So dirty.

671
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,640
I went to the fields.

672
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,440
Why?

673
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,079
Today is Flower Festival.

674
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,039
Don't you walk around?

675
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,599
Little guard

676
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,960
might go there.

677
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,720
Wait a second. Let me change my clothes.

678
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,400
(Flower Festival)
Mask. Mask.

679
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,359
Sister,

680
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,000
I heard the God of Love Temple in the west

681
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
does have somethings.

682
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,519
Do you want to go with me,

683
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:10,160
asking for a love line?

684
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,640
No.

685
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
It is useless

686
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,160
to pray for a Mr. Right.

687
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,400
Right.

688
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,920
You even don't know

689
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,759
the guard's name.

690
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,799
It is hard for Buddha to help you.

691
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Okay. You know Mr. Cai's name. Just go.

692
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,400
Then, I'll go.

693
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,119
Miss.

694
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,480
Let's walk around as well.

695
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,079
Let's go.

696
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,000
Hurry up. Hurry up.

697
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:07,640
Miss.

698
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,240
Miss, go.

699
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,000
Over there.

700
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
There is a lantern show.

701
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,759
If we win the jackpot,

702
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:18,079
we can take

703
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,079
such a huge night-shining jewel home.

704
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:19,799
Hurry up.

705
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,000
Miss.

706
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:35,720
Someone's dropping. Is it alright?

707
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,960
You show up

708
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,680
in a special way.

709
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,039
Little guard.

710
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,160
I heard from Mr. Cai

711
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,759
you are leaving tomorrow.

712
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,160
For business.

713
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,319
I have to go.

714
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,359
We know each other.

715
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:00,960
But I am still

716
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,039
ignorant of your name.

717
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
I can't call you little guard

718
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,079
all the time.

719
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,640
My name is Mu Huaishu,

720
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,000
ranking second among my siblings.

721
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,680
Mu Huaishu

722
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,359
I remember it.

723
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:28,559
Mom.

724
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,559
May you love who you love

725
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,480
in your afterlife.

726
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,720
Miss Lu,

727
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,599
do you believe in, quote
"You had me at first sight"?

728
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,680
Actually, I also thought

729
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,160
the word

730
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,200
was

731
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,680
a joke a wanderer

732
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,319
said to an ignorant girl.

733
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,119
But

734
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,839
since I met Miss Lu,

735
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,759
I think the word

736
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,880
is so true.

737
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,200
Miss Lu.

738
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,400
In fact,

739
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,480
I like you.

740
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,200
I fell for you instantly

741
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,359
when I first met you.

742
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,079
But

743
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,200
I know I am just a tiny guard.

744
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,359
I get nothing

745
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,079
except for ambitions.

746
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,799
I don't long for glory or fortunes,

747
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,039
not mentioning I have possessed them.

748
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,519
I don't need to depend on others.

749
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,079
Just hope I could love who I love.

750
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,799
But you are an outstanding girl.

751
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,960
You deserve the world.

752
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,119
Wait.

753
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,440
Don't be hurried.

754
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:06,960
The boat won't set out so soon.

755
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,640
We part in a rush.

756
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,960
Never ever forget me.

757
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,000
I will be back after I handle my duty.

758
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,480
Don't go back on your word.
I will wait for you.

759
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,599
Sister,

760
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,559
don't you have some words

761
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,359
to Mr. Cai?

762
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,519
Say it before it is too late.

763
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,839
Mr. Cai, take care.

764
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,359
Thank you for seeing me off.

765
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:30,880
Finished?

766
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,599
It's enough.

767
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,079
It is late.

768
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,000
We have to board.

769
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,519
Leaving.

770
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,839
Take care.

771
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,359
Come back early.

772
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:59,240
The jade is ancestral.

773
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,480
Take it as a token of engagement.

774
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,240
With this as my promise,

775
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,319
I am willing to

776
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,799
grow old with you.

777
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,760
What? Don't want it?

778
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,239
Yes, I do.

779
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,400
(Two months later)

780
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:31,440
Miss.

781
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,840
Is it a letter from Hanjing?

782
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:34,599
Yes.

783
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,079
But it is for Miss Xinran.

784
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,039
It is been two months.

785
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,280
Receiving no letters.

786
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,360
Sister,

787
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,000
Hasn't Bodyguard Mu written to you?

788
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,400
Maybe he is busy in Hanjing.

789
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,039
Indeed.

790
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:49,159
Some days ago,

791
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,440
I heard from Mr. Cai

792
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,760
North sabotaged the border again.

793
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,079
His Highness Prince Qing

794
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,000
even led the military to fight.

795
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,159
Bodyguard Mu

796
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,559
is a follower of His Highness Prince Qing as well.

797
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,079
Did he go with the prince?

798
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,480
What are you saying?

799
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,360
The war with North is violent.

800
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,639
Everyone is the same
in front of weapons.

801
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,719
Did he encounter anything?

802
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,400
Sister, don't worry.

803
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,360
Maybe he didn't go to North.

804
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,440
I will write to Mr. Cai

805
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,320
and ask him about it.

806
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,079
He doesn't write to Miss
when he doesn't fight.

807
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,920
It is worse than

808
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
dying in the war.

809
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Lingxi.

810
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,239
Watch out.

811
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,840
These are the betrothal gifts
to the Lu Family.

812
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,000
Note that.

813
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,280
Put the betrothal gifts well.

814
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,280
I will go around.

815
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,480
Is it the ship from Hanjing?

816
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,280
Have you brought letters?

817
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,000
Miss Lu, there are still some.

818
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,159
I haven't checked them yet.

819
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,159
Have a look. Is there yours?

820
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,000
Miss Lu, nice to meet you.

821
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
It's you. Farming expert.

822
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:20,880
It is said that

823
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,360
you have redirected three branches

824
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,800
to widen and deepen

825
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,119
the rivers,

826
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,159
which made here

827
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,400
the largest port.

828
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,079
It wasn't done by me alone.

829
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,679
My father and I

830
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,480
have coaxed the magistrates

831
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,719
for a month.

832
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,199
We also donated much.

833
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,679
Then, we finally persuaded them.

834
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,360
Civilians suffered

835
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,840
from rampant floods.

836
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,000
They helped a lot as well.

837
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,039
What trouble you like this

838
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,239
since you are such a hero?

839
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,800
Even heroes will fall for beauties.

840
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,719
Then the beauty

841
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,039
must be

842
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,960
one in a thousand.

843
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,519
It is one in a million.

844
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:17,719
Why?

845
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,440
I heard a word

846
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,960
from an old farmer before.

847
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:22,719
Do you want to know what it is?

848
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:23,960
What is it?

849
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,079
There will always

850
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,960
be a good thing tomorrow.

851
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,320
It is weaved by you, right?

852
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,159
You haven't told me

853
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,119
your name.

854
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,559
I styled myself

855
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,280
as Rice Fragrance Hermit.

856
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,079
It is equal to Farm Master.

857
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,360
Miss.

858
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,400
The fat is in the fire.

859
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,840
Someone from Hanjing is coming.

860
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,519
Dad. Mom.

861
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,320
Who is it?

862
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,800
Anran.

863
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:06,480
The Lu Family's first daughter kneels down
to accept the imperial decree.

864
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,239
Kneel down.

865
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,239
By Imperial Decree,

866
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,639
it is said that
the Lu Family's first daughter in Su City

867
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,000
is a decent, upright, and smart beauty

868
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,119
enjoying surpassingly good behaviour.

869
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,039
She is in love with Prince Qing Mu Ze,

870
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,559
their love stronger than diamonds.

871
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,960
Emperor would like to fulfill their romantic wish.

872
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,519
Therefore, Emperor especially allows
the Lu Family's first daughter

873
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,880
to marry Prince Qing,

874
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,679
bestowed Princess Qing.

875
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,440
The wedding will be held in Hanjing

876
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,800
on the eighth day
of the ninth lunar month, an auspicious day.

877
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,000
Respect it.

878
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,920
Did Emperor misunderstand?

879
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,480
What "in love with"?
What "love stronger than diamonds"?

880
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,880
It is not for me.

881
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:46,880
Bold.

882
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,119
As Emperor bestows you the marriage,

883
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,840
you can't defy.

884
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,519
Do you want all the people of the Lu Family

885
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,960
die with you?

886
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,519
Dad. Mom.

887
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,880
Anran.

888
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,639
Miss Lu.

889
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,760
Will you accept the decree

890
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,599
or not?

891
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,079
I...

892
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,840
I...

893
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:20,920
I accept it.

894
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,559
Congratulations to
Your Highness Princess Qing.

895
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,039
On the eighth day
of the next month,

896
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,519
His Highness Ninth Prince,

897
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,119
on behalf of His Highness Prince Qing,

898
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,480
will come to Su City

899
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,519
and escort Your Highness Princess
to Hanjing for the wedding.

900
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,159
Your Highness Princess,
please prepare well.

901
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,480
I will leave now.

902
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:40,360
Gramercy, His Majesty.

903
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:43,719
Right,

904
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,679
His Highness Prince Qing

905
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,519
asked me to give you this letter.

906
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:48,920
Mine?

907
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,239
Anran, I hope this finds you well.

908
00:39:58,519 --> 00:39:59,719
I haven't written to you for a long time

909
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,519
because I couldn't spare time to do so

910
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,079
during the war with North.

911
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,639
Till now,

912
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,719
I have to

913
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,760
tell you the truth.

914
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:09,559
Actually, I am

915
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:11,079
the second prince of the Dahan Dynasty.

916
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,360
I apologize that I had to hide it from you.

917
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,199
I didn't expect during my trip to Su City,

918
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,880
I would fall for you at first sight.

919
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,760
With my military exploit in the war,

920
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,480
I begged His Majesty
to bestow the marriage.

921
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:26,719
His Majesty rebuked me
for dwelling upon love.

922
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,199
Prince Yi laughed at me

923
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,599
because I forsaked my bright future

924
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,000
for a businessman's daughter.

925
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,679
But so what?

926
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,280
I have made up mind.

927
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,840
I bet all

928
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,440
to stay with you for the rest of my life.

929
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,519
I am waiting for you in Hanjing.

930
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:42,800
Miss you.

931
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,790
(Huaishu)

932
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,519
Prince Qing is the little guard.

933
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,580
(Lu's Mansion)

934
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,199
May who you are waiting for

935
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,719
be your one in a million.

936
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,480
Miss, walnut crisp.

937
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,239
Don't you want to show up
as a beautiful bride?

938
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,280
Mom, then let you have it.

939
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,480
Miss,

940
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:34,760
you do get fatter

941
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,599
after two weeks.

942
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,760
Really, mom?

943
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:40,800
Dad.

944
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,440
Mom said I get fatter in two weeks.

945
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,400
Your mom is right.

946
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,679
Anran.

947
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,639
Do you really believe

948
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,519
he just wants to marry you?

949
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,119
Dad,

950
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,440
with his military efforts,

951
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,760
he could ask for anything.

952
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,519
But he only wanted me.

953
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,960
Such affection,

954
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,719
I don't want to betray.

955
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:13,400
Royalties are the cruelest.

956
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,079
As you always make your own mind,

957
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,559
I can't convince you anymore.

958
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,320
Dad.

959
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,639
Mom, look at dad.

960
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Your dad

961
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,079
is reluctant to lose you.

962
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,880
There is a long way to go

963
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,079
from Su City to Hanjing City.

964
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:43,880
In the future,

965
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,000
dad and I won't be able to protect you.

966
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:52,679
Mom.

967
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,159
Relax.

968
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,960
He sweared to me

969
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,519
he only loves me for his life.

970
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,840
And we are like-minded.

971
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,400
I will be happy.

972
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:06,480
Women's love

973
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,800
resembles a gamble.

974
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,760
It is nothing to do with your background.

975
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:13,440
More importantly,

976
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,920
do you believe if his vows

977
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,880
are easily to be broken or not?

978
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,800
If you believe in him,

979
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,400
you don't have to listen to others.

980
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:23,360
Mom,

981
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,039
have you won?

982
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,800
No one knows until we die.

983
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:34,599
Alright, go back to have a rest.

984
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,960
I will comb your hair tomorrow.

985
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,000
(Hangde Hall)

986
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,039
Miss, turn around. Let me have a look.

987
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,599
And turn back.

988
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,320
Miss, you are so gorgeous.

989
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:58,800
I didn't expect

990
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,719
the little guard was Prince Qing for real.

991
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,480
I have told you

992
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,679
our Miss Lu

993
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:05,320
should match

994
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,360
a hero,

995
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,239
one and only.

996
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:08,679
See, I was right.

997
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,159
So awesome you are.

998
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:11,599
Why hasn't mom arrived yet?

999
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:12,639
Yuzhu has gone to call her.

1000
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,400
Miss.

1001
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:15,800
I wanted to show you this.

1002
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,000
Miss. Miss.

1003
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:19,039
Madam...

1004
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:20,400
What is the rush?

1005
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,760
Madam is in danger.

1006
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:25,960
Mom.

1007
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:26,920
Mom.

1008
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:27,960
Mom.

1009
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:28,960
Mom.

1010
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,039
Anran is here, mom.

1011
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,559
Mom, look.

1012
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:36,559
Do I look pretty?

1013
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:36,880
Mom.

1014
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:42,480
Anran.

1015
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:46,199
I am sorry.

1016
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,679
No. Mom.

1017
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:49,000
You are not sorry to me.

1018
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,840
But you promised me

1019
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,239
to attend my wedding.

1020
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:53,000
Mom.

1021
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:55,239
Why don't you keep your word?

1022
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:55,800
Mom.

1023
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,679
It's okay. Mom.

1024
00:44:57,679 --> 00:44:58,000
Mom.

1025
00:44:58,679 --> 00:44:59,039
Madam.

1026
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,400
Call for a doctor.

1027
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:01,400
Mom.

1028
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,800
Doctor. Now.

1029
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,519
Mom. You will be fine.

1030
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:05,880
Master.

1031
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,719
The bridal sedan chair
has arrived in the city.

1032
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,559
Take a look.

1033
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,880
Splendid.

1034
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,639
So imposing.

1035
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:16,280
Yes.

1036
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,760
How can I get married

1037
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,280
if my mom is like this?

1038
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:25,960
Master.

1039
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:26,679
But...

1040
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:28,559
But the marriage
was bestowed by His Majesty.

1041
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,719
We can't defy it.

1042
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,519
Anran.

1043
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:40,480
I know

1044
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,159
you are sad now.

1045
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:51,880
Lingxi,

1046
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,159
hold Miss Lu up.

1047
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,039
Yes.

1048
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,639
Miss.

1049
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,440
Miss.

1050
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:03,280
Send her to get on the sedan chair.

1051
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,760
Now.

1052
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,400
Dad.

1053
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,159
Dad, I plead with you.

1054
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:16,639
Anran.

1055
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,440
I don't want to leave.

1056
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,079
Anran.

1057
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,320
Your mom

1058
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,800
wished you could marry well

1059
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:32,480
for her whole life.

1060
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,280
Don't let her worry about you.

1061
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,400
Get married without worry.

1062
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:42,159
Dad is here.

1063
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:45,800
Miss.

1064
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,280
It is from the royal family.

1065
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,440
If you miss the auspicious hour,

1066
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:50,039
I am afraid

1067
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:51,159
the Lu Family will
suffer with you as well.

1068
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,880
Let's go, Miss.

1069
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,639
Rest assured.

1070
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:05,920
I am here.

1071
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:57,880
You

1072
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:00,159
are Ninth Prince?

1073
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,920
Do you have troubles?

1074
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:05,840
No.

1075
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:08,159
It is all right.

1076

Now, Lu Anran

1079
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,239
thought her mom's sudden death

1080
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,639
had been

1081
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:52,079
the biggest regret in her life.

1082
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,320
But she didn't expect

1083
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,199
the scroll of fate

1084
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,000
is revealing

1085
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:01,159
in a painful way

1086
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,800
