2
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,840
Stop! Don't run!

3
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,359
Don't come.

4
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,599
Don't come over.

5
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,760
If you come over,

6
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
I'll cut my face.

7
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,480
This little girl is strong.

8
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,519
I like it.

9
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,840
Don't do it in the hard way.

10
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,319
Go!

11
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,159
Don't come.

12
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,359
There's no turning back.

13
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
I would rather die now without being harassed.

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,040
Gril.

15
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,959
The knife is used to protect yourself.

16
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,319
Not to kill yourself.

17
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,280
Thank you, Childe.

18
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,639
But it's my own business.

19
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,400
I won't drag you down.

20
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,159
We can't agree to

21
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,199
matters of forced buying and selling.

22
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,199
I'm warning you.

23
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,719
Think of it.

24
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:19,960
Don't be too stubborn

25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
to ruin my trade.

26
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,960
500 taels of note.

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,360
This girl is mine.

28
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,000
Hold on.

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,080
What if I mean to ruin your trade?

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,039
You want

31
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,400
to die?

32
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,400
Listen to this girl first.

33
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,719
After it,

34
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,080
if you still want to fight,

35
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm ready.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,560
Who are you?

37
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,000
Wait!

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,759
I'm Holly. Thanks for saving my life.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,879
But I'm just a lowly man,

40
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,120
and my life is worthless.

41
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,919
I won't be a burden to you.

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,680
I...

43
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,080
All men are born equal.

44
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,479
Don't belittle yourself.

45
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,439
The deal is not done.

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm qualified to compete with it.

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,159
Right?

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,039
You want to compete with me?

49
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,080
Tell me.

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,360
How?

51
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,360
I want everyone to be the witness.

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,439
I have one thousand taels of note.

53
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,000
The money will be the ransom.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Holly is mine now. How's it?

55
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,479
Interesting.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,919
For the first time in my life,

57
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,479
women dare to compete with me.

58
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,960
Just speak.

59
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't come so close.

60
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,719
Compete or not?

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,080
Yes.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Of course.

63
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,319
1,000 taels more.

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,280
Five thousand.

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,159
Do you have more?

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,800
Miss Lu is really rich.

67
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,159
Spend thousands.

68
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,759
Make him lose his arrogance.

69
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,919
Farm Master is arrogant too,

70
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,800
giving me a lot of confidence.

71
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,599
I have the proper title.

72
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
Could it be Rice Fragrance Hermit?

73
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,120
How do you know?

74
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,759
Of course, I understand you.

75
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
It's hard to find a bosom friend.

76
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,199
Miss Lu.

77
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,959
I have nothing to

78
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,079
pay your great kindness back.

79
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,480
I hope you can let me follow you.

80
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,040
I can be a horse

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,120
to repay your kindness.

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
You don't have to be a horse.

83
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,519
Be a good person.

84
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,279
I'm just helping you.

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,319
Don't mind it.

86
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:36,680
No.

87
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,519
Receiving drips of water when in need, and I shall return the kindness with a spring.

88
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,079
Miss, let me follow you.

89
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,079
I'm willing to serve you as a servant.

90
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,319
I save you to free you.

91
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,199
Not to be a servant.

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,199
If you don't agree,

93
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,160
Holly will keep kneeling.

94
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,439
Her father sold her to the Bordel.

95
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,959
I guess she can't go back to that home.

96
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,920
Now she's lonely and helpless.

97
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,720
What if the Childe Gao

98
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,480
can't bear what happened today

99
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
and comes to find her,

100
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,199
no one will protect her then.

101
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,120
Then it's up to you.

102
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,439
Come in.

103
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,839
Miss.

104
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,480
Miss, why are you so late?

105
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,519
Who is this girl?

106
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,439
This is Holly.

107
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,959
She'll be your good sister from now on.

108
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,360
What? Miss?

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,639
Did I serve badly?

110
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,759
Why are you buying a new maidservant?

111
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,480
Our Lingxi is the best.

112
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,199
But Holly has some difficulties.

113
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,680
Then I got her back.

114
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,079
What difficulties?

115
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,959
Just solve them.

116
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,759
Why bring her back?

117
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,639
Remember.

118
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,160
I'm Miss's maid.

119
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,600
You just came.

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,439
Go to wash Miss's clothes.

121
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
Clean the closestool.

122
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,800
The clothes are all made of silk.

123
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,879
The temperature of water used should be

124
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,720
neither cold nor hot.

125
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,079
First, soak them in the soap water.

126
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,879
Then soak them with rose flowers.

127
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,079
At last, bask it in the shade.

128
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,120
You have to iron it.

129
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,199
Lingxi.

130
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,199
Do you like to eat fish?

131
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,560
Miss, how do you know?

132
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,519
You're so picky.

133
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,600
Everyone knows.

134
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,519
Though you know the method,

135
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,439
the clothes you washed

136
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,480
all faded.

137
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
Miss, you have changed.

138
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,240
You don't care about me anymore.

139
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,639
Holly,

140
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,680
please be more tolerant towards her

141
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,600
in the future.

142
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,680
Don't worry.

143
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,800
I'll study hard.

144
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,399
Though Miss doesn't care about me,

145
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,720
there's still one thing about Miss

146
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,360
you must keep in mind

147
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,839
if you stay with Miss.

148
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,560
What?

149
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,600
Second Daughter of Lu and her mother

150
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,439
are not good people.

151
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,639
Some time ago,

152
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,160
they hid poison in Miss's clothes.

153
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,000
Miss almost got a rash.

154
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,399
Darn it!

155
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,399
Holly can't repay to

156
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,680
your kindness of helping me.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,040
If you want revenge,

158
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,759
I'm willing to perish together.

159
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,519
I...

160
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,120
I can too.

161
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,560
Just perish together.

162
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,279
Lingxi, Holly.

163
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,920
I know you're nice to me.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,079
But I'm nice to you

165
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,600
because I treat you as sisters

166
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,079
not weapons.

167
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,560
Don't say things like this anymore.

168
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,240
Come.

169
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,639
Be careful.

170
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,160
After you applied this ointment,

171
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,399
the bruises on your body

172
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,800
will be gone soon.

173
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,920
It's okay, Miss. I'll do it myself.

174
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,360
Just let Miss do it.

175
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
When I am injured,

176
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,160
she also applied the medicine.

177
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,040
Come.

178
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,000
Why are you so careless?

179
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,120
Hurt yourself all over.

180
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,759
They asked me to serve men.

181
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,240
I don't want to.

182
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,160
So they hit me.

183
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,079
These people are so bad.

184
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,399
I will support you

185
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,439
in the future,

186
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,439
no one dares to bully you.

187
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,680
You're really amazing.

188
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,240
You can even support Holly.

189
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,079
No, Miss.

190
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,240
That's because we have you.

191
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,959
Holly, don't worry.

192
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,279
You're our Miss's maid now.

193
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,560
Miss is very overbearing

194
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,439
outside the Mansion.

195
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,279
Is she...

196
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,160
What's wrong, Miss?

197
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,519
Nothing.

198
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,439
Holly.

199
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,839
Was it your natural father

200
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,920
who sold you to the brothel?

201
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,639
No.

202
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,160
When I was young,

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
our house was destroyed by the flood.

204
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,320
My parents

205
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,759
had to take my brother and me to flee.

206
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,600
I was separated from them.

207
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,679
My father now

208
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,399
picked me home.

209
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,879
At first,

210
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,559
we live a good life.

211
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,039
Then he fell and hurt his leg

212
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,080
and became addicted to gambling.

213
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,600
He went to drink when he lost.

214
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,360
He hit me

215
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,879
when he was drunk.

216
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,240
Do you still remember

217
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,480
where your family is?

218
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,759
Do you remember their faces?

219
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,840
It's been too long. I can't remember.

220
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,879
I don't even know

221
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,480
whether they're alive or not.

222
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,279
But I remember

223
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,639
my brother is different from others.

224
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,840
His heart

225
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,759
is on the right.

226
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,399
Don't worry.

227
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,600
I will do my best

228
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,759
to help you find your family.

229
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,440
Thank you, Miss.

230
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:40,960
Miss.

231
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,159
No one has ever been

232
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,320
so nice to me.

233
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,759
Since you come to Lu's Mansion,

234
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,200
we are a family now.

235
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,159
A family should

236
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,279
love and support

237
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,320
each other.

238
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,480
These are peanut cakes I saved.

239
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,720
Peach cakes.

240
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,360
And chestnut cakes.

241
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,320
And the maltose Miss bought for me.

242
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,279
It's all yours.

243
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,399
I didn't treat you well before.

244
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,879
Can you forgive me?

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
You're my sister now.

246
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,519
Why don't you say anything?

247
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,120
Will you forgive me or not?

248
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,519
I never blamed you.

249
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,720
Then it means

250
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,200
I'm your good sister now too.

251
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,919
However,

252
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,879
Miss's

253
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,799
favorite girl

254
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,759
should be me.

255
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,840
If you don't believe me, ask Miss

256
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,159
who she will save first if you and I

257
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,159
fall in the water together?

258
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,120
Guess.

259
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,720
It doesn't matter.

260
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,720
Miss will save you after she saves me.

261
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,399
Let Holly taste

262
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,080
your peach and peanut cakes.

263
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:56,840
Alright.

264
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
And this.

265
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,799
Madam, time for medicine.

266
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,480
Don't drink it.

267
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,200
Be careful.

268
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,759
You scared me to death.

269
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,240
Holly.

270
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,120
I've checked

271
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,799
the medicine.

272
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,159
There's no problem.

273
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,720
I know

274
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,240
you suspect

275
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,519
it is Liu Mingyu that

276
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,320
makes my illness worse.

277
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,559
I suspected it before.

278
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,480
But she kept her duty.

279
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,200
She never crossed the line.

280
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,440
She not only pays respects to me every day,

281
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,279
but also takes good care of me.

282
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,879
Mom.

283
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,279
I don't believe her plan

284
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,480
can be so watertight.

285
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,840
Lingxi,

286
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,399
take Holly and Yuzhu

287
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,799
find all the things

288
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,799
sent by Second Madam.

289
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:56,320
Yes.

290
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,279
Yuzhu, go there. Let's go.

291
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,840
Take it.

292
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,320
And this.

293
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,039
Look over there.

294
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,720
Ok.

295
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,320
Everything sent by

296
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,600
Second Madam is

297
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,559
all there.

298
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,720
I've checked

299
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,879
everything.

300
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,320
There's nothing unusual.

301
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,879
Miss.

302
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,240
I even checked the quilt.

303
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,320
Anran.

304
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,720
Are we thinking too much?

305
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,440
Mom.

306
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,080
Did we miss anything?

307
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,919
Is the statue of Goddess Guanyin

308
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,600
sent by Liu Mingyu either?

309
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,159
Miss!

310
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,519
Smashing it

311
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,840
will be punished!

312
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't believe in Buddhism.

313
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,000
I only believe in myself.

314
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,080
Miss.

315
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,960
Right. It's the root of
bidentate achyranthes.

316
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,639
It's been years

317
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,039
from its appearance.

318
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,480
Is it toxic by smelling it?

319
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,879
It's good to replenish qi
and enrich the blood.

320
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,039
How could it be poisonous?

321
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,840
Although it is non-toxic,

322
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,159
you should

323
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,200
pay attention.

324
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,519
It may have antagonistic action

325
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,960
against some tonic.

326
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,840
Be careful when you use it.

327
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,840
Take a look at this prescription.

328
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,480
Is it against the root of
bidentate achyranthes?

329
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,039
It is not allowed!

330
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,679
This prescription
is for the lung disease.

331
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,960
It is to cool blood and warm the channel.

332
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,039
While the root of
bidentate achyranthes

333
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,639
is great for nourishing qi and blood.

334
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,279
Mixing them may cause you

335
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,759
in a trance or cough,

336
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,600
or even make one overexcite,

337
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,639
finally cough up blood and die.

338
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
(Flower Festival)

339
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,559
Madam gives Guanyin incense every day,

340
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,759
and smells the root of
bidentate achyranthes.

341
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,360
And has the medicine twice a day.

342
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,720
No wonder she doesn't get better.

343
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,639
If anything happens to mother,

344
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,440
there's no problem with the medicine,

345
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,759
and nobody cares about Guanyin Statue.

346
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,600
Then she can escape unscathed.

347
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,720
I didn't expect

348
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,399
Second Auntie is so vicious.

349
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,679
Take a look.

350
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,639
The best river lanterns.

351
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,759
The best river lanterns.

352
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,279
Boss.

353
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,080
How much is this?

354
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,799
This one? Cheap for you.

355
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,799
Let us pick one?

356
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,519
Mom.

357
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,159
Why are we buying river lanterns?

358
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,840
Because today is the Flower Festival.

359
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,120
We can pray with lanterns.

360
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Those who passed away

361
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,720
will come to our dreams

362
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,039
with the candlelight.

363
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,559
Take it.

364
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:04,399
Come.

365
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,080
Alright.

366
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,360
Let's go. Put the lantern on.

367
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,919
Put the lantern on.

368
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,559
Miss, what's wrong with you?

369
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,240
Nothing.

370
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,120
I'll go to the river.

371
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,679
Buy a same new

372
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,639
Guanyin Statue

373
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,679
and send to Madam.

374
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,639
OK.

375
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,600
Got it. Let's go.

376
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,879
Be careful.

377
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,000
Miss Lu?

378
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,120
Why are you here?

379
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,320
Play with the lantern.

380
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,519
Are you here to set off the lantern?

381
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,480
Don't you have a custom here?

382
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,919
Pray during the Flower Festival

383
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,799
can meet your old friends in dreams.

384
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,000
Is Yu the one you want to meet?

385
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,039
How do you know about Yu?

386
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,879
When you were drunk last time,

387
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,080
you told me this name.

388
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,279
You even forced me to

389
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,200
make a rabbit lantern to Yu.

390
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,960
Look, the lantern you put today is also a rabbit.

391
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,840
It must have something to do with him.

392
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:29,840
Yu,

393
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,759
is a rabbit I had before.

394
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,279
He fell into the water and died.

395
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,120
The rabbit

396
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,200
must have been envied by
other friends in paradise.

397
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,039
Because its owner

398
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,159
forces others to make lanterns

399
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:50,799
and pray for him

400
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,000
when she is drunk.

401
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,879
Yu.

402
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,279
Mother is back.

403
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,240
It's a pity that everything in this
life has a chance to be saved.

404
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,839
Except you.

405
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,880
I'm afraid we won't meet again.

406
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,240
May the lantern light the way home.

407
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,759
and your next life be smooth and safe.

408
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,480
Why are you looking at me like this?

409
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,400
You're so serious that

410
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
I don't want to bother you.

411
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,720
I miss my mother a little bit.

412
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,440
This lantern.

413
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,200
Let it pass.

414
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
If Mother has a spirit,

415
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,359
I'm sure she doesn't want to come back to the world.

416
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,000
Don't think too much.

417
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,880
The lantern is just a wish.

418
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,720
Don't take it seriously.

419
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,319
If you really want to console the dead,

420
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,240
why not enjoy

421
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,480
the green mountains and rivers for them.

422
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,880
Why not enjoy

423
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,759
the green mountains and rivers for them.

424
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,559
Taste the delicious food.

425
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,200
Taste the delicious food.

426
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,839
To live a better life.

427
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,519
To live a better life and be carefree.

428
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,319
When you meet again,

429
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,960
you can tell it to them.

430
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,519
What?

431
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,240
Saying these words,

432
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,839
you are like

433
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,480
an old woman who has experienced a lot.

434
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,359
Have greatly discerned and apprehended.

435
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,119
Well.

436
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
I've made the rabbit lantern for Yu.

437
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,000
I have no chance to give it to you.

438
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,640
I was drunk and fooling around.

439
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,759
Don't take it seriously.

440
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,079
You were drunk while I'm sober.

441
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:23,680
Besides,

442
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,640
a man should

443
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,319
keep his words.

444
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,519
It only takes 15 minutes

445
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:27,680
to my inn.

446
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll get it for you.

447
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,000
Wait for me here.

448
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,519
Alright.

449
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,599
I'll wait for you here.

450
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,039
Boatman!

451
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,160
How much is the cruise?

452
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,400
Everybody.

453
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,200
I'm really sorry.

454
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,920
It's closed today.

455
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,559
All my boats

456
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,640
are booked by an honored guest.

457
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,039
How could that be?

458
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,960
The honored guest

459
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,119
booked all our boats

460
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:10,799
for a whole night.

461
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,759
You won't be able to take it tonight.

462
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,559
Go back.

463
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:14,880
I wonder who he is.

464
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,039
He is so rich.

465
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,880
But he wasted such a good night.

466
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,039
Boatman.

467
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,200
Girl.

468
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,599
We can't take anyone tonight.

469
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,759
No, may I ask if the one

470
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,599
who rented all the boats today

471
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,160
is surnamed Mu?

472
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,160
Miss, how did you know?

473
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,920
I'm his maid.

474
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,960
Old Madam asked me

475
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,200
to find him.

476
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,559
The honored guest

477
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,039
rented all the boats

478
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,079
in order to create a chance

479
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,319
to meet with a girl.

480
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,279
Don't damage

481
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,640
the good marriage.

482
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,960
Go back.

483
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,519
Wasn't it

484
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,440
a coincidence?

485
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,720
Mu Ze must be nearby.

486
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,680
You made use of Second Uncle Lu

487
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
and do such a big thing.

488
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,119
So that Lu Anran relents.

489
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,519
This woman is really hard to deal with.

490
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,319
Women

491
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
are kind-hearted.

492
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,920
If it's business,

493
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,480
she is flawless.

494
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,480
But if she does it emotionally,

495
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,519
she can be made use of by us.

496
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:53,039
As long as she is in the game tonight,

497
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,960
she'll definitely fall in love with me.

498
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,079
Once a woman is in love,

499
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,880
she'll give in.

500
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,680
Your Highness is right.

501
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,319
The boat is ready.

502
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,000
Let's go.

503
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,279
Whether it's in the past or present,

504
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,160
I can't escape from your plan.

505
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,039
From the beginning to the end,

506
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,000
you haven't loved me for a while.

507
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,000
Our meet

508
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,680
is an elaborate hoax.

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,559
countless hoaxes in the future.

524
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,759
Instead of avoiding it,

525
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,039
it's better to face up to it

526
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,960
and take the initiative.

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,559
I'm my own boss.

544
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,720
Someone jumped into the river.

545
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,240
Someone fell into the river.

546
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,359
What should we do?

547
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,319
The way Miss Lu appears,

548
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,039
is very special.

549
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,119
The way Miss Lu appears is very special.

550
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,839
The timing of Prince Qing's showing up

551
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,279
is quite appropriate.

552
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,880
Miss Lu, this is it.

553
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,079
Let's go inside.

554
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,119
Come on.

555
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
Splendid scenery.

556
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,279
Fantastic landscape.

557
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,279
I didn't expect that

558
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,119
God of Love Temple of Su City

559
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,680
is really well-deserved.

560
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,079
Look at me.

561
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,519
You threw it far.

562
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,279
Why are those people

563
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,319
throwing coins

564
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,240
into the pond?

565
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,640
It's said that in the pond

566
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,880
lives a thousand-year-old carp spirit.

567
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Throwing coins

568
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,839
is to pray to the carp spirit.

569
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,599
Pray to the carp spirit.

570
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,839
That's it.

571
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,119
Let's go there and throw coins again.

572
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:34,640
Let's go.

573
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,359
I have some coins.

574
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:42,240
Do you want to try it?

575
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,559
I don't believe it.

576
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,960
I only believe

577
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:50,759
myself.

578
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,559
If you fold the boat in this way,

579
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,279
the boat will sink.

580
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,680
I wonder how's the love fate

581
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,599
between Cai Wangjin and me.

582
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,559
God of Love, please guide me.

583
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,519
By riverside,

584
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,960
a pair of turtledoves are cooing.

585
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,039
There is a maiden fair

586
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,079
whom a young man is wooing.

587
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,839
Remember.

588
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,440
The hull should be tall.

589
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,519
The bottom of the boat should be wide.

590
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,240
Then the boat can drain

591
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,200
as much water as possible.

592
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,400
Boats like this

593
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,200
won't easily sink

594
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,839
even if you put a few coins in it,

595
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,279
Here, try it.

596
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,240
It really doesn't sink.

597
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,440
Thank you, sister.

598
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,519
Miss Lu deserves the title of

599
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,759
the leader of Lu family who

600
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,240
builds all river transportations.

601
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,720
Lord Qing, no need to flatter me.

602
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,400
I just folded a boat

603
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,519
which ordinary people can fold.

604
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,400
It's easy to make a paper boat.

605
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,319
But knowing the principles

606
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,880
and folding a boat

607
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,960
which can bear weight

608
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,920
and doesn't sink

609
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,039
is not that easy.

610
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,200
Over the years,

611
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,359
I have encountered so many floods.

612
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
If I can't

613
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,799
learn something from it.

614
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,920
How can I

615
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,599
accept Double Fish Order,

616
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,759
master 36 ports

617
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,680
and

618
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,759
thousands of boatmen.

619
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,559
Miss Lu is really

620
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,200
bold and wise.

621
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,039
Through the water environment

622
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,759
and its use,

623
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,000
you transform the Lu merchant ship.

624
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,640
To make the ship safer.

625
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,119
Also can also improve

626
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,880
Lu merchant ship of value in use.

627
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,880
If Miss Lu can

628
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,559
use your talent

629
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,039
for research on wheeled boat,

630
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,920
I believe the soldiers of Dahan

631
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,279
will definitely be grateful to

632
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,359
Miss Lu.

633
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,359
What do you think?

634
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,319
You work so hard,

635
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,680
just want me to

636
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,920
make wheeled boats for you.

637
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,039
Wheeled boats are important to a country.

638
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,279
It needs a lot of

639
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,039
material, financial and human resources.

640
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,119
How can I, a businesswoman dare to think?

641
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,160
What's more, if making wheeled boats

642
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,640
needs to rely on Lu family,

643
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,039
I'm afraid

644
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,279
it will finally disappoint

645
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,759
soldiers of Dahan's hearts.

646
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,599
Prince Qing, don't you go?

647
00:30:58,759 --> 00:30:59,559
Brother, brother.

648
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,759
Where's my candied haws?

649
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:03,799
Alright.

650
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,799
Take it.

651
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,279
Go play.

652
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:20,799
Mr. Cai.

653
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,160
Miss Lu.

654
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,720
I didn't expect to meet you here.

655
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,680
Yeah, what a coincidence.

656
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,480
Seems that your marriage with Childe Wang

657
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,440
will definitely succeed.

658
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,599
Today is a great day.

659
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,599
I've already got

660
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,759
several luckiest tokens.

661
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,920
God of Love.

662
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,759
May I ask what's the fate

663
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,599
between the man by my side

664
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,519
and me?

665
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,359
I didn't expect that

666
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,920
Miss Lu is so frank.

667
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,279
You're not

668
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,839
as reserved as

669
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,680
other unmarried girls.

670
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,279
Life is but a span.

671
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,839
If I am not frank,

672
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,119
God of Love

673
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,920
needs to think about it for a while.

674
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,680
It's a waste of time.

675
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,839
The luckiest token?

676
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,079
There're favorable climatic,
geographical and human conditions.

677
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,680
You'll envy the couple but not
a lonely and immortal life.

678
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,720
God of Love

679
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,480
is really generous.

680
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,000
The first token

681
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,400
is so good.

682
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,400
The luckiest token.

683
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,640
Dream together in the moonlight.

684
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,799
The spring breeze is gentle.

685
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,200
The luckiest token again!

686
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,400
Life is like the clouds floating
into the sky with the wind,

687
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,599
the mood of parting is like the flakes
that stick to the ground after the rain.

688
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,200
Your Highness Prince Qing,

689
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,599
is it strange?

690
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,920
My luck is always bad.

691
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,000
Since I was little,

692
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,640
I didn't even get a lucky token before.

693
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,759
After we met

694
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,279
for 30 minutes,

695
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,599
I got three luckiest tokens.

696
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,519
In my opinion,

697
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,359
there's nothing strange.

698
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,839
If you want to please a girl,

699
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,480
you have to play pretty tricks.

700
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,400
(The luckiest token)

701
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,680
Your Highness Prince Qing,

702
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,680
convey false messages of God of Love.

703
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,559
Aren't you afraid offend God's will

704
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,720
and overreact yourself?

705
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,559
God's will?

706
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,599
Actually,

707
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,279
in my opinion,

708
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,559
Man can conquer nature.

709
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,880
I guess Your Highness

710
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,440
must get all you want.

711
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,519
From my point of view,

712
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:21,880
if one

713
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,559
wants something,

714
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,000
it's nothing more than

715
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,679
using all means painstakingly.

716
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,199
Mu Ze,

717
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,800
I can give you what you want.

718
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,800
It depends on if you can handle it.

719
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:40,320
Miss Lu.

720
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:41,840
What...

721
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,000
are you thinking?

722
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,159
I was thinking

723
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,920
I am just a civilian.

724
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,400
How can I bother you so much?

725
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,519
I am a bit ungrateful.

726
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,639
So.

727
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,679
So what?

728
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,519
So,

729
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,239
I'm willing to satisfy Your Highness.

730
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,239
To marry you.

731
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,079
To marry you. To marry you.

732
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,519
And become the Princess Qing.

733
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,639
Miss Lu is really unusual.

734
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:48,840
Well,

735
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:50,719
this jade pendant

736
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,079
is handed down from my ancestors.

737
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,320
Today

738
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,960
I'll give it to you

739
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,079
as the engagement token.

740
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,840
This jade pendant is handed down from my ancestors.

741
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,960
I give it to you

742
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,239
as the engagement token.

743
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:07,880
I'm willing to

744
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,440
grow old with you.

745
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:21,280
I'm willing to

746
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,800
grow old with you.

747
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,519
Please remember, Your Highness.

748
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,599
It's a partnership

749
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,440
between us.

750
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,760
No emotions.

751
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,960
I know.

752
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,039
Tomorrow,

753
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,000
I'll propose to you.

754
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,519
Ninth Brother.

755
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,599
Second Brother.

756
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,639
Why are you here?

757
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,159
Shouldn't you be in Yizhou

758
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,000
killing pests?

759
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,119
I want to give you

760
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,280
some rice cakes.

761
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:04,559
Come in.

762
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,320
Have a seat.

763
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,480
What's up?

764
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,840
Something's on your mind?

765
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,000
Second Brother, try this rice cake.

766
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:27,920
Pretty good.

767
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,159
It's better than

768
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,400
those specialties you

769
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,079
brought back before.

770
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,360
Yes.

771
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,480
This is made from the new rice
of the first half year.

772
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,679
The farmers gave me a lot.

773
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,519
If you like it,

774
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,440
I can get you some more.

775
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,639
You're worthy of the title of

776
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,599
Rice Fragrance Hermit.

777
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,840
Seems you've learned a lot.

778
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,440
Second Brother, why are you here?

779
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,280
I have something personal.

780
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,880
I should have told you.

781
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,320
You'll have a Second Sister-in-law.

782
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,239
Second...

783
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,400
So surprised?

784
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Which girl?

785
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,039
Lu Anran, the first daughter of Lu family of Su City.

786
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,559
Maybe you don't know

787
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,280
the Lu family now masters

788
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:20,000
all the river transportation of Dahan.

789
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,239
Once, we both had a dream.

790
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,440
That is the world is peaceful

791
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,119
and people are not hungry anymore.

792
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,239
This woman

793
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,119
can help us

794
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,360
to achieve our dream.

795
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,360
Only-only because of this?

796
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,039
Of course.

797
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,639
Lu Anran is broad-minded.

798
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,920
She's not an ordinary woman,

799
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,000
and is also worthy of being the Princess.

800
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,159
What's wrong? Have some tea.

801
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,400
No one wants to rob your cake.

802
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,480
Eat slowly.

803
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,719
Sorry, Second Brother.

804
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,280
You know

805
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,239
I'm always afraid of being hungry.

806
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,599
Actually,

807
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,440
every time I ate the food you brought,

808
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
I would think of

809
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,719
what you and I suffered as a child.

810
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,280
Although we are not born of the same mother,

811
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,280
I'll never forget

812
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,119
your love for me

813
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:22,800
all my life.

814
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,079
Second Brother.

815
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,800
No need to say these words between us.

816
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,000
Right,

817
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,159
if you're not busy tomorrow,

818
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,119
go propose with me.

819
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:46,039
I won't join in the fun.

820
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,880
There's something unfinished

821
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,840
in the farmland.

822
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,920
