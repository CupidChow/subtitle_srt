2
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,439
Lu Anran.

3
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,079
Your Highness.

4
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,680
I come to you today

5
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,359
all because

6
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,560
Leader Shen asked for a favor.

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,560
I have no interest in

8
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,480
how you hit the bottle

9
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,719
and impaired your health.

10
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,359
Then why don't you look at me?

11
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,760
What are you afraid of?

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,959
Lu Anran, what are you hiding for?

13
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,879
I asked Holly

14
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,760
to make it clear to you.

15
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,840
It's for leaving some space

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,120
between you and me.

17
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,800
But if you are stubborn
to ask for an answer,

18
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,520
okay,

19
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,680
I will make it explicit.

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,360
You and I

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,199
are only bosom friends.

22
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,840
The one who I love for real

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,719
is your second brother.

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,280
The one who I will marry

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,680
is Dahan Dynasty's

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,599
His Highness Prince Qing.

27
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,879
Do you understand?

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,120
No way.

29
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,639
You clearly have me in your heart.

30
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,159
Lu Anran.

31
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,159
Is there anyone forcing you?

32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,520
I said you can rely on me.

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,560
I beg you to rely on me once more.

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:35,919
Okay?

35
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,759
No one is forcing me.

36
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,479
I figure it out myself.

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,400
What about that day?

38
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,039
You said on that day.

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
We went shopping together.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,719
You told a story to me.

41
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,639
And set off fireworks for me.

42
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,360
You promised that

43
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,680
we will enjoy harvests together.

44
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,759
What are these?

45
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,039
These are all for friends.

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,360
They mean nothing at all.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,280
You said that day

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,759
if you had a second life,

49
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,080
you were unwilling to be chosen by God

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,159
for an ordeal till death.

51
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,960
What does it mean?

52
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,520
Does it mean

53
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,479
you're going to marry into
the Mansion of Prince Qing

54
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,039
the next day?

55
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,879
Because he is your second brother,

56
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,439
so I am willing to.

57
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,639
I know I can't

58
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,520
forget him.

59
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
In this life, I am destined

60
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,560
to live through thick and thin.

61
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,800
So, I told you these.

62
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,199
If I make you misunderstand,

63
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,360
I can apologize.

64
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,719
If you like my second brother,

65
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,159
why don't you show any signs

66
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,400
for a long time?

67
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,599
I didn't know his feelings

68
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,080
until I was buried by Lu Xinran.

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,240
When I was trapped in the dark

70
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,039
in desperation,

71
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,080
his face

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,120
showed up in my mind.

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,719
These feelings have been covered

74
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,120
by our agreement.

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,719
Were it not for the farce,

76
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,800
I would not learn about it

77
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,280
for this life.

78
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,080
Enough!

79
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,479
Stop it.

80
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,840
Lu Anran.

81
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,479
What about me?

82
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,080
What am I in your heart?

83
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,199
I have said all I should say.

84
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,120
Your Highness Prince Qi, please behave yourself.

85
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:40,800
Hyah!

86
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,000
Hyah!

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Hyah!

88
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,040
Miss.

89
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,680
His Highness Prince Qi is chasing us.

90
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,800
Faster.

91
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,480
Faster.

92
00:04:59,439 --> 00:04:59,920
Hyah!

93
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,199
Faster.

94
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,480
Miss.

95
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,759
His Highness is still ill.

96
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,240
He may not stand it

97
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,480
if he rushes around.

98
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,439
Hyah!

99
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,160
Stop.

100
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,399
Hyah!

101
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,120
Whoa!

102
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,519
Your Highness Prince Qi,

103
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,959
why do you entangle with me like this?

104
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,839
If you don't like me,

105
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,720
why do you still wear the bracelet?

106
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,319
I wear the bracelet

107
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:37,959
all because

108
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,079
it is exquisite.

109
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,199
Why do Your Highness Prince Qi

110
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,079
overthink?

111
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,560
It is only a bracelet.

112
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,839
Why does it mean love

113
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,040
in your eyes?

114
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,360
You know what the bracelet contains

115
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,160
represents.

116
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,439
So what?

117
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,480
If the bracelet

118
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,879
brings you any misunderstandings.

119
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,399
The relations between you and me

120
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,000
will be like this bracelet.

121
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,639
I am sorry.

122
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,800
Still angry?

123
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,160
Lingxi.

124
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,800
Miss has

125
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,800
many unavoidable

126
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,560
difficulties.

127
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,519
Look.

128
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,480
Master is back in Su City.

129
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,000
Young Master

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,600
is in the barracks far away from here.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,680
In the entire Hanjing City,

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,600
we are her only intimate friends.

133
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,920
If we are angry

134
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,000
with her,

135
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,399
to whom should

136
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,920
Miss tell her difficulties?

137
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,079
You.

138
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,240
In Miss's mind,

139
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,399
you are the greatest maid now.

140
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,120
I am nothing.

141
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,000
Jealous?

142
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,519
Yes.

143
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,240
You all think I am stupid

144
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,399
and impulsive.

145
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,079
But I have made progress

146
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,680
after I came to Hanjing.

147
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:51,920
Right. Right.

148
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,160
Our Lingxi has made progress.

149
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,399
Well,

150
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,040
Miss

151
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,199
is in a bad mood today.

152
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,120
What she said is not for you.

153
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,120
How could you

154
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,000
take it serious?

155
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,600
I didn't take it serious.

156
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,959
Miss is Miss.

157
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
She is the one

158
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,680
who I should serve for my life.

159
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,160
That's right.

160
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,759
What delicious food

161
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,920
are you going to make?

162
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,879
Red bean soup.

163
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,600
In the past,

164
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,639
when Miss was upset,

165
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,839
I would make it for her.

166
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,959
She would get better

167
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,079
after she drank it.

168
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,240
Lingxi, you are really a good girl.

169
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,079
In fact,

170
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,159
you aren't angry with Miss now,

171
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,080
are you?

172
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,799
I didn't blame Miss.

173
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,039
I just feel bad for her.

174
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,240
Holly.

175
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,360
Why does Miss

176
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,840
reject His Highness Prince Qi?

177
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,759
She likes His Highness Prince Qi so much.

178
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,399
Because Miss

179
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,200
has more esstential things to do

180
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,120
than

181
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,679
staying with His Highness Prince Qi.

182
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
Then, she should marry
His Highness Prince Qing?

183
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,960
She has to.

184
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,639
I get it.

185
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,600
It seems that I should learn more

186
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,679
to be smarter

187
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,039
and more reliable.

188
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,559
In this way, I can

189
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,120
know what Miss is thinking on earth.

190
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
Thus, help Miss

191
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,120
do things she wants to do.

192
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,279
Our Lingxi

193
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,360
is good enough.

194
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,200
After Miss drinks

195
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,240
your red bean soup,

196
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,480
she must feel better.

197
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,440
I heard you had a high fever yesterday.

198
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,440
You still drink alcohol now.

199
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,519
I am fine.

200
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,600
I know you are feeling down.

201
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,360
But no matter what,

202
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:01,960
you'd better not

203
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,799
damage your health.

204
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,759
I am not damaging my health.

205
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,639
Is Second Brother going to talk about

206
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,759
love with me?

207
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,960
No.

208
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,639
Politics?

209
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,120
No either.

210
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,720
Then what for?

211
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,279
I have told you

212
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,679
I knew you are sick.

213
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,279
So,

214
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,000
I came to have a look.

215
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,840
Okay.

216
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,360
You have seen me.

217
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,600
I know no one can force her.

218
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,519
Second Brother, do you know I once thought

219
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,399
no matter who

220
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,360
she will marry in this world,

221
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,559
as long as the bridal sedan chair

222
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,519
hasn't entered the gate,

223
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,840
I will never give up.

224
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,399
Anyone.

225
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,919
I will give a shot for myself

226
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,799
even if I lose all.

227
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,519
But I didn't expect...

228
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,120
I expected all,

229
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,159
but I didn't expect she should

230
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,360
marry into the Mansion of Prince Qing!

231
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,879
I didn't expect it was you either!

232
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,720
Before she marries you,

233
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,360
I thought God pitied me.

234
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,240
Pitied me missing her in Su City.

235
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,120
But the one who I should miss

236
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,200
will be missed anyway.

237
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,320
Thank you for making this lantern

238
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,519
for me in person.

239
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,960
I fret in the future,

240
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,320
during long nights,

241
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,720
I will feel sad in the dark.

242
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,240
I can only steal a beam of light

243
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,720
from it.

244
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,559
What's going on?

245
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,039
Miss.

246
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,120
Miss. Come and have a look.

247
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,840
Why does the grapevine wilt?

248
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,480
It was good just now.

249
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:30,440
Miss.

250
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,960
The smell of fresh paint.

251
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,200
It must be the workers

252
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,799
who painted the new house.

253
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,159
They poured the waste here directly

254
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,960
because they thought it was convenient.

255
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,120
Where are the grapes
you are going to grow from?

256
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,159
Su City.

257
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,279
You like the green grapes

258
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,519
from Su City the most, don't you?

259
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,480
But I found later

260
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,519
they are exclusive to Su City.

261
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,879
It's hard to grow in the north.

262
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,840
Without the grapes,

263
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,840
we wouldn't know His Highness

264
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,320
treats Miss so wholeheartedly.

265
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,480
Would you like to believe me?

266
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,360
Whatever happens in the future,

267
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,759
I will face it with you.

268
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,960
Lu Anran.

269
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,679
What am I in your heart?

270
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,399
Miss, where are you going?

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,759
I'll go chase Miss.

272
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,120
Miss.

273
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,279
Miss, watch out.

274
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,119
In case of scratching you hands.

275
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,400
Losing track of time,

276
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,680
I am able to encounter you.

277
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,079
Kiss you, love you,

278
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,039
forever live up to you.

279
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,279
His Highness

280
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,640
pampers Lu Anran so much.

281
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,160
He not only allows her
to live in her own mansion,

282
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,839
but also

283
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:34,759
breaks the walls that connect her yard

284
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,759
and the mansion.

285
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,400
What does it mean?

286
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,640
Hide his precious woman well?

287
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,720
It must be that coquette

288
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,160
instigates His Highness to do so.

289
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,599
But why does her backyard

290
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,960
connect

291
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,359
our backyard?

292
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,880
What a coincidence.

293
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,240
She must deliberately

294
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,519
try to approach His Highness.

295
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,240
I will let her know today

296
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,240
who is the real mistress

297
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,519
of the Mansion of Prince Qing.

298
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,559
Grapevine.

299
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,799
Miss is already sad.

300
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,160
Please listen to us.

301
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,440
Get better soon.

302
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,480
Lu Anran.

303
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,640
Lu Anran.

304
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,759
Why are you here?

305
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,079
Where is Lu Anran?

306
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,160
Our Miss is not here.

307
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,640
Ms. Xiao, please go back.

308
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,960
Where is she going?

309
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,920
Why should I report

310
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,160
our Miss's whereabouts to you?

311
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,079
Bold!

312
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,359
You little maid

313
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,160
should talk with our princess like this.

314
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,119
Our Miss

315
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,279
hasn't married into the mansion yet.

316
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,920
Why are you showing
your pretentiousness here?

317
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,359
What's more, you are not the princess.

318
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,319
What a bold servant!

319
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,759
You will know what a maid is like

320
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,400
from her hostress.

321
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,039
If I don't

322
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,079
flex my muscles to you today,

323
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,240
your hostress

324
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,680
will climb over my head one day.

325
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:15,519
Maid.

326
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,359
Yes.

327
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,759
What are you doing?

328
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,680
Stop it.

329
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:22,319
What are you doing?

330
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,079
Go away. Bad girl.

331
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:23,799
Stop.

332
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,240
Full of rabbit lanterns here.

333
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:28,920
Go away.

334
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,359
Rabbit lanterns.

335
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,559
Hung rabbit lanterns.

336
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,440
Miss.

337
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,240
It's so dark.

338
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,559
What about going back first.

339
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,279
As dawn breaks tomorrow,

340
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,240
I will take people to find it.

341
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,160
No.

342
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,640
I must find it tonight.

343
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,200
Tomorrow...

344
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,599
Holly.

345
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,319
I don't have a tomorrow.

346
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,000
The grapevine wilted.

347
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,279
I lost him as well.

348
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,079
I can't lose the bracelet anymore.

349
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:02,880
Sparrow.

350
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,359
If you dare to touch the grapevine,

351
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,119
I will kill you.

352
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,079
See I dare to touch the grapevine or not?

525
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,039
Lingxi.

526
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,119
Lingxi.

527
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,240
It's me.

528
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,720
Me everytime.

529
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Lingxi is right.

530
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,119
I have changed.

531
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,799
There was no secret

532
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,000
between us before.

533
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,720
But now,

534
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,319
I fret she is innocent and impulsive.

535
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,640
So, I don't tell her anything.

536
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,200
Back then, I planned to make
Lu Xinran get married for me.

537
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,079
I considered everyone

538
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,079
but I didn't consider Lingxi.

539
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,640
This time is the same.

540
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,759
She was so worried about me.

541
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,680
But our last conversation

542
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,559
was a fight.

543
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
It's His Highness Prince Qi.

544
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,359
Let me explain to him.

545
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,400
I am supposed to

546
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,599
end our relations.

547
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,359
Thus, it'll be more completely.

548
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,039
For me and for him,

549
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,799
it's the best.

550
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,880
(Back then, I planned to make
Lu Xinran get married for me.)

551
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,759
(I considered everyone)

552
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,319
(but I didn't consider Lingxi.)

553
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,839
(This time is the same.)

554
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,079
(She was so worried about me.)

555
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,199
(But our last conversation)

556
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,159
(was a fight.)

557
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:21,840
You come to Danzhou

558
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,880
not for business, right?

559
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,360
You know so well about

560
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,599
the details of missing famine relief.

561
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,039
You also know Qinghe Gang well.

562
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,000
(How much do you know about)

563
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,239
(Lu Anran?)

564
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,679
(She left a message to me)

565
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,840
(when she was in Su City)

566
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,679
(saying she would wait for me in Danzhou.)

567
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,559
(She sees us clearly)

568
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,119
(all the time.)

569
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,360
(But we see her)

570
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,000
(like seeing through fogs.)

571
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,039
The one who desperately saved Holly

572
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,400
is you.

573
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,280
The one who sacrificed herself

574
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,920
to catch Gao Chengxian is you.

575
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:47,960
And now the one who cheats
in the Imperial Examination

576
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,800
and makes Xu Qingce die is you as well.

577
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,800
Which one is you?

578
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,400
Which is the real one?

579
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,760
(Have you ever thought)

580
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:35,800
(everything develops)

581
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,559
(in its own way?)

582
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
(It is like a long river.)

583
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
(If you)

584
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,880
(stop it halfway,)

585
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,599
it must find another way.

586
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,480
But no matter how,

587
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,360
it will never stop flowing.

588
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,199
Miss,

589
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:27,599
what are you doing?

590
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,960
If I burn my hand and feel the pain,

591
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,519
can I awake

592
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,880
from the nightmare?

593
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,600
(Dewei Hall)

594
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,719
Second Brother,

595
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,639
I want to pick up Lu Anran

596
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,760
in person tomorrow.

597
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,480
Actually,

598
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,079
you don't have to do this.

599
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,000
Second Brother,

600
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,840
agree with me, please.

I'll come again.

633
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,079
This is Miss Lu, right?

634
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,119
The daughter of the Lu Family
does have something.

635
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:54,960
With the half-dead Lu Mansion,

636
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,159
First Miss

637
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,039
still wants to get married.

638
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:58,519
More than this.

639
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,719
The one whom she will marry
is Prince Qing.

640
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,679
I heard

641
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,079
she wants to marry into the mansion
even as a concubine.

642
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,960
Miss Lu

643
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,679
can be counted as

644
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,840
a famous heroine.

645
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,679
Why does she

646
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,639
come down to be a concubine?

647
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,159
So, I said she is awesome.

648
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,119
Not long ago, the second miss

649
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:18,199
was divorced because of the affair.

650
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,199
So, she hurried to seize the chance

651
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,280
to connect the royal.

652
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,719
Isn't that her brother-in-law?

653
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,400
They

654
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,800
have flirted with each other early?

655
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,960
The daughter of the Lu Family

656
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,639
rivals a coquette.

657
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,079
Oh my.

658
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,199
I seem to know nothing about you.

659
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,559
You can stand

660
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,719
even such humiliation.

661
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:59,079
You hide the relationship

662
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,159
with my second brother so deep.

663
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,599
Your Highness Prince Qi,

664
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,079
you welcome the bride for your brother

665
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:07,159
to ask this?

666
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:11,800
I am here

667
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,320
to end my wishful thinking.

668
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,440
I will ask you three questions.

669
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,119
Answer me honestly.

670
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,039
You have early planned all

671
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,639
from Su City to Hanjing.

672
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,159
You even

673
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:32,719
forged the affair of your sister

674
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,480
to help the Lu Family retreat.

675
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:40,360
Right?

676
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,280
Yes.

677
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,159
The second question.

678
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:51,519
Do you count me

679
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,599
in your plan?

680
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,079
Yes.

681
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,199
The third question.

682
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,079
Holly asked me for Snow Cicada

683
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:12,800
and Gelsmium elegans.

684
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,920
They are for
the substitute marriage, right?

685
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,320
You poisoned yourself

686
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,280
with the medicines I found for you.

687
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,280
Yes.

688
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,760
Lu Anran.

689
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,320
What vendetta is it?

690
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,280
You plotted even if losing your life.

691
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,960
To reach your goal,

692
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,119
you can ignore your friend.

693
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:48,239
Harm your family.

694
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:50,519
You even used my true love

695
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:51,440
towards you.

696
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,159
Your Highness Prince Qi is right.

697
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:05,119
I am such a callous person.

698
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,599
Your Highness Prince Qi was blinded by me.

699
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,480
You got me wrong.

700
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,880
Now, I have told you honestly.

701
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,559
Your Highness can give up now.

702
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:19,000
Holly.

703
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:22,000
The rain stops. Let's go.

704
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:42,880
Down.

705
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,280
Don't you regret for real?

706
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,519
Don't.

707
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:48,199
The cruel fate

708
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:50,280
used the high wall
of Prince Qing's Mansion

709
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,760
to split the world into two parts

710
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,840
eventually.

711
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,280
Since now, Mu Chuan couldn't step into

712
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,800
the world ahead as wishes.

713
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,760
When Lu Anran trapped herself

714
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,880
in the grand cage,

715
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,320
the vast world outside

716
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,360
seemed to lose its meaning

717
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:10,920
instantly.
