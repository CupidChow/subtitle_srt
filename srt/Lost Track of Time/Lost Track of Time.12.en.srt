=Lost Track of Time=
=Episode 12=

2
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,159
What are you doing here?

3
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:44,799
Watch out.

4
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,400
Why are you here?

5
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
Can't I

6
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,640
pay a visit

7
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,040
without a greeting letter?

8
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,200
Your Highness is joking.

9
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,120
Why do you look like

10
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,959
you are on guard against your archenemy?

11
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,439
Are you

12
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,480
terrified against me?

13
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
Is your hand alright?

14
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,919
A small scratch is no big deal.

15
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,560
I appreaciate Your Highness' generosity,

16
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,840
but I don't like owing favors,

17
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,360
especially yours.

18
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,639
The Chinese medical wine smells strong.

19
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Will I

20
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,199
violate Your Highness' taboo?

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,039
What taboo?

22
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,639
Never drinks alcohol.

23
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:47,840
How do you know

24
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,120
I don't drink?

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
I haven't seen for once.

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,960
I am just guessing.

27
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,120
Did I

28
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,319
forget anything?

29
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,000
What does Your Highness mean?

30
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,439
Have we met

31
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,199
before I went to Su City?

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,599
Why does Your Highness ask this?

33
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,120
On the day before
the hair-pinning ceremony,

34
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,680
I met Your Highness for the first time.

35
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,479
But your looks tell me

36
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,479
we've met before.

37
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,080
Sis,

38
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,120
Mr. Xu wants to
borrow the books in the study.

39
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:25,960
I am here to...

40
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,280
Greet Your Highness Princess Qing.

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,199
Who is Mr. Xu you mentioned?

42
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,759
He is a talented man

43
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,400
in Su City, even in the southern Su area.

44
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,120
Mr. Xu is great.

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,280
So capable.

46
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,039
From the grass roots.

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,479
He is suitable

48
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,919
to be a substitute
for Minister Yan's son.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,919
(Winning the first prize,)

50
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,879
(Mr. Xu was used by Mu Ze)

51
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,639
(and assasinated by Prince Yi)

52
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,800
(on the street soon.)

53
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,319
(If he had failed and returned home,)

54
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,520
(he might have been saved.)

55
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,680
(It's never too late)

56
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
(to attend the exam after three years.)

57
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,479
(Why not make use of and go with it?)

58
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,560
What?

59
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,000
You don't look like

60
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,360
you are willing to.

61
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,560
I know there is no room

62
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,600
for what Your Highness decides.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,319
Tomorrow is my birthday.

64
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,399
It's a nice present.

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Take your maid home

66
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,040
after the exam result is unveiled.

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
(Mansion of Prince Qing)

68
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,519
Cuicui, stop it.

69
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,120
Okay.

70
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Okay. Slower.

71
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,000
Your Highness. Your Highness.

72
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,560
Leave it to me.

73
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,600
Get out.

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,519
Get out of there.

75
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,920
Take care.

76
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,279
Take care, Your Highness.

77
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,839
Take it slow.

78
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,800
Take care.

79
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,720
Look.

80
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,800
Those minions.

81
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,519
How could they be like this?

82
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,199
They don't take

83
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,480
His Highness' birthday seriously.

84
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,279
There can't be someone...

85
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,040
Someone who doesn't care about

86
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,839
his birthday.

87
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,439
Right?

88
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,279
Mom,

89
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,439
today is my birthday.

90
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,920
But it is the date I hate most.

91
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,079
Because there is never a soul

92
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:31,680
who knows your name.

93
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,879
There will be a day

94
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,519
when I put your name

95
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,519
in the royal ancestral temple.

96
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,519
Let you be enshrined by generations.

97
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,759
What are you doing?

98
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,920
Since Your Highness toils day and night,

99
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,120
I am always afraid that

100
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,959
I can't spare your distress.

101
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,160
And today is your birthday,

102
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
I can only

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,639
make a bowl of longevity noodles
for you personally.

104
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,519
Wish you live a long life

105
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
and all your dreams come true.

106
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
You should

107
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,600
stay in your own court.

108
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,639
Don't make efforts

109
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,799
to flatter me.

110
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,639
Your Highness. Your Highness.

111
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,720
It's not for flattering you.

112
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,879
When I was in the Lu Family,

113
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:48,919
no one cared about my birthday

114
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,879
every year.

115
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
The whole family prepared feasts

116
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,759
for Lu Anran.

117
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,720
I felt lost inside,

118
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,919
but I could only say I didn't mind it.

119
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,759
I don't know

120
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,320
why you don't celebrate your birthday.

121
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
So, I just put myself in your shoes.

122
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,679
I don't want Your Highness

123
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,559
to feel

124
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,679
a little bit of disappointment.

125
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,440
Even when you are showing your sincerity,

126
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,320
you don't forget to depreciate Lu Anran.

127
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,159
But Princess,

128
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,120
you seem to have a poor memory.

129
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,919
I have reminded you

130
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,320
to behave yourself.

131
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,799
Don't stir things up.

132
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,720
Your Highness,

133
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
what we've made has no conclusion yet.

134
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,720
As I married you,

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,120
I will only live for you

136
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,519
for this life.

137
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,600
But Lu Anran won't.

138
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,519
Her resurrection

139
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,200
is strange enough.

140
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,080
And now she comes to Hanjing,

141
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,799
haunting us.

142
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,519
What does she want from us?

143
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,399
Your Highness shall beware of her.

144
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,960
Even if Lu Anran has an ax to grind,

145
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,519
she is more useful than you.

146
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,840
You are just a concubine's child.

147
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,919
The Lu Family thinks you are worthless.

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,279
It's I who feed you now.

149
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,399
Were it not becasue you can't mess around

150
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,320
with the imperial marriage,

151
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,639
do you think

152
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,559
you have any chance to be pretentious

153
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,960
in front of me?

154
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,159
Do you dislike me so much?

155
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,279
Your princess title

156
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,159
was stolen from her.

157
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,960
If you even try to gain a foothold here,

158
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,639
then I

159
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,600
will never go easy on you.

160
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,679
Also,

161
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,840
if you dare to take it upon yourself again,

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,799
the bowl of noodles

163
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,039
will become the offering

164
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,440
on your grave next year.

165
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,120
Remember?

166
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,159
Miss.

167
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,279
Lu Xinran

168
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,840
is really unfortunate.

169
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,080
I fret that Cuicui may have a rough time.

170
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,600
She will get out of the sufferings

171
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,919
one day.

172
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,720
It's all because of you

173
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,840
who made me so humiliated today.

174
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,360
Your Highness,

175
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
it's my fault.

176
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,720
Please forgive me.

177
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,200
Keep slapping.

178
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,720
Lu Anran,

179
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,159
why are you always around me?

180
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,080
The Double Fish Order
is still in her hand.

181
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,759
His Highness will
give way to her somehow anyway.

182
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,159
Right.

183
00:11:59,159 --> 00:11:59,960
Yun.

184
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,559
I got Yun.

185
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,600
(Examination Hall)

186
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:17,600
Brother Xu.

187
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,440
(Select Talents for the Nation)
Yun.

188
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
How is the exam?

189
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,080
The question

190
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,039
is set well.

191
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,639
We don't have to
write an eight-legged essay,

192
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,879
nor verses, ditties, odes or songs.

193
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,799
It asks us

194
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
to give advice

195
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,879
on the starvation

196
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,000
and heavy taxes

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,919
Dahan's civilians suffer.

198
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:31,840
I stated

199
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,639
all the panaceas

200
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,759
I can come up with.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,080
So jubilant.

202
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,120
That is great.

203
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:36,840
Yes.

204
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,240
Yun.

205
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:39,679
It's my fourth times

206
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,840
to attend the exam in the capital.

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,799
To raise the traveling expenses

208
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,600
for me all this way,

209
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,480
my family has been destitute.

210
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,559
But if I can

211
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,519
score high this time,

212
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,039
I can finally

213
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,519
live up to them.

214
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,279
Brother Xu,

215
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,360
I heard the chief in the Imperial Academy

216
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,759
was once a chief examiner.

217
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,799
Really?

218
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,279
Yeah.

219
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,159
Let me ask him to make an assessment.

220
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,120
Let's go.

221
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,559
Go.

222
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,360
Go.

223
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,440
I didn't hear you mention it.

224
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,679
Ask him to

225
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,399
judge your answer then.

226
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:06,759
Okay.

227
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,480
Yun.

228
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,200
Why don't you visit me

229
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,519
since you came to Hanjing?

230
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,320
What brings you here?

231
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,240
Brother Xu,

232
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,080
this is my second sister.

233
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,039
My name is Xu Qingce.

234
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,919
You are Yun's friend?

235
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,559
If you need

236
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,600
any help,

237
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,200
you can reach me
at the Mansion of Prince Qing.

238
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
She is Princess Qing now.

239
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,159
Yun,

240
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,480
I will wait for you over there.

241
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,200
I will leave you

242
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,600
to catch up.

243
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,519
I am leaving.

244
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,039
Tell me now if you need something.

245
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,440
I have to take Brother Xu

246
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,679
to find the chief to rewrite the paper.

247
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,480
Yun.

248
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,480
I just want to tell you

249
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,519
that you are fooled by Lu Anran.

250
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,039
What are you saying?

251
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,320
Lu Anran told me in person.

252
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,879
She killed our mom.

253
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,759
She almost killed me.

254
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,519
Do you know it?

255
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,399
Nonsense.

256
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,120
Mom got a dose of her own medicine!

257
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,759
She failed to harm First Madam.

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,320
She still wanted to kill Big sis.

259
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,159
Mom did this for whom?

260
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,200
For you!

261
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,240
Nowadays, the Lu Family's property

262
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,120
is all owned

263
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,360
by Lu Anran.

264
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,720
She sowed discord between us.

265
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,639
Isn't it for

266
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,840
grabbing all the property alone?

267
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,679
Look clearly.

268
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,360
I am the very sister

269
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,320
who shares the same mother with you.

270
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,679
You come to me today

271
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,639
and sow discord between Big sis and me.

272
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,120
Isn't it for the family property?

273
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,600
Yun.

274
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,960
Sister.

275
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,320
I beg you, okay?

276
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,000
You have been

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,679
Princess Qing now.

278
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:54,679
You have realized

279
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,840
mother's dream.

280
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,600
Stop asking for more.

281
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,799
Yun.

282
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,240
You all help Lu Anran.

283
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,879
I will let you

284
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,759
see her real face

285
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,840
one day.

286
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,120
Go. Let's go.

287
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,960
How is it?

288
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,919
Let me have a look.

289
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,639
Excuse me.

290
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,639
Excuse me. Excuse me.

291
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,159
Excuse me.

292
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,720
Excuse me.

293
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,600
(1st: Yan Ziyun
2nd: Wang Chudao 3rd: Bi Shengjie)

294
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,679
I made it.

295
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,600
I made it.

296
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,559
Congratulations!

297
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,080
Congrats! Congrats!

298
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,919
Congratulations! Congratulations!

299
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,440
Never mind. Never mind.

300
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,320
If you don't win the champion,

301
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,480
the Imperial Scholar background
is fine as well.

302
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,399
Let me check it.

303
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,500
(The Rankings)

304
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,500
(Yan Ziyun, Wang Chudao, Bi Shengjie)

305
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,480
Miss Lu, please.

306
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,039
Your Highness,

307
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,759
Miss Lu is here.

308
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,840
Coming.

309
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,200
You hurry to here

310
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,480
to take your reward, right?

311
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,360
Whether give me or not
depends on Your Highness.

312
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,879
If I am right,

313
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,480
the Yan Family

314
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,080
is preparing the feast
to celebrate the first prize.

315
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,960
Relax.

316
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,600
I will do

317
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,879
what I promised you.

318
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

319
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,600
Bring her in.

320
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,120
Bring her in.

321
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,159
Lingxi.

322
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,639
Miss.

323
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,360
I am here to take you home.

324
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,320
Is it true?

325
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,519
I still have some concern.

326
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,639
The agreement between us before

327
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,960
is a wedding aggreement,

328
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,200
which can prove our relations.

329
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,640
But now we collaborate with no evidence.

330
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,920
How can I trust you?

331
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,000
How about this?

332
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,519
Here is an agreement.

333
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,640
Sign it.

334
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,039
If one day,

335
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:22,960
any party

336
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,599
betrays the other,

337
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,319
he or she will be punished
by the other as they wish.

338
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,319
How is it?

339
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,279
Wait.

340
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:52,480
Raise.

341
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,680
What are you doing?

342
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,920
The Mansion of Prince Qing doesn't need

343
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,759
a reluctant alliance.

344
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,100
(Lu Anran)

345
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,480
See Miss Lu off nicely.

346
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,599
Miss Lu, please leave.

347
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,279
Mr. Cai.

348
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,000
You are injured.

349
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,680
Your Highness.

350
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,480
Thank you for Your Highness' kindness.

351
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,839
But it's improper for me to receive it.

352
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Please Your Highness

353
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,839
doesn't embarrass me.

354
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,240
It's normal

355
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,480
for me to care about you as I treat you

356
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,400
as His Highness' consultant,

357
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,480
let alone you're my friend.

358
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:36,920
I don't dare to.

359
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,160
If you regard me as an outsider like this,

360
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,599
I will be sad.

361
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,559
You know.

362
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,839
In this mansion,

363
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,920
there are a few for me

364
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,000
to extend my care.

365
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,000
Fine. Thank you, Your Highness.

366
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,000
But I don't understand

367
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,079
now that Lu Anran
gets closer with His Highness,

368
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,960
why did she prick you?

369
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,000
His Highness caught Lingxi

370
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,200
because he wanted Lu Anran

371
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,440
to help him cooperate with Minister Yan.

372
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,119
Today, the rankings are out.

373
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,000
Lu Anran has made contributions
to the rankings.

374
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,359
So, they signed

375
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,240
a new agreement today.

376
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,000
My injury

377
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,440
was just a result

378
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,880
of their tentative choices to each other.

379
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,079
What help?

380
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,799
We were looking for a talent.

381
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,039
Lu Anran introduced a right option,

382
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,799
which did Minister Yan a favor.

383
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:35,960
Then again,

384
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,240
he is from Your Princess's hometown.

385
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,319
Holly.

386
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,440
I am back.

387
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,680
Lingxi.

388
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,160
It's great you are back.

389
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,119
It's great you are back.

390
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,160
Do you miss me?

391
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,119
Yes.

392
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,319
I will arrange a room for you

393
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,599
after I clean this pillar.

394
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,240
What is going on?

395
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,599
You didn't arrange my room

396
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,000
ahead of time.

397
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,680
And why do you prioritize

398
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,240
cleaning the pillar?

399
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,759
I will arange it for you now.

400
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,680
Alright?

401
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,200
Let's go.

402
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,160
That's more like it.

403
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,119
What's wrong with your hand?

404
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,519
It seems that

405
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,279
you do care about me.

406
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,359
Stop it. Stop it.

407
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,119
Let's treat it.

408
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,279
It's no big deal.

409
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,559
It doesn't hurt for real.

410
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,119
What is your sad face?

411
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,720
Just a failure.

412
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,440
You don't need to worry about me.

413
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:15,880
It's me...

414
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,039
It's me myself.

415
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,160
Aimed high without the abilities.

416
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,440
Therefore,

417
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,640
I let the time of over a decade

418
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,440
pass in vain.

419
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,599
Mr. Xu,

420
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,119
you don't have to sell yourself short.

421
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,559
I promise you

422
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,759
the Lu Family will ensure
you are fully supported

423
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,000
without further worry

424
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,759
however times you attend the exam.

425
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,480
Thank you for your good intention.

426
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,960
I really appreciate it.

427
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,599
But if I agree with it for real,

428
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,240
my past study time

429
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,039
is frittered away

430
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:54,960
for sure.

431
00:23:59,119 --> 00:23:59,960
Tomorrow, I will

432
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,920
leave for Su City.

433
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,599
Thank you

434
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,480
Yun

435
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,559
and Miss Lu

436
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,519
for your care recently.

437
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,119
Farewell.

438
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,640
A few days ago, the chief said

439
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,759
Mr. Xu's essay was ingenious.

440
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,200
He could rank third class in the exam.

441
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,160
How could...

442
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,960
Your Highness, Mr. Lu is here.

443
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,839
What do you call me for?

444
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,279
Yun.

445
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:01,839
Have a seat.

446
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,200
You are my only relative

447
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,759
in Hanjing.

448
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,440
Even if I ask you to stay with me,

449
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,039
you don't have to be loath to do it.

450
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,759
Big sis is your relative too.

451
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,440
She treated you so well before.

452
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
It's because you did

453
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,279
something you shouldn't.

454
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,759
You stay with Lu Anran

455
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,920
all day.

456
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,720
But do you really

457
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,799
see through her?

458
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,839
What do you mean?

459
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,279
Sis,

460
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,839
don't try to stir up a dispute

461
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,920
between Big sis and me.

462
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,319
Has your friend Xu Qingce

463
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,359
failed?

464
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,359
How do you know?

465
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,279
Isn't it weird

466
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,559
that Mr. Xu couldn't
make himself on the rankings

467
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,279
with his abilities and insights?

468
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:09,200
Ask

469
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,359
your good sister

470
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,720
if she changed Xu Qingce's paper

471
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,960
for that of Minister Yan's son.

472
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,720
No way.

473
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,640
Don't you buy it?

474
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,279
Then go ask your classmates

475
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,519
in the Imperial Academy.

476
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,960
They are all born with wealth and fame.

477
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,000
It's not hard for them

478
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,079
to get the paper of the champion

479
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,559
from the court, right?

480
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,880
Come in.

481
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,319
Yun.

482
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,119
Sis,

483
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,480
please do

484
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,440
Mr. Xu a favor.

485
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,000
What?

486
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,300
(Yan Ziyun)

487
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,799
Mr. Xu's paper

488
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,799
was secretly changed by someone.

489
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,079
He is supposed to be the champion.

490
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,680
Sis.

491
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,759
Why don't you say anything?

492
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,000
I get it.

493
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,759
When Second Sister told me about this,

494
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
I thought

495
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,559
she didn't change

496
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,160
and wanted to frame you again.

497
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,599
But I really didn't expect,

498
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,599
sis,

499
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,039
you should do such a thing!

500
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:50,599
Yun.

501
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:51,640
I will explain it to you

502
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,240
later.

503
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,920
But you can't

504
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,759
tell Mr. Xu about this.

505
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,200
Get it?

506
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,359
Till now,

507
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,440
you still want to hide it from him.

508
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,200
The champion now

509
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,880
is the son of Minister Yan.

510
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,200
If you make it serious,

511
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,319
will he stop there?

512
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,079
Even if it's for Mr. Xu's life,

513
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,279
you should pretend you don't know.

514
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,319
Then, why should you did this?

515
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,920
It would be nothing

516
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,920
if you didn't change the paper.

517
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:13,200
Sis, why?

518
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,680
Why?

519
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,759
Why?

520
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,039
Tell me.

521
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,119
Why did you do this?

522
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,440
Tell me.

523
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,000
Yun.

524
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,079
This is?

525
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,920
This is my paper.

526
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,640
Yan Ziyun?

527
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,160
Yun,

528
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:50,039
where did you get this paper?

529
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,720
Tell me.

530
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,559
It's mine.

531
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,240
This is...

532
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,880
This is the essay of the champion

533
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,319
shared in the court.

534
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,359
Brother Xu,

535
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,119
it is your essay.

536
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,480
Brother Xu.

537
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,720
It's my paper.

538
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:21,799
Are you okay?

539
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,160
Brother...

540
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,440
Brother Xu. Brother Xu.

541
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,880
Brother Xu, where are you going?

542
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,519
Mr. Xu.

543
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:30,480
Yun.

544
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,200
Mr. Xu.

545
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,039
Brother Xu.

546
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,599
Mr. Xu.

547
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,119
Young Master.

548
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,160
Miss, Cuicui sent us a message saying

549
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,680
Lu Xinran met Young Master in the mansion.

550
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,799
But she didn't know the reason.

551
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,119
Prepare a horsecar
to the Mansion of Prince Qing.

552
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,519
Then, what about Young Master?

553
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,559
I can't stop him now.

554
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:46,680
Ask Shan Yue to watch him.

555
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,920
Tell me if there are troubles.

556
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,319
Okay.

557
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,559
Shan Yue.

558
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,279
Open the door.

559
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,400
A complaint to make.

560
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,000
A complaint to make.

561
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,000
A complaint

562
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,559
to make.

563
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,279
I, Xu Qingce,

564
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,720
receiving bounties
from my relatives and villagers,

565
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,400
desire to serve the country.

566
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,440
So, I made endeavors
to study for over a decade.

567
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,359
But I didn't expect someone

568
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,799
changed my paper with his power,

569
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,480
stealing my championship.

570
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,359
Please look up.

571
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,500
(Examination Hall)

572
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,640
The examination hall

573
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,039
is not

574
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,720
a place for the selection of talents,

575
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,519
but a vault for the wealth

576
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,079
and a grave for the poor.

577
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,680
What is the meaning for we the poor

578
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,480
to study hard for twelve years?

579
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,640
Yan Ziyun

580
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,160
won the first prize

581
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,920
with my paper.

582
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,480
The examination hall

583
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:21,839
must give an explanation today.

584
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,079
Open the door.

585
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,359
Give the first prize back to me.

586
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,839
You look thinner

587
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,079
after you work in the examination hall.

588
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:46,720
During the days when we set the questions,

589
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,240
I have debated with those old pedants

590
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,559
for some days.

591
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,119
Then when we scored the papers,

592
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,200
it's much tougher.

593
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:54,880
My body

594
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,319
did lose fat.

595
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:57,799
Since you are here,

596
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,480
have a meal together.

597
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,200
I ask the chefs

598
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
to make you delicious food.

599
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,799
Okay.

600
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,079
I heard Yan Ziyun

601
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,160
was a rich playboy.

602
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,799
But I read his paper this time.

603
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,920
His purity

604
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:10,839
and far-sightedness

605
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,880
are beyond my thought.

606
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,200
Your Highness.

607
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,839
Minister Yan is visiting you.

608
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,640
Your Highness Prince Qing.

609
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,119
Your Highness Prince Qi.

610
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,440
Minister Yan.

611
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,559
Ninth Brother.

612
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:25,640
Second Brother, I'll leave you.

613
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,759
Minister Yan, please.

614
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,519
After you.

615
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,160
Your Highness.

616
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,119
Someone is beating the drum
to make a complaint in front of the hall.

617
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,240
He said his paper

618
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,079
was changed by someone.

619
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,279
Minister Yan, please rest assured.

620
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,240
The issue.

621
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,079
I have sent someone to handle it.

622
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,079
Fu Yunan is smart.

623
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,720
It is his first time
to hold the Spring Imperial Exam.

624
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,759
He doesn't want to

625
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:57,519
see such a scene either

626
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,119
as it will damage his reputation.

627
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,880
What do you think?

628
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,400
Then,

629
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,039
I will go back and do something.

630
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:08,920
Otherwise, I can't feel at ease.

631
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:09,960
Okay.

632
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,440
I am leaving.

633
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,679
Princess.

634
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,039
What are you doing?

635
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,679
Hands off.

636
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,239
What are you doing?

637
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,159
Lu Anran.

638
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,039
I am His Highness' wife.

639
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:40,360
I don't mind

640
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,119
if you usually don't respect me.

641
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,880
But now you disgrace me like this

642
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,840
in front of His Highness.

643
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,000
Do you respect His Highness

644
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,880
or not?

645
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,760
You know you are

646
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,719
His Highness' wife.

647
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,519
Your Highness,

648
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,800
Lu Xinran intended to disclose

649
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,719
the change of the papers to Yun.

650
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,320
She almost destroyed all you have done

651
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,360
for the examination.

652
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,400
Minister Yan still asked me

653
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,719
why Xu Qingce knew this.

654
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,079
I also doubted it.

655
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,960
But now I know why.

656
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:01,920
Lu Anran,

657
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,320
you slander me.

658
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,800
Your Highness,

659
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,320
don't trust her.

660
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,360
Just because she ruined it

661
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,639
and she is afraid that
Lu Yun will incriminate her,

662
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,159
so she smears me.

663
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,599
More than this,

664
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,639
I know one thing accidentally

665
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,440
that Lu Yun took Xu Qingce

666
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,800
to find the chief of the Imperial Academy

667
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,239
to rewrite the paper.

668
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,559
It must because

669
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,440
Lu Anran planned to
destroy Your Highness' plan

670
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,320
from the beginning.

671
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,960
A few days ago, the chief said

672
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,920
Mr. Xu's essay was ingenious.

673
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,320
He could rank third class in the exam.

674
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,039
How could...

675
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,480
Your Highness,

676
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,280
Lu Anran

677
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,079
is always duplicitous.

678
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,519
She set a trap
to let me be the surrogate wife,

679
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,639
then she could get out of it.

680
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,199
And now she ruins your plan.

681
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,000
Your Highness,

682
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,639
don't trust her.

683
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,599
Lu Xinran, it is because

684
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,679
you have a grudge against me

685
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,800
and you knew accidentally

686
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,079
about the plan of His Highness and me,

687
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:00,880
so you instigated Yun

688
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,079
to take Xu Qingce to rewrite the paper

689
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,679
and told Yun

690
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,679
I engaged in the change of the papers

691
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,880
to make it a big scene now.

692
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,599
For one, you made me flop.

693
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,480
For another, you sowed discord

694
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,719
between Yun and me.

695
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:11,119
Killing two birds with one stone.

696
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,320
You are talking nonsense.

697
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,800
Your Highness,

698
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,280
don't trust her.

699
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,559
Since they were both our own words,

700
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,639
how do you assure

701
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,559
I am taking nonsense?

702
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,440
If I did wreck

703
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,360
His Highness' plan,

704
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,400
how would you get a chance

705
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,639
to mess around here?

706
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,840
Your Highness,

707
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,519
now that we can't

708
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,719
tell the truth in a minute,

709
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,280
the priority is to appease Xu Qingce

710
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,840
and defuse the situation.

711
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,079
I have sent

712
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,519
Cai Wangjin to address it.

713
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,679
Since Xu Qingce
is able to win the first prize,

714
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,639
if Your Highness can use him,

715
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,159
you will get a right-hand man.

716
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,440
I think Xu Qingce

717
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,960
will consent

718
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,920
after evaluating the state of affairs.

719
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,679
I have no time

720
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,320
to investigate the cause of the issue.

721
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,880
After the situation is defused,

722
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:55,119
I will settle the scores with you two.

723
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,280
Lu Anran,

724
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,719
if the case of the chief is real,

725
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,280
I will leave it to you.

726
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Forestall future trouble.

727
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:03,760
Yes.

728
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,079
Fu Yunan, tell me.

729
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,360
Why don't you look into

730
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,880
the Xu Qingce issue?

731
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,039
Prince Qi,

732
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:22,920
several powers in the capital

733
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,920
are watching the examination hall.

734
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,199
Even if the mayor of the capital
doesn't send attendants here,

735
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,840
other officials will also send attendants.

736
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:30,880
How can we investigate

737
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,440
with our tiny power?

738
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,719
Then you even need to look into it.

739
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,400
(Zhigong Hall)
If you and I

740
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,000
watch the Imperial Examination
falling to a place

741
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,199
for the power and money trade
without doing anything,

742
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,480
where do students

743
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,039
put their high spirits

744
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,039
for serving the nation?

745
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,159
How does the examination hall

746
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,239
select talents for the court?

747
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,000
If we do investigate it,

748
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,119
we may incriminate

749
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:46,960
some nobles in the court.

750
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,199
Won't it

751
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,960
affect you yourself?

752
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,280
What do you mean?

753
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,599
This is

754
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,880
all I can say.

755
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:03,800
Your Highness,

756
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,840
please behave yourself.

757
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,119
Your Highness Prince Qing, Prince Qi.

758
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,880
Ninth Brother.

759
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,719
Second Brother, I will leave you.

760
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,280
Mr. Xu.

761
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,159
I was once a student

762
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,440
as you are.

763
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,719
I really understand

764
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,519
your feeling now.

765
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,280
You won the title and reputation

766
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,239
after making endeavors for over a decade,

767
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,440
but you have to relinquish it
to the other now.

768
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,960
You must feel resentful.

769
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,960
But have you ever considered the case?

770
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,920
The substitute

771
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:06,360
is the son of the Minister of Personnel.

772
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,159
Even if you regain your title and reputation,

773
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,679
but you will offend him.

774
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,440
How will you grab a foothold
in the official circles afterwards?

775
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,159
If you help His Highness now,

776
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,719
Minister Yan will
appreciate his favor as well.

777
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,079
Afterwards,

778
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,760
it will not be a hard thing

779
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,079
to give you a post.

780
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:34,960
With the support

781
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,480
of His Highness and Minister Yan,

782
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:39,280
how will you fret that
there is no way to serve the country?

783
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,800
What about other students?

784
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,360
Who will

785
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,320
do the justice for them?

786
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,239
Justice?

787
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,159
Mister,

788
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,679
in this cage,

789
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,559
you still strive for the justice?

790
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,400
Isn't it funny?

791
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,320
Do you know

792
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,039
why you flopped again and again

793
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,840
during these years?

794
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,480
That is because of your background.

795
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,880
So what if you enjoy outstanding talent?

796
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,639
So what if you boast the reputation
in the southern Su?

797
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,320
Your poor background

798
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,360
is like rootless duckweed.

799
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,480
Please think about this.

800
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,119
On the rankings these years,

801
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,559
which one

802
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,159
isn't the offsprings of dignitaries?

803
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,760
It is wishful thinking

804
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,199
if students like you

805
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,079
want to stand out.

806
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,440
I really admire

807
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,840
your talents and ambitions.

808
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,239
But isn't it a pity

809
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,800
if you don't have a chance

810
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,679
to show your talents and ambitions?

811
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,800
Your are intelligent.

812
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:15,679
I believe

813
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
you will

814
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,480
make the best choice.

815
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,039
Miss went to the Mansion of Prince Qing

816
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,639
in order to protect Young Master?

817
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,559
Once Mu Ze checks it,

818
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,360
he will know it was Yun who told the issue

819
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,480
to Mr. Xu.

820
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,960
So, why not I made it clear

821
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:03,320
and blamed Lu Xinran

822
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,559
to let him think

823
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:05,880
Lu Xinran stired it up purposely.

824
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:07,800
Then, he wouldn't

825
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,760
do anything to Yun.

826
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,159
But I didn't expect

827
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,519
Yun would take Xu Qingce

828
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,480
to rewrite the paper.

829
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,400
If the chief

830
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,480
does have the paper,

831
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,800
will you destroy it for real?

832
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,199
I should end this soon.

833
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,840
Otherwise, if it becomes serious,

834
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,440
I worry about Mr. Xu's life.

835
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Didn't Prince Qing

836
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:33,960
send someone to recruit him

837
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,239
as you planned?

838
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,400
But I don't feel at ease.

839
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,199
Fire.

840
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,519
Fire.

841
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:42,480
Hurry up.

842
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,159
Fire.

843
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,159
What's going on?

844
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:45,440
Miss.

845
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,719
The Mansion of Hanjing's Mayor is on fire.

846
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,920
Fight the fire.
