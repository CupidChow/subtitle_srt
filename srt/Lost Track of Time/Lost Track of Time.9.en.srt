2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,239
Prince Qing.

3
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,640
Prince Qing.

4
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,300
(Gao Chengxian,
General of the garrison in Danzhou)

5
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,319
I am trusted by His Majesty,

6
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,159
and stationed here,

7
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,239
so that

8
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,799
people can live a happy life,

9
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,840
free from the invasion of bandits.

10
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,120
But you...

11
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,520
How many times?

12
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,400
If this keeps going,

13
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,520
we can just take off the armor

14
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,560
and kill ourselves to apologize.

15
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,520
This saves His Majesty trouble.

16
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,319
Near Danzhou River

17
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,759
are all cliffs.

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,800
The bandits come and go without a trace.

19
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,719
We lost lots of soldiers.

20
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,080
They died in hard battles.

21
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,560
We are sorry for that.

22
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,120
But what about people in Danzhou?

23
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,800
They suffer from floods.

24
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,000
Many people die of hunger.

25
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,840
Aren't their families sad?

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,039
Please be assured.

27
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,520
We will

28
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,479
fight to death with the bandits.

29
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,319
Prince Qing.

30
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,400
You come here in person.

31
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,159
Why not send a message?

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,479
I heard General Gao sticks to rules.

33
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,639
Meticulous.

34
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,759
Today I see

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,680
that you live up to your name.

36
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

37
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,840
We must seek peace for people.

38
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,800
This is of utmost importance.

39
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,479
You're right.

40
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,240
I was a General once.

41
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,599
I remember

42
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,280
failure to catch bandits

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,879
should receive 30 bludgeonings.

44
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,240
General Gao,

45
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,479
you're missing a few?

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,919
What I'm here for

47
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,319
is not a big thing.

48
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,159
We can talk later.

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,159
The military order rules.

50
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,840
I dare not interfere.

51
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,319
Go ahead.

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,039
Yes.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,959
Weak.

54
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,439
General Gao.

55
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,680
If you have no affairs

56
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,839
to attend to,

57
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,480
come with me.

58
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Mister, mister.

59
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,000
Mister.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,959
Give me some food.

61
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,480
Mister.

62
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,439
Give me some food.

63
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,120
Mister.

64
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,160
Give me some food.

65
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,240
Mister.

66
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,319
Mister.

67
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,920
(Chen's Rice Shop)
Mister.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,199
Please.

69
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,720
Please.

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,759
Look at the poor kid.

71
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,480
Give us some rice.

72
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,160
Go away.

73
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,079
Mr. Gao.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
(Rice
Five tael per catty)

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,240
The rice price

76
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,639
in Danzhou

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,720
is five times higher

78
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,879
than Gu Rice for the Hanjing Royals.

79
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,199
Your rice shop

80
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,399
is as good at

81
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,959
ripping off people

82
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,639
as the bandits.

83
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,639
Bastard.

84
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,399
Go.

85
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,600
Go.

86
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,120
Penniless thief.

87
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,439
Look how repulsive you're.

88
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,079
Give me.

89
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,360
Give me.

90
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,240
Or I'll beat you to death.

91
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,680
Stop.

92
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,839
Are you blind?

93
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,000
You are blind.

94
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Dare you be impolite to Prince Qing?

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,199
Spare my life, Prince Qing.

96
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,839
Spare my life, Prince Qing.

97
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,480
General Gao.

98
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,319
I believe

99
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,879
you care about

100
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,040
the civilians.

101
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,000
Of course.

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,240
So how about doing a good deed

103
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,000
with me today?

104
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,800
What is it?

105
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,680
Everybody,

106
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,360
the rice shop today

107
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,879
is giving away free rice.

108
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,680
General Gao, please.

109
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,360
Hurry.

110
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,680
Free rice.

111
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,600
Free rice.

112
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,040
Quick.

113
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,839
Thank you.

114
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

115
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,800
Thank you.

116
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,279
Here.

117
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

118
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

119
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,399
Miss.

120
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,680
Prince Qing and Gao Chengxian

121
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,199
went to the Chen's Rice Shop

122
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,399
and gave away free rice.

123
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,839
Seems my gift

124
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,040
has been received.

125
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,279
Leader Shen

126
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,680
and Ninth Prince

127
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
went out in a hurry this morning.

128
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,360
It's time.

129
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,319
They should have got the man.

130
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,759
Miss Lu.

131
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,199
Who are you?

132
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,199
Why do you ask?

133
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,959
Chai Guang is the traitor.

134
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,160
He was caught by Brother Shen

135
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,959
when trying to send a message

136
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,079
to Gao Chengxian.

137
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,079
What a shame.

138
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,879
He worked under me,

139
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,040
yet I noticed nothing.

140
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,639
Thank you, Miss Lu.

141
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,399
Without your feat,

142
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,199
Qinghe Gang's century-old reputation

143
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,759
would have been ruined.

144
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,720
Danzhou has been poor for long.

145
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,480
The government is useless.

146
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,920
Letting the stationed armies be rampant.

147
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,439
Ruining all business opportunities here.

148
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,040
I'm just a merchant.

149
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,240
I hope the ports

150
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,079
our Lu Family built

151
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,600
are used for transport,

152
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,160
not hosting refugees.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,120
Well said.

154
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,720
But

155
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,360
I still want to apologize

156
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,040
to Leader Shen.

157
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,160
Apologize?

158
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,120
I said something offensive

159
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,240
to you earlier.

160
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,439
It's okay, Miss Lu.

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,600
You're a forthright person.

162
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,720
I like that.

163
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:27,839
No need to apologize.

164
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,079
Miss Lu doesn't like rude people.

165
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,440
That's an abrupt comment.

166
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,360
Sorry for my abruptness.

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,879
Anyway,

168
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,559
Leader Shen broke

169
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,919
the thousand-year-old fir table.

170
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,279
Compensation is a must.

171
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,480
How about this?

172
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,159
I can give you a sister.

173
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,480
Holly.

174
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,960
No, no, Miss Lu.

175
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,039
Thank you for that.

176
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,799
Shouldn't you first ask

177
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,600
what Holly thinks?

178
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,200
Right. Even if I agree,

179
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,279
she probably wouldn't.

180
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,960
If Miss sells me today,

181
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,919
I won't say

182
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,679
no, at all.

183
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,159
No, no.

184
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,879
Miss Lu.

185
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,960
I have to go.

186
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,720
The missing sister.

187
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,080
Anyone

188
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,200
has a weakness.

189
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
We helped Leader Shen

190
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:23,879
find his sister

191
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,919
who's been missing for over a decade.

192
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,120
Sister?

193
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,799
He's been trying to find

194
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,720
his sister for years.

195
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,159
Turned out

196
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,000
she was taken by

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,159
Gao Chengxian

198
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:33,960
as a maid.

199
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,399
When she was found,

200
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,120
she was so tortured

201
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,000
that it was hard to make out her face.

202
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,600
Thankfully, she has

203
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,799
a butterfly mark on her arm.

204
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,720
Very obvious.

205
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,000
That's how His Highness recognized her.

206
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Does Leader Shen

207
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,879
have a missing sister?

208
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,480
Couldn't find her even though

209
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,720
the entire gang searched everywhere.

210
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,559
The brother and sister is not
reunited to this day.

211
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,559
Is that true?

212
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,320
Yes.

213
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,080
She has a red butterfly mark

214
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,799
on her arm.

215
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,759
Is it right?

216
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,080
How do you know?

217
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,600
Holly.

218
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,720
Girls your age

219
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,080
should live a free life.

220
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,120
Live with your family.

221
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,440
Don't be too harsh on yourself.

222
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:21,960
Feel you're loved.

223
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,679
Act like a child.

224
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,240
How good is that?

225
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,159
Go.

226
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,879
Holly?

227
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,840
Yes.

228
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,639
Were you separated from family

229
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,000
because of flood when you were young?

230
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,320
Yes.

231
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,600
Is your butterfly birth mark

232
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,480
on the left wrist, the palm side?

233
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,440
Are you really my brother?

234
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,759
Holly.

235
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,480
Brother.

236
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,440
Holly.

237
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:48,960
Brother.

238
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,600
These years must be hard on you.

239
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,120
Goddamned Prince Qing.

240
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,320
I tried to

241
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,480
treat him nicely.

242
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,720
Now

243
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,080
he's trying to overpower me.

244
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,519
Don't be mad.

245
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,679
Should we send someone

246
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,559
and give him a lesson?

247
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,720
Be smart.

248
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,080
Keep eyes on them.

249
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,320
See what they're doing.

250
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,399
Lu Anran from Su City

251
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,600
gave away free rice in my place?

252
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:36,440
Yes.

253
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,720
Let me give you

254
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,000
a tit for tat.

255
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,320
OK.

256
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,159
Go.

257
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:56,840
It's said

258
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,720
the fortune tellers

259
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,279
use copper coins to tell
people's fortune.

260
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,799
How about you have a try on me?

261
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,480
I'm no fortune teller.

262
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,960
You're not.

263
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,720
But you know the truth

264
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,320
of Danzhou's rice giveaway.

265
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,960
You know

266
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,080
Holly is Shen's sister.

267
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,879
Seems everything

268
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,399
after we met Shen

269
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,799
is within your control.

270
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,240
Isn't it even cooler than

271
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,080
a fortune teller？

272
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,480
Many things

273
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,759
give us clues.

274
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,399
While it seems I didn't break a sweat,

275
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,720
but you don't know

276
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,000
what efforts I made.

277
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,399
I've been with you.

278
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,279
All this time.

279
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,600
All this way.

280
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,799
Is there anything

281
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,039
I don't know?

282
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,240
Your little brain

283
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,080
can't figure it out.

284
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,159
Forget it.

285
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,840
Lu Anran.

286
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,279
Let me remind you.

287
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,840
I'm a year older than you.

288
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,720
Don't act like you're so mature.

289
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,399
(I've lived for ten years longer than you.)

290
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,440
Look at that face.

291
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,799
What face?

292
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,519
Looking-at-younger-brother kind of face.

293
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,200
OK.

294
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,440
I'll take a look at your fortune

295
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,080
as compensation.

296
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,759
OK.

297
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,279
Come on.

298
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
What do you want to know?

299
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,840
Relationship?

300
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,840
Am I...

301
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,080
Am I such a tacky person?

302
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,360
Look at my lifespan

303
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,879
for me.

304
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,120
What?

305
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,279
They say

306
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,600
the longer you roam around outside,

307
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,240
the longer you live.

308
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:57,679
You,

309
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,039
I'm afraid, will live to a
hundred years old.

310
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,039
You,

311
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,840
I'm afraid, are talking nonsense.

312
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,399
Really going to leave Holly

313
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,559
with Qinghe Gang?

314
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,759
This should be

315
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,559
up to her.

316
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,240
After the affair in Danzhou
is dealt with,

317
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,759
what are you going to do?

318
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,759
I just go with the flow.

319
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,480
Anran.

320
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,799
If Second Brother

321
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:53,960
takes Lu Xinran.

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,759
You can live

323
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,120
the life you want to have.

324
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,759
You don't have to be

325
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,120
involved in the Hanjing affairs.

326
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,120
That way,

327
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,240
we can manage

328
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,360
the floods in Danzhou together.

329
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,559
The geography here is similar to Su City.

330
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,840
You must be of great help.

331
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:08,960
After that,

332
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,000
we can travel around.

333
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,799
I mean,

334
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,200
We can complete
the National Granary program,

335
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,480
building the universal granaries together.

336
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,000
Without the Lu Family...

337
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,559
I have to go back to Hanjing.

338
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,240
Back to your brother.

339
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,960
But you said...

340
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,559
Do you think

341
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,480
I'd leave Lu Family

342
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,559
to someone like Lu Xinran?

343
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,080
Sorry.

344
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,919
You plan.

345
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,000
I can't be part of it.

346
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,120
I only want to protect the family.

347
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,799
This

348
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,960
can't be left to anyone else.

349
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,679
Neither would I...

350
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,639
People always say goodbye.

351
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,799
Once in a life time.

352
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,000
Only bosom friends

353
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,600
can stay long.

354
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,279
Do you understand?

355
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,960
OK.

356
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,640
This is the Lu's warehouse.

357
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,519
Go find fire over there, you two.

358
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,720
You two, over there.

359
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:35,279
Yes.

360
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,640
What happened?

361
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,440
Why are you here?

362
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,680
We looked for a long time.

363
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,160
Only smoke, no fire here.

364
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,960
Miss Lu.

365
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,960
Nice to see you again.

366
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,880
The bodyguard is with you.

367
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,440
You can die together

368
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,039
and be each other's company.

369
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,200
Gao Chengxian,

370
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,720
you killed so many people.

371
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,559
They don't want to be reborn.

372
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,440
They're all waiting for you down there.

373
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,039
No wonder you think we'd be lonely.

374
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,400
You stole a woman from me before.

375
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,559
Now you're here to stir up trouble.

376
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,200
Don't be too complacent.

377
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,039
Get them.

378
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,079
Who dares?

379
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:20,839
Go.

380
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,640
Mu Chuan.

381
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,000
Zhaolie.

382
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,400
Stop.

383
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,319
Your Highness.

384
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:55,519
Second Brother.

385
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,640
Second Brother.

386
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,200
General Gao says

387
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,039
the bandit who gave away free rice

388
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:06,960
has been caught.

389
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,359
I'm here to take a look.

390
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:10,960
General Gao.

391
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,920
Let me introduce him to you.

392
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,319
This is the Ninth Prince.

393
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:16,519
Mu Chuan.

394
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,480
Your Highness.

395
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,599
I'm here for Lu Anran.

396
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,359
I don't know her bodyguard

397
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,319
is Ninth Prince.

398
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,359
Please be wise.

399
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,400
Second Brother, why are you here?

400
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,799
I'm here

401
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,160
to kill bandits as ordered

402
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,400
and investigate the rice relief.

403
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,599
Great.

404
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,319
Lu Anran.

405
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,559
What is this you're playing?

406
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,200
Your Highness.

407
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,599
In our investigation today,

408
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,440
we found rice relief

409
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,319
in the Lu's warehouse.

410
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,319
The Lus must have

411
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,519
colluded with the bandits

412
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,799
and tried to make a fortune
during the disaster.

413
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,680
Bullshit.

414
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,519
It's you.

415
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,319
Do you have anything

416
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,480
to say to me?

417
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,279
Lu Anran is just an ordinary person.

418
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,680
And dares not play anything
in front of Your Highness.

419
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,359
It's only an accident.

420
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,000
A frame.

421
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:17,160
Miss Lu is a shrewd strategist.

422
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,680
Why always

423
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,880
set up by others recently?

424
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,880
Am I overestimating you?

425
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,440
Gao Chengxian.

426
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,839
You want to arrest Miss Lu.

427
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,319
Do you have evidence?

428
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,200
Come.

429
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,079
Take the rice from the warehouse here.

430
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:34,960
Yes.

431
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,400
I heard Ninth Prince

432
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,480
is an expert in agriculture.

433
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,000
Is this

434
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,359
the rice relief from Hanjing?

435
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,480
I think you know the answer.

436
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,240
OK.

437
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,200
The facts speaker louder than words.

438
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,200
Anything else you want to say?

439
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:07,240
Your Highness, please be wise

440
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,680
and exonerate me.

441
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,160
Take her away.

442
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,319
I'll leave here.

443
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,279
Second Brother.

444
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,440
It's not Lu Anran.

445
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,519
I know.

446
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,839
You know?

447
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,319
Then why arrest her?

448
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:25,880
How much do you know

449
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,240
about this Lu Anran?

450
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,720
Tell you.

451
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,200
When she's in Su City,

452
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,480
she left me a message.

453
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,279
Said she'd wait for me in Danzhou.

454
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,400
In the days here,

455
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,720
she managed to send more messages to me.

456
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,240
She led me

457
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,279
to investigate the rice relief.

458
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,720
Don't you think

459
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,640
everything that happened

460
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,680
had been in her control

461
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,039
all this way?

462
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,880
I find it strange.

463
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Miss Lu

464
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,400
can see us

465
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,799
so clearly.

466
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,000
But we can't seem

467
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,519
to understand her

468
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,880
or what she's thinking.

469
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,599
But Second Brother,

470
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,279
whatever she wants to do,

471
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,000
the fact is

472
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,759
right before you.

473
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,319
We've found the traitor

474
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,160
in Qinghe Gang.

475
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,759
Chai Guang.

476
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,240
He helped Gao Chengxian

477
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,279
loot the rice and get away with it.

478
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,839
Don't underestimate

479
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:12,759
Gao Chengxian.

480
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,200
Another thing.

481
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,640
Is this Chai Guang

482
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,640
still in the Qinghe Gang?

483
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,440
Wonderful, Miss Lu.

484
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,200
So calm

485
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,400
even in the prison.

486
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,200
General Gao, you look like

487
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,480
the one who's set to win.

488
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,839
So,

489
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,119
you've got around it.

490
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,880
Killing two birds with one stone.

491
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,200
Nice trick.

492
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,640
Keeps Prince Qing from

493
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,920
investigating you.

494
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,400
And takes revenge for the bet at Su City.

495
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,559
It's a surprise.

496
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,160
Your mind underneath all that fat

497
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,720
actually works.

498
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,480
Don't forget you'll die soon.

499
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,680
Do you think I can't

500
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,640
attack your weakness this way?

501
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,119
Believe it or not.

502
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,960
I'm going to make you hand in evidence

503
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,759
to Prince Qing yourself.

504
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,039
Don't look at me like that.

505
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,559
So tentalizing.

506
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,359
I might even want to do something

507
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,480
to you.

508
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:34,480
Get off.

509
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,640
Gao Chengxian, listen.

510
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,319
If my body shows

511
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,640
any trace of punishment,

512
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,000
I'll tell Prince Qing

513
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,839
you want to use Lu Family

514
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,680
against him by asking me to confess.

515
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,839
Then I'll see

516
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,119
who is to die first.

517
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,720
You or me.

518
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,960
You just reminded me.

519
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,039
You seldom come to the prison.

520
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,599
Today I'll let you know

521
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,839
how what those torture tools
that leave no marks

522
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,920
can do to you.

523
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,759
Take her arms off.

524
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,200
I didn't expect

525
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,640
Miss Lu

526
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,000
would maker herself

527
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,240
so poor like this.

528
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,880
Isn't it

529
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,200
what Your Highness wanted?

530
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,000
Breaking the promise with Your Highness

531
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,960
is not my intention.

532
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,880
But Your Highness must be
unhappy with me.

533
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,400
With Gao Chengxian torturing me like this,

534
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,559
you must be happy

535
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,240
that you finally get it back to me.

536
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,240
You

537
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,599
should give me an explanation.

538
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,079
If it's not satisfying enough,

539
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:29,960
I'm afraid Lu Family

540
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,359
will be left with only one daughter,

541
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,920
Lu Xinran.

542
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,119
Your Highness must have sent people

543
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,640
to check the Lu Family.

544
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:37,880
Why ask me to

545
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,160
say it again?

546
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,759
Do you think I'd believe

547
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,640
a word you say?

548
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:54,839
Lu Anran.

549
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,279
You're not an ordinary person.

550
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,119
How would you let yourself

551
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,920
almost be killed in the family conflict?

552
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,519
Your Highness,

553
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,359
the most dangerous enemy
on the battlefield

554
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,960
is not the enemy in front of you.

555
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,640
But

556
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,119
your fellow soldiers.

557
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,799
Your family.

558
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,559
Isn't it?

559
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,680
The winner takes all.

560
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,079
If Lu Xinran

561
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,079
can set you up,

562
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,279
it means she's useful.

563
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,720
Now she's Princess Qing.

564
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,599
That's to say.

565
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,279
My alliance agreement with Lu Family

566
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,799
is still effective.

567
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,880
In this,

568
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,160
you're the only loser.

569
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,559
Your Highness.

570
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,319
Maybe

571
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,200
I'm more useful

572
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,920
than Lu Xinran.

573
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,319
You did so many things

574
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,079
only to

575
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,559
show your faithfulness?

576
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,039
Right?

577
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,400
Your Highness must have

578
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,799
doubts about me.

579
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,680
If I can't help you with your concerns,

580
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,880
or do something extrarodinary,

581
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,599
how can I make you

582
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,720
trust me again?

583
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,599
You tried to influence me step by step.

584
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,119
With the rice relief,

585
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,480
I admit,

586
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,720
you caught

587
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,759
my attention.

588
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,519
But I always think

589
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,039
you'll play something bigger.

590
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,000
Look at yourself now.

591
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,920
So disappointing.

592
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,960
Your Highness.

593
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,680
I'm not dead.

594
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,839
How do you know

595
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,119
I won't get the upper hand again?

596
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,680
OK.

597
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:07,319
I look forward to that day.

598
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,039
Your Highness.

599
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:22,960
Yesterday

600
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,400
in the Lu's Port warehouse

601
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,519
I found rice relief.

602
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,480
Your Highness, please do justice

603
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,880
to Danzhou people.

604
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,279
Lu Anran.

605
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,839
Anything you want to say?

606
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,079
If the rice relief from the
central government

607
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,160
is looted by Lu Family,

608
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,319
then tomorrow if I just

609
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,640
blame it on General Gao,

610
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:45,799
he should also

611
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,680
kneel down here

612
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,839
and argue it?

613
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,279
You sly woman.

614
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,920
Don't think because your family

615
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,839
has wedding agreement with Prince Qing

616
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:55,799
you can do anything

617
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,200
to defy the law.

618
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,519
I'm sure

619
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,000
Prince Qing will do justice

620
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,680
to Danzhou people.

621
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,119
Lu Family has wedding agreement with

622
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,119
Prince Qing.

623
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,240
No wonder they're so bold.

624
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,400
The officials protect each other.

625
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,039
Prince Qing won't

626
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:12,720
punish Lu Family.

627
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,759
What do we do?

628
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,119
Who's going to help us?

629
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,960
Prince Qing, please help us.

630
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,119
Punish Lu Family.

631
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,680
Punish Lu Family.

632
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,319
Help us.

633
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,519
Punish Lu Family.

634
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,359
Punish Lu Family.

635
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,200
Punish Lu Family.

636
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,799
Punish Lu Family.

637
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,559
Punish Lu Family.

638
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,039
Help us, Your Highness.

639
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,400
Punish Lu Family.

640
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,359
Punish Lu Family.

641
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,039
Punish Lu Family.

642
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,279
Help us, Your Highness.

643
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,519
Punish Lu Family.

644
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,119
Punish Lu Family.

645
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,599
Help us.

646
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,400
Lu Anran.

647
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,960
There's no other way.

648
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,119
If you want to get something from me,

649
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,759
prove yourself first.

650
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,240
Lu Anran.

651
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,519
Do you plead guilty?

652
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,359
Yes, I do.

653
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,400
Lu Anran colluded with bandits

654
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,440
and looted rice relief.

655
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:27,839
The evidence is clear.

656
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,440
She will be taken back to
the capital tomorrow at noon.

657
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,160
Wise.

658
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,640
So wise.

659
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,920
Your Highness is so wise.

660
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,440
Your Highness is so wise.

661
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,319
Your Highness is so wise.

662
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,039
Thank you, Your Highness.

663
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,599
General Gao, stop here.

664
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,599
We'll reach Hanjing

665
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,440
if you keep going.

666
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,759
This woman is sly.

667
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,119
I can't have the peace of mind

668
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,920
unless I'm here.

669
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,079
She's only a merchant

670
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,720
after all.

671
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,039
What big wave can she make?

672
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,240
Right.

673
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,400
General Gao made
a great contribution this time.

674
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
I'll report it to His Majesty.

675
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,039
Thank you, Your Highness.

676
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:20,400
Goodbye.

677
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,640
Have a safe trip, Your Highness.

678
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,680
Finally get these bastards off.

679
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,119
Wise, General.

680
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:42,680
Maybe

681
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,279
we can even get rewards

682
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
from the Emperor.

683
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,079
Now my account

684
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,039
is so empty.

685
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,640
Buy a pig for me this minute.

686
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,119
OK.

687
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,480
On it.

688
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:53,960
Go.

689
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,079
Go.

690
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,519
Go.

691
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,319
Zhaolie.

692
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:10,759
Stay.

693
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,319
OK.

694
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,799
Here's to General.

695
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:32,759
Here.

696
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,359
Danzhou has seen

697
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,160
imperial envoys

698
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,559
come and go.

699
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,720
No one

700
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,880
can take advantage

701
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,680
of our General.

702
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,680
Am I right?

703
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:46,519
Yes.

704
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,599
This time

705
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,799
General is both wise and brave.

706
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,799
Not only diverted the disaster,

707
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,359
but also distanced the royal brothers.

708
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,599
Ninth Prince

709
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,920
probably thinks ill

710
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,440
of Second Prince now.

711
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,880
Boot licker.

712
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,920
As they are too young,

713
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,200
I don't even need

714
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,440
bravery or wisdom

715
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,799
to deal with them.

716
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,160
Exaggerating.

717
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,519
Today's a happy day.

718
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,400
Let's drink.

719
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,359
To our General.

720
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,279
Drink.

721
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,200
Follow me.

722
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,160
And I'll treat you well.

723
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,720
Yes.

724
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,000
What I have

725
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,640
will always be shared with you.

726
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,559
Get up.

727
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,240
Will fight for General to death.

728
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:50,920
Come on.

729
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,720
Serve the main course.

730
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,199
Follow me.

731
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,119
Meat everyday.

732
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,239
Meat everyday.

733
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,280
Why all stones?

734
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,239
Why all stones?

735
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,599
Here too.

736
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,079
All stones.

737
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,360
All fake money.

738
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,119
Where's the money?

739
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,559
I don't know.

740
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,599
I...

741
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,119
I took the goods

742
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,039
as usual.

743
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,360
Guards.

744
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,079
Get them from the pork shop.

745
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,519
Yes.

746
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:19,719
Who?

747
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,039
Who did it?

748
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,960
You colluded with second master
Chai Guang

749
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,719
from the Qinghe Gang, Danzhou Fleet,

750
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,559
to take rice relief for yourself.

751
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:37,320
And shifted the blame to Lu Family.

752
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,519
Now

753
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,559
the witness and evidence is here.

754
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,639
You wanna lie?

755
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,079
You didn't leave the city.

756
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,800
You pretended to take Lu Anran away.

757
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,639
Now you're back

758
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:52,679
just to hit me back.

759
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,760
General Gao

760
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,000
followed us so far.

761
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,280
I have to

762
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,039
repay the kindness

763
00:35:58,679 --> 00:35:59,800
and say goodbye

764
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,880
to General Gao in person.

765
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,760
You are all

766
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,079
on the same team.

767
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,360
You changed the money.

768
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,159
You set the trap.

769
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,119
You played me.

770
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,480
If we didn't,

771
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,199
how can you fall into it?

772
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,719
What's the next step?

773
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,039
Only when I plead guilty

774
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,119
and be sent back to the capital

775
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,280
will he reveal himself.

776
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,119
As expected,

777
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,320
you became complacent so soon

778
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,159
and started to collect money.

779
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,199
We stopped your message pigeon midway,

780
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,760
(7 a.m.--9 a.m. The Market)
beat you to the pork shop,

781
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,159
(Xu's Fresh Pork)
and changed the money for fake money.

782
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,199
And then we just wait for the big show.

783
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,000
(Xu's Fresh Pork)

784
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,800
Now,

785
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,519
do you have anything to say?

786
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:59,039
If Prince Yi doesn't protect me,

787
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,559
then I have to

788
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,719
take this bitch

789
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,360
together.

790
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,920
Mindless.

791
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,200
(Country Government of Danzhou)

792
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,239
Narrow escape from death.

793
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
You have played

794
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,480
this trick twice.

795
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:29,760
The fake marriage

796
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,039
was a setup.

797
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,760
It's because I shouldn't die

798
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:35,079
that I meet Your Highness
again like this.

799
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,800
Anyway,

800
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:39,079
I thank you for that.

801
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,280
Thank you for the trust.

802
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,480
And for your tolerance.

803
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,159
I didn't do this

804
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,639
because of our relationships.

805
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,880
I just

806
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,480
met the request of Ninth Brother.

807
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,760
Second Brother.

808
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,440
Are you here to plead?

809
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,360
No.

810
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,239
I can let Gao Chengxian

811
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:53,880
reveal himself.

812
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,400
Need any help?

813
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,159
No.

814
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,880
Just take Lu Anran back to the capital

815
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,760
according to law.

816
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,760
Trust needs to be built.

817
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,400
I have presented evidence
of Gao Chengxian

818
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,679
right before Your Highness.

819
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:06,960
Is this Oath Letter

820
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,280
enough?

821
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,159
Of course not.

822
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,519
Even without your words,

823
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:14,079
Gao Chengxian

824
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,519
can't escape either.

825
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,280
When we left the city,

826
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,679
Zhaolie went back.

827
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,000
It must be

828
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,280
an arrangement of Your Highness.

829
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,960
You said Zhaolie

830
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,800
is my arrangement.

831
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,400
But I can tell you

832
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,079
there's another

833
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,000
besides Zhaolie.

834
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,480
Look who this is?

835
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,320
Chai Guang.

836
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,360
Why is he with you?

837
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,760
Is staying with Qinghe Gang safe?

838
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,719
You can take people away.

839
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,639
I can, too.

840
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,519
When did you

841
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,320
get him?

842
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,000
About ten days ago.

843
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,119
Ten days ago.

844
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,239
That was when

845
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,079
I was caught at the port.

846
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,360
Then you should know

847
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,400
Gao Chengxian instructed him

848
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,360
to take rice relief.

849
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,519
How could you believe

850
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,599
what he said about me?

851
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:18,559
So you led Gao Chengxian

852
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,719
to catch me.

853
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,159
Exactly.

854
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,360
Lu Anran.

855
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,440
Tell you.

856
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,280
When you think yourself smart,

857
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:31,719
remember one thing.

858
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:33,480
I don't like to follow

859
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,960
a path set by others.

860
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,760
To play strategy,

861
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,079
I am nowhere near Your Highness.

862
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,239
I don't like women

863
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,599
too aggressive.

864
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:46,599
The Oath Letter

865
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:47,760
is only half finished.

866
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,360
The other half

867
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,960
can wait

868
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,159
till back in the capital.

869
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,440
Why look at me like this?

870
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:07,920
It's late.

871
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,719
Take a good rest, Your Highness.

872
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,760
A ruler

873
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,280
has to cut off love.

874
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,000
It's all fake.

875
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,360
The first encounter.

876
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,199
What happened in the mansion.

877
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,559
Lu Anran.

878
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,920
What kind of life do you lead?

879
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,559
She seems quite downtrodden.

880
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,840
I find it strange.

881
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,719
The way she looked at me.

882
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:48,400
Why, Your Highness?

883
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,320
We are connected

884
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,000
by only an alliance agreement.

885
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,159
But I seem to feel

886
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,960
she sees someone she used to know

887
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,360
when she looks at me.

888
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,920
Lu Anran thinks

889
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,559
all she has for Mu Ze

890
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,280
is hatred.

891
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,719
Yet when she falls again

892
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,360
into Mu Ze's trap,

893
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,519
though

894
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,880
small

895
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,639
compared to previous ones,

896
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,960
she still feels sad.

897
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:31,079
But this sadness

898
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,480
has no love in it.

899
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:36,320
It's the defiance

900
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,719
and bitterness

901
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,360
for wasting ten years of true feelings.

902
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,400
How's it going with Second Brother?

903
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,199
He agrees to let me go to Hanjing.

904
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,559
Then he won't look further into

905
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,440
the fake marriage.

906
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You two

907
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,840
will just follow the mistake.

908
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,360
Yes. Follow the mistake.

909
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,639
Compared with

910
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,119
men and women who misplaced their love,

911
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,920
this is a happy ending.

912
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,599
I don't think you're happy.

913
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,119
Is it because he only cares

914
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,639
about his royal order,

915
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:34,960
instead of your safety?

916
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,360
No.

917
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,320
You don't know.

918
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,079
Second Brother

919
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,280
accumulated so many military merits

920
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:46,079
to have a firm footing in the court.

921
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:47,960
To protect himself,

922
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:49,800
sometimes he has to

923
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,159
take caution.

924
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:52,320
But he's not someone

925
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,079
who disregards justice.

926
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,159
Justice.

927
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:58,880
I grew up with him.

928
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:00,440
Though at times

929
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,400
he didn't play fair,

930
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,159
but he couldn't do otherwise

931
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:03,760
because he has to

932
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,639
fight off the malicious
acts in the court.

933
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,480
If you two are to form alliance,

934
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,159
I hope you won't...

935
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,840
Stop it.

936
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,039
Do you really know

937
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:11,119
what kind of person he is?

938
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,760
No.

939
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,159
You're still weak.

940
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:49,719
And you've been so tortured

941
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:50,760
at the prison.

942
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,519
Don't be too hard on yourself.

943
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,440
Mu Chuan.

944
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,679
I don't understand indeed.

945
00:43:58,559 --> 00:43:59,719
You all seem to have secrets.

946
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,159
There's something

947
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,559
you can't tell others.

948
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,440
You.

949
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,079
And Second Brother.

950
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:15,320
But the dark side of yourself

951
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,880
doesn't need to be known by others.

952
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:20,960
You should only

953
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,199
know your heart.

954
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,639
I only know that

955
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:28,599
he's not living a happy life.

956
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,199
But I want him to.

957
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:35,400
Lu Anran.

958
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:39,679
It's the same for you.

who is spoiled by her parents.

968
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:27,360
You didn't say anything

969
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,239
when you fend off the knife for me.

970
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,360
What's wrong with putting
the coat on you?

971
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,880
When did I do that?

972
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:37,880
At the warehouse.

973
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,079
When we were surrounded
by Gao Chengxian's people.

974
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:46,360
That's not true.

I've come to understand you more.

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,400
But there's a long way ahead.
