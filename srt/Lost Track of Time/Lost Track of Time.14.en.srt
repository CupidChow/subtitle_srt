2
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,120
Tell me,

3
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,439
what do you want

4
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,319
with Mr. Xu's body?

5
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,319
I,

6
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,359
I just don't want you

7
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,519
to tell His Highness.

8
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,439
For what?

9
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,840
The imperial examination.

10
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,000
About the imperial examination.

11
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,480
I just don't want

12
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,439
His Highness to investigate it.

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,079
You should have told me earlier.

14
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,480
Why do you have to put on the airs

15
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,239
of the Princess Qing in front of me?

16
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,599
As for the sobs at night,

17
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,760
try to cut down the locust tree in the backyard.

18
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,360
Your Highness.

19
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,039
During the imperial court,

20
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,639
you angrily denounced Prince Yi,

21
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,919
and tried your best to
get justice for Xu Qingce,

22
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,680
winning the support

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,039
of many virtuous officials.

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,360
These are all invitations

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,479
from them.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,520
Great.

27
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,719
Your Highness,

28
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,120
Miss Lu is here.

29
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,439
Let her in.

30
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,039
Yes.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,520
Your Highness,

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,080
the imperial examination...

33
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,000
If you're here to plead today,

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,080
then you don't have to.

35
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,280
If it weren't for Xu Qingce

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,719
committing suicide for Spring Exam,

37
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,840
I wouldn't have

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
gained so much.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,159
I thought Your Highness lost Minister Yan,

40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,520
and would feel a little heartbroken.

41
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,719
If His Majesty

42
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,000
finds out the truth,

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,919
I'm doomed.

44
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,439
So Minister Yan

45
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,800
had to die.

46
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,319
What did you gain, Your Highness?

47
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,879
Candid
officials from the court.

48
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,039
Now, whether it's the folk

49
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,879
or the imperial court,

50
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,919
they all think it's Prince Yi

51
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,120
using Minister Yan.

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,439
Prince Yi used Minister Yan

53
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,520
and cheated in the Imperial Examination.

54
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,080
After the rumors about the fraud arouse,

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,759
he killed Minister Yan.

56
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,840
I just

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
lost Minister Yan.

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,159
But I won the support

59
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,680
of the virtuous officials in the court.

60
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,080
I can even blame

61
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,560
Prince Yi.

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
It's really

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,080
a good deal.

64
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,879
Then His Highness

65
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,960
ran for Xu Qingce again.

66
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,560
Comparing the two princes,

67
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,840
virtuous officials will naturally think

68
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
His Highness is much kinder

69
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,120
than Prince Yi.

70
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,719
As long as I

71
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,400
beat my chest and blame myself,

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,560
why

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,360
didn't I send more people to protect Mr. Yan.

74
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,960
No one wouldn't be moved.

75
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,120
I should send more people

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,199
to protect Mr. Xu.

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,520
No one knows

78
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,439
Prince Yi would kill him

79
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,240
in the capital.

80
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,639
You argued for it

81
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,639
in front of His Majesty,

82
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
Virtuous officials

83
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,280
will also see the true face of Prince Yi.

84
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,560
Your Highness.

85
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,800
What is this?

86
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,279
Virtuous officials' invitations.

87
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,879
I think they've finally found out

88
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,439
Your Highness is much kinder than Prince Yi.

89
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,839
One is Minister Yan.

90
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,480
Another is

91
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,560
the virtuous official.

92
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,079
It's obvious which side to choose.

93
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,439
(It's you.)

94
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,959
(Is it you?)

95
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,560
(At that time, Xu Qingce)

96
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
(had already made a name for himself,)

97
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,920
(He's the rising star of virtuous men.)

98
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,439
(You killed him on purpose to frame Prince Yi.)

99
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,079
(And then you pretended to run for him.)

100
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,160
(So as to win)

101
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
(the support of virtuous men in the court.)

102
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,000
(It's exactly the same as)

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,959
(your killing Minister Yan.)

104
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:15,959
(I thought)

105
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,480
(the appreciation between you and Xu Qingce)

106
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,839
(is at least true.)

107
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,759
(But I didn't expect that)

108
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,199
(even this is fake.)

109
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,759
(That's ridiculous.)

110
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,079
(I've slept with such a person)

111
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,959
(for nearly ten years.)

112
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,199
What's wrong?

113
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,240
Not used to it?

114
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,319
Do you think

115
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,560
I'm too cruel?

116
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Let me tell you,

117
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,240
people on this position

118
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,399
are indeed freezing cold.

119
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,839
I will regard

120
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,560
your misbehavior today

121
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,720
as your shock of Xu Qingce's death.

122
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,519
If it happens again,

123
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,519
I won't spare you.

124
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,240
Get out!

125
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,759
Do you

126
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,959
hear people sobbing occasionally

127
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,560
at night?

128
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,800
In your room, there is also

129
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,360
a valerian screen with grass and deer.

130
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,560
The screen is made of silks from Jiannan.

131
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,759
There are four planes.

132
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,519
About six deer.

133
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,279
There is a bed by the window,

134
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,759
which is made of rarely-seen jade.

135
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,279
Cuicui.

136
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,879
Cuicui.

137
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,519
Cuicui!

138
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,160
What's wrong, Your Highness?

139
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,839
Go to the backyard.

140
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,319
That locust tree.

141
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,680
Cut down!

142
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:43,800
Yes.

143
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,000
(Examination Hall)

144
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Minister Yan is dead,

145
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,800
and the test papers are all burnt.

146
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,879
How should we investigate this?

147
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,399
Your Highness,

148
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,519
why don't you ask all the candidates

149
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,560
to take the exam again?

150
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,160
The examiners will review it again.

151
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
It's inevitable that there will be

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,680
fish in troubled waters,

153
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,720
to whitewash articles.

154
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,639
It's hard to prevent it.

155
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,680
Then the only way is to retake the exam.

156
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,399
If they retake the exam,

157
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,600
the previous exam will be in vain.

158
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,560
It's not fair.

159
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,720
And if so,

160
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,600
we can't help Xu Qingce

161
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,360
get back

162
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
the champion justifiably.

163
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
Your Highness Prince Qi.

164
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,399
Fu Yunan, why are you here?

165
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,720
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

166
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,679
Test paper of Spring Imperial Exam?

167
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,240
I've kept it for you for a long time.

168
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,710
(Examination Hall)

169
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:31,600
(Rankings)

170
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,279
Did you find it?

171
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,200
It comes out! It comes out!

172
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,919
Look!

173
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,639
Where? Where?

174
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,720
Let me have a look.

175
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,559
I'm on it!

176
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,320
Me too.

177
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,320
Great. Great.

178
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,039
Congratulations!

179
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,759
After ten years of hard study,
I finally got it.

180
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,720
That's great!

181
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,840
(Xu Qingce)

182
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,639
Let me look for it for you.

183
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,879
Really!

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,399
I got it. I got it.

185
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,919
I finally got it.

186
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,159
I got it.

187
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,320
Congratulations!

188
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,519
Your Highness Prince Qi.

189
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,120
Thanks! Your Highness Prince Qi.

190
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,000
Seek justice for students.

191
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,320
Thanks! Your Highness Prince Qi.

192
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,759
Your Highness Prince Qi is wise.

193
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

194
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,639
Your Highness Prince Qi is wise.

195
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,840
Thanks! Your Highness Prince Yi.

196
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,039
Your Highness Prince Qi is wise.

197
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,700
(Examination Hall)

198
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,799
Thank you for your support

199
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,840
during this period.

200
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,200
That's why the list can be corrected

201
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,879
so fast.

202
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,879
It's my duty.

203
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,000
Official Fu has protected

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
the test paper long ago.

205
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,279
After His Majesty promised
to investigate thoroughly,

206
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,639
and handed it over.

207
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,639
You must have known

208
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,159
everything behind this.

209
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,120
Your Highness, you don't have to

210
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
think highly of me because of this.

211
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,639
In this muddy water,

212
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,759
I only want to protect myself.

213
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,440
If the Ninth Prince hadn't fought hard,

214
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,840
those papers

215
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,360
would have been like burned.

216
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,279
Ninth Brother.

217
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,360
Now in such a big palace,

218
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
only you are sincere to me.

219
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,080
Second brother,

220
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,200
what are you talking about?

221
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,879
Right now, Second Brother,

222
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,679
in your eyes,

223
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,759
is

224
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,080
an unscrupulous person

225
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,960
who kills the innocent and
the loyal unjustly.

226
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,399
No.

227
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,559
Though you say so,

228
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,279
but now,

229
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,840
you don't have full trust

230
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,960
in Second Brother anymore.

231
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,039
Am I right?

232
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,200
By the way,

233
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,279
I,

234
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,759
I have a question for you.

235
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,679
If it were now,

236
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,559
will you still give all the cake

237
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,879
to me?

238
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,519
I'm so hungry.

239
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,399
Second brother, here you are.

240
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,000
Where did you get it?

241
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,279
Crown Prince gave it to me.

242
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,120
I'm not willing to eat it yet.

243
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,879
Ninth brother,

244
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,080
this half is for you.

245
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,759
I have another one.

246
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,240
Save it and eat it slowly.

247
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,759
This is for you.

248
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:43,840
Ninth Brother!

249
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,440
Ninth Brother!

250
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,759
Back then, I remembered that

251
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,480
you almost starved to death.

252
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,919
So I swear to God,

253
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,679
I won't let anyone

254
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,399
hurt you in this life.

255
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,279
I won't let you be killed by others.

256
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,039
But are you going to kill others

257
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,559
if you don't let them kill you?

258
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,320
Second Brother admitted that

259
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,879
regarding Xu Qingce,

260
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,600
I did neglect it.

261
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,919
Originally, I wanted to take him as my advisor,

262
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,120
and then make it up to him.

263
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,519
But unexpectedly,

264
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,759
he is an indomitable person.

265
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,360
As you know,

266
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,480
His Majesty,

267
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,960
he hatses me.

268
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,639
Prince Yi

269
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,000
also wants to kill me.

270
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,519
If I don't fight back,

271
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,840
I would have died.

272
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,519
But,

273
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,159
I promise you,

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,480
I won't kill anyone in the future.

275
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,399
Can you forgive me?

276
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,799
Second Brother,

277
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,879
I'm not an ignorant person.

278
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,360
But if all the people in this world,

279
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,519
do what they want,

280
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,120
and want to be the master.

281
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Then the killing will only

282
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,039
go on endlessly.

283
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,679
Second Brother,

284
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,559
you're in danger,

285
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,080
how can you be immune to it?

286
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,519
I'm just thinking,

287
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,559
there's no other way out.

288
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,919
Is this the sorrow of you and me?

289
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,840
Or the sorrow of the world?

290
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,000
Second brother knows that

291
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,360
you are born a gentleman.

292
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,519
That's why I don't want

293
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,919
those dirty things in the court

294
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,039
stain your eyes.

295
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,320
Just

296
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,840
be your

297
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,000
Rice Fragrance Hermit.

298
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:53,559
And I

299
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,200
will try my best not to let you down.

300
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,480
Okay?

301
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,120
(Mr. Xu.)

302
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,440
(You can rest in peace.)

303
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,080
(I can't pay you back)

304
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,000
(what I owe you this life.)

305
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,200
(Soon,)

306
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,720
(I'll send your belongings back to Su City.)

307
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,919
Miss,

308
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,120
Lu Xinran is out.

309
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,879
Alone?

310
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:36,919
Yes.

311
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,639
My brother wrote that

312
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,279
Cai Wangjin also went out alone.

313
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,919
It's said that he goes up the mountain
to worship his parents.

314
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
They say the first three months are

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,679
the most dangerous.

316
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,879
Maybe we should

317
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,679
go back to the room.

318
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,159
I'm not that delicate.

319
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,360
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.

320
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,320
When it comes to having a baby,

321
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,159
one can't be too careful.

322
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,399
It's not making a mountain out of a molehill.

323
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,960
Okay.

324
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,160
Your Highness.

325
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,200
Sis.

326
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,640
We...

327
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,720
Mr. Cai and I are in a relationship privately.

328
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,519
Your Highness.

329
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,200
When I first met Xinran,

330
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,720
I fell in love with her.

331
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,400
For the rest of my life,

332
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,559
I won't let her down.

333
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,960
As long as you love each other,

334
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,240
I'll be happy.

335
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:35,960
Sis.

336
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,240
I got this from

337
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,799
a very efficacious treasure land.

338
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,960
It can ensure the child to grow up safely.

339
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,920
Don't mind it.

340
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,559
Xinran is begging for this

341
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,839
and met the gangster in the mountain.

342
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,400
Fortunately, I was paying homage

343
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,480
to my parents in the mountains.

344
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,240
So that nothing happens.

345
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,359
Silly girl, are you hurt?

346
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,559
No.

347
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,680
Her back was injured by a sword.

348
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,240
At that time, there was
no one in the mountain.

349
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,359
but fortunately, Cai knew some herbs.

350
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,640
And wrap her up immediately.

351
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,680
There's no one in the mountain.

352
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,799
As for the injury on your back,

353
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:08,839
it's not convenient to deal with it yourself.

354
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,119
Did Mr. Cai do it for you?

355
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,440
Sis.

356
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,680
Lu Xinran really has to

357
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,640
go back to the old ways.

358
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,720
Let's go.

359
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,039
Miss.

360
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,359
Miss.

361
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,000
Cai Wangjin is also in this forest.

362
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,480
He is worshipping his parents.

363
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,759
That's weird.

364
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,799
If this thing happens again,

365
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,799
then what exactly

366
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,680
did I change?

367
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,759
Today, I made a divination

368
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,200
which was shown by the gods.

369
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,519
Someone with unfinished fate
will come to the door,

370
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
and settled the debt of
the former dust with me.

371
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It must be you, lady.

372
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,400
I didn't come here

373
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,359
to pray for God and Buddha.

374
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,000
I have no wish to pray.

375
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:54,799
You can avoid

376
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,839
those

377
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,559
specious things.

378
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,119
My Lady. You don't have to be like this.

379
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,480
As for what the guest just asked for,

380
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,480
I've already rejected it.

381
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,960
Why?

382
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,200
I saw blood

383
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,119
in her eyes.

384
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,759
That's the blood of a close relative.

385
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,440
The blood

386
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,799
reflects the mark of my totem.

387
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,319
Beauty,

388
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:47,680
it's getting dark.

389
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,319
Why are you alone on the mountain?

390
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,880
It's none of your business.

391
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,599
I talk to you nicely.

392
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,440
But you're so perfunctory.

393
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,039
I'm going to be angry.

394
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,680
People like you, who are at a dead end,

395
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,920
just want money, don't you?

396
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,079
I'll give it to you!

397
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,240
I want money.

398
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,079
You,

399
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,279
I also want.

400
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,799
Help!

401
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,640
Run!

402
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,640
Mr. Cai.

403
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,160
Stop!

404
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:27,759
Stop running!

405
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,000
Stop right there!

406
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:32,559
Hurry up!

407
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:33,640
Your Highness.

408
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,480
Run first.

409
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,119
Leave me alone.

410
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:35,799
Run!

411
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,000
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

412
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,640
Stop!

413
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:42,720
Stop!

414
00:22:59,079 --> 00:22:59,839
Mr. Cai.

415
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,319
Let go.

416
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,240
Let go.

417
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,559
Princess.

418
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,359
Let's go.

419
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:21,880
Come on.

420
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:25,559
It's okay.

421
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:26,599
Let's go.

422
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,559
What totem?

423
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
It's a curse

424
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,440
which is extremely sinister

425
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,599
and cruel.

426
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,200
Sis,

427
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,400
I got this

428
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,720
from a very efficacious treasure land.

429
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,400
It can ensure the child to grow up safely.

430
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,759
Don't mind it.

431
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,720
Have you ever thought that

432
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,759
everything exists

433
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,519
in a proper way.

434
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,759
It's like a long river.

435
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,359
If you stop it

436
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,839
from going where it's going,

437
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,559
it will find another way.

438
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,359
But no matter what,

439
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,319
it will never stop.

440
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,400
Mr. Cai,

441
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,839
fortunately, you're here.

442
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,200
Every time I meet Mr. Cai,

443
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,039
I always seem to be

444
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,200
in such a mess.

445
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,000
Your Highness, you worry too much.

446
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,079
In this world,

447
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,480
who can live

448
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,640
a smooth life forever?

449
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,720
In this world,

450
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,440
I'm afraid Mr. Cai

451
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,519
is the only one who can help me.

452
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:22,960
Your Highness,

453
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,160
you are hurt.

454
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,640
Find a place to deal with it.

455
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
Let's go.

456
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,279
Miss.

457
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:11,799
Cuicui sent a message saying

458
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,920
when Lu Xinran came back,

459
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,839
the wound on her back

460
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,720
has been bandaged.

461
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,279
Time to save the Lu family

462
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,240
is finally here.

463
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,319
Come and help.

464
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,640
Coming.

465
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,799
If I had known growing grapes
was so troublesome,

466
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,400
I might as well have stopped growing them.

467
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,079
How ungrateful of you

468
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,160
to say that!

469
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,920
If we don't grow grapes,

470
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,119
we wouldn't have known His Highness

471
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,279
is so attentive to you.

472
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,799
Only this stage

473
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,240
where we need to

474
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,119
heat up the grapes.

475
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,680
No need to do it at other times.

476
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,799
All right,

477
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,720
go back and rest.

478
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,640
I'm watching the fire here.

479
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,400
How can we ask

480
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,640
Prince Qi who is famous in Hanjing City

481
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,359
to watch the fire?

482
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:02,880
Holly, Lingxi.

483
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
Make some drinks.

484
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,200
Prince Qi is thirsty.

485
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,119
Yes.

486
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,839
I'll loosen the soil.

487
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,279
Spring Imperial Examination ends.

488
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,000
Mr. Xu also won

489
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,079
the first place back.

490
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,359
You should be happy.

491
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,160
Why do you still look sad?

492
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,559
I met my second brother.

493
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,799
In fact, his situation

494
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,200
is more difficult than I thought.

495
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,039
He is surrounded by tigers and wolves,

496
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,599
and consolidates step by step.

497
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,119
Looking inside and outside
the imperial court,

498
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,200
he can trust no one.

499
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,720
Anran,

500
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,640
I can't abandon him.

501
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,240
I see him as my brother as well as father.

502
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,119
I know.

503
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,640
He has no way out.

504
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,039
But I don't know if you have one.

505
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,880
In fact, I've been thinking these days

506
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,799
what happened

507
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:30,799
after you came to Hanjing.

508
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,200
I have a feeling that

509
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,119
there's something big inside you.

510
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
And this big thing

511
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,119
is about my second brother,

512
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,839
also about Lu Yun,

513
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,799
and Lu Xinran.

514
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:45,759
Stop guessing.

515
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,079
I told you,

516
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,799
I just want to protect the Lu family.

517
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,720
But my second brother will only

518
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,839
be in the whirlpool of the court,

519
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,000
deeper and deeper.

520
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:55,880
With the Lu Family,

521
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,000
you go with him.

522
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,160
Things may develop in the opposite direction
when they become extreme.

523
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,319
(Of course I know.)

524
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,000
Even if you can bear Xu Qingce's death,

525
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,359
can you bear
more deaths of the innocent?

526
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,640
Would you like to believe me

527
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,720
no matter what happens in the future,

528
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,160
I'm willing to face it with you.

529
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,240
If you don't want to tell me,

530
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,160
it doesn't matter.

531
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,400
It doesn't matter.

532
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:36,440
But I don't want you

533
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,759
to oppress yourself so hard.

534
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,000
Okay?

535
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:50,839
Mu Chuan.

536
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,359
I saw the words on the bracelet.

537
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,480
You saved Lingxi's life.

538
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,400
I know.

539
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,839
When you heard about my death,

540
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,000
you rushed to Su City day and night.

541
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,559
You tried your best to save Lu Xinran.

542
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:09,359
It is because

543
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,759
you fear I'll really kill her.

544
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,039
I have way out.

545
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,960
Wait for me.

546
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,920
Okay?

547
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:25,319
I'll wait for you.

548
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,279
Miss, Miss.

549
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:31,880
Miss.

550
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,000
What's wrong? Take your time.

551
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,720
Young master,

552
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,160
young master goes out of town by horse.

553
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,039
I see he is carrying a bag,

554
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,039
he must have run away from home.

555
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,440
Miss! Miss!

556
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,119
Miss!

557
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,640
Young master left a letter in his room.

558
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,119
So many things happened during this time,

559
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,160
I can't figure it out.

560
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,720
I don't understand it either.

561
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,720
Now, the only thing I can be sure of,

562
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,319
is my own heart.

563
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,119
Big sis,

564
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,200
I'm going to do

565
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,640
what I like.

566
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,880
But I don't know if what you're doing

567
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,519
is what you like.
(Lu Yun.)

568
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,440
Second sis might not be that bad.

569
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,680
When the chief was assassinated,

570
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,559
it was she that

571
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,960
asked me to turn to you.

572
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,559
I thought you

573
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,519
agreed to meet there.

574
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,359
And happened to encounter the assassination.

575
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,960
But I didn't expect it to be Lu Xinran.

576
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,680
Since Lu Xinran

577
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,480
got the news of the assassination,

578
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,319
the one who gave the order

579
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,240
must be in Mansion of Prince Qing.

580
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,319
Second brother wanted to kill chief.

581
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,240
And Lu Xinran...

582
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,039
Borrowed a knife to kill a man.

583
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,039
Let me disappear forever.

584
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,559
Don't mind it.

585
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,200
Lu Xinran,

586
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,519
although you and I are relatives,

587
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,079
connected by blood.

588
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,839
We become

589
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,279
sworn enemies.

590
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,279
I've been fooled by your fake gentleness

591
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,200
for so many years.

592
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,039
I don't even know you hate me that much.

593
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,599
This is the last time.

594
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,119
Take it as what you owe me.

595
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,440
I owe you one more time.

596
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,559
I'll deal with the foolish mess

597
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,720
between us

598
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,680
until all the dust settles.

599
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,519
Brother Mu Ze.

600
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,039
I thought I would wait for a long time.

601
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,759
I didn't expect you to

602
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,759
marry me so soon.

603
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,359
Today, I'm here

604
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,960
to choose a wedding date with Your Highness.

605
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,279
Sister shouldn't have

606
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,559
followed today.

607
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,319
This is my own wedding date.

608
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,960
Why can't I come?

609
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,160
What do you think, Brother Mu Ze?

610
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,200
Reasonable.

611
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,640
Jingque is from the general's clan,

612
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,759
she won't be

613
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,359
that bashful

614
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,359
like other girls.

615
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:22,839
Right?

616
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,519
Butler,

617
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,759
what have you been up to lately?

618
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,640
His Highness is going to have a concubine.

619
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,319
I don't know which girl it is.

620
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,160
General Xiao Ying's sister,

621
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
Xiao Jingque.

622
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,319
General Xiao has made great achievements

623
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,000
in the front line.

624
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,799
The recent victory

625
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,000
will keep the East safe

626
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,480
for at least ten years.

627
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,079
From beginning to end, His Majesty knew that

628
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:08,559
I was the one who killed the Little Prince.

629
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:10,079
But what will His Majesty do to me?

630
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,679
His Majesty is now giving an order

631
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,920
to kill your whole clan.

632
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,079
Execute immediately.

633
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,320
His Majesty did not hesitate

634
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,280
to sacrifice an entire forward army

635
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,840
to frame Qin Yekuo.

636
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,440
In order to bring down Prince Yi.

637
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,280
Xiao Jingque should have

638
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,559
entered the mansion three years later.

639
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,480
Why is it so early?

640
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,519
Your Highness, Miss Lu Anran is here.

641
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,159
Welcome.

642
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,800
What happened today?

643
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,719
You don't look well.

644
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,440
Are you all right?

645
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,599
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

646
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,159
Brother Mu Ze,

647
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,679
who is she?

648
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,960
I call you here today

649
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,000
because I want to introduce

650
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,760
General Xiao to you.

651
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,599
I am Lu Anran.

652
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,239
Just a businesswoman.

653
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,079
In the light of His Highness,

654
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,760
I have the honor to meet General Xiao.

655
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,880
You don't have to belittle yourself.

656
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,199
The person His Highness specially recommends,

657
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,239
must be extraordinary.

658
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,559
You're right about that.

659
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,679
The reason why your strategic materials

660
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,760
are able to reach the battlefield

661
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,679
so quickly

662
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,440
is all her merit.

663
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,719
She is the owner of the Double Fish Order,

664
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,800
and the head of the Lu family fleet,

665
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,800
Lu Anran.

666
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,719
I got it.

667
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,519
You're Princess Qing's sister.

668
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,880
Yes.

669
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,000
Brother Mu Ze,

670
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,679
since you're so close to her,

671
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,320
and her sister is the Princess Consort,

672
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,440
won't I be bullied in the future?

673
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,519
How come?

674
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,360
I have guarded

675
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,639
the border for many years.

676
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,559
It's worth

677
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:10,400
the loyalty of the Xiao family,

678
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,239
instead of

679
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,280
humiliating for our family.

680
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,119
Logically speaking,

681
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:18,679
if my sister marries

682
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,440
the nobles in the capital,

683
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,559
she is qualified to be

684
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,760
the Crown Princess.

685
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,639
But Jingque has loved
Your Highness since childhood,

686
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,559
even if she can only be a concubine,

687
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,280
she also wants to marry you.

688
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,400
Considering the marriage,

689
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,480
it's really a bit unfair.

690
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,920
There is only one Crown Princess.

691
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,320
General Xiao, do you

692
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,440
want His Highness

693
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,599
to divorce with me?

694
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,400
Your Highness don't misunderstand.

695
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,480
Of course, I didn't mean that.

696
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,960
General Xiao, we've known
each other for many years,

697
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,360
and we fought side by side.

698
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,880
You obviously have something to say today,

699
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,519
why are you beating around the bush?

700
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,280
General Xiao,

701
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,559
please come straight to the point.

702
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,760
Your Highness,

703
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,679
I'd like to ask you

704
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,920
to marry my sister Jingque

705
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,320
with the ceremony of the Crown Princess.

706
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,800
This is not a trifling matter.

707
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,039
His Highness has worked hard,

708
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,920
so he has the current position in the court.

709
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:25,559
If he really follows General Xiao's order,

710
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,000
capable officials in the court

711
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,760
will think His Highness is a foolish man

712
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,199
who spoils his concubine
and abandons his wife.

713
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,519
Your Highness,

714
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,880
I'd like to ask you

715
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,159
to marry my sister Jingque

716
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,159
with the ceremony of the Crown Princess.

717
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,679
There's something

718
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,440
I don't know if I should say it or not.

719
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,599
Eldest Sister is like a mother.

720
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,599
Since princess is not here,

721
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,440
of course you can decide for her.

722
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,559
His Highness has finally gained

723
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,280
a firm foothold in the imperial court.

724
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm sure General Xiao

725
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,679
doesn't want His Highness

726
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,239
have the stigma of

727
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,519
spoiling his concubine and
abandoning his wife.

728
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:23,880
No.

729
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,559
But Miss Xiao

730
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,199
is sincere to His Highness.

731
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,360
As a woman,

732
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,880
I can understand it better.

733
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,880
Judging from your tone of voice,

734
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,719
you have a perfect solution.

735
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,519
After Miss Xiao enters the mansion,

736
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,480
Your Highness can hold a banquet in Miss Xiao's name

737
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,480
and invite all the ladies in the capital.

738
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,840
In this way,

739
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,079
it shows that Your Highness

740
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,440
attaches importance to

741
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,880
the Xiao Family.

742
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,639
As well as your affection for Miss Xiao.

743
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:50,599
What's more,

744
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,800
Your Highness can get closer to

745
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,639
people who don't dare to

746
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,719
make friends with via women's contacts.

747
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,159
Why not do it？

748
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,559
(Lu Xinran's plans for the past few days)

749
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:02,639
(have come to naught.)

750
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,760
(How can she endure)

751
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,840
(Xiao Qingcui with a higher background,)

752
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,239
(and higher life experience)

753
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,280
(making a splash.)

754
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,000
What?

755
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,440
His Highness is going to
have a new concubine?

756
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,760
Even

757
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,440
a girl from general's clan.

758
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,719
The real noble of Hanjing,

759
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,039
Princess don't worry.

760
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,559
No matter what,

761
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,360
you're the real Princess.

762
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,159
Only with the title,

763
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,559
how do I look like a real princess?

764
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:45,880
Why is God

765
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,199
so unfair to me?

766
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,880
When I was in Lu's Mansion,

767
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,400
I was oppressed by Lu Anran.

768
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,840
Now that I'm a princess,

769
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,039
I still have to

770
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,039
be oppressed by others.

771
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,679
No way.

772
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,119
I have to think of a way.

773
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,719
Yes, I have to think of a way.

774
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,559
Anran,

775
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:30,880
let me take you somewhere.

776
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,559
Where?

777
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,210
(Peace Granary)

778
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,079
I wonder how much

779
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,559
Boss Lu thinks

780
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:52,760
the names of the first witnesses

781
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400
of Peace Granary cost?

782
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,119
Approximately,

783
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,360
enough to let you take me out

784
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,519
for 10 times for no reason.

785
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:58,880
Only 10 times?

786
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,320
You're too stingy.

787
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:03,519
(Peace Granary)

788
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,119
The imperial examination

789
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,159
has finally come to an end.

790
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,119
His Majesty asked what reward I wanted,

791
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:08,320
I asked for this.

792
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,159
Worth it.

793
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,519
That's right.

794
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,800
Except for the cities and counties of Hanjing,

795
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,239
His Majesty has ordered to

796
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,360
build the official granary everywhere.

797
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,400
The imperial court

798
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,079
allocates grains

799
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,599
to the port built by your Lu Family

800
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,519
to restore in the granary.

801
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,480
It seems that your National Granary Plan

802
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,599
has achieved initial results.

803
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,519
