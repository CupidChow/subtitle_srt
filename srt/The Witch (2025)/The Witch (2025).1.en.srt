For real?

15
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,039
- Gosh. - Yes.

16
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,310

Three thousand dollars!

25
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,259
- Yes! - Yes!

26
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:18,509
All right.

27
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,240
How is this possible?

28
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,150
I want to check the CCTV.

29
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,319

00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,460
Any more bets?

35
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,439
Banker, natural eight. Banker wins.

36
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,840

38
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,550

00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,269
to the casino.

45
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,159
A rented studio in a small city in Gyeonggi Province.

46
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,360
Owns a domestic sedan.

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,059
Besides having occasional drinks...

49
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,375
- Excuse me. - with close friends,

50
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,199
he doesn't do much in his free time.

00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:56,740

Banker, eight. Banker wins.

59
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:18,230
Pain point. The psychological Maginot Line.

60
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,729
The amount of loss...

61
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,259
shocking enough to never return to a casino again.

62
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,398
We, Shine Solution,

63
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,128
analyse big data from various customers...

64
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,540
with similar conditions,

65
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,198
including gender, age,

66
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,708
living standards, casino adaptability, and more,

67
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:35,610
to estimate each individual's specific pain points.

68
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,829
Sir.

69
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,160
What?

70
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,799
You see...

71
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,230
What do you want?

72
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,110
Our hotel has prepared a meal especially for you.

73
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,569
How about getting some fresh air?

74
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:08,680
Sorry?

75
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,680
Taking a break at a time like this is a good idea.

76
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:13,980
Allow me to escort you.

77
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,649
When a guest's losses approach their pain point,

78
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,689
we help them reset by offering complimentary meals or drinks.

79
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:29,759
Sir.

80
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,129
This is a hotel voucher given to our VIP guests.

81
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,160
(VIP Guest Room Certificate)

82
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,209
Why are you being so nice to me?

83
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,309
Please use it the next time you visit us.

84
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,779
We'll provide the best service.

85
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,310
Enjoy your meal.

86
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,350
(VIP Guest Room Certificate)

87
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,939
This concludes the data we've prepared.

88
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,449
What do you think is the goal of a casino?

89
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,050
Isn't it making the most profit?

90
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,518
Our casino's goal is...

91
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,689
to collect as much of the guests' money as possible.

92
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,930
Frankly, it's not our concern if they sell their car or house.

93
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,670
It's not like our casino is a social enterprise.

94
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,469
Rather than leaving guests...

95
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,899
lose everything and never return,

96
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:47,269
wouldn't managing them in a way that encourages continuous visits...

97
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,240
be more profitable? More money will flow into the casino.

98
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:59,319
The atmosphere of today's meeting was great.

99
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,390
And Seohan Bank will renew the consulting contract.

100
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,689
Beef is on me today. It'll be boneless short ribs.

101
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,730
Boneless short ribs?

102
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,799
But I'll just go home.

103
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,699
Why? Why are you playing hard to get again?

104
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,970
We're always missing our ace in our team dinners.

105
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,069
I've got a long-awaited plan with a friend.

106
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,339
But you don't have a...

107
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,279
Is it Kim Joong Hyuk from our major?

108
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:20,709
Yes.

109
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,579
Right. After all, Kim Joong Hyuk is your only friend.

110
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,319
Is he doing well?

111
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,250
He's busy with all the cases.

112
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,820
Why don't we all get together sometime?

113
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,990
Okay.

114
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,289
Here comes the chairman.

115
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,650
Today's proposal was interesting.

116
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,370
Thank you.

117
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,169
Most people delude gamblers by talking about...

118
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,370
odds and statistics, claiming they can win money at the casino.

119
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:55,539
Your idea of making them lose less money was quite intriguing.

120
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:59,178
That is Shine Solution's distinctive competitive edge, Chairman.

121
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,179
I see.

122
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,019
- Director Kang. - Yes?

123
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,750
Consulting contracts are indeed needed,

124
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,789
but how about investing in Shine?

125
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,820
If Shine gives us the approval, I'll bring it up at the table.

126
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,960
Good.

127
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,460
Do you play golf?

128
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,129
No, Chairman.

129
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,399
What about tennis?

130
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,700
I'm afraid I'm not the athletic type.

131
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,119
Do you have hobbies like playing pool or riding a bicycle?

132
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,768
Reading books and analysing data in my room.

133
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:26,909
I guess those are my hobbies.

134
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:30,709
What a boring guy.

135
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,710
You're right.

136
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:40,049
Here.

137
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,888
- My years have taught me... - That should do.

138
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,999
- life is full of variables. - Thank you.

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,529
- Good luck. - Desire is even harder to measure.

140
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:55,100
How's the car? Is it all right?

141
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,668
Like you said,

142
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,309
it'd be great if world affairs were answered in numbers.

143
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:08,350
Spare me some time, will you?

144
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,750
I'll treat you to a meal.

145
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,649
I'll do so.

146
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,389
Get back safely, Chairman.

147
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,559
What...

148
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,940
My car...

149
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,139
You jerk!

150
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,980
Scum of a bag!

151
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:15,648
See that?

152
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:16,980
He's checking the phone number.

153
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,519
The man did it clearly knowing who owned the car.

154
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:22,758
A clear target means...

155
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,059
he has a grudge against you.

156
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,190
"A grudge?"

157
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,590
Or it's a crime of passion.

158
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,010
I'm not involved in any of that.

159
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,799
Look carefully. Does he not look familiar?

160
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,870
I've never seen him before.

161
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,909
Really?

162
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,350
Yes.

163
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:50,850
All right. Then...

164
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,490
Let's write a damage report first.

165
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,259
Your name, Lee Dong Jin.

166
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,190
The address is Gangwon Province...

167
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,230
Do you live in Taebaek?

168
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,899
- Please tell me again. - That's my hometown.

169
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:05,470
My primary residence is...

170
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,668
- here, the address on the bottom. - I see.

171
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:09,599
(Change of Address)

172
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,710
- "Seoul, Seocho-gu," - Go ahead.

173
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:15,840
- Your name. - "Seoun-ro 4-gil, 14."

174
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,908
Fine. May I get your name first?

175
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,048
"Unit 504."

176
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,779
- What do you do for a living? - Min Park.

177
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,319
- Sorry? - "Min Park?"

178
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,990
Your job. I'm asking what your job is.

179
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,090
I'm a data miner.

180
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,489
"Data min..."

181
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,759
(Occupation: Data min...)

182
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,429
Is the spelling of "minor" like in "minor league?"

183
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,799
No, it's not that "minor."

184
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,000
What I do is data mining.

185
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:47,539
It's inferring information from vast amounts of data.

186
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,809
I'm just an office worker.

187
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,309
Right, an office worker.

188
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:53,649
- Yes. - "Office worker."

189
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,850
Isn't this the so-called big data?

190
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,219
Big data, as in what I search on the internet pops up...

191
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,719
as advertisements...

192
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,959
- Yes. - on my social media...

193
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,658
and websites I visit.

194
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,929
Yes, that's one kind of data mining.

195
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,500
I see.

196
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:13,830
I'm guessing data miners earn big bucks.

197
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,570
- What? - Well...

198
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,440
A young man like yourself owns an expensive car.

199
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,538
It's strange these days.

200
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,839
I don't know what people do, but they're all making money.

201
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,509
And I mean a lot. Don't you think so too?

202
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,479
Give me your ID cards.

203
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,549
- Give him your ID card! - Stop it.

204
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,590
- Enough! - Darn it!

205
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:36,418
- Goodness. - Guys, please.

206
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,429
- You little... - This is a police station!

207
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,399
- Stop it! - That scumbag!

208
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,459
- Really, you... - Seriously.

209
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,629
Get off of me!

210
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,470
Drink some water.

211
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,500
And calm down, okay?

212
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,970
- Where did the report come from? - Sorry?

213
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,580
The owner of Milal Bar from across the street called.

214
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,350
You two are wasting time pleading the Fifth.

215
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,419
Take out your ID cards, will you?

216
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:15,029
What a total loser.

217
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
That scumbag.

218
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,898
Or else, both of you will be charged with mutual assault...

219
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:25,668
and fraud for dining and dashing on top of it.

220
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:28,009
I'll make a convincing warrant request and...

221
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,440
You get it, right?

222
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,250
Sir...

223
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,289
I don't think the two would want to get charged.

224
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,820
What do you mean?

225
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,559
I think they're a family.

226
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:48,730
You mean those two?

227
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
His shoulder.

228
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,169
And see his stained socks?

229
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:57,898
Identical staining due to a chemical reaction.

230
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,579
It's caused by the same laundry detergent.

231
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,139
Watch how they touch the water bottles.

232
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,508
A family living together is seven times more likely...

233
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:10,048
to pick up the same habits than the general population.

234
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:11,720
And they're probably keeping...

235
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,250
a white dog or a cat.

236
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,259
That man's shoulder.

237
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,879
Do you know each other?

238
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,350
Are you brothers?

239
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,320
- You think I'm... - Good grief.

240
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,149
Aren't you two too old enough to fight now?

241
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:49,120
Did you call Mom?

242
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:51,759
I so did. What? Are you scared, jerk?

243
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:53,829
- You idiot... - You're dead meat.

244
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,500
I'll see you at home, scumbag.

245
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,129
I am...

246
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,870
too humiliated to live in this neighbourhood. Seriously.

247
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,669
Goodness.

248
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,409
Good evening.

249
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,980
My apologies, Detective.

250
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,979
They say one with a cursed husband has cursed children.

251
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,518
And I'm the prime example of such a saying.

252
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,620
Mom. He ate all the snacks but wanted me to pay for the drinks.

253
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,659
Good evening, Mom.

254
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,929
"Mom?"

255
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,898
Did you invite me here thinking I might not know...

256
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,600
what a police station looks like?

257
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,768
You hopeless son!

258
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:35,200
You hopeless son! Get on your knees!

259
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,969
(Reliable Police, A Safe Country)

260
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,539
- Bye. - Bye.

261
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,509
- Behave yourself. - Yes, Mom.

262
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,259
Goodness, a data miner is impressive.

263
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:00,559
You're worth driving a nice car.

264
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,959
Anyway, vehicle damage falls under...

265
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,670
special property destruction, making it a serious offence.

266
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,868
Since you mentioned no one would hold a grudge against you,

267
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,339
we will investigate from multiple angles...

268
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:14,980
and get back to you.

269
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,680
- Okay. Thank you. - No problem.

270
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,529
- Hyun Woo. - Joong Hyuk.

271
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,130
Goodness. I'm beat.

272
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,539
Seriously.

273
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,809
Are you all right?

274
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:48,579
These men sure can run.

275
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,809
Great work, Joong Hyuk.

276
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:52,079
Good grief.

(Joong Hyuk)

279
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:10,759
Hey, Detective Kim.

280
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:11,869
Dong Jin.

281
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,730
I'm afraid something came up.

282
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:17,099
Is that so?

283
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,769
I'm sorry. I'll wrap it up quickly.

284
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:23,509
Actually, why don't we meet up next time, Joong Hyuk?

285
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,710
No, it's okay. I only need to make the handover.

286
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,710
Joong Hyuk! Hurry!

287
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,920
I've been dragged to a team dinner.

288
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,318
Are you being honest?

289
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,759
Of course, I am.

290
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,960
Jeong Woo is treating us to Korean boneless short ribs.

291
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:42,960
It'd be disrespectful of me to leave early.

292
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,200
Well, that's a relief.

293
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:48,269
How are you these days? Are you doing well?

294
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,299
Yes, nothing has changed.

295
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,069
Did anything happen?

296
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:54,240
No, I'm fine.

297
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,710
All right.

298
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,760
I'll see you next time, Dong Jin.

299
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,509
Okay.

00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,589
(Ramyeon, Coffee, Beverages)

301
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,509
Why are you alone today? What about your friend?

302
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,240
He's busy and can't make it.

303
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:30,309
Well, that's new.

304
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,859
The train for Hanam Mount Geomdan Station is approaching.

305
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,160
Please be careful of the gap...

306
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,029
between the train and the platform.

307
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:17,220
The door is closing.

308

Please stand behind the safety line.

309

Come on, Mi Jung.

310
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,999
Turn me down with a reasonable explanation.

311
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,209
Only then will I not get upset.

312
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,739
Hey. Look at them.

313
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,839
What do you mean it's dangerous...

314
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,910

Mi Jung.

317
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:46,950
Are you listening?

318
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,420
You can't take a hint, can you?

319
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,329
I told you to stop. So stop.

320
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:56,359
You see,

321
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,430
I can't do that.

322
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,768
Hey, be quiet.

323
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:02,200
That's because...

324
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,869
I like you...

325
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,809

Please?

327
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,119
What do you even know about me?

328
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,950
You're selfishly imposing...

329
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:22,099
your one-sided feelings on me without considering my feelings.

330
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:25,430
But you want me to accept you?

331
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,160
It is her.

I'm truly...

334
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,240
sick of it.

335
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:46,849
My mom told me if we were fated to meet,

336
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,349
we would meet one day.

337
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,049
I couldn't believe her then.

338
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,960
But today,

339
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,490

Okay. Do you need anything then?

How can you study right now?

It's white noise.

349
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,390
It helps me focus better.

350
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,759
I see.

Hey, Lee Dong Jin.

352

Are you planning to go to college alone?

353
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,528
This is a good example of white noise.

00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,318
- Pass it to me. - Pass it.

368
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,588
- Nice. Go for it. - Hey.

369
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:00,650
- Dong Jin! - Hey.

370
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,118
- Hurry up. - Get it.

371
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,818
- What was that? - Come on.

372
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:05,288
- He... - I gave you a nice pass.

373
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:06,730
- Seriously. - He's like a robot.

374
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:08,700
- Come on. - Let's go.

375
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,930
Hey!

376
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,068
- You should've scored it there. - Hey, let's try again.

377
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:15,670
- My gosh. - Come on.

378
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:18,169
With her neat bob haircut...

379
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,650
and no effort to enhance her looks...

380
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,109
Come on, go for it.

381
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,140
- Over here. - she was still pretty.

382
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,426
What are you doing? Come on! You're not going to play?

383
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,650
- Hey, pass it. - Hey.

384
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:28,579
- Hey. Okay. Keep going. - Hey.

385
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:30,279
- I got it. - Pass it.

386
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,920
Hey, keep going!

387
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:34,220
She was the type of girl...

388
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,419
who caught my attention...

389
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,789
and sparked my interest without even trying.

390
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,799
Finish it!

391
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,099
- What a surprise. - I told you that.

392
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,650
Back then, strange things kept happening in our school.

393
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,619
There was a rumour that it was all because of her.

394
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:07,059
That must have been why...

395
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,759
she was always alone.

396
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,690
Park Mi Jung.

397
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:16,599
Then one day...

398
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:19,970
What are you doing here?

399
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:21,430
Hey, Jung Hwan.

400
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,499
I don't have an umbrella.

401
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,509
I was waiting until the rain would stop.

402
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,610
You think it will stop anytime soon?

403
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,790
Tell you what. I'll share my umbrella with you.

404
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:33,309
No. I can just go home in the rain.

405
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,349
You might catch a cold.

406
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:38,059
You don't take the bus. You always walk home, don't you?

407
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,819
I actually do the same.

408
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,970
My house is in the same direction as yours.

409
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:44,819
Is that so?

410
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,990
Let's go.

411
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:00,309
My house is pretty close from here.

412
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:02,380
How far do you have to walk?

413
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,049
Are you okay?

414
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,460
Take this with you. Bye.

415
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:14,579
(Midong High School)

416
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,359
Oh, no.

417
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,960
A male student died in an accident on a rainy day.

418
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,650
Let's have a moment of silence.

419
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:03,529
(Midong High School)

420
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,339
Why did the hearse take a lap around the yard before it left?

421
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:18,639
I'm not sure.

422
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,480
Maybe, it's a way of praying for the departed.

423
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,980
A student from our school died.

424
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:26,269
Why are there so many accidents from our school?

425
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Right.

426
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,099
Hey, how many accidents did we have so far?

427
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,900
A student broke his bone, and another got hit by a car.

428
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,309
Now, someone died.

429
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,049
Get back inside. Let's go.

430
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:01,869
- Let's go. - Hey, we should go.

431
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,319
Let's go.

432
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,470
But how did he die?

433
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,170
You didn't hear?

434
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,670
He got struck by lightning.

435
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:22,339
- Lightning? - Yes.

436
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,839
It rained a lot two days ago.

437
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,300
He was walking home and then got struck by lightning.

438
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,619
How could he die from a stroke of lightning?

439
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,079
I know, right?

440
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,926
The chances of that happening are lower than winning the lottery.

441
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,990
Anyway...

442
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:40,390
That day, she was definitely crying.

443
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,970
Hey, I heard it happened...

444
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,970
because of Park Mi Jung.

445
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,509
What?

446
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,279
You know the accident.

447
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,108
Oh, I didn't come up with it.

448
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:00,950
That's what my friends said. That it was because of Park Mi Jung.

449
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,420
You guys know Ik Jong, right?

450
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:07,048
The one who got into Hankuk University?

451
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,858
- Yes. - Of course, we do.

452
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:11,160
The banners about him are hanging in every alley.

453
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,359
My mom has been on my back because of him.

454
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:16,930
But what about him?

455
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,929
There was an accident at church.

456
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,730
He got stung by a wasp.

457
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,970
Da Eun told me that...

458
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,069
Park Mi Jung was there when it happened.

459
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,008
Bad things keep happening...

460
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:27,970
whenever she's around as if she's cursed.

461
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:31,710
Do you know how Class Three calls her?

462
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:33,849
How do they call her?

463
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,490
The Witch.

464
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:43,160
Jung Hwan was struck by lightning...

465
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,858
around Park Mi Jung's house.

466
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:46,029
- Is that true? - Yes.

467
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:47,759
Yes, I heard about that too.

468
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,259
That's so creepy.

469
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,299
Why is that creepy?

470
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,538
The fallacy of hasty generalization.

471
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:00,710
Lazy induction.

472
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:03,180
What? What's he saying?

473
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:06,629
Judging someone in her entirety based on a partial observation.

474
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:11,980
Here's an example.

475
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:16,890
Yes. Let's say there was an ice cream thief in the cafeteria.

476
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,190
Ho Young, the ice cream lover,

477
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,910
practically lives there during breaks.

478
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,430
Then...

479
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:25,359
does it mean he's the ice cream thief?

480
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:26,630
Hey. I...

481
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,629
I'm not a thief.

482
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,268
I pay for my food.

483
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:31,999
What? That doesn't make sense.

484
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,469
Right, it doesn't make sense.

485
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,669
It's the same logic.

486
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,139
Whether she was there when it happened...

487
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,860
or the lightning happened around her house,

488
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,809
it has nothing to do with Park Mi Jung.

489
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,980
Be quiet. Silence.

490
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,189
You can chat when you get home.

491
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,430
You can start dating when you go off to college. Got it?

492
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,819
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

493
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,490
Study hard.

494
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,259
Yes, sir.

495
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,799
Be quiet, guys.

496
00:30:57,329 --> 00:30:58,329
You be quiet.

497
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,838
- Mom. - Yes.

498
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,079
Are the camera batteries dead?

499
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,449
I don't know. I didn't even touch that.

500
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,319
Do we have any spare batteries at home?

501
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,088
Who uses that kind of camera these days?

502
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,558
Just take the digital camera.

503
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,960
Don't pester me later to get the photos developed later.

504
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:26,929
I told my friends that I would bring a film camera...

505
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,289
to take pictures of them.

506
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,069
Come on. Do we have any spare batteries?

507
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,069
Check the drawer under the TV.

508
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
My gosh.

509
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,910
They aren't here.

510
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,740
Yes, they are.

511
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,809
Come on.

512
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,549
I'm serious. They aren't here.

513
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,789
Unbelievable.

514
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:56,460
Where are the batteries?

515
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,329
Here. See?

516
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,200
- They were really here. - Good grief.

517
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:09,640
You can't see what's in front of you just like your father.

518
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,500
Gosh, don't laugh.

519
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,910
Thank you, my dear mother.

520
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:25,650
Our second semester began.

521
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,690
And we went on a school field trip.

522
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:53,750
All right. One, two, three.

523
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,950
Another pose.

524
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,250
- One, two, three. - Hey.

525
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,519
I don't have a lot of takes left. One, two, three.

526
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,319
Gosh, those fools.

527
00:33:05,829 --> 00:33:07,130
One, two, three.

528
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:13,268
All right. This is the last take. Let's make it fun.

529
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:15,400
- When you jump, I'll take it then. - Okay.

530
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,640
On my count of three.

531
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:19,240
One, two, three.

532
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:27,309
Hey, what are you doing? My legs hurt.

533
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,858
- Hey, what are you doing? - Come on.

534
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:38,519
- Hurry up. Take it already. - Come on.

535
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:40,859
Okay. Let's do it.

536
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,759
One, two, three.

537
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:49,269
Hey, Hae In just farted.

538
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,599
- No, I didn't fart. Seriously. - Oh, no.

539
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,369
- I really didn't. - Move out of my way.

540
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:55,369
Move!

541
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:58,809
Hey, isn't that Bang Ju Song?

542
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,150
Yes, it is. Bang Ju Song from Class Three.

543
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:03,679
That must hurt a lot. Why are there so many accidents?

544
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,089
Did you see the blood? He was bleeding a lot.

545
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,410
That looks like a serious injury.

546
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:28,409
She was...

547
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,380
trembling as if she was overwhelmed by fear.

(Digital Photo Development Studio)

549
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,920
- Hello. - Hey.

550
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,619
You're here, Dong Jin. Hold on.

551
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:49,429
Here you go.

552
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:51,960
Dong Jin.

553
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:54,328
Nowadays, you can still get your photos developed...

554
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:55,869
with a memory card.

555
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,250
With the film rolls, it costs more to get them developed.

556
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,820
I have to wait for the pictures to be developed.

557
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,210
I like that.

558
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:05,380
All right. Check the photos then.

559
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:06,650
Thank you.

560
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,460
My gosh. These fools.

561
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,699
Will she be offended if she finds out?

562
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:47,289
What's the lunch menu today?

563
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,119
Spicy pork?

564
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:08,138
Then you do it.

565
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,939
- All right. - Hey, are you serious?

566
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,409
- You're ridiculous. - Seriously.

567
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,849
Hey, are you all right?

568
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,150
I don't know.

569
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,949
Hey, how did this happen?

570
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,219
Guys, you should be careful around her too.

571
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
What do you mean?

572
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,230
As more time went by,

573
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:30,460
she spent a lot more time on her own.

574
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,570
Dong Jin, are you coming?

575
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,239
I'm coming.

576
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:01,389
(Midong High School)

577
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:04,030
- We must try it. And that too. - Nice and sweet.

578
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:08,769
You're not even my friend.

579
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,519
She was having lunch...

580
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,019
in a quiet corner of the school as the sun beat down on her.

581
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,570
- I'm back, Mom. - You're back.

582
00:37:57,449 --> 00:38:00,050
What is it? Why didn't you go home right away?

583
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,460
What?

584
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,489
Do you need money again?

585
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:12,969
Mom, you're the best.

586
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:14,369
What is it for?

587
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,669
The school bench in front of the storage...

588
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,170
doesn't have a sunshade.

589
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:22,780
- Like an awning screen? - Yes.

590
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,210
I was sitting on the bench after soccer.

591
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,280
It was way too sunny on the bench.

592
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,479
There's no coming back once you get sunburned in autumn.

593
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,949
I heard it could cause skin cancer.

594
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,590
Good grief! How could you say such a thing?

595
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:40,130
Or could you lend me money?

596
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,789
I'll pay you back when I grow up.

597
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,260
And how long is that going to take?

598
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,029
Darn it. Whatever.

599
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,030
Tell them the president of the PTA will donate it.

600
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,469
Really? Are you really going to set it up?

601
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,169
My only son is worried...

602
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,480
about getting skin cancer. What choice do I have?

603
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,109
My goodness. If I serve another term...

604
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,350
on the PTA, it might drive our finances into the ground.

605
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,219
Thank you, Mom.

606
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,649
- It tickles. Stop it. - Okay?

607
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,219
Stop it. Hey!

608
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:08,719
My goodness.

609
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,590
That brat. My gosh.

610
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:14,659
Good grief. That money-consuming thing.

611
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:17,260
- Okay. - Pass it.

612
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,599
- Hey. - Here.

613
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,529
- Hey. - Go!

614
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,198
- Hey, he got the ball. - Is it Dong Jin?

615
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,299
I can block your shot even without looking.

616
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,510
- Just kick it already. - Gosh, that little...

617
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,539
I'll block it without using my hands. Come at it.

618
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,550
Shoot!

619
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,049
Darn it, it smells.

620
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,719
Hey, don't throw it.

621
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:41,920
- Hey, we won. - Come on.

622
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,488
Hey, kick it. Come on.

623
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:48,059
No!

624
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:54,329
There's an awning screen.

625
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,210
- Hey, pass it to me. - Hey.

626
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,079
- Over here. - Hey, hurry up.

627
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,280
Hey, take it. Come on.

628
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:14,590
Hey, let's go.

629
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:17,388
- Hey, keep going. - No, kick it high.

630
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:18,420
I want to try too.

631
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,389
Another male student died...

632
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:25,199
in March of the new school year, just as we began our third year.

633
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:29,969
The dead student was in our class.

634
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:33,409
The students whispered to each other.

635
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,079
What was it this time?

636
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,480
You didn't hear?

637
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,549
You know the pharmacy around the downtown area?

638
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,880
There was an accident.

639
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,218
It would be more scientific if you blamed it on the weather.

640
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:47,250
- Isn't that Park Mi Jung? - I think so.

641
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,320
Who's that next to her?

642
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,489
- Is something wrong? - I don't know.

643
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,789
Blame it on the rain.

644
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,829
Blame it on the lightning that hit exactly in that spot.

645
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,139
I told you to stop.

646
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:06,840
I'm sorry.

647
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,210
I didn't mean to...

648
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,900
Mi Jung.

649
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,199
Mi Jung.

650
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,070
But did you know that Park Mi Jung was with him?

651
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:44,039
Is it true that Park Mi Jung is a witch?

652
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,710
Hey, don't even go near her.

653
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,309
You might die too.

654
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,680
Everyone, let's all have a moment of silence.

655
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:37,250
All the baseless rumours that floated around...

656
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,050
branded the girl as a witch.

657
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:47,459
(Park Mi Jung in Year 3 Class 3 is a witch.)

658
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,259
(Witch)

659
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,859
(Get lost.)

660
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,260
(No, Park Mi Jung is...)

661
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,050
(Don't come to school. That's enough. Witch.)

662
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,409
I thought I must talk to her this time.

663
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,940
I was just waiting for recess during class.

664
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:18,239
But she left school right away.

665
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,480
I...

666
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,219
couldn't say a single word to her in the end.

667
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:30,460
"Hi, I'm Lee Dong Jin."

668
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,489
I couldn't say it until the end.

669
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:10,559
This stop is Gangdong Station.

670
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,469
The doors are on the right.

671
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:16,769
Mi Jung.

672
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,840
Excuse me.

673
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,690
(Gangdong)

674
00:50:20,389 --> 00:50:22,460
I just followed her before I knew it.

675
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:24,559
What do I even want to do?

676
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,099
She wouldn't even know me.

677
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:24,480
It's...

678
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:27,190
really hard for me...

679
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,849
sometimes.

680
00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:36,730
Can I live without meeting people?

681
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,469
I really don't know...

682
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:45,469
how to live...

683
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,940
or how to disappear.

684
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,809
I know nothing.

685
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:01,920
I hoped she would be doing well.

686
00:53:02,989 --> 00:53:05,989
I hoped she would be doing well wherever she is.

687
00:53:07,929 --> 00:53:09,769
I've been wanting to meet her for a long time.

688
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,630
I didn't know she would be living like this.

689
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:15,130
Maybe...

690
00:53:16,469 --> 00:53:17,749
I might've hurt someone today...

691
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,670
as I always have.

692
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,320
There must be a reason why you and I have met again...

693
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,289
after all this time.

694
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,420
Because people who are meant to meet...

695
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,159
will inevitably do so one day.

696
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,080
(The man who caused a nuisance on the subway)

697
00:55:32,739 --> 00:55:34,138
(A man who looked obviously drunk...)

698
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:35,439
(confessed his feelings to a woman and was rejected.)

699
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,840
(Then he collapsed. It was a mess.)

700
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:43,880
I...

701
00:55:45,219 --> 00:55:46,349
like you a lot,

702
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,949
Mi Jung.

703
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,360
Do you know that?

704
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,960
I really...

705
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,360
(Emergency on the subway)

706
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,139
(Emergency on the subway)

707
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:28,190
Mi Jung.

708
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:30,699
Mi Jung.

709
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,139
Hey, are you okay?

710
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:39,939
- Hey. - He collapsed.

711
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,169
Please report to 911.

712
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,238
- Hey. Come on. - What's the matter?

713
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:44,340
He fainted.

714
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:45,780
He's unconscious.

715
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:48,109
What's going on?

716
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,380
Oh, no.

717
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,650
What's the matter?

718
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,690
Someone collapsed here.

719
00:56:57,159 --> 00:56:58,920
Please report to 911 right now.

720
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:02,030
Right in front of the door.

721
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:04,960
It's number 5050.

722
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:07,199
Hurry up.

723
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,840
Someone collapsed here.

724
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:14,769
Mi Jung.

725
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:20,980
Hey, are you okay?

726
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,509
Hey.

727
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:24,119
Please report to 911 right now.

728
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,820
Are you okay?

729
00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:29,320
Someone collapsed here.

730
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:30,690
Please report to 911.

731
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:35,860
Hi.

732
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,969
- You're here. - Yes.

733
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,139
Do you want to drink?

734
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:54,909
Here.

735
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,960
Is something wrong?

736
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:12,659
Joong Hyuk.

737
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,730
Some people are a little weird,

738
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,699
aren't they?

739
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,039
You?

740
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,710
No, not me.

741
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:26,809
What's weird about me?

742
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:28,650
You're totally weird right now.

743
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:32,820
What I'm saying is...

744
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:36,289
For example...

745
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:39,119
Will he show that side again?

746
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:41,328
He hit it!

747
00:58:41,329 --> 00:58:43,189
- It's flying over! - It's going far.

748
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,876
It's like whenever you go to watch a game in person,

749
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,159
the team you support always loses.

750
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:49,230
Do you get it?

751
00:58:50,769 --> 00:58:51,840
I think I do.

752
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:54,439
Whenever you look at a clock, it's always 4:44.

753
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,440
(4:44pm)

754
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,138
We have a table for two people. Please come inside.

755
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:00,209
Whenever you line up outside a restaurant,

756
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:02,510
they run out of ingredients right before your turn.

757
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:07,888
The machine that worked just fine when other people used...

758
00:59:07,889 --> 00:59:10,420
is always broken when you use it.

759
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,489
Like Murphy's law...

760
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,530
or Sally's law?

761
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:16,690
Right. A law.

762
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:20,559
There are strange laws in the world.

763
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,900
There's no law. It's all coincidence.

764
00:59:25,469 --> 00:59:26,699
What if there's actually...

765
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,409
a law like that?

766
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,009
What if there's someone haunted by that dreadful curse...

767
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:35,349
for their entire life?

768
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:40,849
Their life must be so hard.

769
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:43,989
What on earth are you talking about?

770
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:54,670
Someone is haunted by the law of death like a curse.

771
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,909
If I can understand that law, couldn't I break the curse?

772
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,940
Doesn't it mean I could save the person from the curse?

773
01:00:09,949 --> 01:00:10,980
Joong Hyuk.

774
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:14,519
Do you think...

775
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:18,489
there's a witch?

776
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:43,448
(Special thanks to Kim Hye Ok, Ju Ji Hoon, )

777
01:00:43,449 --> 01:00:46,118
(Yoon Bak, and Hyun Bong Sik for their cameo appearance)

778
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:47,518
(The original soundtracks "It's Still Love" by Choi In Gyeong...)

779
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:48,948
(and "Don't Go Away" by Park Jang Hyun...)

780
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:50,420
(are available on all platforms.)

781
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,829
Strange things have often happened around me since I was little.

782
01:00:57,929 --> 01:00:59,129
How about tteokbokki?

783
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,429
Sounds amazing!

784
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:03,130
(Danger)

785
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,670
- It's all coincidence. - What if there's actually...

786
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,480
a law like that?

787
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,179
It seems like there's a food poisoning outbreak at school.

788
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:18,079
Apparently, 12 boys from our class have been affected.

789
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:20,989
Their life must be so hard.

790
01:01:24,219 --> 01:01:25,389
I like you.

791
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,230
Why is it your fault that he died?

792
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:32,310
It was probably just his fate to die at that moment.

793
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,230
Oh, my gosh.

794
01:01:34,369 --> 01:01:35,928
Is it my daughter's fault...

795
01:01:35,929 --> 01:01:38,170
that your son fell from the cultivator? Is it?

796
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:40,170
Her mother died giving birth to her.

797
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:43,110
I told you.

798
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:45,340
Mi Jung is really a witch.

799
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:49,980
Mi Jung!

800
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:51,679
Wake up!
