(Natural Disaster Occurrence Status)

16
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:01,499
You used statistics to prove that...

17
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:05,499
a series of accidents and deaths in a village had nothing to do...

18
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,240
with one individual. I liked that idea.

19
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,670
But...

20
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,069
it's useless now.

21
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:14,879

No.

23
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,650
Your report was useless from the start.

24
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,319
It was full of errors.

25
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,890
You applied statistics selectively.

26
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,050
To put it simply,

27
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,259
you had already concluded that she wasn't a witch.

28
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,089
Then you used statistics to fit your narrative.

29
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,099
This isn't mathematics.

30
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:35,700
Take it.

31
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,170
Why are you giving this back to me?

32
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,469
Verify all the questions on the checklist.

33
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:46,569
Then it will be clearer if she's a witch or not.

34

Even if you correct the misapplication of statistics,

77
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,380
the target value was set incorrectly from the beginning.

78
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,489
It means...

79
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:48,019
even though you wanted to prove that she wasn't a witch,

80
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,390
but you pointed to her as a witch.

81
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,260
That's true.

82
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:55,359
Because the only common factor in the incidents was her.

83
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,370
Okay.

84
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:01,099
This is a crime map created by the San Francisco Police Department.

85
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,598
They created a crime map...

86
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,769
that indicated the location, time,

87
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,210
and severity of crimes.

88
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,739
The police department thought the date they had was insufficient.

89
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,709
So they analysed the data that included hidden crimes,

90
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,320
which they discovered through direct interviews with local residents.

91
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,089
Based on the crime map they created,

92
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,419
they reassigned patrol areas and personnel,

93
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,690

94
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,799
The crime rate in San Francisco decreased significantly.

95
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,928
So are you saying...

96
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:34,599
you're going to make an incident map related to the witch?

97
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,669
Bingo.

98
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,968
The goal is to extract the pattern of incidents and accidents...

99
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:40,510
that occurred around the witch.

100
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:44,549
If we can identify the variable that affects this pattern,

101
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:48,479
we can predict potential future incidents.

102
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,849
If we can predict it, we can also stop it from happening.

103
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,130
But we don't have enough data to find the pattern, do we?

104
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,460
We should still try, though.

105
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:03,799

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,549
the experimental and new stuff.

186
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,649
Instead of nurturing your juniors, you're blocking their path forward.

187
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,679
Hey.

188
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,620
Am I your parent?

189
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:42,260
Who nurtures who in this harsh world?

190
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,890
Everyone should find their own way to survive.

191
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,760
I...

192
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,760
need to stay here for a very long time.

193
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:52,870
My children still have a long way to go.

194
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,140
I'll be stuck on the ground like a fallen leaf soaked in rain.

195
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,870
No matter how much they try, I won't let them sweep me away.

196
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,110
You don't have any ambition.

197
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,380
Your juniors will learn nothing from you.

198
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:09,380
Gosh.

199
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,319
Ambition?

200
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,250
I don't need it.

201
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:16,720
Look at this.

202
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,730
Look.

203
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:19,860
(Mathematics)

204
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,028
I don't have the money to pay for a tutor,

205
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,659
so I teach math to my daughter who is a senior.

206
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,569
My already thin hairline has fallen out.

207
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,600
Do you know why I'm doing this?

208
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,340
Because I'm a father.

209
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,510
Because I'm a father, I'm doing pathetic things like this.

210
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:39,678
(Vision Trip)

211
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,049
Whatever. Don't look for me starting from today.

212
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,220
Hey, Ms. Heo.

213
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,350
Heo Eun Shil!

214
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,260
That crazy punk.

215
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,130
It's so sudden.

216
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,529
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:02,038
Don't do something to be sorry about.

218
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,669
What are you doing, Mr. Lee?

219
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,539
Dong Jin.

220
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,479
We have so many things to do.

221
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,409
What can I do without you?

222
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:14,449
Think about Shine Solution.

223
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,150
We have more than 30 employees now.

224
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:19,549
There are more than 100 people, including their families.

225
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:21,519
I'll make sure to finish the digital logistics system project...

226
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
we're undertaking...

227
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:24,459
with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport.

228
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:28,000
Dong Jin.

229
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,629
Dong Jin. Don't you know that casino investment contracts...

230
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,000
are being exchanged?

231
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:36,298
You can handle it.

232
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,740
I'm not even in charge of it.

233
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:42,038
The chairman keeps telling me that he wants to eat with you.

234
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,140
What do I do?

235
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:46,250
I'll contact him privately.

236
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,150
Jung Ho.

237
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,689
Do you remember the consulting project with Seohan Bank?

238
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,659
It was about the small business loan algorithm.

239
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,090
Seohan Bank?

240
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:01,929
Data might not be everything.

241
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:04,729
What if data isn't everything?

242
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:08,340
Things other than data only hinder the accuracy of the algorithm.

243
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:09,800
That's what you said.

244
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,169
Right.

245
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,380
Dong Jin.

246
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,019
I don't know what made you feel skeptical about this,

247
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,050
but if you quit like this, other people will take the credit...

248
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,489
for what we worked so hard for.

249
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,290
Is it because your stake is too small?

250
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:33,630
I was clueless.

251
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,860
Fine. I'll give you an additional three percent of the shares.

252
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,668
Okay. Let's do this then.

253
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:41,540
I'll increase your stake by five percent,

254
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,499
and give you a ten percent incentive...

255
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:46,140
- for each project. - Jung Ho.

256
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:49,939
You know that's not what it's about.

257
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:53,249
Just think that it's a sabbatical year.

258
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,820
A sabbatical year?

259
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,149
You're too young to have a sabbatical year. Team Leader Lee.

260
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,350
No. Director Lee.

261
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:04,060
Can't you grasp the situation?

262
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,759
The atmosphere has been good.

263
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:09,159
You should work harder when the time has come.

264
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,850
Are you burnt out?

265
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,709
Jung Ho.

266
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,719
There's something I must do.

267
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,820
I think I'm going to regret it if I miss this opportunity.

268
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,199
Okay.

269
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:47,130
Don't go too far.

270
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:06,149
The water pressure is nice,

271
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,890
and the hot water works well too.

272
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:11,120
Your neighbours mostly live alone, so it'll be quiet.

273
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:15,229
When are you going to move in?

274
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:16,959
As soon as possible.

275
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,669
If it's urgent, you can move in right now.

276
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,739
Still, you better check other things too.

277
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:25,340
Try flushing the toilet.

278
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,810
But I want to move into the unit upstairs, not here.

279
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:43,719
It's already taken by someone.

280
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,229
Can I still have a look?

281
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,560
How can we see the place when it's not even for rent?

282
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,668
It has the same layout and size as this place.

283
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:53,800
There's no difference.

284
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:55,570
It has to be the apartment upstairs.

285
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,239
Can you please let me see it?

286
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:06,749
Well...

287
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,749
I can ask if you can take a look.

288
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,489
But this person isn't home.

289
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:22,400
Why should I?

290
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:25,570
Let us just take a look.

291
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,070
It won't take long.

292
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,300
So why should I do that?

293
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,640
Please let me take a look.

294
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,508
He must have a reason.

295
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:38,349
Could you please let him take a look?

296
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,309
Come on. I covered for you when you were playing the guitar...

297
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,150
and people filed noise complaints.

298
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,949
No.

299
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,019
My gosh.

300
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,790
My goodness. Come on.

301
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,699
Gosh, that tenant has quite the temper.

302
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,070
On top of that, he never pays rent on time.

303
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,369
I often avoid him because he can get a bit scary.

304
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,840
So don't take it personally.

305
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,310
I won't.

306
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:11,650
My goodness.

307
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,489
Wait! Hold the elevator.

308
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,689
Thank you.

309
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,239
Hello.

310
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:39,009
Hey.

311
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,679
Do you like rice cakes?

312
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,610
What? Rice cakes?

313
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,310
Like rainbow rice cakes or sirutteok. Any favourites?

314
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,350
My parents run a rice cake shop.

315
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,150
I hate rice cakes.

316
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,860
My gosh. I see.

317
00:21:57,989 --> 00:21:59,390
That didn't cross my mind.

318
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:02,929
Okay.

319
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,040
Could you recommend a nice boxed meal for me?

320
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:20,249
The spicy pork with kimchi and tuna bibimbap are most popular.

321
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:24,780
(Spicy pork with kimchi)

322
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,759
What's a popular drink then?

323
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,699
What's...

324
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,699
The carbonated water and energy drinks.

325
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,269
(Boxed Meal)

326
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,479
It's 11.3 dollars.

327
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:00,350
Do you want a plastic bag?

328
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:02,090
You don't need one, right?

329
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:03,719
What?

330
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,560
Enjoy.

331
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,860
What?

332
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:22,408
- Sung Min, let me do it. - What are you doing?

333
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:24,208
- I'll do it. - I'm great at this. I can do it.

334
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:25,580
- I'll do it for you. - What are you doing?

335
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:27,080
I'll do it.

336
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,218
You shouldn't do this.

337
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:31,919
I can take care of this. Okay?

338
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,820
Why would you do this? My goodness.

339
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,590
Fine, you do it then.

340
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,699
Sung Min. See you around!

341
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,509
(I'm new to the building. I hope we can get along well.)

342
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,009
Come on.

343
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:13,129
Who is it?

344
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,189
Mister.

345
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,259
Why are you doing this to me?

346
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:27,739
Happy now?

347
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:29,580
Would...

348
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,310
three months' rent and moving expenses be enough?

349
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,380
Oh, well...

350
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,150
You don't have to do that.

351
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:46,330
I emailed you the materials for next week's meeting.

352
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,830
Right.

353
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,958
I also uploaded the data analysis file...

354
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,570
regarding the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy project.

355
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:53,969
Okay, I got it.

356
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,540
Dong Jin. Everything is okay with you, right?

357
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,409
Yes.

358
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,709
Jung Ho.

359
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:08,009
I'm sorry for causing you concern.

360
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:23,758
- Bye. - Bye.

361
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,370
Bye, kids.

00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:50,360
Oh, right.

May I help you?

00:25:57,699 --> 00:26:00,300
Oh, right. I'm just headed...

369
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,699
to the third floor.

370
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,768
I see. The third floor.

371
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:04,900
- Yes. - Okay.

372
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,759
(Brazilian Waxing, Bikini Waxing, 30 percent off for off-season)

373
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:27,429
(Full face waxing: 72 dollars, armpit waxing: 12 dollars)

374
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,469
(Brazilian Waxing, Bikini Waxing, 30 percent off for off-season)

375
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:34,929
Welcome.

376
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:47,249
This looks good.

377
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,620
I'll put a piece of kimchi on it.

378
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,999
It's so good. It's amazing.

379
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:05,669
Is this for real?

380
00:27:07,469 --> 00:27:09,239
Here. This is for you.

381
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:12,110
I'm good. I feel full just by watching you eat.

382
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,439
You always sound like my mom. My goodness.

383
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:18,580
This is so good.

384
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:21,150
Eat a lot then.

385
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,390
I want to save up money and go on a trip.

386
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:32,060
Yes. You translate travel shows for a living.

387
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,860
But you never get to travel.

388
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,300
Please go and travel.

389
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,929
I came across this place while translating.

390
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,728
It's not an island, but it looks like one.

391
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:43,169
And it's not so crowded.

392
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,040
Nice. Where is this place?

393
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,140
Hallstatt in Austria.

394
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,009
Is it because not a lot of people live there?

395
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,249
I just thought...

396
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,749
things might be better abroad.

397
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,919
Yes. Let's work hard then.

398
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:11,560
My gosh. You did a great job with your vegetable garden.

399
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:15,199
Cherry tomatoes, lettuce, perilla leaves, and napa cabbages.

400
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,300
I try to grow my ingredients in my garden if I can.

401
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,640
That's amazing.

402
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:23,439
Oh, my.

403
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,449
Hey, you're a city farmer.

404
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,850
My father was a farmer.

405
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,219
I'll plant potatoes next spring.

406
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,189
Can you also grow potatoes in this small place?

407
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:37,988
Of course.

408
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:40,729
Potatoes grow anywhere as long as there's enough soil.

409
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:42,658
Why didn't you plant them this year?

410
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,600
I saved a task for next year.

411
00:28:45,229 --> 00:28:46,300
You saved a task?

412
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,439
Yes. That way, I have something to look forward to in life.

413
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,909
But why potatoes of all crops?

414
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:56,080
Well,

415
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,149
potatoes hide underground,

416
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,380
but they grow well on their own.

417
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:03,780
And it was also the last thing my father planted.

418
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,689
Will you keep bringing up sad stories?

419
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,659
This isn't a sad story.

420
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:15,499
It's a happy story.

421
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,370
I'm happy to see that you've become more cheerful lately.

422
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,600
You're smiling more too.

423
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,140
Of course. I must live diligently.

424
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:27,570
Yes. Let's live diligently.

425
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:29,409
Let's go to Hallstatt.

426
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,310
Thank you for helping me...

427
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,780
get the translation jobs with the publishing house...

428
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,789
as well as the travel documentary.

429
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,019
My gosh, stop it.

430
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,040
This is Lee Dong Jin speaking.

431
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,979
This is Detective Cha Kyung Soo from Gangnam Police Station.

432
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,919
I'm calling you because we identified a suspect.

433
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,350
His name is Lee Joong Ho.

434
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,889
He's on the wanted list.

435
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,419
So arresting him will only be a matter of time.

436
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:19,089
We looked into your case.

437
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,029
He ran a company named Seonil Products.

438
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,829
He used to run a small factory that made paper cups.

439
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,929
But his company went bankrupt.

440
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,070
His loan was approved by the bank.

441
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:30,299
But a change in the bank policy...

442
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,209
wouldn't allow him to get the loan, so he went bankrupt.

443
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,709
This guy went to the bank...

444
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,609
and made a huge scene.

445
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:39,309
The employee at the bank mentioned your company...

446
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,350
because your company created the system for bank loans.

447
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:43,620
My guess is that...

448
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:46,688
he saw you on the company's website...

449
00:30:46,689 --> 00:30:48,689
and targeted you.

450
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,530
That's how it happened.

451
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
A grudge...

452
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,469
What...

453
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,938
would happen if I were to drop the charges?

454
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:07,540
Will you remove him from the wanted list?

455
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,810
It's a serious crime.

456
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,478
It could help reduce the sentence.

457
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:15,310
But he will have to face criminal punishment.

458
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:18,049
It's not like he turned himself in.

459
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,519
He's on the run.

460
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,959
- I see. Okay. - Okay.

461
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,259
Bye.

462
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,669
I have one more question to ask.

463
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,570
Where can I file a report regarding flickering streetlamps?

464
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:42,610
Streetlamps?

465
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:44,979
Streetlamps...

466
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,228
- Detective Jang. - Yes.

467
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:03,758
Which department can he talk to...

468
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,229
about flickering streetlamps?

469
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:06,999
He can contact the Facilities Department...

470
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:07,999
at the borough office.

471
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,600
You can contact the borough office.

472
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,969
Okay. Thank you.

473
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:29,790
Mr. Lee Dong Jin.

474
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:41,800
What's your problem?

475
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:44,840
You're him, right? The guy from Shine or whatever.

476
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,439
Are you Lee Joong Ho?

477
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:50,409
You jerk.

478
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,810
You jerk.

479
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:55,009
Hey.

480
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,049
To you, people are mere numbers. Aren't they?

481
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,150
- Hey! - You jerk.

482
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:01,649
- What are you doing? - Get off me.

483
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,918
- Are you all right? - You jerk!

484
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:05,259
- Hey! - I got him. Call the cops now.

485
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,360
- Let him go. Get back to work. - Get off me.

486
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,429
Get off me.

487
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,479
It's fine. Don't call the police!

488
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:27,479
You jerk.

489
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:30,019
Why me?

490
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,689
Why did it have to be me, you jerk?

491
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,519
The loan was approved.

492
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:40,390
I was going to pay back the promissory note...

493
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:42,729
and settle all the overdue wages.

494
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,360
Everything would have been sorted out.

495
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:49,439
But my application was denied at the last minute.

496
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:52,100
Do you know what that means?

497
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,870
All of us...

498
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,879
Dozens of people lost their jobs overnight.

499
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,939
You jerk.

500
00:34:09,189 --> 00:34:10,860
Darn it.

501
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,430
Darn it.

502
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:36,479
Actually,

503
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,519
this was the first time I've been beaten up like this.

504
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,860
And it was also...

505
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:45,990
the first time hearing a stomach growl while getting hit.

506
00:34:58,669 --> 00:34:59,769
Have some more.

507
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,209
Apparently,

508
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,740
their spicy pork with kimchi and tuna bibimbap are pretty good.

509
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,550
Especially, the spicy pork with kimchi.

510
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,320
It is number one in the industry.

511
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:35,709
The main customer group for boxed meals...

512
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,680
from convenience stores consists of men in their teens to 30s.

513
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,509
Everyone in the food business knows...

514
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,749
that men love spicy pork thanks to big data.

515
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,050
But the competition became too intense.

516
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,490
It was hard to win over customers with just flavours.

517
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,090
So this convenience store brand...

518
00:35:54,729 --> 00:35:56,559
added a fried egg.

519
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:00,930
Like how restaurant owners would serve...

520
00:36:01,169 --> 00:36:03,169
fried eggs for free to their regulars.

521
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,639
That's what I do.

522
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,410
I add fried eggs to the meals.

523
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,539
But...

524
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:16,050
I didn't do that as a generous restaurant owner.

525
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,018
Well, adding a fried egg...

526
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:24,389
would incur 30 cents more to make the boxed meal.

527
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,558
But the sales would go up by ten percent.

528
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:30,229
I would put together how much it'd cost to set it up and so on.

529
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,360
I would gather a lot of data...

530
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,570
and calculate numbers to the best I could.

531
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:39,099
I would give it my all. I would do my best for it.

532
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,380
Oh, right. I do my best for everything.

533
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,079
I worked so hard to the point that...

534
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:51,880
my college professor...

535
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,019
told me to stop working so hard.

536
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:29,189
I'm sorry.

537
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,499
My family is all broken up.

538
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,869
My son...

539
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:48,139
went to his uncle's house in Masan.

540
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:51,880
My daughter, the apple of my eye,

541
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,879
went to Cheongju to live with her great aunt...

542
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,610
whom she had never met before.

543
00:37:56,249 --> 00:37:57,720
My wife is staying in a dry sauna.

544
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,919
I sleep in the Internet cafe.

545
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,760
I didn't want to let my family down,

546
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,130
so I worked hard.

547
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,130
But...

548
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,939
I lost everything in an instant.

549
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:20,340
Everything was gone just like that.

550
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,209
I didn't have the courage to start over given my age.

551
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,959
"Fine."

552
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,760
"Let's end it."

553
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,030
"It will be over with me gone."

554
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,570
I was staring down at the Han River for a long time.

555
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,169
I suddenly felt it wasn't fair.

556
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:09,760
(Seohan Bank)

557
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,788
I decided to find the guy...

558
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:13,229
("Lee Dong Jin Develops Loan System for Seohan Bank")

559
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:15,490
who was responsible...

560
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:18,229
and take him down with me.

561
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,439
But...

562
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,309
you saved me.

563
00:39:40,189 --> 00:39:41,450
I'm so sorry.

564
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,820
I know this isn't enough to console you.

565
00:39:49,229 --> 00:39:50,630
But I didn't know any better.

566
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:55,400
I didn't do it with malicious intent.

567
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,039
I'm truly sorry.

568
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,160
Can you take a picture of this too?

569
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,430
You said nothing was missing, right?

570
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:30,539
It appears that way.

571
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:32,538
There's no sign of forced entry.

572
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:34,139
So the culprit must know the passcode.

573
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,439
Does anyone come to mind?

574
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,780
Did you recently go through a breakup or a fight?

575
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,450
Well,

576
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,618
it's nothing like that.

577
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:47,650
Hyun Woo.

578
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,900
Do you have a place to stay for the time being?

579
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:01,869
Yes.

580
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,050
You should request protection.

581
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,919
Then you can get protection from the police.

582
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:24,090
Install a CCTV or wear a smartwatch.

583
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,530
Will you come at any time?

584
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:32,030
Press a button when you're in danger,

585
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,970
and a district or appointed officer will rush to you.

586
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:38,139
Can I...

587
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,269
appoint the officer?

588
00:41:42,979 --> 00:41:44,010
Yes.

589
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,180
Thank you.

590
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,039
Yun A.

591
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:18,539
Are you okay?

592
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,479
- Goodness. - Mom...

593
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,050
It's okay.

594
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,720
You're okay.

596
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,760
To arrest the culprit on their first offence,

597
00:42:38,459 --> 00:42:41,200
I think we should do a stakeout first.

598
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:49,978
Hi, Dong Jin.

599
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:50,979
Hi.

600
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:52,380
Have you been well?

601
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:54,380
Yes, I'm always the same.

602
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:59,180
You must've shot an action movie recently.

603
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,919
An action movie?

604
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:03,889
I sure have. But I wasn't the main character.

605
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,160
I was an extra done after getting beat up.

606
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,160
That's very unlike you.

607
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:09,829
What brought you here without a call?

608
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,630
I was around the area and thought we could catch dinner together.

609
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,200
"Dinner?"

610
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,069
I'll excuse myself first.

611
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,139
I have a date with my girlfriend.

612
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,209
Bye, Joong Hyuk.

613
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,840
Let's go.

614
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:27,780
Okay.

615
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:31,280
Your face. What really happened?

616
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,789
I deserved to be hit.

617
00:43:35,189 --> 00:43:38,459
I don't believe you. You wouldn't bully anyone.

618
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:40,289
I have a side you don't know.

619
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,860
I'm sorry.

620
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:46,669
All of a sudden?

621
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:49,229
This and the last incident. I was of no help.

622
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,769
I'm not a kid.

623
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,369
Joong Hyuk. I can take care of my own business.

624
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:58,240
It seems like things keep happening around you.

625
00:43:58,639 --> 00:43:59,650

What took you so long?

636
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,059
We're screwed.

637
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,590
There will be even more talk about it. Darn it.

What...

639
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:25,499

640
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,610

Weren't you the appointed officer? Why are you here only now?

644
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,200
What was the use of asking for protection?

645

We needed you to stop such incidents!

646

Honey. Stop it.

647
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,209
Come on, honey.

648
00:46:14,209 --> 00:46:16,519
Let's go to Yun A. Hurry.

649

It's good you didn't get lost.

659
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,800
Take a seat.

660
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:11,369
Setting up a time to meet you was tough.

661
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,369
But to think you'd contact me first.

662
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,510
It's an honour.

663
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:17,880
My apologies. I had a lot to take care of.

664
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:20,749
Yes, I can tell from your face.

665
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:26,279
You don't seem the type to fight with others.

666
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,389
What happened?

667
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,419
Well, you see...

668
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,419
I fell down and got hurt.

669
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:34,930
You're bad at lying.

670
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,530
The kalguksu here is right up my alley.

671
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,169
Sweetness is the key to red bean kalguksu.

672
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:48,439
Here. Dig in.

673
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,280
Yes, sir.

674
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,150
Make sure to add a lot.

675
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:18,070
(Kalguksu)

676
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:21,669
The cold wind makes me...

677
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,039
crave this place's red bean kalguksu.

678
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,650
This has been my lunch for the whole week.

679
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,780
I'm happy about it, but not them.

680
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,119
You may leave first if you're done.

681
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:36,389
Aren't you all busy?

682
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:38,720
Yes. Please excuse us first, Chairman.

683
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:40,130
Go ahead.

684
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:56,740
I wondered why this craving wouldn't stop.

685
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:58,880
I must be...

686
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,749
missing my mother greatly.

687
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,550
The red bean kalguksu here...

688
00:49:04,749 --> 00:49:06,789
tastes just like the one my mother made.

689
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:11,289
I guess I miss my mother a lot despite my age.

690
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,229
All right. So you had a favour to ask?

691
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,930
Oh, yes.

692
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,240
Let's see.

694
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,840
Who is this man?

695
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,609
I learned what you meant...

696
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,779
when you said not everything in life...

697
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,079
could be answered with numbers.

698
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,590
He unintentionally suffered because of me.

699
00:49:41,889 --> 00:49:43,860
Things like that can happen while working.

700
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:45,459
When...

701
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:48,590
that happens, will you go around making amends every time?

702
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,860
I'd appreciate it if you could give him a small duty in the casino.

703
00:49:56,229 --> 00:49:59,200
Right. If he's someone you guarantee,

704
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,869
I shall hire him for a suitable job.

705
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,309
Thank you, Chairman.

706
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,610
In this day and age,

707
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,550
people are only interested in their business.

708
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:10,479
Nobody cares about others. Don't you agree?

709
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,090
But you're trying to rescue someone.

710
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:19,419
You intrigue my interest.

711
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,700

714
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,539

718

The light's been fixed.

719
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:41,990

seeing you come to me when I come around...

724
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,950
makes me feel like I'm a real witch.

Like a fairy tale heroine cursed and trapped in a castle,

726

she lost her own life.

727
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:35,079
I will somehow find a way.

No matter what it takes,

729
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,519
I will break the curse she has...

730

I'm going back to the very beginning.

733
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,950
In Taebaek, where we were both born and raised,

734
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:47,689
I will find a clue to lift her curse.

735
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:28,150
Hey.

736
00:57:28,289 --> 00:57:29,419
Give me a minute.

737
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,360
You came earlier than expected.

738
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:36,829
It's a weekday, so there was no traffic.

739
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,430
Do you want some tea?

740
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,130
No, I'm good.

741
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:41,869
I have another place to be.

742
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:44,200
Hey. How long has it been?

743
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:45,700
Let's see.

744
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:49,039
Three years after my mom passed away.

745
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:50,579
You're so indifferent.

746
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,249
- I'm sorry. - No. I'm the same.

747
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:58,079
But will everyone be free?

748
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,950
Min Jae and Ho Young will be happy to see you.

749
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,889
Remember Da Eun?

750
00:58:03,289 --> 00:58:05,058
Yes, I do. Da Eun from liberal arts.

751
00:58:05,059 --> 00:58:06,659
Yes. She's going to come, too.

752
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,860
Midong High's Korean teacher.

753
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:10,289
- She also lives in Taebaek. - Really?

754
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,360
That's good. As a matter of fact, I have to drop by school.

755
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,869
Lee Dong Jin.

756
00:58:15,499 --> 00:58:16,569
What's this?

757
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,939
Explain what's going on if you've called up all your friends.

758
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,070
You left your hometown. So why are you back all of a sudden?

759
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:24,280
Did something happen?

760
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,309
I'll tell you tomorrow when we all meet up.

761
01:00:11,419 --> 01:00:12,519
Big data.

762
01:00:13,249 --> 01:00:15,650
I must extract the essential information from here.

763
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:48,590
(Special thanks to Kim Young Woong and Hyun Bong Sik.)

764
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:53,359
Since 2014, everything has been digitized...

765
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,889
and stored only on the server.

766
01:00:55,689 --> 01:00:57,530
But back in our days,

767
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,728
a lot of records were still handwritten.

768
01:00:59,729 --> 01:01:01,299
Most of what you need should be here.

769
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:04,169
That house. Near that house.

770
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:06,538
Yes, right here.

771
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:07,570
(Jeongun-ri)

772
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,769
Did anyone get injured or die in this area?

773
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:11,280
Is it even possible?

774
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,050
Of all times and places, a wild boar was there.

775
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:16,610
I know it's strange.

776
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,019
But I came to ask about when you were stung by a wasp.

777
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,018
A wasp?

778
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:24,490
We haven't seen each other in ages.

779
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:27,260
But why would you bring up the Witch?

780
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,130
So...

781
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:31,829
you still call her Witch.

782
01:01:34,169 --> 01:01:35,498
The accidents that occurred here...

783
01:01:35,499 --> 01:01:38,539
are concentrated primarily in 2010 and 2012...

784
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,069
when Park Mi Jung was enrolled.

785
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,070
(2011 Fall Trip)

786
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:44,010
