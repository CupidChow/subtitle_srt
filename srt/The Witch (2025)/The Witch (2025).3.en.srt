To save you from the pit of statistics,

10
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:06,979
I'm Hwang Jung Sik.

11
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,380
It's Hwang Jung Sik, not Hang Jung Sik.

12
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,690
Now then, we'll do what everyone loves for our first class.

13
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,520
Introducing yourself.

14
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,989
I know who's retaking my class,

15
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,660
so don't try to play any tricks.

16
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:26,558
No matter how big the class is,

17
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:28,858
your turn will always come, and you know that. Right?

18
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,059
- Yes. - Yes.

19
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:32,499
Let's start with you in the very front row.

20
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:37,839
- Me? - Yes.

21
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,710
Well...

22
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:48,820
Hi.

23
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,150
My name is Lee Dong Jin.

24
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,889
All right, Lee Dong Jin.

25
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:59,229
Why did you choose statistics?

26
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,630
I chose statistics because...

27
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,969
- You see... - Let me guess.

28
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,700
Your grades were enough for it.

29
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:09,039
No.

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,670
Then, is your dream to work at the National Statistical Office?

31
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,079
- No. - If you wish to earn lots,

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,409
it's better to take the actuary exam.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,748
Here's some sincere advice.

34
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:21,318
Unless you want to become like me,

35
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,020
don't go to graduate school.

36
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,289
- Next. - I...

37
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:32,730
Through statistics,

38
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:35,930
I have a life problem to solve. That's why I'm here.

39
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,640
Oh, gosh. What a novel reason.

40
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:42,800
"A life problem?"

41
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:44,610
That life problem of yours...

42
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,439
What's with you?

43
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,379
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:57,080
I love your enthusiasm for wanting to introduce yourself.

45
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,659
So, who are you?

46
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,490
Right.

47
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,029

48
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,200

51
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,839
Hi. I'm starving.

52
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,510
Enjoy.

53
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,279
Isn't he in our department?

54
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:29,279
He always eats alone.

55
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:31,649
His taciturn personality looked cool,

56
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,849
making him popular at first.

57
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:34,490
But now, everyone hates him.

58
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,760
The least he can do is greet others back.

59
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,559
That's why he has no friends.

60
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:43,059
Your fingers look bad. What happened?

61
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,930
Oh, this? I was peeling fruits.

62
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,140
That guy. It's like he has zero emotions.

63
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:53,170
There's a reason the guys call him a psychopath.

64
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:58,210
Joong Hyuk reminded me of Park Mi Jung.

65
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,190
You're wrong.

66
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,200
Sorry?

67
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,070
I said you were wrong.

68
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:24,609
What is he doing?

69
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,750
Kim Joong Hyuk.

70
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,650
That's your name, right?

71
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:36,719
Hey. Why are you eating alone? That's no fun.

72
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,390
Do you not remember me?

73
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:42,088
I'm also a statistics major.

74
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,390
We both take Professor Hwang's introduction to statistics.

75
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:47,400

77
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,928
By the way, where do you live?

78
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:53,370
I live alone near the school.

79
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,369
People ask if my family farms potatoes...

80
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,668
when I say I'm from Gangwon Province.

81
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:01,510
If so, do Jeju Island people all harvest tangerines?

82
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,010
We don't grow potatoes.

83
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,580
My mom runs a shop.

84
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,519
But my neighbours do farm...

85
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,949
Would you like some potatoes?

86
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,190
You see, my mom is super generous.

87
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:15,890
Even if I stir-fry them or boil them,

88
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,359
there's no end.

89
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:30,940
He really didn't say a thing.

90
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,919
Kim Joong Hyuk! Where are you going?

91
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,630
Hey, hold on!

92
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:01,669
Joong Hyuk!

93
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,270
Take your potatoes.

94
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,979
I told you I'd give you some my mom sent over.

95
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,210
Enjoy.

96
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,298
- Dong Jin. I'm leaving first. - Okay.

97
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,400
- Bye. - Bye.

98
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:41,380
Joong Hyuk. Let's go get lunch.

99
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,978
I'm tired of our cafeteria. How about eating out?

100
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,320
There's a new Chinese place near our school.

101
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,890
What do you want from me?

102
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,219
What do you mean?

103
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:00,859
When I don't respond,

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,060
people get the message and start avoiding me.

105
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,630
It seems you don't get it.

106
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,099
I don't mean any harm.

107
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,210
But you make me uneasy.

108
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:17,779
You remind me of someone.

109
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:24,549
I couldn't do it in the past.

110
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,390
I wasn't brave enough.

111
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:30,620
I don't want to repeat the same mistake.

112
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:32,130
I'm sorry...

113
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:34,560
if I made you uneasy.

114
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:50,679
Hurry up. I need to go to my part-time job.

115
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,349
I never asked you to join me.

116
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,690
All right. Take your time, okay?

117
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,359
By the way,

118
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,630
how many part-time jobs do you have?

119
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,900
You see,

120
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,200
I work at the convenience store on weekday evenings...

121
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,010
and the on-campus coffee shop on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

122
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,439
- I filled in for Myung Soo... - Got it.

123
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
- at the BBQ place. - It won't take long.

124
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,010
For money?

125
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:28,150
Or is your family financially poor?

126
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,220
Oh, that?

127
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,590
I didn't realize it then because my mom had always paid for them.

128
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,919
After signing up for online lectures and buying CSAT books,

129
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,860
I found out it was pretty expensive.

130
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,659
I see.

131
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,600
So you're taking the CSAT again.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
After getting into Seun University?

133
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,299
My mom will kill me for sure if I do that.

134
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,010
It's not for me.

135
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,340
I want this particular person to take the CSAT.

136
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,209
It's for that person.

137
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,199
That's right.

138
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:18,870
I work part-time here starting from 1pm.

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,380
Can we get more pickled radish?

140
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,880
Sure.

141
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,760
Seriously. Isn't Professor Hwang stingy when it comes to grades?

142
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:47,459
I know, right? At this rate, I might have to retake his class.

143
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,299
Hey, let's go the other way.

144
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,569
- Why? - Just come.

145
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:53,929
But why?

146
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,110

Since we're on break,

150
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,620
I'm going to work part-time.

Really? How about we work at the same place?

Okay.

153
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,500
Like that, Joong Hyuk became my friend.

154

Oh, my!

Goodness. My proud son!

I'm not a kid anymore.

164
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,058
They say once kids grow up,

165
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,260
they're strangers, and it's totally true.

"They're strangers?"

167
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:29,198
In other words, raising kids is fruitless.

Gosh. To think...

169
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,329
you'd reject my kiss now that you're an adult.

171

Putting aside money,

182
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,130
it's a great chance to learn about social life.

183
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:06,729

00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,640
They say there's a right time for studying.

186
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,569
How's university life?

187
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:14,579
It's fun.

188
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,579
I have a best friend named Joong Hyuk now.

189
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,250
What is he like?

190
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,719
He doesn't talk much.

191
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,789
He's not that sociable either.

192
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,658
But he's reliable.

193
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:30,319
You know those kind of people.

194
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,990
Ones you get drawn to more.

195
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,529
Joong Hyuk reminds me of someone.

196
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,260
Who?

197
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:37,969
Just someone.

198
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,069
Oh, Mom.

199
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:43,000
- I got a GPA of 4.3. - What?

200
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:44,970
I might get a scholarship.

201
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,439
Lee Dong Jin.

202
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,650
I had a hunch when you said you were working part-time.

203
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,579
How can you go to school with that score?

204
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,649
- What? - Just drop out of school!

205
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,980
Don't breathe. Don't eat, either.

206
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,220
- What? - I can't believe it.

207
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:01,459
I sent you to university, but what was it? 4.3?

208
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:05,329
How many did you get wrong to get that score?

209
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,289
Did you get one question right?

210
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,770
Mom. So you think 1 question is worth 4.3?

211
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,169
How can you laugh right now?

212
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,010
Look at their faces.

213
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,459
Yes, Mom?

214
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,360
What is it, Mom?

215
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:19,969
Your mom, who knows nothing...

216
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,798
since she didn't attend university,

217
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,640
is returning to the shop.

218
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,309
Stop it, Mom.

219
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,539
I'm sorry, okay?

220
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:29,779
Whatever.

221
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,880
I'll be home late. Order dinner, okay?

222
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:35,880
And greet the others well if you're going outside. Okay?

223
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,019
But I've got plans today.

224
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,419
Must I greet them today?

225
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:42,789
Don't you have a second to show your face around?

226
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,789
Remember how much they adored you?

227
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:48,028
By the way, the dry cleaner's son is in the hospital.

228
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:49,959
The owner is feeling low, so keep that in mind.

229
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,499
Didn't you say he did martial arts?

230
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,630
Why is he in the hospital?

231
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,370
I wonder if you know, too.

232
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,370
There was a rumour that there was a witch in your school.

233
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,179
How do you know about that, Mom?

234
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:04,549
Really, you.

235
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:06,449
There's nothing I don't know.

236
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:08,620
Anyway.

237
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,350
Her dad passed away not too long ago.

238
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,390
It's a shame. He was a nice person.

239
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,090
What? When?

240
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,760
It's been a few months already.

241
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:21,400
You should treat me well while I'm alive.

242
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,058
Life is really unpredictable.

243
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,429
It ends in a blink of an eye.

244
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,340
So Hyun Kyu from the dry cleaner...

245
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,669
went to her house to comfort her, and on his way back,

246
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,110
he ran into a wild boar.

247
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Goodness.

248
00:15:35,641 --> 00:15:37,510
How is running into a wild boar even possible?

249
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,318
With all that has happened,

250
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,620
the rumour that she's a witch might be true.

251
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,319
Mom! How can you be the same as them?

252
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,289
How is she a witch?

253
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,329
Do you actually believe that? Isn't it absurd?

254
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:54,959
But you see...

255
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,629
So many people either get hurt or die.

256
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,669
Are you listening to yourself?

257
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,199
Everyone gets hurt or dies. Okay?

258
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,270
But how can you blame it on her?

259
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,279
Think about the population in our country.

260
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,650
According to statistics, 247,000 people died last year.

261
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:13,880
That means an average of 677 deaths per day.

262
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,480
That many die a day?

263
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,019
If you do the math,

264
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,519
it's 500 deaths per 100,000 people.

265
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,090
In short, 5 per 1,000.

266
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,759
Midong High has 1,200 students.

267
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,659
So that means, around 5 to 6 would die.

268
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,028
But in the past 3 years, only 2 have died.

269
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,360
In other words,

270
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,199
everything is just a coincidence!

271
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,739
All right. Fine.

272
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,840
Seriously.

273
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:39,909
By the way, do you know those numbers by heart? Do you?

274
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:42,340
Dong Jin.

275
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:44,779
She's...

276
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,909
probably gone by now.

277
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,519
- What's this? - Why are we here?

278
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,319
The village meeting was a few months ago.

279
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,800
The people asked her to leave.

280
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,168
Let's see what she looks like.

281
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:08,339
Why do you even ask? I bet she looks like a sly fox.

282
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,870
Hyun Kyu was attacked by a wild boar because of her.

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,060
It's always those hardworking students.

333
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,729
They run away without looking back even for a second.

334
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,800
I won't run away.

335
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,630
Do you mean that?

336
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,870
Great. Then let me ask you a question.

337
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:43,610
This witch in your report. Is she a fictional character?

338
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,580
No.

339
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,679
She's misunderstood.

340
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,179

341
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,320

343
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:57,820
Yes.

344
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,759
You used statistics to prove that...

345
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,330
a series of accidents and deaths in a village had nothing to do...

346
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,969
with one individual. I liked that idea.

347
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:12,540
But...

348
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,840

To put it simply,

356
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:32,089
you had already concluded that she wasn't a witch.

357
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,860
Then you used statistics to fit your narrative.

358
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:36,929

359
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,330

00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:56,499
You'll make that happen, right?

547

(Dream Realtor)

548
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,119
Well, is it bad?

549
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,990
- Yes. - Oh, no.

550
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,099
I feel awful about it.

551
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:06,630
Ms. Oh is such a nice lady.

552
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:08,999
How unfortunate.

553
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:18,938
Let's put your house and the shop on the market.

554
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:20,749
No, I don't want to put the house on the market.

555
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:23,220
Why?

556
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,889
If no one lives in it, managing it will be hard.

557
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,119
It's fine.

558
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,189
All right then.

559
00:37:31,189 --> 00:37:33,930
So the 1,652m² of farmland at the foot of Mount Gurae...

560
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,760
in Midong...

561
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:37,229
Right.

562
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:38,829
Then...

563
00:37:39,669 --> 00:37:41,329
what will you do with the house from that family?

564
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:45,399
Pardon? What house?

565
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,039
You know, your mother owns another house.

566
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:50,079
It was the house of some witch or something.

567
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,979
Park's house in Jeongun-ri.

568
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,409
No one wanted to buy the house.

569
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,450
But she bought their house and the farmland.

570
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,749
Anyway, she has a big heart.

571
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,720
But you didn't know about it?

572
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,169
Doesn't it feel nice?

573
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,380
If it bothers you,

574
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,579
you can try to find faith.

575
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:40,759
It's the Pascal's Wager,

576
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,990
the apologetic methodology of a mathematician.

577
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,498
Whether there is a deity or not,

578
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:46,900
the probability of either one being right is 50-50.

579
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,300
So not believing in a deity...

580
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:53,110
would result in getting punished in the afterlife.

581
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:57,010
As someone who didn't go to university,

582
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,749
I don't understand.

583
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,780
That again.

584
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,919
I'm saying having faith is better than not having it.

585
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,720
So...

586
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,660
is there a deity or not?

587
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,728
I'm saying believing that there is a deity is advantageous for you.

588
00:39:18,729 --> 00:39:20,269
Mathematically and logically speaking.

589
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:27,240
So what is it? Is there a deity or not?

590
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:29,410
Mom.

591
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:33,280
No mathematicians can be certain.

592
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:36,219
Nothing can be 100 percent certain...

593
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,249
because there is...

594
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:41,019
a possibility that there can be exceptions in the world.

595
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,389
What a difficult concept.

596
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,229
Mom. By the way,

597
00:39:58,139 --> 00:39:59,709
it's about Park Mi Jung's house.

598
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,180
Why did you do it?

599
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:11,720
The one...

600
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,950
who kicked her out of our village...

601
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,289
was me.

602
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:20,489
Stop it, Jong Soo.

603
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,260
Talk to him after you let go.

604
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,099
You people are no different.

605
00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:27,430
Why didn't you stop him from spouting such nonsense?

606
00:40:27,669 --> 00:40:30,340
How can you when we live in the same neighbourhood?

607
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,740

- that man is... - What happened?

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,150
Hey, Mi Sook.

613
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:46,149
Rumour has it that Park's daughter...

614
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,150
is bewitching all the young men.

That's ridiculous.

616
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,220
Even the Midong High School students know about it.

617
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,789
So many male students got hurt.

618
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,959
Doesn't your son also attend Midong High School?

619
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,469
Yes, he does. He's a senior.

620
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,530
Gosh.

621
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,769
Your son should also be careful.

Don't we have to protect our children?

- Of course, we should. - Of course.

00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:32,180
- I can't stay still. - I agree.

660
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,149
Let me see her face. I wonder how she looks.

661
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,220

(Report on Fatality Rates: Denial of the Witch's Existence)

735
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,848
(That person was branded as a witch in the town where she lived...)

736
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:46,379
(and eventually left as she couldn't bear the stares of the people.)

737
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,789
As I lived,

738
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:52,959
I strangely found...

739
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,430
that sometimes...

740
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,860
I would meet certain people.

741
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,470
It was amazing how it happened that way.

742
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,510
So, I...

743
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:13,209
once thought...

744
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,209
I might see her again.

745
00:51:19,419 --> 00:51:20,990
Because you always end up meeting the people...

746
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,189
you're meant to meet.

747
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:29,630
Dong Jin.

748
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,599
If you ever meet her...

749
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:36,530
instead of me,

750
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:42,669
can you please say...

751
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:48,450
that I'm sorry?

752
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,260
Thank you, Mom.

753
00:52:07,869 --> 00:52:08,900
Mom.

754
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,269
I love you.

755
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,160
Oh, right.

756
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:11,400
Did you contact your relatives?

757
00:53:15,229 --> 00:53:16,300
How about your friends?

758
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,840
I should contact them now.

759
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:23,169
Give me their numbers. I'll contact them.

760
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:25,780
Thank you.

761
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:29,180
I...

762
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,180
liked my dad's camera.

763
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,619
It was a film camera.

764
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:36,289
I see.

765
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:38,860
I always took pictures of my friends.

766
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,829
Stray cats, trees,

767
00:53:47,169 --> 00:53:48,599
and clouds too.

768
00:53:51,499 --> 00:53:52,570
But...

769
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:59,610
I've never taken a picture of Mom.

770
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,079
I have never...

771
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,680
taken a picture of her.

772
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:10,490
Why isn't there a single solo photo of her?

773
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:12,789
My gosh.

774
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:17,030
It's funny.

775
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,260
Why do I find it so funny?

776
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:30,439
I loved taking pictures.

777
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,459
But there are no solo photos of her.

778
00:54:54,269 --> 00:54:55,300
Not even a single one.

779
00:55:02,709 --> 00:55:04,280
Mom was a good person.

780
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:07,610
Not to everyone,

781
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:10,519
but she was a good person.

782
00:57:55,749 --> 00:57:57,079
When I was organizing her possessions...

783
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,979
after the funeral,

784
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:03,349
I found what I had forgotten about.

785
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:13,558
(Korean)

786
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:15,098
(Books move people, and people change the world.)

787
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:16,629
(Books move people, and people change the world.)

788
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:20,639
The books and report I left behind at her house...

789
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:22,669
a long time ago.

790
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,139
Mom brought them all back.

791
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:28,610
"Report on Fatality Rates,"

792
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,180
"Denial of the Witch's Existence."

793
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,288
"I thought it was an appropriate method..."

794
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:43,490
"to perform predictions."

795
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:50,098
"Estimation method, sampling, and..."

796
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,769
The report, which Mom wouldn't even understand,

797
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,069
was covered in her fingerprints.

798
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,110
"Sampling." It's difficult.

799
00:58:56,869 --> 00:58:58,979
It showed how much she read it.

800
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:06,180
Mom might've believed in my error-filled statistics...

801
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:09,018
that claimed she was not a witch.

802
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:10,050
"Therefore..."

803
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,530
As I lived...

804
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:20,970
Sometimes,

805
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:24,470
I would meet certain people.

806
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:28,169
It was amazing how it happened that way.

807
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:32,079
Because you always end up meeting the people...

808
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,410
you're meant to meet.

809
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,490
I think I'm really cursed.

810
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:50,289
I just want to fade away...

811
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:55,499
and disappear without anyone knowing.

812
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,309
You might be a witch.

813
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,539
But...

814
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,510
you should never be a witch.

815
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:12,550
Just as my mom had hoped,

816
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:14,749
I will prove...

817
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,689
that you're not a witch.

818
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:47,749
(Special thanks to Jin Sun Kyu for his cameo appearance)

819
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:53,019
You used statistics to prove that...

820
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,990
a series of accidents and deaths in a village had nothing to do...

821
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,559
with one individual. I liked that idea.

822
01:00:59,729 --> 01:01:01,630
Because of the witch's curse.

823
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,470
(Because of the witch's curse.)

824
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:07,709
It's so sudden.

825
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,169
I'm sorry.

826
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,780
Can I...

827
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:14,780
designate someone as the officer in charge?

828
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,720
I...

829
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,059
want to go somewhere.

830
01:01:27,459 --> 01:01:29,689
When are you going to move in?

831
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,430
As soon as possible.

832
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:34,130
If it's urgent, you can move in right now.

833
01:01:34,269 --> 01:01:36,430
But I want to move into the unit upstairs, not here.

834
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,300
Who are you looking for?

835
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:41,869
- Sorry? - Who are you looking for?

836
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:44,740
In Taebaek, where we were both born and raised,

837
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:48,579
I will find a clue to lift her curse.
