00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:16,760
(Park Jin Young, Roh Jeong Eui)

2
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,470
(Lim Jae Hyuk, Jang Hee Ryung)

3
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,979
(The Witch)

4
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,980
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

5
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,980
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

6
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:43,990
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

7
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,950
It's my house.

8
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,700
It's still there.

9
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,830
Hi, Mi Jung.

10
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,800
It's Da Eun.

11
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,970
Da Eun, the postmaster's daughter.

12
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,980
Let's see...

13
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,580
I don't have the courage to talk in person,

14
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,650
so I'm giving my regards through video footage.

15
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,950
While reading the books...

16
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,420
you translated that Dong Jin gave me,

17
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,560
I felt proud of you.

18
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,870
I also felt relieved knowing you were doing well...

19
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,870
and grateful.

20
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
Mi Jung.

21
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,610
Back then,

22
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,620
I was too young...

23
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,490
and full of envy.

24
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,890
The rumour could have been short-lived,

25
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,700
but I...

26
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,970
added a name to it.

27
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,670
And once it had a name,

28
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,210
the rumour went around...

29
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,010
faster and farther.

30
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,150
I'm terribly...

31
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,520
Terribly sorry, Mi Jung.

32
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,190
Well...

33
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,330
Mi Jung.

34
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,960
Ever since you were little,

35
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,200
you always made others smile.

36
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,710
Playing gonggi...

37
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,940
and jumping over ropes with you...

38
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,580
are my happiest memories.

39
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,690
Every time...

40
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,760
I think of Do Hoon, who fell into a manhole...

41
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,119
while running away after cutting the rope,

42
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,830
I can't help but laugh.

43
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,400
Oh, right.

44
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,870
That very Do Hoon...

45
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
became a postman in Taebaek.

46
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,340
He's getting married next month.

47
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,980
"I'm sorry."

48
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,390
I don't know why...

49
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,790
such simple words...

50
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,860
weighed down on me for such a long time.

51
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,500
I'm really sorry.

52
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,140
Please forgive...

53
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,110
my loose lips and immature behaviours.

54
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,750
And I hope...

55
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,810
you'll find...

56
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,520
your pretty name...

57
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,960
Mi Jung back, not Witch.

58
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,800
Bye.

59
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,840
(Episode 9: Shine On You)

60
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,120
Joong Hyuk. This is the place.

61
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,720
That car belongs to the punk's dad.

62
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,759
But does that fool not know...

63
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,530
he shouldn't log in at such a place in this day and age?

64
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,229
- Let's go in right away. - Yes, sir.

65
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,430
I'll use the back door.

66
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,640
(Lee Dong Jin: I'm going to her.)

67
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,780
But I didn't delete it.

68
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,150
Welcome.

69
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,480
Excuse me.

70
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,920
(Kim Joong Hyuk)

71
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,160
What brings a policeman here?

72
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,700
I'm looking for someone. Allow me to search around.

73
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,340
Of course. Go ahead.

74
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,470
Myeong Gi.

75
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,340
It's me.

76
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,010
You know me, right?

77
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,680
Darn it!

78
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,810
Stop right there!

79
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,520
Joong Hyuk! He's here!

80
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
Joong Hyuk!

81
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,040
Darn it!

82
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,070
Darn it.

83
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,710
Hey!

84
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,120
Go after him.

85
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,860
(Prince Motel)

86
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
Myeong Gi.

87
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,670
I'm really curious.

88
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,200
Why are guys like you such fast runners?

89
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,940
Piss off!

90
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,720
Stay still.

91
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,860
Come on, now.

92
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,589
You've resisted enough.

93
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,830
Put that down.

94
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,600
Or you'll regret it.

95
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,770
Don't move.

96
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,030
Na Myeong Gi.

97
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,700
You are...

98
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,369
arrested without a warrant for stalking and attempted murder...

99
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,370
of Lee Yun A.

100
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,770
You can hire an attorney...

101
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,570
and ask for a writ of habeas corpus.

102
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,580
Listen, sir.

103
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,220
I've been dying to ask for a while.

104
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,620
Do you have a thing with that wench?

105
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,960
Did she hit on you?

106
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,590
You scumbag.

107
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,460
Die!

108
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,340
Joong Hyuk.

109
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,980
- Enough. Stop it. - Let go.

110
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,279
(Seoul Gangdong Police Station)

111
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,320
Joong Hyuk.

112
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,090
Three broken ribs.

113
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,130
Several teeth are missing.

114
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,229
A total of 21 weeks to recover.

115
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,930
It's clearly an abuse of authority and assault.

116
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,500
You're in real trouble this time.

117
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,270
My apologies.

118
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,440
Is this because of the victim?

119
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,869
Didn't you conduct the initial investigation...

120
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,080
when she reported the stalking?

121
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,110
This is all because you feel guilty, no?

122
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,480
Joong Hyuk.

123
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,420
We can't prevent all that hasn't happened yet.

124
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,190
All we can do is do our best.

125
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,360
There will be an inspection.

126
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,900
Let's wrap this up well.

127
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,180
My apologies for being too late.

128
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,220
No. That's not true.

129
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,020
You've really worked hard.

130
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,420
Thank you so much.

131
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,530
Please tell Yun A the news yourself, Detective.

132
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,200
No. You should do it, ma'am.

133
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,810
Please excuse me.

134
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,880
Thank you.

135
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,950
Thank you.

136
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,730
(Seoul Gangdong Police Station)

137
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,840
Good grief.

138
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,480
Goodness. It seems the one in the wrong has it better.

139
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,620
You have time to work out and stuff.

140
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,249
Gosh, I'd love to do some cyber investigations...

141
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,490
with the heater blasting.

142
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,820
Are you unhappy about it?

143
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,660
No. What I meant was,

144
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,329
I got stabbed in the thigh.

145
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,959
But I'm not granted sick leave because I can walk around.

146
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,630
Isn't that too mean?

147
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,470
You look like you're full of energy.

148
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,570
If you have time to chitchat, run.

149
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,970
While his junior is hurt, the senior is working out.

150
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,710
How heartwarming.

151
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,610
What brings you here, Su Hyeon?

152
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,780
I'm here to see Detective Kim Joong Hyuk.

153
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,150
Not me, but Officer Kim Joong Hyuk?

154
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,889
Su Hyeon. He's no longer a detective...

155
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,560
but an officer of the Investigation Team.

156
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,800
Is there something I can help you with?

157
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,930
Well,

158
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,830
as you've been reassigned,

159
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,839
there's a paper you need to fill out.

160
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,270
(Confirmation Document)

161
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,909
I only need your signature.

162
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,940
Okay.

163
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,880
Really, Su Hyeon?

164
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,910
You could've just called him over to the administrative department.

165
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,809
There wasn't a need to bring the document...

166
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,220
to this stinky gym.

167
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,280
Here you go.

168
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,860
And here.

169
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,960
What's this for?

170
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,160
- Congratulations on your transfer. - Sorry?

171
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,000
Hold on a minute.

172
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,770
What about mine, Su Hyeon?

173
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,470
You should...

174
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,940
Su Hyeon? Wait.

175
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,980
Kim Joong Hyuk?

176
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,680
This place stinks of sweat.

177
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,010
It needs some airing out.

178
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,220
May we talk for a minute?

179
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,360
What's this? Do you know her?

180
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,830
We've met before, right?

181
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,970
We met at the hospital Dong Jin was in.

182
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,310
You're not very observant for a detective.

183
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,750
Just cut to the chase. It's working hours for me.

184
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,520
I know, okay?

185
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,150
And I'm as busy as any detective.

186
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,390
(Heo Eun Shil)

187
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,190
My name is Heo Eun Shil.

188
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,600
Yes, I can read from the card. What brings you here?

189
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,830
You know Lee Dong Jin, right?

190
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,570
He's your friend.

191
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,340
You have endless questions.

192
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,210
Are you always that mean?

193
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,870
You don't have many friends, do you?

194
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,640
Please cut it short.

195
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,850
When was the last time you were in touch with him?

196
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,490
How do you know Dong Jin?

197
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,690
You should answer the question first,

198
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,390
not ask a question back.

199
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,560
About two weeks ago.

200
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,060
"Two weeks ago?"

201
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,230
Did you not text or call since?

202
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,030
No.

203
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,870
Were you the one who dared to stab a detective?

204
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,180
Look at this punk.

205
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,249
What about Hyun Woo?

206
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,050
He's at the hospital. I checked that he was fine.

207
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,550
Got it. Great work.

208
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,149
- Here. Take him away. - Come here.

209
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,450
I'll go park the car first.

210
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,469
(Message)

211
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,710
(Lee Dong Jin: I'm going to her.)

212
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,880
(Lee Dong Jin)

213
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,960
It's been two weeks since you heard from him.

214
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,830
Are you guys really friends?

215
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,530
We don't have to call each other every day to be friends.

216
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,970
Anyway,

217
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,130
you didn't call him again since that night, correct?

218
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,770
You have no idea where he is or what he's up to now.

219
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,910
I guess you could say that.

220
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,940
Mr. Kim.

221
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,980
Can't you see what's going on?

222
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,350
Mr. Lee Dong Jin is missing.

223
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,219
What do you mean?

224
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,249
Your friend could be in danger right now.

225
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,450
No. Worse yet,

226
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,089
he might even be dead.

227
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,860
I'm talking about your dear friend, Lee Dong Jin.

228
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,070
His phone can still receive calls.

229
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,540
If he had indeed gone missing, his phone would've been turned off.

230
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,810
He probably can't answer his phone because he's busy with work.

231
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,149
When he's focused on something,

232
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,080
he won't even notice flames next to him.

233
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,050
Fine. Think what you want.

234
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,890
I thought you were his best friend. But you're clueless.

235
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,030
I truly feel awful for Mr. Lee too.

236
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,780
I can't get anything done or do anything.

237
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,110
Joong Hyuk.

238
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,850
Hey. Why are you eating alone? That's no fun.

239
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,390
Kim Joong Hyuk. That's your name, right?

240
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,690
Hey. Why are you eating alone? That's no fun.

241
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,930
Do you not remember me?

242
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,769
I'm also a statistics major.

243
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,070
We both take Professor Hwang's introduction to statistics.

244
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,040
Hi. My name is Lee Dong Jin.

245
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,119
You should inform his family...

246
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,550
and have them file for a missing person's report.

247
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,620
We need a warrant to track his phone for location...

248
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,250
and look into his whereabouts.

249
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,290
He has no family left.

250
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,330
His mother passed away a few years ago.

251
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,900
He's got no one.

252
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,870
Let's talk later. Could you look into this a bit more?

253
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Okay.

254
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:14,430
Joong Hyuk, where are you going?

255
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,130
- Please go ahead. - Thanks.

256
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,500
The address we have on file for him is his old one too.

257
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,840
The one in Yangjae-dong.

258
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,510
Is that so?

259
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,140
Did you two fight?

260
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,180
It's been over five months since he left the company.

261
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,950
But you didn't know?

262
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
I...

263
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,160
used my work as an excuse and haven't been around.

264
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,320
I was really shocked when he left too.

265
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,430
He had never been that impulsive.

266
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,230
But he said there was something he had to do.

267
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,230
There's something I must do.

268
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,800
I think I'm going to regret it if I miss this opportunity.

269
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,000
He said he couldn't delay it any longer.

270
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,640
He couldn't delay it any longer?

271
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,940
I don't know what he was planning to do...

272
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,540
because he didn't tell me.

273
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,750
Oh, right.

274
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,389
After he left, he asked me to send over...

275
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,790
the rest of his things via courier.

276
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,720
What? Via courier?

277
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,460
(Cheonho-ro 29-gil)

278
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,100
Seriously.

279
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,699
I don't know if I should let you go in...

280
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,270
without the tenant's permission.

281
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,399
- Have you been well? - Hello.

282
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,440
Hello.

283
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,940
I can't solely be responsible for this if this goes wrong.

284
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,540
I'll take responsibility.

285
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,540
Don't worry.

286
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,060
Wait. You said he might have gone missing.

287
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,830
What if we open the door...

288
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,960
and see a dead body?

289
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,329
He was adamant about renting this particular room.

290
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,370
I thought it was odd.

291
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,700
That won't happen.

292
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,110
But still. Just in case...

293
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,370
Wait. My gosh.

294
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,410
Oh, no.

295
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,670
My gosh. He cleaned up the place well.

296
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,070
Did he die on the hill, not in this house?

297
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,380
Wait. What did you say earlier?

298
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
What?

299
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,950
Oh, I wondered if he died on the hill, if not in this house.

300
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,789
You know, you see that a lot on the news.

301
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,520
No. Not that.

302
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,459
You said Dong Jin insisted that he had to rent...

303
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,730
this particular unit, correct?

304
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,860
Yes. He did.

305
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,499
He wanted to switch the units,

306
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,600
so he pestered the part-timer quite excessively.

307
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,330
The part-timer?

308
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,370
It was very strange.

309
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,540
He begged me to switch the units.

310
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,380
At first, I thought he was a crazy pervert.

311
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,280
Was there a specific reason he had to rent Unit 602?

312
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,750
I don't know.

313
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,820
It seemed he was pretty much holed up in his room all day.

314
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,960
Except for the day when he worked at the supermarket once a week.

315
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,830
So Dong Jin delivered groceries only on Tuesday, correct?

316
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Yes.

317
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,370
That's why I naturally thought he had some reason for it.

318
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,500
But he couldn't work for a long time anyway.

319
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,010
He seemed like a gentle guy.

320
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,810
But he got into so many fights.

321
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,279
There were always new injuries every week.

322
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,080
He kept showing up with more injuries.

323
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,980
Then he called us to say that he was hospitalized.

324
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,990
He said he was hurt pretty badly, so he couldn't work for us anymore.

325
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,599
- You're still here. - Yes, sir.

326
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,700
Could you think of anywhere he might have gone?

327
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm not sure.

328
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,140
Dong Jin was a rare one, especially in this day and age.

329
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,140
People these days try to turn their skills into money.

330
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,410
But he used his skills to save a man.

331
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
When was the last time you talked to him?

332
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,320
We didn't keep in touch or anything.

333
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,490
Don't worry too much.

334
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,060
He seemed capable of saving people's lives.

335
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,690
He wouldn't give up on his life.

336
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,360
Yes. You do have a point, but...

337
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,830
Oh, right.

338
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,200
When you reach him,

339
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,270
please thank him for me.

340
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,940
Thanks to him, I can rest up quite well even in my car now.

341
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,710
Pardon?

342
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,180
Dong Jin was the one who introduced me to Mr. Lee here.

343
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,989
Let's see.

344
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,290
(Resume, Lee Joong Ho)

345
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,490
I will.

346
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,690
- All right then. Take care. - Thank you.

347
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,709
Lee Dong Jin.

348
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,970
Why did you leave me this riddle?

349
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,429
(Music)

350
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,660
(This folder is empty.)

351
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,400
I found only statistics-related programs installed on his computer.

352
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,900
I didn't find anything else on it.

353
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,920
("Thinking in a Strange Place")

354
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,240

355
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,150
("Thinking in a Strange Place")

356
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,420
("The Journey of Being")

357
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,650
Hello.

358
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,649
Hello? Mr. Lee.

359
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,019
Why haven't you been answering your phone?

360
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,820
Gosh, you had me worried sick!

361
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,389
- Well... - I even had to go...

362
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,029
and visit your cop friend, Kim Joong Hyuk.

363
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,830
The scary one with a bad personality.

364
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,200
Hello? Mr. Lee. Are you there?

365
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,799
This is Kim Joong Hyuk.

366
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,240
Right. That guy, Kim Joong Hyuk...

367
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,010
I see.

368
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,780
This is Detective Kim Joong Hyuk?

369
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,380
Yes.

370
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,480
Dong Jin left his phone in his house.

371
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,350
What about Mr. Lee?

372
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,650
I haven't found him yet.

373
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,120
Ms. Heo Eun Shil.

374
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,190
I need you to explain this in person.

375
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,259
What? Explain what?

376
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,390
I'm a bit busy.

377
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,180
I'm sorry I made you come all this way.

378
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,450
What's this about?

379
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,160
("A Loved Child Stands Strong")

380
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,690
What's this?

381
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,760
It was on Dong Jin's bookshelf.

382
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,230
Pardon?

383
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,430
What's your point?

384
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,370
Men can read parenting books too.

385
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,440
Before Dong Jin left, he left clues on the bookshelf.

386
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,910
Bookshelves are bound to give away the readers' preferences.

387
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,650
But I couldn't find any preferences on Dong Jin's bookshelf.

388
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,180
A parenting book, a romance novel,

389
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,420
and a trite self-development book that might not even be so popular.

390
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,890
It was odd...

391
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,920
because the Dong Jin I knew never read such books.

392
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,300
It was so suspicious because the books had nothing in common.

393
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,230
So small details found in all of these books caught my eye.

394
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,440
The books were written in English and needed to be translated.

395
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,909
(Translator Park Mi Jung)

396
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,140
Is it a coincidence?

397
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,979
They were all translated by the same person.

398
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,050
("The Comfort of Travel," translated by Park Mi Jung)

399
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,510

400
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,220

401
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,390
(Translated by Park Mi Jung)

402
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,690
And I don't know if this is another coincidence.

403
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,760
The translator worked on a travel documentary.

404
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,700
It's the program you're in charge of.

405
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,670
Let me start from the beginning and ask you again.

406
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,130
Ms. Heo.

407
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,770
How do you know Dong Jin?

408
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,010
Mr. Kim.

409
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,540
You finally sound like a detective.

410
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,180
What?

411
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,910
Right.

412
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,950
To tell you how I met Mr. Lee,

413
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,320
I need to tell you about the translator, Park Mi Jung.

414
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,529
But I just don't know where to start.

415
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,960
Who on earth is this Park Mi Jung?

416
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,400
Mr. Kim.

417
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,400
Do you believe witches exist in our world?

418
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,110
Joong Hyuk.

419
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,480
Do you think there's a witch?

420
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,780
Witches?

421
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,990
(Lee Dong Jin: I'm going to her.)

422
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,960
Gosh, that rude jerk.

423
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,930
Mr. Kim.

424
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,770
You can't leave like that.

425
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,500
I really had no choice.

426
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,509
I thought Mr. Lee could find a way for Mi Jung.

427
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,970
Whatever the reason was,

428
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,679
you went along when you knew Dong Jin would be in danger.

429
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,380
You don't have to rub it in. I've been regretting it.

430
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,510
I'll find Dong Jin from here on out.

431
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,950
Mr. Kim.

432
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,690
I know why Mr. Lee is living in that unit.

433
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,840
I had a feeling this might be the case.

434
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,780
But it's even more peculiar than I thought.

435
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,420
This is typical of Mr. Lee.

436
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,920
How thoroughly he organized his stuff.

437
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,550
- He didn't organize them. - Pardon?

438
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,590
He placed them.

439
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,120
Place them?

440
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,560
Dong Jin...

441
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,030
probably expected me to find this unit.

442
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,860
He set this up for me to see.

443
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,100
But...

444
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,470
the only clue Dong Jin left for me...

445
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,310
is Park Mi Jung.

446
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,980
The rooftop house over there is where Mi Jung lives.

447
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,710
This window is thicker than a regular glass window.

448
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,710
It's the glass found in interview rooms at police stations.

449
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,150
We also call it the one-way mirror.

450
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,610
She wouldn't be able to see him...

451
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,820
unless the light in the room was bright.

452
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,500

453
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,880

00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,820

467
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,210
It was posted at 7:23pm.

468
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,310
(I'm going to her.)

469
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,180
That's around the same time Dong Jin texted me.

It appears to me...

481
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,730
Dong Jin started this blog to leave a record.

482
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,730
Then...

483

(The password that you've entered is incorrect.)

489
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,070

499
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,340
Did he perhaps give up and vanish...

501
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,280

548
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,310
Dong Jin's student ID number.

549
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,320
(Every discovery differs only in how close it is to the result.)

550
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,659
(They're all coincidences.)

551
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,129
(Previous)

552
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:01,359
(There are some strange people in the world.)

553
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,559
(Being in the same space with her is dangerous.)

554
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,859
(Her daily routine starts around noon.)

555
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,499
(Every Tuesday, a person from a store delivers essentials to her.)

556
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,799
(Late night when all the stores are closed)

557
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,200
(I tested it over a few days.)

558
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,880
(Wallpaper and Linoleum)

559
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,410
This crazy guy.

560
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,280
How many times did he try?

561
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,520
Do you believe his claim...

562
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:02,020
that Mi Jung is a witch?

563
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,460
He showed it himself.

564
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,930
I didn't want to believe it. But this...

565
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,330
isn't about whether I believe it or not.

566
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:17,740
I just hope...

567
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:21,810
Mi Jung can live well.

568
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,380
This isn't going to work.

569
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,480
I should ask her myself.

570
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,450
Are you going to ask her yourself?

571
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,980
His last message was "I'm going to her."

572
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,750
Then I should ask her over there.

573
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,690
I should ask how his end was.

574
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,960
No, you can't.

575
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,190
Why not?

576
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,930
Do you know why she lives on the rooftop like that?

577
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,570
She's isolated herself from the world.

578
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,170
Because people get hurt because of her.

579
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:55,940
If she finds out that something happened to Dong Jin because of her,

580
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:00,080
she might hide somewhere for real now.

581
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,390
Hyun Woo, this is me.

582
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,160
Let's report him missing.

583
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,829
And please look into the recent unidentified body...

584
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,470
of a male believed to be in his 20s or 30s.

585
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,170
Yes.

586
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,460
(Alarm)

587
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,660
An alarm set at 2:30am?

588
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,600
Why did you come alone today?

589
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,440
You should come with your friends. Why did you come alone?

590
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:15,580
Did something happen?

591
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:22,050
(2:48 am)

592
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:24,590
Ten minutes.

593
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,330
Ten meters.

594
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,400
A person at this hour?

595
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:50,880
What is it?

596
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,140
Oh, my gosh.

597
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,940
What?

598
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,470
Where did he go now?

599
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:44,500
"Data on Accidents and Incidents Related to Kim Joong Hyuk?"

600
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,410
(2:57am)

601
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,110
Only nine minutes have passed.

602
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,780
I'll get going now.

603
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:04,390
Ms. Park Mi Jung.

604
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:10,260
Can we talk for a moment?

605
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,330
Who are you?

606
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,670
You don't have to worry.

607
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:19,770
I'm Detective Kim Joong Hyuk from Gangdong Police Station.

608
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:22,970
Detective Kim Joong Hyuk?

609
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,610
Why did you come?

610
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,610
And ten sentences.

611
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,080
I'd like to talk with you for a moment.

612
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,520
About what?

613
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,420
There's something to verify.

614
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,760
- "Verify?" - You can just...

615
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,900
talk about anything.

616
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,300
I don't understand at all.

617
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,470
You came out of nowhere and asked me to talk.

618
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,440
I'm not a bad person.

619
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,840
Please exchange...

620
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,080
a few more words with me.

621
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,060
That stray cat must be pregnant.

622
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:20,930
Sorry?

623
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,840
Pregnant cats...

624
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,110
don't usually approach people.

625
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:41,990
That's not true.

626
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,720
Pregnant cats are friendly to people.

627
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,860
They tend to approach people first...

628
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,200
because they need someone to take care of them.

629
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,330
I think it's their instinct...

630
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,770
to survive.

631
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,010
She's not a thief cat.

632
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:03,410
She just lives on the street.

633
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,480
She didn't steal anything.

634
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,080
You're right.

635
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,380
She's a stray cat. My apologies.

636
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,260
I'll get going then.

637
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,360
Excuse me. Wait.

638
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,370
There was something to check.

639
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:34,910
Check what?

640
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,380
I'm done now.

641
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,380
And...

642
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,650
I do believe it.

643
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:47,190
Pardon?

644
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:49,990
That people will die...

645
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,960
when they get close to you.

646
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,630
I know that better than anyone...

647
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,800
what it means.

648
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,410
(Data on Accidents and Incidents Related to Kim Joong Hyuk)

649
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,049

(Slip on stairs, traffic accident, slip, fall on icy road)

00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:28,889
"Spinal fracture, severe injury."

655
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,759
(Thunderbolt, slip on stairs, slip, respiratory distress disorder)

656
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,829
"Park Sung Mi, electric shock."

657
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,569
(Park Sung Mi, electric shock)

658
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:37,270
(The victim of the case Joong Hyuk is investigating)

659
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,880
"Lee Yun A."

660
00:56:47,881 --> 00:56:50,049
"The victim of the case Joong Hyuk is investigating."

661
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,119
(A stalker broke into her house.)

662
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,549
"They seem to be more than..."

663
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,290
"just a detective and a victim relationship."

664
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,190
"I hope nothing happens to both Joong Hyuk and the victim."

665
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,589
(Joong Hyuk received a call and rushed to the scene.)

666
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,129
(The stalker attacked Yun A with a weapon.)

667
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,529
(Fortunately, her life is not in danger,)

668
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:05,029
(but it's difficult for her to regain consciousness.)

669
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,399
(What would've happened if he had been more courageous?)

670
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,730
(But it's already in the past.)

671
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:23,080
"I hope Yun A is safe and recovers without any issues."

672
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:27,080
"I also hope Joong Hyuk doesn't blame himself too much."

673
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,319
"That's why it breaks my heart."

674
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:35,460
(Yun A has been hospitalized for two months now.)

675
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,389
(3:42am)

676
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:08,960
I broke all the rules.

677
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,840
But there's a precondition.

678
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,640
It happens only to those who love her.

679
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:26,580
Dong Jin's hypothesis...

680
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,350
was perfect, including the precondition.

681
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,980
Mr. Kim Joong Hyuk!

682
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,570
Mr. Kim.

683
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:26,470
Yes.

684
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,910
I get it now.

685
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,510
I know the reason why Mr. Lee left clues for you, Mr. Kim.

686
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:41,990
You know it too, right?

687
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,530
Please answer me.

688
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,960
I'm Dong Jin's friend.

689
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,870
It's something he couldn't give to you...

690
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,800
ten years ago.

691
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:07,300
How much longer must we meet from such a distance?

692
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,980
How much longer must we only share a few words like this?

693
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,079
(Verification)

694
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,620
(Decision Tree Analysis)

695
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,520
"They can't be linked..."

696
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,790
"to any specific individual."

697
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,030
Get off at the next stop.

698
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:32,700
Get off immediately no matter what happens.

699
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,070
What?

700
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:35,970
What are you talking about?

701
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:37,500
Don't go too far.

702
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,370
I'm coming. I'll come and pick you up.

703
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:42,410
When did you find out...

704
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,040
that Dong Jin had gone far away?
