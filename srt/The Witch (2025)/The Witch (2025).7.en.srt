188
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,970
Thank you for waiting.

189
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,909
I didn't wait at all. You came fast.

190
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,009
Well...

191
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,980
My signature?

192
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,750
Oh, right.

193
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,759
Since it's heavy,

194
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,659
I'll carry it inside for you.

195
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:51,789
Pardon me.

196
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,710
You didn't have to.

197
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,679
Please check if your order is right.

198
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,250
It must be right.

199
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,120
After all, you've never made a mistake.

200
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,389
If any item is missing, I'll get scolded by Big Boss.

201
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,820
"Big Boss?"

202
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:25,830
Yes.

203
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,759
Oh, you mean the elderly woman?

204
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,870
Kimchi, 1 set of 5 ramyeon,

205
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,379
eggs, five curries,

206
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,009
bread, a bag of onions,

207
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:48,179
strawberry jam,

208
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,549
and three wet wipes.

209
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,820
All items are in here. Or are any missing?

210
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,820
No. I don't think so.

211
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:01,500
The total is 57.90 dollars.

212
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,740
I received 60 dollars.

213
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,849
Here's your change of 2.10 dollars.

214
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,720
Oh, right.

215
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,859
Sorry.

216
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,029
Right here.

217
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:56,720
Thank you.

218
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
What?

219
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,049
Right.

220
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:01,859
Now then...

221
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,220
Take care.

222
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,529
Bye.

223
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:17,599
Excuse me.

224
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,380
Thank you for checking it thoroughly.

225
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,809
Sorry?

226
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,680
Thank you.

227
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,190
Drive safely.

228
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:55,910
That was 8 minutes and 22 seconds.

229
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:57,940
I didn't go over ten minutes.

230
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,059
In the days that followed, nothing happened to me.

231
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,230
(Hyomyung Mart)

232
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,258
I timed myself when I was within her space.

233
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,490
(Stop, Lap)

234
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:03,180

235
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,819

236
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,048
(Stop, Lap)

237
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,319
(Stop, Lap)

238
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:19,390
I tested it out for a few days.

239
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,299
Ten minutes was fine.

240
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,630
(Start, Reset)

241
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,960
Then this time around, I'll stay for over ten minutes.

242
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:06,509
(Brazilian Waxing, Bikini Waxing, 30 percent off for off-season)

243
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,750
(Stop, Lap)

244
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,529
(Stop, Lap)

245
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,278
I've registered you for the appointment.

246
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,809
- Please take a seat and wait. - Okay.

247
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,279
This must hurt a lot.

248
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,420
So you fell down the stairs?

249
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,130
Yes.

250
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:40,559
Did you hurt your head?

251
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:43,359
I'm fine. I was wearing a helmet.

252
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,730
I see. I guess you work as a delivery guy.

253
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Yes.

254
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:49,839
I had a feeling...

255
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,369
I might be in an accident today.

256
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,548
(1. Being within a 10m radius of her is dangerous.)

257
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:01,579
It's ten minutes.

258
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:04,579
It's fine as long as it doesn't go over ten minutes.

259
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,059
Being within a 10m radius of her...

260
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,959
for over ten minutes...

261
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,489
(Being within a 10m radius of her for over 10 minutes...)

262
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,528
is dangerous

263
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:16,798
(1. Being within a 10m radius of her for over 10 minutes is dangerous.)

264
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,799
Hypothesis confirmed.

265
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,230
(1. Being within a 10m radius of her for over 10 minutes is dangerous.)

266
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,839
I'm from Hyomyung Mart.

267
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,380
I apologize again for the inconvenience.

268
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:39,019
It's especially heavy today, right?

269
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,720
I ran out of rice.

270
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,660
There's no elevator, and I live on the top floor.

271
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:45,759
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

272
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,700
I thought about ordering a lot in one go.

273
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,470
But I was worried that the box would be much heavier.

274
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,028
Yes, that's right. That's what I want.

275
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:56,339
Order as often as you wish.

276
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Pardon?

277
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,670
Well,

278
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,039
I don't mind making frequent trips.

279
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,979
So it's great if you can order more frequently in small quantities.

280
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,509
That's better than carrying heavy boxes.

281
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
I see.

282
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,349
Let me go over the items.

283
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,660
You don't need to go over every single item in there.

284
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:18,319
- No. - Pardon?

285
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,258
There have been mistakes in our delivery.

286
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:21,900
My boss made it very clear I had to go over them.

287
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,058
I'll compare the items to the order list.

288
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,200
Could you check if I brought everything?

289
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Okay.

290
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,309
Firstly, there should be a 5kg bag of rice.

291
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,880
A 5kg bag of rice.

292
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,380
A box of cereal.

293
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,289
A box of cereal.

294
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:48,519
A bundle of five-bag ramyeon.

295
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,018
A bundle of ramyeon.

296
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:53,890
I don't know how long it's been since I talked to...

297
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,130
anyone like this.

298
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,359
And...

299
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:07,670
Two cucumbers.

300
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:09,380
Two cucumbers.

301
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,809
Three cans of tuna.

302
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,549
Three cans of tuna.

303
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,849
And 2 1.5L bottles of water.

304
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:16,650
Two bottles of water.

305
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,450
One bag of perilla leaves.

306
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,049
One bag of perilla leaves.

307
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,589
- One packet of pickled radishes. - One packet of pickled radishes.

308
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:26,559
One bag of sugar.

309
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,559
One bag of sugar.

310
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,500
It seems we finished...

311
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,869
checking the items.

312
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,710
It seems that way. We finished.

313
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,579
The total is 72.5 dollars.

314
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,019
Here.

315
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:59,190
Are you paying with a card?

316
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:01,889
Yes.

317
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,659
When I placed the order on the phone earlier,

318
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,500
I told them I wanted to pay with a card today.

319
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,140
I didn't bring the card reader.

320
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:14,409
I'll hurry and bring it back.

321
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,609
No. Don't do that. That will be a hassle.

322
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,079
Please wait.

323
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,410
No.

324
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,609
I can come back.

325
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:37,230
(Captain Delivery)

326
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,559
Come on...

327
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:16,869
I found some cash at home.

328
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,970
Okay. Thank you. Have a good day.

329
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,240
Bye.

(Start, Reset)

333
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:49,599
I wasn't late.

334
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,079
Darn it. You startled me.

335
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,690
You can't just pop out from a small alley like this.

336
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,960
I didn't see you there. I'm sorry.

337
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:15,359
Are you here for a delivery?

338
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,059
Yes. I deliver groceries.

339
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,140
I'm sorry I lashed out at you when we worked in the same industry.

340
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
It's fine.

341
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,538
This building doesn't have an elevator.

342
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:26,769
It's awful, isn't it?

343
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:29,809
Yes.

344
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,980
They ought to double our fee for buildings like this.

345
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,710
Right?

346
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,480
Yes.

347
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:38,150
Maybe, I shouldn't accept their orders next time.

348
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:58,200
(Wallpaper and Linoleum)

349
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:05,509
(Wallpaper and Linoleum)

350
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,819
I wasn't within a 10m radius of her for more than 10 minutes.

351
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,690
But what has gone wrong?

352
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,529
Space, time, and...

353
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,930
Was it the conversation?

354
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,069
Is there a limit on conversations too?

355
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,969
(I quickly left the building. By then, it had been...)

356
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,799
(9 minutes and 41 seconds. I didn't go over ten minutes.)

357
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,210
Is it the number of exchanges?

358
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:36,240
Then what's the maximum number of exchanges?

359
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,589
Why are you overworking your body?

360
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,950
You have injuries all over your body.

361
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,190
I'm sorry.

362
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,329
Why would you apologize to me?

363
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,460
You should apologize to yourself.

364
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,029
All right. Let me take a look.

365
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,539
Okay.

366
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,339
Does it hurt?

367
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,909
That's bearable.

368
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,980
- This is bearable? - Yes.

369
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,019
Then how about this?

370
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,170
You ordered groceries, right?

371
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:15,240
Okay. I'll place the box here.

372
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:17,180
My gosh.

373
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,279
All right then.

374
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,319
Gosh, how could a building not have an elevator?

375
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,059
Gosh, my back. Oh, my knees.

376
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,359
Good grief. This is killing me.

377
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:32,089
Oh, my.

378
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:04,819
A bundle of ramyeon.

379
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,029
Pork, 300g.

380
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,660
A bottle of sesame oil.

381
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,529
A pack of minced garlic.

382
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,440
A bottle of dish soap.

383
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,380
A bag of potatoes.

384
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,750
Two boxes of tissues.

385
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,319
A bottle of cooking oil.

386
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:35,690
A bag of seasoned salt.

387
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,730
I told you not to touch it.

388
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,730
You can just look at it.

389
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,799
I want an expensive one this time.

390
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:54,470
I see.

391
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,109
Once you start buying helmets, you want to buy another.

392
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:02,048
It will be sturdy and worth my money, right?

393
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:03,079
You bet.

394
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,678
As for this helmet,

395
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,789
how well did it do on the shock performance test?

396
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,590
This one right here. What's that?

397
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,099
That's for motorcyclists. It's a protector.

398
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,260
- Do you want to take a look? - Yes.

399
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,359
We're slow today.

400
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,960
Do you want to go home early and rest?

401
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,030
What?

402
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,300
No. Not yet.

403
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,699
I'm worried about your hand.

404
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,670
Oh, this? This doesn't hurt at all.

405
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:31,900
As for this, my orthopaedist...

406
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:34,269
is the worrying type. So he went a bit overboard.

407
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:36,880
My gosh, this is nothing. I can work without a problem.

408
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,510
My goodness.

409
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:42,719
I guess you were worried about me.

410
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:44,880
Yes.

411
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,500
- Ma'am. - Yes.

412
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:08,210
As for fresh food, it's better to place them at eye level.

413
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,239
And keep the temperature of the refrigerator at 7°C.

414
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,179
What do you mean?

415
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,549
Even if you have to wear long sleeves at the supermarket,

416
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,420
you should lower the overall temperature.

417
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,849
A study suggests that for every degree...

418
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,018
the temperature drops in a supermarket,

419
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:24,860
the number of customers increases by four percent.

420
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:28,590
That can really increase our sales?

421
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,300
It'll be helpful to decide on a few key products to focus on.

422
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,369
Analysing our main customer demographics...

423
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,730
such as age group and gender will make the approach easier.

424
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:39,440
How do you know all that?

425
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,340
Actually,

426
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,079
I used to work as a business strategy consultant...

427
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,480
at the headquarters of Plus Mart across the street.

428
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,420
What?

429
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,320
I'm sorry.

430
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:59,018
- Stop it. - No.

431
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:01,559
- I'm fine. I really am. - My gosh, stop it.

432
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,699
So that's it? Is there more?

433
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,329
- I'm really fine. - My gosh.

434
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,170
Give me a consultation then.

435
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:15,809
All right then.

436
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,510
Most of our customers live alone, rather than with their families.

437
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,679
What do you think about selling fresh produce in small portions?

438
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:26,190
- Fresh produce in small portions? - Yes.

439
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,889
And there was a survey conducted...

440
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:30,320
by the Korea Consumer Agency in 2022.

441
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,159
It showed that 71 percent of Zoomers felt uncomfortable...

442
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,928
with excessive hospitality from salespeople.

443
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:40,500
In the end, it resulted in not making a purchase.

444
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,670
What? They feel uncomfortable by hospitality?

445
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,010
Yes. It means they won't come back...

446
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,380
if you're too friendly.

447
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,510
What?

448
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,409
Come back with your husband next time. Okay?

449
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,448
Instead of remembering or mentioning...

450
00:37:58,449 --> 00:37:59,820
your regular customers' private lives,

451
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,650
you should analyse their receipts.

452
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,260
Remembering the items they often buy will be more helpful.

453
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,428
Recommending products based on that analysis...

454
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:08,989
would be even better.

455
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,429
My goodness. I had no idea.

456
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,900
I was so nosy for no good reason then.

457
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,500
Dong Jin. So this is what you used to do?

458
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:21,369
This is so cool.

459
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:22,679
It really is.

460
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,239
My goodness.

461
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,920
Hello.

462
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:56,210
Are you the one who delivered my groceries before?

463
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:58,440
One exchange.

464
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,480
Yes, I am.

465
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,170
I'll go over the order list.

466
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,510
There's a small tray of eggs.

467
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:35,849
Two exchanges.

468
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,820
The fried tofu rice ball set.

469
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,820
The fried tofu rice ball set.

470
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,190
Three exchanges.

471
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,360
A bunch of green grapes.

472
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,389
A bunch of green grapes.

473
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:46,889
Four exchanges.

474
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,059
Ten small soy milk boxes.

475
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:50,328
Ten small soy milk boxes.

476
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:51,429
Five exchanges.

477
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,000
- And a box of minced garlic. - A box...

478
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,050
A box of minced garlic.

479
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,150
Six exchanges.

480
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:13,190
Two packets of bok choy. That's it.

481
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,050
Two packets of bok choy. That's it.

482
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:17,519
Seven exchanges.

483
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:27,170
And it's been six minutes.

484
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,070
The total is 45.1 dollars.

485
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,379
You must sign it here.

486
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,750
Oh, I asked the owner about it.

487
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,079
I was told I didn't have to sign it from now on.

488
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,618
Eight exchanges.

489
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:47,650
Pardon?

490
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,090
I see. Is that so? Okay.

491
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,559
Here you go.

492
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,199
I'll get going now.

493
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,099
Wait.

494
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:11,210
Did you hurt your hand?

495
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,280
Nine exchanges.

496
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,650
Did you...

497
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,320
hurt your hand after delivering groceries to my house?

498
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:25,960
She's worried as always that she might be the cause of my injury.

499
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:29,599
I wanted to ease her mind.

500
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:32,659
No.

501
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,539
I hurt myself exercising.

502
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,110
That's a relief.

503
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,380
I forgot how many times we exchanged words.

504
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:49,309
But...

505
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:54,619
seeing her relieved face was enough.

506
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,199
(Cheonho-ro 29-gil)

507
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,900
(Wallpaper and Linoleum)

508
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:09,130
(Wallpaper and Linoleum)

509
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,710
(Hyomyung Mart)

510
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,369
Having a conversation that goes beyond ten exchanges...

511
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,069
is dangerous.

512
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:51,939
(2. Having a conversation that goes beyond ten exchanges...)

513
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,049
(is dangerous.)

514
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,348
(2. Having a conversation that goes beyond ten exchanges...)

515
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:59,920
(is dangerous.)

516
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:34,650
You're here.

517
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:38,960
You look awful.

518
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,190
How about the hospital bill? Can you afford it?

519
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,558
I'm thankful to my friend, Hong.

520
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:46,570
What?

521
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,699
I have medical expense insurance thanks to him.

522
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:52,369
You're so chill about it.

523
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:53,809
How can you make a joke at a time like this?

524
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,909
Are you really...

525
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,409
okay?

526
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,619
The hypotheses...

527
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:07,550
have been more specifically verified since then.

528
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:13,129
"Being within a 10m radius of her..."

529
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,158
"for over 10 minutes is dangerous."

530
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:16,559
(1. Being within a 10m radius of her for over 10 minutes is dangerous.)

531
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,529
"Having a conversation that goes beyond ten exchanges..."

532
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,559
"is dangerous."

533
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:21,300
"If she knows your name, it is dangerous."

534
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:23,369
"Confessing your feelings to her is dangerous."

535
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,739
"Breaking all of these rules will result in death."

536
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,809
"The assumptions apply only to those who love her."

537
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:32,210
No matter how much I think about it, you shouldn't do this anymore.

538
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,210
Dong Jin.

539
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:35,980
Please...

540
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,980
stop now.

541
00:44:38,449 --> 00:44:40,889
I wouldn't have started if I was going to stop.

542
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,989
You proved the Rules of Death yourself.

543
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,590
It means you might die.

544
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:47,960
You're right.

545
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,599
But I can survive as long as I don't break the Rules of Death.

546
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:55,599
You don't understand at all.

547
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:58,969
No matter how much I think about it, this isn't right.

548
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,268
Mi Jung might find out what your name is...

549
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:02,710
at any moment.

550
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,610
I hope she doesn't.

551
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,380
That's meaningless.

552
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,808
Risking your life...

553
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:09,609
for someone who doesn't even know your name or existence?

554
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,079
That's insane.

555
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,849
You've been working hard.

556
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:18,420
I want to thank you instead of her.

557
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:21,530
Now, you better focus on recovery...

558
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:24,300
and take a good rest. Okay?

559
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,928
Do you really think there's no other way?

560
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,070
I said there wasn't!

561
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:35,908
Even if you die trying to prove your hypotheses,

562
00:45:35,909 --> 00:45:37,139
don't contact me.

563
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:40,509
I can't contact you if I die.

564
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,550
Are you serious?

565
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,119
How can you joke around at a time like this? You're annoying.

566
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:46,449
Please stop.

567
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,079
She's smiling.

568
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,050
She's leaving for her trip today.

569
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,159
I wanted to go on that trip with her too.

570
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,260
I wanted to see...

571
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,800
what she would see together.

572
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:33,349
The distance between me and her on the bus is about 11m.

573
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,519
It's very close,

574
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:38,789
but it's not bad.

575
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,130
It's not bad.

576
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,429
No, it's good.

577
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:48,730
Because I can travel with her this way...

578
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,440
despite the distance.

579
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:42,940
It's already time to go back.

580
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,880
It felt too short.

581
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,550
I hope there's a traffic jam.

582
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,170
Ma'am.

583
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:53,109
This is the front seat, but you can sit here.

584
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,280
Can I do that?

585
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:56,509
Yes. I'm getting off soon. It's fine.

586
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:57,550
Thank you.

587
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,500
I'm within less than a 5m radius of her.

588
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:23,010
(Stop, Lap)

589
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,010
But it's okay.

590
00:53:27,409 --> 00:53:28,848
I can get off at the next stop.

591
00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:30,079
(Cheonho Station, Pungnap Market)

592
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,219
It's okay.

593
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,788
(5 minutes from Geumchon Intersection to Sannae Intersection)

594
00:53:39,789 --> 00:53:43,928
(Traffic congestion from Cheonho Bridge toward Cheonho Intersection)

595
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,259
(No traffic congestion...)

596
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:48,029
(from Cheonho Bridge toward Gwangjang Intersection)

597
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,030
(12 minutes from Munbal Interchange to Jayuro Junction)

598
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:13,190
The Olympic Highway is congested toward the airport...

599
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,259
and from the south end of Dongho Bridge to Banpo,

600
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,260
with congestion remaining near Sinsa-dong.

601
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:19,499
The Gyeongbu Expressway heading toward Hannam Bridge...

602
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,900
is now clear for the return trip to Seoul.

603
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:25,139
There's congestion on the city route heading toward Seongnam.

604
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,969
It appears to have heavy traffic.

605
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:30,339
There is ongoing congestion...

606
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,239
on the Seohaean Expressway...

607
00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:40,049
Did you see that just now?

608
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,349
Lightning struck over there.

609
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,389
Hey, shall we get off?

610
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:47,690
Hey, it's the safest to stay in a car when lightning strikes.

611
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:53,800
I don't have much time left.

612
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,500
What form and shape will it take this time?

613
00:54:59,139 --> 00:55:00,139
Lightning?

614
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,639
No. Let's calm down for now.

615
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,119
Nothing seems dangerous on the bus.

616
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,618
(Watch Your Hand)

617
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:19,889
(No Boarding at Rear Door)

618
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,210
(Start, Reset)

619
00:56:02,769 --> 00:56:04,940
An accident only follows its target.

620
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,969
Is that so?

621
00:56:07,769 --> 00:56:09,070
(Start, Reset)

622
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:13,808
Let's calm down. The two vehicles are stuck side by side...

623
00:56:13,809 --> 00:56:15,079
simply because both lanes are jammed.

624
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,289
No.

625
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,730
I need to stay 10m away from her right now.

626
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:31,900
I need to get out of here right now.

627
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,570
- Excuse me. - What the heck?

628
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:39,238
Hey, it's dangerous.

629
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:40,639
- Sir. - What's going on?

630
00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:41,969
Please let go of me.

631
00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:43,670
Don't we have to stop him?

632
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:45,079
Hey.

633
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:46,780
I said I was fine. Let go of me!

634
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:48,710
- My goodness. - Oh, no.

635
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,219
He really jumped out the window.

636
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,800
- What? - What's wrong with him?

637
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,170
Is he not hurt?

638
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:11,940
Come down.

639
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:38,230
Lee Dong Jin?

640
00:57:43,369 --> 00:57:44,369
She...

641
00:57:45,869 --> 00:57:47,268
knew my name.

642
00:57:47,269 --> 00:57:49,439
(3. If she knows your name,)

643
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,610
(it is dangerous.)

644
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:05,658
I've been within a 10m radius of her for over 10 minutes,

645
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:06,860
and she knows my name.

646
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:10,760
I broke too many rules at the same time.

647
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,599
But I know the pattern of the accident.

648
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,969
I'm fully prepared.

649
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,710
Lee Dong Jin.

650
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,179
Why are you here?

651
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,260
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, no.

652
00:58:40,261 --> 00:58:42,929
What is he doing?

653
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,230
- It's dangerous. - Don't.

654
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,539
It's dangerous to be near water during a thunderstorm.

655
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,678
But there has never been a recorded instance...

656
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:00,679
of lightning striking the Han River in the middle of winter.

657
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:04,619
It means it's so rare that it's hard to even gather statistics on it.

658
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:23,300
Follow me if you can!

659
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:28,969
I trust statistics.

660
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,789
No.

661
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,260
No, Dong Jin. Don't do that.

662
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,269
Producer Heo Eun Shil?

663
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:04,940
Yes, this is me.

664
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:08,039
Please come to the hospital right now if you can.

665
01:01:09,139 --> 01:01:10,170
Who is it?

666
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:17,550
Lee Dong Jin?

667
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,889
(Lee Dong Jin)

668
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,860
Come to think of it,

669
01:01:26,659 --> 01:01:28,389
I think our eyes met.

670
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,369
I wanted to talk to him even just once...

671
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:40,369
before graduating.

672
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:47,849
Someone was looking this way.

673
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:53,320
It was too far to recognize the person.

674
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,089
(I'm going to her.)

675
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,349
I'm going to her.

676
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,289
Lee Dong Jin.

677
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,190
So it was you.
