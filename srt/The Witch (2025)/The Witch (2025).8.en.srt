(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

7
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,789
- Excuse me. - Hey.

8
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,060
It's dangerous.

9
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:30,569
- What's going on? - Please let go of me.

10
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,700
- Don't we have to stop him? - Hey.

11
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,599
I said I was fine. Let go of me!

12
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,909
He really jumped out the window.

13
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,218
Is he not hurt?

14
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:56,219
Come down.

15
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,379
Lee Dong Jin?

16
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,610
Are there no classes in the third period?

17
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,280
Our homeroom teacher said so earlier.

18
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,709
Yes! It was a math class.

19
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,680
They just gathered and chatted.

20
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,179
No one was genuinely sad.

21
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,250
Let's all have a moment of silence.

22
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,159
(Lee Dong Jin)

23
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,430
At least...

24
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,969
one of them is.

25
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,449
Let's go.

26
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,699
Come to think of it,

27
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,030
I think our eyes met.

28
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,839
Shoot!

29
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,038
- Get it! - Just like that.

30
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,639
Get the ball!

31
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,139
There you go!

32
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,319
It was so far that I couldn't see his face.

33
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:06,650
I think our eyes met at that moment too.

34
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,729
Dong Jin. Try to take a photo with a unique vibe.

35
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,439
- Make it sentimental. - Okay.

36
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,110
Can you guys stand properly? There are only a few frames left.

37
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:35,519
The picnic in fall. It happened at that time too.

38
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,889
It felt like our eyes met.

39
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,360
- He's so bad. - Go!

40
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,028
- Hey! - Hey!

41
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,458
Hey!

42
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,588
- Hey! - Hey!

43
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,958
- Hey! - That was bad.

44
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,028
- Catch it! - Left foot!

45
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:53,729
- Just a little more. - Get it.

46
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,569
- Do it like this! - Darn it.

47
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:00,240
Show us!

48
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,208
- He'll miss. - Block it!

49
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,480
- Hold back! - Hey.

50
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,180
- Kick the ball. - Hey!

51
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,379
Kick the ball.

52
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:08,679
- Look carefully. - You don't have to block it.

53
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,219
- Look at him. - Just kick it right away.

54
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,750
- Be patient. - Just do it!

55
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,949
- Just a little more. - How?

56
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,319
- Shoot! - Look.

57
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,489
Kick it.

58
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,490
Here he goes.

59
00:05:19,491 --> 00:05:20,958
He was always bright...

60
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,930
and laughing with his friends.

61
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,500
Watching him was as entertaining as watching TV.

62
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,269
(Donated by Lee Dong Jin's mother, Oh Mi Sook)

63
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,339
Lee Dong Jin.

64
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,240
It was his name.

65
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,278
Every day, I looked at his name...

66
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,779
while eating lunch.

67
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,589
I wanted to talk to him even just once...

68
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,629
before graduating.

69
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,970
Someone was looking this way.

70
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:12,410
It was too far to recognize the person.

71
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,449
But it didn't feel unfamiliar.

72
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,519
However,

73
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:27,230
that was the last time.

74
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:41,680
Who is it?

75
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,620
Lee Dong Jin?

76
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,189
(Midong High School)

77
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,430
(Midong High School)

78
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,740
So everyone graduated.

79
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,269
(Year 3 Class 3)

80
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,879
(Lee Dong Jin)

81
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:25,249
Lee Dong Jin.

82
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,219
(Lee Dong Jin)

83
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,588
I've never seen his face properly like this.

84
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,389
(Lee Dong Jin)

85
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,189
But he looks familiar.

86
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,740
I saw that face again...

87
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,949
after more than ten years had passed.

88
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,250
Why are you here?

89
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,869
- Don't do that. - It's dangerous.

90
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,930
Stop him.

91
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,789
No.

92
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,259
No, Dong Jin. Don't do that.

93
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,049
It was definitely Lee Dong Jin.

94
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,059
My goodness.

95
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,769
(Episode 8: Lee Dong Jin)

96
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,649
At least, the ambulance arrived quickly.

97
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,519
It's a relief.

98
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,870
- Hello? - Producer Heo Eun Shil?

99
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:06,039
Yes, this is me.

100
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,879
Do you know Lee Dong Jin?

101
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:09,340
Yes. What's the matter?

102
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,379
Something happened to him.

103
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:15,149
Please come to the hospital right now if you can.

115
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,480

(Seun University Medical Center)

117
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
Joong Hyuk.

118
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,669
Did you wake up?

119
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,549
Why did you suddenly dive into the Han River?

120
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,019
Do you enjoy extreme sports or something?

121
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,059
No, I don't.

122
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,759
Then why?

123
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,960
I just wanted to prove the data.

124
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,299
What?

125
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,470
There's something like that. Aren't you busy?

126
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:18,539
Of course, I'm busy.

127
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:20,710
There are constant incidents and accidents happening around here.

128
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,379
You at least should help me out.

129
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:26,080
I got it.

130
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:29,120
I'm fine. You can go now.

131
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,950
Are you sure you're fine?

132
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:33,990
I'm really fine.

133
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,019
Are you really okay?

134
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,759
Hey, I'm totally fine. I'm strong.

135
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,860
What happened?

136
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,429
Are you up?

137
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,799
- Producer Heo. - Goodness gracious!

138
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,480
Who is she?

139
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,279
She's just a producer I know.

140
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,349
I'll take care of the admission paperwork for you,

141
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,419
so get a good rest.

142
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,360
Call me if anything happens.

143
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,889
Thank you.

144
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,269
Who was it?

145
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,539
He's my best friend, Kim Joong Hyuk.

146
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,940
He looks gentle and kind,

147
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,269
but he's actually a detective who catches criminals.

148
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,909
"Gentle and kind?"

149
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,779
I could tell he was a detective at a glance.

150
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,720
Right?

151
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:37,649
People's judgment seems to be pretty much the same.

152
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,549
Do you really want to die?

153
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:44,690
You're not helping Mi Jung at all.

154
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,700
You must be busy. I'm sorry for making you come.

155
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:51,970
But now,

156
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:55,638
I have to ask you a favour...

157
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,939
because of my state.

158
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,070
Don't even.

159
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:00,539
What are you trying to ask me to do this time?

160
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,080
There's the last variable...

161
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,919
I want to check.

162
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,250
A variable?

163
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,350
To verify the variable,

164
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,190
I need to hear it from Mi Jung herself.

165
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,600
Everyone who loved her even a little bit...

166
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,870
was hurt or died.

167
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,100
That's true.

168
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:29,000
Then,

169
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:33,710
what happened to people she loved?

170
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,049
Can you meet her on my behalf?

171
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:42,879
This is my last request.

172
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,220
(Cheonho-ro 29-gil)

173
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,470
Mi Jung, hop in the car!

174
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,539
It's cold. Hurry up and get in.

175
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,419
Why did you come all of a sudden?

176
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,450
Did you perhaps...

177
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,850
quit your job?

178
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,360
No.

179
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,090
Then...

180
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,459
did you break up with a boyfriend you never told me about?

181
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,700
- Hey! - Oh, my gosh.

182
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,230
I don't have a boyfriend.

183
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:36,570
I thought I'd never be able to go to Hallstatt or whatever...

184
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,409
if I kept living like this.

185
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,879
I came out because I was frustrated and sad.

186
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,509
You need to get some fresh air too.

187
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:46,980
In this cold weather?

188
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,980
And I get some fresh air every day.

189
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,450
I can get a lot of fresh air on the rooftop.

190
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,159
So are you going on a trip with me or not?

191
00:16:58,929 --> 00:16:59,960
Let's go.

192
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Shall we go?

193
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:13,440
Here we go.

194
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,069
It's cold.

195
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:23,940
This is nice.

196
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,519
Isn't it great?

197
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,250
Yes.

198
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,660
You can tell me whenever you want to go on a trip.

199
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,569
(Lee Dong Jin)

200
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,609
- Aren't you busy these days? - Hey.

201
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,669
I'm so busy.

202
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,308
I always stay up all night to edit videos.

203
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:56,509
I can't even date anyone.

204
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,749
So don't take a bus and wander around by yourself.

205
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,720
If you want to go on a trip, just tell me.

206
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:05,789
I want to get some fresh air, using you as an excuse.

207
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,660
Eun Shil.

208
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:15,359
Are you upset with me?

209
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,930
What?

210
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,529
No.

211
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,839
Have you done something wrong to me then?

212
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,069
Me? To you?

213
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,109
There's nothing like that.

214
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,750
Watering the plants,

215
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,119
looking at the sky on the rooftop,

216
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,390
taking a bus trip from time to time,

217
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:43,619
and taking a walk to feed the cats late at night.

218
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,730
It's not bad.

219
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:53,200
Something being "not bad" is different from it being "good."

220
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,500
You should try to do good things in life.

221
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,710
How can only good things happen?

222
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:04,210
The twists and turns in your life make you stronger.

223
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:08,180
I'm really fine.

224
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:10,819
So don't worry.

225
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,019
Mi Jung.

226
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:20,589
I know many men liked you.

227
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,200
But was there anyone...

228
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,970
you liked?

229
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:28,869
That's so random.

230
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:30,599
Tell me.

231
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,609
Please. I'm curious.

232
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,279
There was someone.

233
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:43,880
Oh, my. Really?

234
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,049
I had only one crush growing up.

235
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,490
But that was a long time ago.

236
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,599
I don't even know if I can call it first love.

237
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,299
He was an older guy from my church.

238
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,240
What? An older guy from church?

239
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,309
My gosh. That sounds like a cliché story.

240
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:30,960
- His love is blossoming - His love is blossoming

241
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:34,929
- His generosity embraces me - His generosity embraces me

242
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,099
Was he handsome?

243
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:42,740
I had known him ever since I was a child.

244
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,008
I don't care about that. So was he handsome?

245
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:50,519
- He brings comfort to my heart - He brings comfort to my heart

246
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,390
I just thought that he had...

247
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,519
a nice smile.

248
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:00,828
The truth is, I went to church every week to see him.

249
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:04,359
- He always touches our heart - He always touches our heart

250
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:11,339
- Our Father is there for us - Our Father is there for us

251
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:17,440
- In happiness and pain - In happiness and pain

252
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:20,710
You've been experiencing fewer seizures lately, right?

253
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,579
Yes. It improved quite a lot.

254
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,980
Even so, you must take the medicine regularly.

255
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:28,519
Take one more tablet of this if the seizures continue.

256
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,759
Okay.

257
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,390
I explained to your mother about the additional prescription.

258
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:36,730
Okay. Thank you.

259
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:38,529
Bye.

260
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,170
Mi Jung.

261
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:47,740
Hello.

262
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,210
What brings you to the pharmacy?

263
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:55,420
My dad's teeth have been acting up, so I'm here to buy some medicine.

264
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:00,650
I see.

265
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:03,119
I'll see you around.

266
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,559
That's when...

267
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,900
I found out that he had epilepsy.

268
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:16,700
- Ma'am. - Yes.

269
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,509
Time continued to pass when I hadn't had...

270
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,279
a proper conversation with him.

271
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,989
(Congratulations on your acceptance to Hanguk University!)

272
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,019
(Year 3, Im Ik Jong)

273
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:43,559
I thought I wouldn't be able to see him often...

274
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,630
once he went to Seoul.

275
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,210
But...

276
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:02,779
Mi Jung.

277
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:06,119
He approached me first once again.

278
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:07,890
Can we talk for a moment?

279
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,328
I wrote this. It'll be useful.

280
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:14,359
(English Key Points)

281
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,129
Take it. This is nothing.

282
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,230
Just take a look.

283
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,930
It'd be nice if we could go to the same university later.

284
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,609
Ik Jong.

285
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,509
Hey.

286
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,619
Then he had an incident...

287
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:40,319
just like all the others...

288
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:42,589
who had approached me.

289
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:04,078
I was worried,

290
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,950
so I went to his house with the medicine for epilepsy.

291
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:09,119
But I didn't have the courage to ask for him.

292
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,700
After he was discharged from the hospital,

293
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,529
he quietly left the village.

294
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:35,940
Then several years later,

295
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,240
I met him again.

296
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,259
Mi Jung.

297
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:01,470
I didn't think I properly congratulated you the other day.

298
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,900
Good job studying hard in that small, rural village.

299
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,240
Well done.

300
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,710
How kind of you.

301
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,950
Your notes helped me a lot.

302
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,309
Thank you.

303
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,480
What? My notes?

304
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,390
What notes?

305
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,559
Your notes on key points of comprehensive English studies.

306
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,029
Comprehensive English studies...

307
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,130
Right. I gave them to you. Yes.

308
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,298
Mi Jung, our university has an alumni association...

309
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,739
for people from Taebaek.

310
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,400
I don't rarely go to their meetings.

311
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,538
But it'll be nice if you attend them.

312
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,308
You might be able to find people...

313
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,279
who can help you get around Seoul.

314
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:46,749
Anyway, that's it. I'll get going.

315
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,509
See you around. Bye.

316
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:00,960
When I saw that he didn't remember giving me his notes,

317
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,730
I was over my crush completely then.

318
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:10,099
Hold on. So...

319
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,269
your handsome first love...

320
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,710
was Im Ik Jong from our department?

321
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,279
You really have low standards.

322
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,650
He's the one who started the rumour in our department.

323
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,119
That I'm a witch?

324
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,220
What? You knew about that?

325
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:34,460
You know, rumours spread like wildfire.

326
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,730
Even if he hadn't started it,

327
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:42,000
the rumour would have spread somehow.

328
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,869
My gosh. Listening to you is making me angrier.

329
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,769
It's already in the past, anyway.

330
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,308
He liked you too.

331
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,079
How awful of him not to remember the notes?

332
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,420
Hold on.

333
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,750
That doesn't align with the propositions...

334
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,250
Something doesn't add up.

335
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,019
What? What do you mean?

336
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,130
Let me check a few things.

337
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:11,430
Just answer them as how you remember.

338
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,670
Was the church big?

339
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,569
How big was it? As big as the rooftop?

340
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,369
Well,

341
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,640
I think it was about the same size.

342
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,809
But why do you ask?

343
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,109
How long was the service? About 30 minutes?

344
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:30,650
About an hour.

345
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,048
(1. Being within a 10m radius of her for over 10 minutes is dangerous.)

346
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:33,150
But why do you ask?

347
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,759
Did you talk to other people at church?

348
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,489
How many exchanges within the conversation?

349
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,289
Was it more than ten?

350
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,460
Right.

351
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,200
We used to have refreshments all the time after the service.

352
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:52,669
Im Ik Jong. I doubt you didn't know his name.

353
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,739
(3. If she knows your name, it is dangerous.)

354
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,940
Then...

355
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,309
did he confess his feelings to you?

356
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,210
That he liked you?

357
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,819
(4. Confessing your feelings to her is dangerous.)

358
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,390
He practically did.

359
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:13,889
"He practically did?"

360
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,730
Did he tell you about his feelings or not?

361
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,970
I told you that he gave me his notes.

362
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:25,910
(Notes)

363
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:28,170
How come he didn't die?

364
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,380
What?

365
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,180
Nothing.

366
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,549
(5. Breaking all of these rules will result in death.)

370
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,569
What is it this time?

371
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:37,079
My gosh. I'm already busy enough as it is.

372
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,410
Make it quick.

373
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:48,619
I don't think there are some parts you left out.

374
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,559
Is that so? Did I now?

375
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,759
So what did I leave out?

376
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,230
It turns out that wasps hibernate in winter.

377
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,069
What's your point?

378
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,009
Why did you say you were stung by a bee?

379
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:11,579
This is just crazy.

380
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:14,809
I never said that.

381
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,619
When I woke up in the hospital,

382
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,920
that's what everyone thought happened to me.

383
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,220
And I never corrected it.

384
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,259
Then...

385
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:26,059
Right.

386
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,299
I didn't get stung by a bee that day.

387
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:32,630
You've been experiencing fewer seizures lately, right?

388
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,769
Yes. It improved quite a lot.

389
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,740
Even so, you must take the medicine regularly.

390
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:39,639
Take one more tablet of this...

391
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
- if the seizures continue. - Okay.

392
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,038
I explained to your mother...

393
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,578
about the additional prescription.

394
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:47,079
(Prescription)

395
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,450
Okay. Thank you.

396
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,289
It was nothing to be embarrassed about.

397
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:01,230
But back then, I was insecure about it.

398
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:05,329
I didn't tell anyone that I was taking medicine for epilepsy.

399
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,399
To be honest, she was the last person I wanted...

400
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,569
to find out about my condition.

401
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,240
It'd be nice...

402
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,839
if we could go to the same university later.

403
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,980
Ik Jong.

404
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,450
Ik Jong. Wake up!

405
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,719
Ik Jong.

406
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,389
- Ik Jong. What's the matter? - Ik Jong.

407
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:30,019
Hey, what's wrong?

408
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,190
- What? - I don't know.

409
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,289
I think he was stung by a wasp.

410
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:36,259
A wasp?

411
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,329
Why is there a wasp in the middle of winter?

412
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,099
- Get him up. - Okay.

413
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:42,339
All right.

414
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,400
Get him on my back.

415
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:50,078
I was grateful that she lied to me to keep my secret.

416
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,109
But so what?

417
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,250
It's not like I asked her to lie for me.

418
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,519
Then why did you act as if it happened because of her?

419
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,990
Did you sacrifice her just to cover up your condition?

420
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,999
I heard you even started the rumour when you were in college.

421
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,029
Do you have any idea...

422
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:16,269
how much that rumour tormented Park Mi Jung?

423
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,140
Right.

424
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,509
But do you believe that rumour?

425
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:27,150
Do you think that's just a rumour?

426
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,709
What?

427
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,150
Park Mi Jung is indeed a witch.

428
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,548
According to the rules I've discovered,

429
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:34,419
you should have died no matter what...

430
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,189
whether you were struck by lightning or drowned.

431
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,819
You broke all of the rules.

432
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,389
You were in the same space with her for a long time.

433
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,729
You had a lengthy conversation.

434
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,999
She knew your name.

435
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,200
And you confessed...

436
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,529
your feelings to her.

437
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,170
But despite that, you're still alive.

438
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:52,869
Hold on.

439
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,980
I confessed my feelings to her?

440
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,339
- You did. - I did?

441
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,849
When did I do that?

(I'll wait for you in Seoul.)

452
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:37,308
You broke all of the rules, but you survived.

453
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,440
(I like you, Park Mi Jung.)

454
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,179
Then there's only one possibility.

455
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,149
The possibility that you didn't satisfy a major premise.

456
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,179
My dear junior, Dong Jin.

457
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,119
Try to make some sense. Please?

458
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,500
Did you even like her?

459
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,268
My gosh. This is so childish.

460
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,269
Why do you keep talking about my high school days? Darn it.

461
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,510
Did you really like her?

462
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,539
You're driving me crazy.

463
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:14,979
(Do you think he will apologize?)

(I'll wait for you in Seoul. I like you, Park Mi Jung.)

467
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,300
I wrote this to her because I liked her.

468
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:41,809
Do you think I didn't mean this?

469
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,710
Why do you think I wanted to hide my condition from Mi Jung?

470
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,510
Because I liked her back then.

471
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,690
This isn't fair.

472
00:36:53,889 --> 00:36:54,889
What did you say?

473
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,658
I'm turning into a mess,

474
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:01,960
so I can just have a chance to talk to her.

475
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,530
Don't you still get it?

476
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,929
Why you were the only exception?

477
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:19,010
You don't deserve to be her variable.

478
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,219
Then...

479
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,860
do you think you deserve it?

480
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,869
Did Park Mi Jung ask you for your help?

481
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,340
I...

482
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,570
If your hypotheses are indeed true,

483
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,210
you might die too. Am I wrong?

484
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,409

was her feelings.

551
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,460
So it was you.

552
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,929
I came because I had something to tell you.

553
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,269
You were...

554
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:36,639
on the Cheonho Bridge, right?

555
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,909
Are you all right now?

556
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,280
I wanted to be of help to you.

557
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,219
But I'm terribly sorry.

558
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:52,820
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

559
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,389
To say what I wanted,

560
00:55:56,329 --> 00:55:58,599
I've worked out to get stronger...

561
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,829
and made many preparations.

562
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:11,210
Wait.

563
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:13,380
Don't do it.

564
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,409
Don't say anything.

565
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,780
As...

566
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,289
you were directly involved,

567
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,320
you must've had a faint idea.

568
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:28,960
Please stop.

569
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:32,630
But...

570
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,340
those events weren't caused by you.

571
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,469
Go back.

572
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:46,840
Please.

573
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,280
I wanted...

574
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,320
to tell you this in person.

575
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,880
It's a gift for you from the guys in Taebaek.

576
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:27,650
And...

577
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:33,059
there's something I'd like to risk my whole life to say.

578
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,130
But I won't do it today.

579
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:12,630
Mi Jung.

580
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,739
Do what you've always wanted to do.

581
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,980
It's okay to do that.

582
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,250
I'm serious.

583
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,210
I spoke more than ten words again.

584
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,559
(Start, Reset)

585
00:59:24,739 --> 00:59:26,139
I have a long way to go.

586
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,440
Let's get going.

587
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,159
(Under Construction)

588
01:00:03,909 --> 01:00:04,909
I told you, didn't I?

589
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,650
You have a simple pattern.

(Special thanks to Shim So Young.)

593

(Heo Eun Shil)

594
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,738
My name is Heo Eun Shil.

595
01:01:05,739 --> 01:01:06,800
What brings you here?

596
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:08,840
Mr. Lee Dong Jin is missing.

597
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:10,979
He might be dead.

598
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,880
I'm talking about your friend, Lee Dong Jin.

599
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,050
(Lee Dong Jin: I'm going to her.)

600
01:01:21,989 --> 01:01:23,090
It's my house.

601
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,989
Why are you eating alone? That's no fun.

602
01:01:31,429 --> 01:01:33,559
Kim Joong Hyuk. That's your name, right?

603
01:01:34,369 --> 01:01:36,670
Hey. Why are you eating alone? That's no fun.

604
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:39,170
What if there's a dead body?

605
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:42,369
He was adamant about renting this particular room.

606
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:46,309
What is this?

607
01:01:47,179 --> 01:01:48,210
"Shine on you?"

608
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:50,780
Is it a coincidence?

609
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,718
It's the same translator.

610
01:01:53,719 --> 01:01:54,719
(Translated by Park Mi Jung)

611
01:01:54,989 --> 01:01:56,349
I get it now.

612
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,889
I know the reason why Mr. Lee left clues for you, Mr. Kim.
