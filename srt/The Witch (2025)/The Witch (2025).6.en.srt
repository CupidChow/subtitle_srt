(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

(Episode 6: Means and Methods)

8
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,750
What are you doing? It's cold.

9
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,650
You're here.

10
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,689
It seems you're going to plant something here.

11
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,859
Yes. I'm going to plant some potatoes when spring comes.

12
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,790
You could just buy them.

13
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,829
You're foolishly diligent.

14
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,269
It's just a pastime. I'm bored.

15
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,999
A young person like you shouldn't feel bored.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,099
Oh, my gosh.

17
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,939
Is there anything uncomfortable for you?

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,170
- No. It's all good. - Okay.

19
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,109
Is the boiler working fine?

20
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:46,049
Yes.

21
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,949
When the temperature drops below freezing,

22
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,950
always leave the faucet slightly open.

23
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,689
- Okay. - All right.

24
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,129
By the way,

25
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,299
did something happen?

26
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,959
Oh, right.

27
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,569
I came...

28
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:09,099
because I thought it'd be better to tell you in person.

29
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,639
Come and have a seat.

30
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,050
We met when you were 21.

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,150
And you're almost 30 now.

32
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:25,449
Right.

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,659
- It's been already ten years. - Yes.

34
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,530
If you perhaps...

35
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:34,360
want to talk about the rent,

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,330
you've never raised it so far, so...

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,900
Oh, the rent?

38
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,500
Wait a second.

39
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,240
Have I not raised it even once?

40
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:43,939
No.

41
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,340
That's why I've been always grateful.

42
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,639
I'm such a nice person.

43
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:53,349
Let's talk about that later.

44
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,819
Well...

45
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:59,150
Even the most beautiful flower doesn't last ten days.

46
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,659
You know the Chinese proverb, right?

47
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,590
- Sorry? - Well...

48
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,289
I'm not boasting or anything...

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,929
But when I was your age,

50
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,860
it was the most beautiful moment of my life.

51
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,500
I made the hearts of the boys in my neighbourhood flutter.

52
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,900
But what's the use of it? It's all in the past, right?

53
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,408
These days, I get startled...

54
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:19,240
when I see my reflection in the mirror.

55
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,909
Why? You don't believe me?

56
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,550
Sorry?

57
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,009
No. I believe you.

58
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,750
So don't lock yourself...

59
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,250
on this shabby rooftop.

60
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,418
Go outside, meet men, and have some romance.

61
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,759
That's how you'll experience the taste of life.

62
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:40,030
Time flies like an arrow.

63
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,169
I'm saying this because you're like a niece to me.

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,340
Are you interested in a blind date?

65
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm happy with my life now.

66
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,780
There's nothing you lack.

67
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:01,780
You make a living with your English skills.

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,218
You're Eun Shil's junior,

69
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,989
which means you went to Hanguk University.

70
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,650
You're very smart.

71
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,189
He's a very nice guy.

72
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,490
Are you interested?

73
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,160
Why don't you meet him?

74
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,399
Aunt, please!

75
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,529
Fine. I'm leaving.

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,300
I came just now.

77
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,170
Bye.

78
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,579
Why were you listening to her? It's cold.

79
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,050
Let's go inside.

80
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,879
It's freezing.

81
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,790
Mi Jung. Don't skimp on the heating.

82
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,919
I didn't turn it on because it wasn't that cold.

83
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,990
It's not cold?

84
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,759
It's minus 10℃ outside.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,829
- Okay. - It's cold.

86
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:54,040
My aunt is a little nosy.

87
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,500
Please understand.

88
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:58,110
No. It was nice talking with her after a long time.

89
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,970
Gosh, this is nice.

90
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,680
I don't know why this place relaxes me so much.

91
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,379
Is it because I feel comfortable?

92
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,990
I'm going to meet someone who is like this cosy blanket.

93
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:13,949
I like it.

94
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,289
Eun Shil, you want some ramyeon?

95
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,290
Yes, please. Your ramyeon is the best.

96
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,930
Good.

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,529
- Mi Jung. - Yes?

98
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,100
Should we open a ramyeon restaurant?

99
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:27,069
Why?

100
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,839
- Did something happen? - It's just that...

101
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,669
I have to say what I don't mean to...

102
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,480
and make programs I don't like...

103
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,579
just to make a living.

104
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,480
My life has been boring these days.

105
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,849
Are you going through adolescence again?

106
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,919
Hey.

107
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,519
I would never want to go back to those days.

108
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,889
Okay. Take a rest. I'll be cooking ramyeon.

109
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,389
- Mi Jung. - Yes?

110
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,560
Make it spicy. Really spicy.

111
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,870
- Make it very spicy. - I got it.

112
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,860
Sir, you have a visitor.

113
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,300
(Authorized Personnel Only)

114
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,470
(Intensive Care Unit)

115
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,069
The wind is cold. Are you all right?

116
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:14,879
I thought it was particularly cold this morning,

117
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,509
so I opened the wardrobe...

118
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:20,480
only to find out that I hadn't taken out any warm clothes yet.

119
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,920
I thought it was strange and saw the calendar.

120
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,519
Then I realized two months had passed already.

121
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,759
I feel like it's my fault.

122
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,389
My heart feels heavy.

123
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,860
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,569
It's the bad guy's fault. Why would you apologize?

125
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,029
You don't have to feel sorry.

126
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:44,569
Well... Mr. Kim.

127
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,209
Yes. Please go ahead.

128
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,480
Every time I see you, I'm a little worried.

129
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:56,519
I wonder if you're here to tell me that he was arrested,

130
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,689
but your eyes say otherwise.

131
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,160
It means he's still roaming around somewhere freely.

132
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,029
I'm worried he might come out of nowhere to hurt us again.

133
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,629
Whenever I think about it,

134
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,029
my heart...

135
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,139
sinks.

136
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,850
I understand what you mean.

137
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,079
Please don't skip your meals.

138
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,110
Joong Hyuk.

139
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:30,378
A telecommunication warrant has been issued for that jerk.

140
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,679
We also got the plate number of his father's SM3.

141
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,319
The moment he turns on his phone, we'll have his location.

(Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Offices)

143
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,220
Thank you.

144
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,259
Put out an APB for that vehicle.

145
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,460
Yes, sir.

(Name: Na Myeong Gi, Address: Seoul, Occupation: Freelancer)

147
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:50,999
(He's a suspected stalker,)

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
(and we need to track his location for an emergency arrest.)

149
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,099
They think I'm a pushover.

150
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,769
Darn it.

151
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,469
Who is it?

152
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,739
Who messed with him again?

153
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,580
- Should we go? - Hyun Woo.

154
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,409
Read the room when you want to make a joke.

155
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,779
Okay.

156
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,619
It happened many times.

157
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,090
We all know smartwatches are the issue.

158
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,388
Blaming the frontline staff won't solve the issue.

159
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:15,559
I know.

160
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,018
They need to acknowledge the limitations...

161
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,589
of the current location-tracking system...

162
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,889
and think about ways to improve it.

163
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:23,259
- Right? - Aren't you busy?

164
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:25,970
I'll go to the Police Administration Division.

165
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,409
- Joong Hyuk. - Yes.

166
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,080
There's nothing we can do about it. Write a statement of explanation.

167
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:38,980
I'm sorry I couldn't cover for you.

168
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:42,549
No, it's okay, sir. I'll write it immediately.

169
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:45,289
Did you try tracking down that jerk?

170
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:48,019
Yes. The telecommunication warrant has been issued just now.

171
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:50,419
We'll try to catch him quickly and wrap things up.

172

183
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,429
Disappear

00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:32,899
I'm giving up on my dream here.

186
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,768
Hey, you said you'd stick like a fallen leaf soaked in rain...

187
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,269
and hold out until the end.

188
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,710
There was a precondition.

189
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,940
Until my daughter goes to college.

190
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,210
My daughter is your junior now.

191
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,749
What?

192
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,610
She was accepted to Hanguk University!

193
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,949
Now, you have a bigger reason to stay here...

194
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,789
like a wet fallen leaf.

195
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,590
You can't resign in this tough world.

196
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,029
It's a national university, so the tuition is cheap.

197
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,330
As a father, my shoulders feel lighter now,

198
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,200
- so I'm going to the countryside. - All of a sudden?

199
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,470
- Your hometown? - Yes.

200
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Humans are contradictory.

201
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,539
When I lived in the countryside,

202
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,239
I wanted to go to Seoul and work for a fancy broadcasting station...

203
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,909
to make my dream come true.

204
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:22,278
But after running for the dream for about 25 years,

205
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,620
I realized it didn't suit me.

206
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,590
It's hard just to get by day by day.

207
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,019
And I don't have the talent to nurture my juniors.

208
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:31,460
So...

209
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:33,889
I'm thinking of raising cows in my hometown.

210
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,730
Does your wife know about your plan?

211
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,500
I should try to persuade her.

212
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,039
Oh, right.

213
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:45,970
Someone came to see you earlier.

214
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
He said he would be waiting at the nearby cafe.

215
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,080
- Who? - I'm not sure.

216
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:53,149
He had a really nice voice.

217
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,620
(Vision Trip)

218
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,360
Why are you giving this to me?

219
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,190
The director approved it.

220
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,200
That's the last show I approved as a chief producer.

221
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:09,960
Make it a good one.

222
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,269
You should also think about the ratings now.

223
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
Okay. Let's go.

224
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,039
The eyes

225
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:23,480
That used to protect me

226
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,210
The warmth

227
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,419
That used to keep me warm

228
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,789
The house

229
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,659
Who are you again?

230
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,299
Oh, I'm Lee Dong Jin.

231
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,269
(Lee Dong Jin)

232
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,210
"Data analyst?"

233
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,320
Have we met before?

234
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
I'm not sure.

235
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,799
I get that a lot.

236
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,128
I'm so ordinary-looking...

237
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,470
that people say they feel like they've seen me before.

238
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,370
I wonder why a data analyst came to see me.

239
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,980
I have questions regarding Park Mi Jung.

240
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,179
- Park Mi Jung? - Yes.

241
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,888
I'm investigating the accidents that occurred around her,

242
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:22,590
compiling statistics, and analysing them...

243
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,789
to identify any consistent patterns.

244
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,330
Why?

245
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,028
If you can identify a pattern,

246
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,599
you can predict future incidents and accidents,

247
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,269
and being able to predict them means we can prevent them from happening.

248
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,070
- A pattern? - Yes.

249
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,639
Hey.

250
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,249
You're that guy from Hawaii Tanning, the waxing salon, right?

251
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,049
(Brazilian Waxing, Bikini Waxing, 30 percent off for off-season)

252
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:55,189
Yes.

253
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,918
Why are you prying into her life?

254
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,129
Are you a stalker?

255
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,389
Data? Statistics?

256
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,230
I'm not buying it.

257
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,529
Tell me when I'm being nice.

258
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,569
What's the real reason you came to me?

259
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:15,880
I heard you were the only person...

260
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,008
who has been close to Mi Jung for the past nine years...

261
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:21,680
since her college years.

262
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,349
From who?

263
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,589
Do you remember Im Ik Jong?

264
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,848
Im Ik Jong from my department?

265
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,859
Yes.

266
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:31,789
Ik Jong, Mi Jung, and I...

267
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,160
were born and raised in Taebaek.

268
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:36,630
And we went to the same school.

269
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:39,529
(Incident and Accident Data)

270
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,338
(Fell down the stairs, went missing, car accident)

271
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:46,639
(Classroom, road at the entrance of Jeongun-ri)

272
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,769
(Broken leg, shoulder injury, head injury)

273
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,979
I've been tracking and collecting data on her...

274
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,108
from her childhood until she left the village in 2013,

275
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:56,818
and even up to the recent incident...

276
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,588
where someone confessed to her on the subway...

277
00:17:58,589 --> 00:17:59,818
and got into an accident.

278
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:01,049
I compiled statistics based on the data.

279
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,489
(Did you confess your feelings to her that day?)

280
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,858
(Do I have to tell you that too?)

281
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:04,889
Let's see.

282
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,789
I soon left after some words of consolation.

283
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,900
It wasn't that long.

284
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,829
Gosh.

285
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,099
Is it even possible?

286
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,970
Of all times and places, a wild boar was there.

287
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:19,640
Park Mi Jung was watching me.

288
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,980
I wanted to make a good impression, and that's when it happened.

289
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,410
I was merely in the school infirmary with Park Mi Jung. That was all.

290
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,920
But I smashed my head the next day while playing basketball.

291
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,518
I'm not sure if I had a crush on her...

292
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,559
when I got injured.

293
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,089
Move out of the way!

294
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,329
- Bang Ju Sung? - Oh, right.

295
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,400
I do remember seeing the fall foliage.

296
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,569
The fall picnic.

297
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,869
Hey, how did you find me here?

298
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:53,869
I have some questions for you.

299
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,239
It's about Park Mi Jung from middle school.

300
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
(Lee Seo A, Nam Ye Bin)

301
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:58,250
(Park Seong Hun, Lee Min Ho, Ju Han Sol)

302
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,549
Mr. Lee Hyeon Cheol.

303
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,759
Did you really meet all these people and interview them?

304
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:11,089
Yes.

305
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,229
Up until 2013, there were around 40 people...

306
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,430
who were injured, minor or major, in her vicinity,

307
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:18,798
and two people who are believed to have died...

308
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,599
due to their direct connection to her.

309
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,639
I've managed to uncover a distinct pattern...

310
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,669
among those who were harmed or lost their lives.

311
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,740
In other words,

312
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,779
I've formulated a hypothesis.

313
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,509
"Being within a 10m radius of her is dangerous."

314
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,150
"Holding a conversation with her is dangerous."

315
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,720
"If she knows your name, it is dangerous."

316
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:41,960
"Confessing your feelings to her is dangerous."

317
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,490
"Breaking all of these rules will result in death."

318
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,828
"However, all the assumptions apply only to those who love her."

319
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:53,098
(However, all the assumptions apply only to those who love her.)

320
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:54,099
What...

321
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,769
What is this?

322
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,700
"The Rules of Death?"

323
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,609
It seems...

324
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,279
there are a few rules of death that follow her around.

325
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,519
But what if there's an error?

326
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,690
This is only a hypothesis and assumption.

327
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,859
That's why I need more information.

328
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:20,329
I hope I can meet more people through you.

329
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:24,130
It's not right to pry into someone's life secretly.

330
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,170
By the way,

331
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:30,869
why are you so obsessed with this?

332
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:34,640
I'm not sure.

333
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:39,980
My feelings are complicated. So it's difficult...

334
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:43,420
to explain them in one word.

335
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,990
But what I can say for sure is...

336
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:51,789
that I simply want to give her back her normal life.

337
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,400
I desperately wanted...

338
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:08,039
someone to help her break out of her shell.

339
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,180
I tried my best, but it didn't work.

340
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,380
A part of me always felt bad for her.

341
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,289
I hope you...

342
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,019
are that someone I've been waiting for.

343
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,460
What can I do to help?

344
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,970
I would like you...

345
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:39,309
to tell me everything you know about Mi Jung.

346
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,809
(Hanguk University)

347
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:52,018
Hello.

348
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,518
I'm the president of the English Department...

349
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,689
at the College of Liberal Arts.

350
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,690
My name is Heo Eun Shil.

351
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,690
(Best Department English Literature)

352
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:04,699
A lot of people have this misunderstanding...

353
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,768
that I was chosen as the president of our department...

354
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:08,799
- after taking one look at me. - My gosh.

355
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,170
Never. That's not true at all.

356
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,639
We had a democratic process.

357
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,209
- What's she talking about? - We had a vote.

358
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,108
- We must face the embarrassment. - I won the vote fair and square...

359
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:19,109
- by a landslide. - I told you we should skip this.

360
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:30,960
All right. My dear freshmen.

361
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,430
You got on the KTX because you wanted to go to Seoul.

362
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,400
But guess what? You ended up...

363
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,759
in Busan, not Seoul.

364
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,499
Attending university all alone without a good community...

365
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,200
could be equivalent to that.

366
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,098
Is life all about speed?

367
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:46,568
No. It's not speed. It's about the directions. Yes?

368
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:48,679
- Hey. - Directions are important.

369
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Can I borrow a pen?

370
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,650
- Our department will help you... - What?

371
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,420
find your goal and direction.

372
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:56,680
Here.

373
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,150
Thanks.

374
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,219
I will help you find your lost youth,

375
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,660
passion,

376
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,460
and campus romance.

377
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,099
A round of applause. Great.

378
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:17,940
Hey, you.

379
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:19,640
Darn it.

380
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:22,039
Good grief. I'm up here and talking to you.

381
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,339
You seem very distracted.

382
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,380
- You can't drop the honorifics. - Forget it.

383
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,779
Darn it.

384
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,349
Don't you know that we are as powerful as your parents?

385
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,319
Do you really want to have a miserable four years?

386
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,619
I'm delivering a heartfelt speech. How dare you get distracted?

387
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,190
- I'm sorry, ma'am. - I'm sorry, ma'am.

388
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:42,758
You two.

389
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,599
Come to the student council room after this.

390
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,768
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

391
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:48,970
Come and fill out the application to join the student council.

392
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,369
Got it?

393
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,769
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

394
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:00,710
Mi Jung...

395
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,650
was dressed in a dull outfit so as not to stand out.

396
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,749
But the male students...

397
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,959
were fascinated by Mi Jung's aura anyway.

398
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,959
I applied to the English writing contest today.

399
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,129
But I was one minute late.

400
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,798
- You were late? - Just by one minute.

401
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,029
So...

402
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Oh, hey.

403
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,869
Ik Jong.

404
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:26,109
Hey. It's you, Mi Jung.

405
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,970
You...

406
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:30,839
Do you go here?

407
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,349
Yes. I...

408
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,750
I'm also majoring in English Literature like you.

409
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,150
Is that so? I didn't know that.

410
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,660
Good for you.

411
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:46,589
Well,

412
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,130
are you all right?

413
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,529
Pardon?

414
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:55,200
I heard what happened in our hometown.

415
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,710
It must have been hard on you.

416
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,039
Who is she?

417
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:05,549
Oh, her.

418
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,849
Let me introduce her.

419
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,720
She's my junior from my hometown.

420
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,819
What's going on?

421
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:16,519
You're acting so awkward as if you did something wrong.

422
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:18,689
Gosh, no. I'm not acting awkward.

423
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,630
We used to go to the same church.

424
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:22,660
Did I ask you that?

425
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,269
Then have a blast talking to your hometown junior.

426
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,700
What?

427
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,970
Mi Jung. Let's catch up later.

428
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,009
Seo Ryung. Hold on. Wait up.

429
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:50,960
Hey.

430
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,460
Go.

431
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,529
Mi Jung.

432
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,130
Here. I should return it to you.

433
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:02,200
Okay.

434
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,809
Mi Jung.

435
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,710
Well,

436
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,839
can I get your number?

437
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,750
Please?

438
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,519
Hey, Lee Yun Dong.

439
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:26,430
Did she just turn you down?

440
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,730
- No. - She totally did.

441
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,058
You'd better run to the student council room.

442
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,569
(Best Department English Literature)

443
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:49,019
I'm sure you've experienced this.

444
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:51,680
You meet people who you become...

445
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,250
instantly interested and feel a connection.

446
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:56,960
Yes. I know that feeling.

447
00:26:58,259 --> 00:26:59,730
I've experienced something similar.

448
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:01,430
To me, Mi Jung was that.

449
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,730
It was different from pity or sympathy.

450
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,000
It felt as if I had known her for a long time.

451
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,140
It's difficult to explain it. But she always caught my eye.

452
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,109
Time flew by.

453
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,240
It was toward the end of the semester.

454
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,950
(Looking for new members, the dream club of Hanguk University)

455
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:24,719
I'll be the team leader and do the research.

456
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,788
Hyun A. You put together the presentation.

457
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:26,819
Mi Jung. You do the presentation.

458
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:28,119
Is that okay?

459
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:31,190
The presentation?

460
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:34,490
I'll do the presentation.

461
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:37,799
Thank you.

462
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,400
Okay. Hyun A will do the presentation.

463
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,740
I'll email you the material within two days.

464
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:45,239
So you'll do the research.

465
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,440
They'll take care of the presentation.

466
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,009
I'll buy coffee then.

467
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,980
Sure.

468
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:52,279
- I've got class. See you later. - Okay.

469
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,650
Same here. Let's talk later.

470
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:02,890
Mi Jung.

471
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,019
Yes?

472
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:08,190
Do you like watching movies?

473
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:11,730
Yes. I do.

474
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,769
Great.

475
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,640
I have tickets to a movie screening.

476
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,740
Do you want to watch a movie this weekend?

477
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:25,609
I'm sorry. I have to be at my part-time job.

478
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,490
This isn't what I had in mind.

479
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,000
Mi Jung. Wait.

480
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:48,700
Could you wait for a moment? I need to talk to you.

481
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,538
(Student Council Application)

482
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:24,268
So only Yun Dong and Jae Ho are the only new recruits...

483
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:25,569
from the beginning of our semester?

484
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,339
Eun Shil. You know that student council isn't popular.

485
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,680
We can't get new recruits...

486
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,849
by throwing them words like "youth" and "campus."

487
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:37,920
Instead of promoting our club, why don't we work with the job fair?

488
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,319
Gosh, forget it. No.

489
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,089
Yun Dong. What happened to your leg? Why are you wearing a cast?

490
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,460
Oh, this? I rolled down the stairs.

491
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,230
Why are there so many accidents in our department?

492
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:54,098
Someone broke his nose while playing foot volleyball.

493
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:55,539
There was a motorcycle accident too.

494
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,539
We might spend the whole semester making hospital visits.

495
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:59,339
Hey.

496
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,940
Just be honest.

497
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,108
Didn't it happen because of Park Mi Jung?

498
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,109
Hey.

499
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:08,449
That's embarrassing. Why would you bring that up?

500
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,519
What?

501
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,579
Park Mi Jung?

502
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,319
You're talking about that freshman girl, right?

503
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:15,690
The girl with a dark aura, right?

504
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
But does she even come to classes?

505
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,559
I haven't seen her around for a while.

506
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,799
It seemed she was coming to classes while keeping a low profile.

507
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,399
But she's quite popular.

508
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,029
Guys from other departments come to check her out.

509
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,039
Rumour has it that even Professor Jung Young Su...

510
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:30,798
of Introduction to English Literature likes her.

511
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,769
Hey. He's not some lunatic.

512
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:34,970
How could a professor have feelings for a student?

513
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,740
Isn't he even married?

514
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,279
My gosh.

515
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:41,910
Well, I heard Park Mi Jung was to blame for the accidents...

516
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,450
taking place in our school.

517
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:48,619
The explosion in the engineering lab too.

518
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,920
Hey. Do you think that makes any sense?

519
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,989
Then is she also responsible for the collapse...

520
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,329
at the construction site of the art center?

521
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,529
I got goosebumps after hearing that rumour too.

522
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,298
I don't even go near her now.

523
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:00,369
Hey, Lee Yun Dong.

524
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,440
I thought you liked Park Mi Jung.

525
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,869
Yes. I did.

526
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,739
Did you decide to badmouth her...

527
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,339
because she turned you down?

528
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,720
Eun Shil.

529
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,049
She was known for it even in Taebaek.

530
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:20,390
That guys who liked Park Mi Jung...

531
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,220
either got seriously injured or died.

532
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:24,989
Who would say something like that?

533
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,459
Ik Jong, the third-year.

534
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,328
He said they were from the same hometown.

535
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:29,858
- Im Ik Jong? - Yes.

536
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:32,700
Darn it. How can a man be such a blabbermouth?

537
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,700
Is he crazy or what?

538
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:42,809
My goodness.

539
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,109
Why did Yoon Ju text you?

540
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,379
We did a team project together.

541
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,549
So she just texted me to say I did a good job or something.

542
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,589
By the way,

543
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,759
are you in touch with the freshman, Park Mi Jung?

544
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,430
Seo Ryung.

545
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,730
Why would you bring her up again?

546
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:07,069
I told you, didn't I? She's just from my hometown.

547
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,369
Nothing happened between us.

548
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,470
You keep mentioning her because you know nothing about her.

549
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,339
Are you trying to weasel your way out of this again?

550
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,710
- I'm being serious. I... - Forget it.

551
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:19,749
Darn it. I wasn't going to say this.

552
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,809
Seo Ryung. So here's the thing about her.

553
00:32:22,819 --> 00:32:24,779
Anyone who talks to her...

554
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,849
or likes her ends up injured or dead.

555
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,690
What do you mean?

556
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,430
Guys who have feelings for her end up injured or dead.

557
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,170
This is crazy.

558
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:12,869
Good job.

559
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:25,779
Are you done already?

560
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,210
Yes.

561
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,750
Mi Jung.

562
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:35,049
Yes?

563
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,420
You did well.

564
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,959
Since you already submitted your work,

565
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,400
let me go over it briefly.

566
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,970
For this part, rather than using formal expressions like this,

567
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:49,299
try something more subtle.

568
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,309
Like something more literary or beautiful.

569
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:05,579
Sir.

570
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,920
Thank you for the lectures.

571
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:24,070
Nothing has happened yet, but an accident will happen soon?

572
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,500
Yes.

573
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:27,969
When can you come?

574
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:31,039
So he's in the lecture room all safe and sound for now?

575
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,150
Are there any threats around him?

576
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:37,980
Well,

577
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,719
I know this sounds strange.

578
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:47,130
But could you please come and check on him today?

579
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,159
We can only dispatch an ambulance if there's an accident.

580
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,800
I'm sorry. But you can't make prank calls like this.

581
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,940
No. I'm being serious.

582
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,969
Hello?

583
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,789
Hey, Mi Jung.

584
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:17,619
Hello. You know who I am, right?

585
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:19,389
I'm the president of our department.

586
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,590
Hello.

587
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,260
Do you like port cutlets?

588
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,329
Let's talk over a meal in the school cafeteria.

589
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:26,670
Can we...

590
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:29,400
do this another day?

591
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:32,139
- I'm sorry. - Hey.

592
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,538
You always disappear so fast after the lectures.

593
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:36,738
I even asked around for your schedule...

594
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:37,840
and waited for you.

595
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:40,449
Just five minutes.

596
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,719
Or three minutes. Please?

597
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:50,559
What's he doing?

598
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,119
That's dangerous. Why is he sitting on the windowsill?

599
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,389
Hey. Don't turn around.

600
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,960
- Professor Jung is watching you. - What?

601
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,929
Eun Shil.

602
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,840
I don't think I can be here right now.

603
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:05,170
What?

604
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,250
What happened?

605
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,489
Oh, no. Don't look.

606
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:38,269
It's because of me again.

607
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,309
It's not because of me. It's just an accident.

608
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:44,840
It's okay, Mi Jung. Don't turn around.

609
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:46,949
It's okay.

610
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:57,420
After that accident, the rumour that she was a witch...

611
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,329
was no longer just a rumour. It became a fact.

612
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:07,569
(The rumour was no longer just a rumour.)

613
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:10,340
(It became a fact.)

614
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,769
Mi Jung...

615
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,980
couldn't endure it anymore.

616
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,679
She withdrew from the university.

617
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,459
(Mayor of Seoul Must Carry Forward Redevelopment Plan)

618
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,098
(To be demolished)

619
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:41,829
(Redevelopment is driving out the locals.)

620
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,340
Oh, no!

621
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,409
I just saw a rat.

622
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,510
The rat is as big as a cat.

623
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,960
Gosh, that startled me.

624
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:07,789
That caught me off guard.

625
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,309
Do you live alone?

626
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,549
Water is the only thing I can offer. Is that okay?

627
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,849
Yes. I need to drink something. I'm thirsty.

628
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:34,650
That's nice and cool.

629
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:39,119
How long have you been living here?

630
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,029
After I moved to Seoul,

631
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,499
I saw on the news that this area would be demolished.

632
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,699
Then I moved here.

633
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,800
After the news of the demolition?

634
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:49,500
Why? It's creepy here.

635
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,639
It's scary since no one's here.

636
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,510
Do you not get scared easily?

637
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:55,639
It's not that.

638
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:58,340
It's more comfortable when there's no one around.

639
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,079
Why?

640
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,179
I'm just...

641
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,449
more comfortable this way.

642
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:09,989
When will you leave?

643
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,760
It will be hard to go down if you leave at a late hour.

644
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,559
I should go. I'll leave soon.

645
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,369
But why did you quit school?

646
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,110
Don't you know what people say about me?

647
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:30,380
I don't care about that.

648
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,239
It's just odd.

649
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,448
You did sit all the way in the back,

650
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:36,820
but you were never absent. You were an industrious student.

651
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,349
But you suddenly dropped out of school?

652
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:41,389
Well,

653
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,789
it doesn't look like it was an impulsive decision.

654
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,059
Did you talk to your family about this?

655
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,960
I don't have a family.

656
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,429
My parents passed away.

657
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,329
Is that so? I...

658
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,070
I know that my life seems pretty sad.

659
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:00,869
But you don't need to pay attention to me.

660
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,039
- What? - You're pitying me.

661
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:08,179
It's insulting to be pitied.

662
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Hey.

663
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:12,650
I'm the last person to pity anyone right now.

664
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:15,119
For some reason, I worry about you.

665
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,659
I don't know why. I just feel that way.

666
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,360
Have you ever experienced this in your life?

667
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,499
You've never met this person, but strangely,

668
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,759
you open up quite fast.

669
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,630
It's like you've met that person before.

670
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,199
I'm not sure.

671
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:33,369
I don't think I've experienced that yet.

672
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:36,280
You know the expression, falling in love at first sight?

673
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,679
I don't think that's only applicable to romantic relationships.

674
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,949
You can...

675
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,420
stop visiting me.

676
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,829
You’re fanning out the spikes like a hedgehog.

677
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,059
But the spikes will prick you one day.

678
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,940
I'm leaving for real now. I'm serious.

679
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,980
I'm leaving now.

680
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,380
(Heo Eun Shil)

681
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,480
(Software Update)

682
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,389
(June 23, 2014)

683
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,880
(Heo Eun Shil)

684
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:28,989
A few months after that,

685
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,019
I got a call from Mi Jung.

686
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:36,059
Darn it.

687
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,530
What?

688
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:41,829
You're still here?

689
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:44,300
Is it raining badly outside?

690
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,769
It's literally pouring down like there's a hole in the sky.

691
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:49,409
Leave that umbrella for me.

692
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:51,639
Are you mad? I've only got one.

693
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,980
- What? - What's this?

694
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,150
A blackout?

695
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,919
I loathe horror movies.

696
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,090
Eun Shil!

697
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,920
Darn it. You scared me.

698
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:07,730
You're more horrifying, you know?

699
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,630
Seriously.

700
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,670
Hello?

701
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,980
Who is this?

702
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:32,380
The power is back.

703
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:39,489
Park Mi Jung!

704
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
I'm sorry.

705
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:51,940
You're the only person I could call.

706
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,269
Why are you so apologetic?

707
00:43:54,409 --> 00:43:56,070
Is it a buzzword?

708
00:44:00,949 --> 00:44:02,079
Let's go inside.

709
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:22,630
Did you report it to the police?

710
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,539
No. Nothing is missing, after all.

711
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:33,750
Seriously. Why do you have to live in the slums?

712
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:35,679
And all alone as a woman, to boot.

713
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,750
You never know what'll happen!

714
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:40,989
This...

715
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:47,090
This is the only way I can live alone.

716
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,530
I have no other choice, Ms. Heo.

717
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,500
Mi Jung.

718
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,210
Call me by my name from now on.

719
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,150
Starting today,

720
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,480
I'm your older sister.

721
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:42,210
Be careful. It's slippery.

722
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,468
The furnace is outside the house.

723
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:09,239
It'll burst for sure in the winter.

724
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:12,739
There haven't been any problems until now.

725
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:15,250
Take care of it well, and it'll be fine.

726
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:16,979
It's only winter that needs caution.

727
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,518
Either way, this needs another 50 dollars cut.

728
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:20,519
Fifty...

729
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:24,460
Even the waterworks is here.

730
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,530
But first,

731
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,489
let's look at the room.

732
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:39,639
Okay. The water pressure looks good.

733
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:42,340
This dresser is unnecessary.

734
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:45,079
The wall needs to be redone.

735
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:47,750
It's only been a year since the last redo.

736
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,820
Gosh. The wallpapers look at least a century old.

737
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,519
A year, my foot.

738
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,489
It's so dull. Even I would get depressed.

739
00:46:58,019 --> 00:46:59,859
How can you laugh right now, miss?

740
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,389
She's right. How is this funny?

741
00:47:01,429 --> 00:47:03,230
This is an important business matter.

742
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,659
I'm sorry.

743
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,899
You'll install an AC before summer, right?

744
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,969
A what?

745
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:12,139
At this price as the rent,

746
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:14,809
the tenant should install the AC, no?

747
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:16,939
You're practically robbing me.

748
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,440
Whatever. Forget it.

749
00:47:19,179 --> 00:47:21,808
I'm fine, Eun Shil. I don't need an AC.

750
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:23,379
But you've never lived on a rooftop.

751
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,420
It's scorching hot in the summer.

752
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,989
It's really okay. I only need a fan.

753
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:30,658
You heard her, right?

754
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:31,920
Get her a fan at the least.

755
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,260
How lucky, ma'am. You saved money today.

756
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,860
Don't tell me you two...

757
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,599
are a scamming duo or something.

758
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:54,510
All right. Good.

759
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,619
It's your home starting today.

760
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,650
If anything happens, let me know through Eun Shil.

761
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,889
I will. Thank you, ma'am.

762
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,429
Goodness. You've got good manners with a pretty face.

763
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:09,959
You remind me of when I was young.

764
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,429
All right. I get that you were pretty back in the day.

765
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,829
You can go back now.

766
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,369
I will. Can't you see I'm leaving?

767
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,539
Bye.

768
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,710
Oh, she's my aunt.

769
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:26,409
- "Aunt?" - Yes.

770
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,980
This house is alimony from my uncle.

771
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,980
Sorry?

772
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,049
They may have gotten a divorce,

773
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,320
but she's still my aunt.

774
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:40,389
I see.

775
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,960
I finally get your relationship with her.

776
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,699
In other words, you two are strangers.

777
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:50,739
Legally speaking, yes.

778
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,570
But she's not to me.

779
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:55,239
Don't worry. She's a nice person.

780
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:58,340
You'll be safe living in this house.

781
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,780
Okay.

782
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,849
Thanks, Eun Shil.

783
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,519
If you are, pay me back later. Okay?

784
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:09,219
How nice.

785
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:21,070
She was standing about here.

786
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:23,599
Please stand there for a moment.

787
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:29,969
What an odd guy he is.

788
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,139
What am I even doing right now?

789
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,050
Done. Thank you!

790
00:49:50,659 --> 00:49:53,730
By the way, why were you measuring the distance?

791
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:57,368
I'm verifying whether Professor Jung's case aligns...

792
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,969
with the five conditions, including the prerequisite.

793
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,510
Mi Jung was in the same area as Professor Jung.

794
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:08,250
They were within 10m of each other when the accident happened.

795
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,280
Professor Jung did talk to Mi Jung.

796
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,619
The two know each other.

797
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:17,619
But did Professor Jung really confess his feelings to Mi Jung?

798
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:20,130
He most likely did.

799
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,980
Hey. Over here.

800
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,309
Hey.

801
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,359
You were badly hurt back then, right?

802
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,789
Don't get me started.

803
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:57,198
I took a crazy tumble with my bike and ended up...

804
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:59,158
breaking my 2nd and 3rd ribs.

805
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:00,469
Recovery was indeed tough.

806
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:01,869
Good grief.

807
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:04,639
Do you mind telling me what happened?

808
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,900
Sure.

809
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,808
I was riding my bike up to the College of Humanities...

810
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:12,579
when I saw Park Mi Jung walking up.

811
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,949
I told her I'd give her a ride and to hop on.

812
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,750
And so, did you give her a ride?

813
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,119
No. She refused until the very end.

814
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:24,058
I kept offering, but she kept turning it down.

815
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,788
Without a choice, I rode next to her...

816
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:28,460
and matched her pace up to the college.

817
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,329
Do you remember how long that took?

818
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:36,469
The school was quite big, so about ten minutes?

819
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,368
(Time spent together: 10 minutes)

820
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:41,769
(2. Holding a conversation with her is dangerous.)

821
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:44,409
You also had feelings for Mi Jung, right?

822
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,579
I still feel shy when it's all in the past.

823
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:52,880
You know, she was quiet...

824
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,849
and had this vibe around her.

825
00:51:54,989 --> 00:51:56,150
She piqued my interest.

826
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,590
And you must've expressed that, right?

827
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:00,329
We like being clear.

828
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,530
It's a yes or a no.

829
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:05,159
I followed her and said,

830
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:08,030
"Hey, Park Mi Jung. I like you."

831
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:09,670
"Let's date."

832
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,968
But the thing is...

833
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:13,138
(4. Confessing your feelings to her is dangerous.)

834
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:15,869
I did some thinking while on the hospital bed.

835
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:18,079
I never introduced myself to Mi Jung.

836
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,909
Eun Shil.

837
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,449
I bet Mi Jung still doesn't know my name.

838
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:25,179
Gosh. Unbelievable.

839
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,449
(3. If she knows your name, it is dangerous.)

840
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:35,429
This is where I sprained my ankle.

841
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,230
And down I went.

842
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,000
I can still remember that moment like it was yesterday.

843
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,239
I had to get a cast.

844
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,309
It took ten weeks to heal.

845
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:49,969
I had it tough until midsummer.

846
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:52,980
How long were you two together?

847
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:56,079
Is that important?

848
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,718
It is, Yun Dong.

849
00:52:57,719 --> 00:52:59,150
Help him as much as you can, okay?

850
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,619
I see.

851
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:02,150
Okay.

852
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,119
Let's see.

853
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,719
After our team meeting,

854
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:09,130
Jae Ho and a girl left for their lectures first.

855
00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:11,000
We were together for about five minutes.

856
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:13,159
Or even ten minutes.

857
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,030
Hey, Lee Yun Dong. Is it 5 or 10 minutes?

858
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,840
Be clear, will you?

859
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,369
But Eun Shil... No.

860
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,710
I mean, President.

861
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:23,940
It's hard to remember the exact time of what happened ten years ago.

862
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:26,210
Remember it.

863
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,750
It was from the lecture room...

864
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,320
until the accident on the stairs.

865
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:35,019
About ten minutes.

866
00:53:35,389 --> 00:53:37,190
Yes, it was about ten minutes.

867
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:40,090
(10 minutes)

868
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,599
What can be the difference between...

869
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:49,130
the bike accident guy and the stair accident Yun Dong?

870
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,669
Whether Mi Jung knew their names...

871
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,239
and whether they confessed to her.

872
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,409
True.

873
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,780
Asking to go to the movies together isn't a confession.

874
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,119
Can we really minimize errors...

875
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,889
by relying on vague memories?

876
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:14,960
There's only one way...

877
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:17,730
to minimize errors.

878
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:21,230
How?

879
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,769
It's to...

880
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:30,010
test out the rules myself.

881
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,980
If your hypothesis is right...

882
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:37,550
If it's right, you might get into grave danger.

883
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:39,179
But...

884
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,050
it's something I want to clarify.

885
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:46,159
Do you like...

886
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,489
Mi Jung?

887
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,929
At first, thinking about Mi Jung...

888
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,769
made me happy.

889
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:03,239
But now,

890
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,179
thinking about Mi Jung...

891
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,719
breaks my heart.

892
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:40,750
(This place is good!)

893
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:45,250
(Hyomyung Mart)

894
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,519
Every Tuesday,

895
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,619
a Hyomyung Mart delivery man...

896
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:55,260
drops off daily necessities at her house.

897
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,199
"Hyomyung Mart?"

898
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,408
Welcome.

899
00:56:08,409 --> 00:56:12,179
(Hyomyung Mart)

900
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,579
Welcome.

901
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:18,920
(Recruiting Delivery Person)

902
00:56:20,949 --> 00:56:22,518
I've never seen you around.

903
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:23,619
Did you move to this area?

904
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:25,420
I did.

905
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,760
Come by often.

906
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,159
We make deliveries if it's over 30 dollars.

907
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,500
What about a delivery person?

908
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:33,099
"Delivery person?"

909
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:34,570
Yes.

910
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:37,139
It seems like you're looking for one.

(Recruiting Delivery Person)

912
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,170
Oh, that?

913
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:44,380
Well...

914

(Education, Qualifications, Language)

915
00:56:57,659 --> 00:56:59,460
(I have a motorcycle license and am physically fit for the job.)

916
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:01,329
His qualifications are unbelievable.

917
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:06,860
A delivery man doesn't need to be this amazing.

918
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:09,670
He must have an unspeakable circumstance.

919
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,399
You remind me of myself years ago.

920
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,809
What nonsense are you spouting?

921
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:16,069
I have a motorcycle license...

922
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:17,980
and will work really hard.

923
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:21,210
But you see,

924
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,019
I was going to take that down but forgot about it.

925
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,150
Business is slow in my supermarket.

926
00:57:27,789 --> 00:57:29,849
We don't have the money to hire a delivery man.

927
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,719
I'd like to work only on Tuesdays.

928
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:34,289
What?

929
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:35,829
"Only on Tuesdays?"

930
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,400
Yes. I've got a certain reason.

931
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:40,769
Would that be hard?

932
00:57:45,869 --> 00:57:47,509
Fine. All right.

933
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:49,110
Everyone must be in a certain situation.

934
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:51,979
Life isn't easy even after graduating from a university...

935

936
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:56,309
Go ahead. You can work on Tuesdays.

937
00:57:58,119 --> 00:57:59,280
There you go.

938
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,519
All right. You're all set.

939
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:08,289
But this place is tough.

940
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,829
The stairs are endless.

941
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:15,329
Good luck and drive safely.

942
00:58:15,469 --> 00:58:17,239
- Okay. I'm off. - Bye.

(1. Being in the same space with her is dangerous.)

944
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:41,090
I have finally come this far.

945
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,730
It took too long.

(Hyein English and Math Academy)

947
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,860
I'm 10m within her space.

948
00:59:19,699 --> 00:59:21,099
I must not spend...

949
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,039
over ten minutes in her space.

950
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:31,079
Who is it?

951
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,480
It's your supermarket delivery order.

952
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,380
You can leave it in front of the gate.

953
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,480
Well...

954
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:42,219
I need you to sign the delivery confirmation receipt.

955
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:44,119
What?

956
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,760
Sorry?

957
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,789
(Special thanks to Kim Mi Hwa and Kim Young Woong.)

958
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,820
I timed myself when I was within her space.

959
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,230
Ten minutes was fine.

960
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,058
I'm sorry to trouble you every time.

961
01:00:57,059 --> 01:00:58,699
Today's delivery is heavy, isn't it?

962
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,630
One bag of 5kg rice.

963
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:03,030
"One bag of 5kg rice."

964
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,780
Why are you overtaxing yourself?

965
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:19,079
You're black and blue everywhere.

966
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,420
What's that hanging over there?

967
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,630
- Would you like to see it? - Yes.

968
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:31,699
Pork, 300g.

969
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,570
- My gosh. - Oh, no.

970
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,070
What happened?

01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,539
Is he okay?
