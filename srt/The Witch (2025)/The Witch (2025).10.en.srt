I'll go outside for a moment.

(Lee Yun A)

12
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,210
Well... I'm sorry.

13
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,110
Why are you sorry to me?

14
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,850
I should've come earlier.

15
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,590
I was late because it felt like it was my fault.

16
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,290
Why is it your fault?

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
It was just...

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,630
his problem.

19
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,960
But still,

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,560
I'm a police officer.

21
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,050
I can't stay here for a long time.

22
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,980
I'll get going now.

23

Mr. Kim.

24
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Your friend visited me recently.

25
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,130
Did Dong Jin come?

26
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,830
Yes.

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,500
He told me something about you.

28
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,970
And the rules.

29
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,910
He did?

30
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,350
What happened to me...

31
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,390
didn't happen because of you.

32
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,760
What do you mean?

33
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,630
I don't meet the prerequisite conditions of that rule.

34
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,070
So...

35
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,370
please don't feel guilty anymore.

36
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,370
I understand what you mean.

37
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,740
I'll get going then.

38
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,980
Su Hyeon, did you hurt your leg?

39
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,980
Yes.

40
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,750
What happened?

41
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,920
I'm fine.

45
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,310
Hello.

46
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,880

Yes.

You know Lee Dong Jin, don't you?

50
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,840
I'm Dong Jin's friend.

51
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,270
Do you know him?

52
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,610
Where is he?

53
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,510
I came to give you something.

54
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,560
It's something he couldn't give to you...

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,180
The conclusion of the report is...

102
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,320
that everything that happened around you...

103
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,090
were just a coincidence,

104
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,220
and those accidents...

105
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,820
were not caused by you.

(Report on Fatality Rates: Denial of the Witch's Existence)

110
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,580
In my case,

111
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,579
to say that it was a coincidence...

112
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,620
Yes.

113
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
You're right.

115
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,490
Errors?

116
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,590
You applied statistics selectively.

117
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,160
To put it simply,

118
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,469
you had already concluded that she wasn't a witch.

119
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,330
Then you used statistics to fit your narrative.

120
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,039

132
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,530
I think you're truly a witch.

133
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,100
Too many people who had feelings for you...

134
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,630
got hurt or died.

135

136
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,609

(What's the common factor in all of the accidents?)

138
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,040
and scared.

140

Honestly, the title of "witch..."

141
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,320
seems more fitting for you.

142
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,060
"Witch?"

143
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,200
I heard it...

144
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
so many times.

145
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,970
Dong Jin has disappeared.

146
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,280
After leaving a message that he was going to meet you,

147
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,210
he disappeared.

149
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,720

151
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,710
Ms. Park.

152
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,520

155
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,000
So it was you.

156
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,800
I came because I had something to tell you.

157
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,370
To say what I wanted,

158
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,470
I've worked out to get stronger...

159
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,740
and made many preparations.

160
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,910
Wait.

161
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,950
Don't say anything.

162
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,880
As...

163
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,350
you were directly involved,

164
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,360
you must've had a faint idea.

165
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,360
Please stop.

166
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,660
But...

167
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,700
those events weren't caused by you.

168
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,340
I wanted...

169
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,840
to tell you this in person.

170
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,690
It's a gift for you from the guys in Taebaek.

171
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,730
And...

172
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,570
there's something I'd like to risk my whole life to say.

173
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,110
But I won't do it today.

174
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
Mi Jung.

175
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,170
Do what you've always wanted to do.

176
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,710
It's okay to do that.

177
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,950
I'm serious.

178
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,470
In the end, because of me...

179
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,190
This...

180
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,220
is Dong Jin's room.

181
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,650
All this while,

182
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,150
he lived here.

183
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,590
Depending on your decision,

184
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,290
I can arrest Dong Jin on charges of stalking.

185
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,890
If you want,

186
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,730
I can be a witness for you.

187
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,930
No way.

188
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,060
All of this...

189
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,700
was part of an experiment to uncover the rules.

190
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,010
"The rules?"

191
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,910
It's a long story.

192
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,880
I'll show you...

193
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,380
everything he tried to do.

198
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,229
It has all the information.

199
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,560
(I'm going to her.)

200
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,070
This is his blog,

201
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,240
which is like his laboratory.

202
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,710
It's based on the data he has been collecting for years.

203
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
But...

204
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,150
do I have to check this?

205
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,520
He wished I hadn't been a witch.

206
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,960
If he really confirmed that I was a witch,

207
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,060
his experiment failed in the end.

208
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,459
The statistics that were supposed to prove...

209
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,800
that you weren't a witch failed already...

210
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,370
when he wrote that report.

211
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,170
- Excuse me? - Dong Jin...

212
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,639
didn't carry out the experiment...

213
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,880
to prove that you aren't a witch.

214
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,650
What I'm saying is...

215
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,720
even if you're a witch, it doesn't matter to him.

216
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,590
What does that even...

217
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,790
He just...

218
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,030
wanted to find a way to love you.

219
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,300
Now,

220
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,830
it's your turn to look into him.

222
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,900
That's so you, Dong Jin.

223
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,970
Your statistics are still ongoing.

224
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,440

You're working hard.

229
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,670
Excuse me.

230
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,980
This is what you requested.

231
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,410
It won't be easy to find Dong Jin.

232
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
I know.

233
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,120
It won't be easy.

234
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,460
Dong Jin's experiment is still ongoing.

235
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,070
(Being in the same space with her is dangerous.)

236
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,439
(If so, what's the range of that space?)

237
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,110
(It's approximately 10m. It's just an estimate.)

Two.

249
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,650
Holding a conversation with her is dangerous.

250
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,510
Being acquainted with her is dangerous.

251
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,520
Four.

252

253

Confessing your feelings to her...

254
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,460
- is dangerous. - "is dangerous."

255
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,730
- Breaking all of these rules... - "Breaking all of these rules..."

256
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,260
could result in death.

257
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,160
"could result in death."

258
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,699
(Being in the same space with her is dangerous.)

259
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,239
(My speculation is that the range of distance...)

260
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,470
(that could cause danger is 10m.)

261
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,509
(The distance between my room and her rooftop rail is 8m.)

262
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,039
(Considering the distance from the rooftop rail to her room,)

263
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,310
(it's roughly 10m away. This should be safe, right?)

264
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,860
(Being in the same space)

265
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,599
(Being within a 10m radius...)

266
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,400
Being within a 10m radius of her is dangerous.

267
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,069
(Being within a 10m radius of her is dangerous.)

268
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,469
(However, the precondition for all these hypotheses is...)

269
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,940
(that one must have feelings for Park Mi Jung.)

270
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,530
Firstly, there should be a 5kg bag of rice.

271
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,630
A box of cereal.

272
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,860
A box of cereal.

273
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,470
(Wallpaper and Linoleum)

274
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,280
A bunch of green grapes.

275
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,049
Ten small soy milk boxes.

276
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,720
Ten small soy milk boxes.

277
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,620
- And a box of minced garlic. - A box...

278
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,500
A box of minced garlic.

279
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
Wait.

280
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,030
Did you hurt your hand?

281
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,840
Did you...

282
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,870
hurt your hand after delivering groceries to my house?

283
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,340
I hurt myself exercising.

284
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,080
That's a relief.

285
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,830
(Breaking all of these rules...)

286
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,870
(Breaking all of these rules will result in death.)

287
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,270
I was completely clueless.

288
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,820
That someone...

289
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,440
had been shining a light on me for a very long time.

290
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,720
Dong Jin substituted himself into the last variable.

291
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,960
Where is he now?

292
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,670
You probably know the answer to that.

293
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,470
The answer is in the question.

294
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,020
(Seoul Gangdong Police Station)

295
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,740
Why are you here?

296
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,210
I'm working.

297
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,050
Unbelievable. How could you do this?

298
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,249
What do you mean?

299
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,590
Mi Jung is gone too.

300
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,960
Okay. I see.

301
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,360
"I see?"

302
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,530
That's it?

303
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,129
Seriously. I have a bone to pick with you.

304
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,260
Believe me, I'm not happy.

305
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,129
You've been dodging my calls for the past week. You know?

306
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,799
When I came by to ask you about Mr. Lee,

307
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,870
you said you were busy and went back in after you were done talking.

308
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,340
Come and sit down.

309
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,250
How many words do you speak a day?

310
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,980
What's the point of having a mouth?

311
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,190
Are you the only busy one?

312
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,820
I'm a busy woman too!

313
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,690
I see.

314
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,790
My gosh. "I see?" Seriously?

315
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,760
Is that the right thing to say in this context?

316
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,130
Anyway, I never liked you from the start.

317
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,169
You don't know how to talk to people.

318
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,600
When you speak, you tend to sound super rude and curt.

319
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,309
You know what? Is looking down on people...

320
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,180
fun for you? Does it relax you or something?

321
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,310
- You really don't know? - Know what?

322

Where Park Mi Jung went?

323
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,780
I'm asking you because I don't know.

324
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,820
Did you wonder why Dong Jin chose me of all people?

325
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,330
Mr. Kim.

326
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:35,090
Stop with the questions. Let's have a conversation.

327
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,130
Why did Dong Jin record everything on the blog?

328
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,130
Why did he make it possible for me to see everything?

329
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,940
Well, that's because you are also...

330
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,070
You already know why.

331
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,009
I won't beat around the bush. I'll just ask you then.

332
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,010
Ms. Heo.

333
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,010

You're a straightforward guy, aren't you?

338
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,990
Interested in you?

339
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,570
What are you doing?

340
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,710
How many exchanges did we have just now?

341
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,840
What?

342
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,190

But I knew I was the cause.

Isolating myself.

349

Hey. Why are you eating alone? That's no fun.

00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,250
But Dong Jin approached me.

354
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,550
Come on. Do you not remember me?

355
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,760
I didn't even answer him when he talked to me.

356
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,620
But he didn't seem to mind.

00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,960
What are your plans for the break?

368
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,230
there could be more people like me.

369
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,310
And that Dong Jin was trying to figure out a way.

370
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,980
But his effort was wasted in vain from the start.

371
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,500
I can't find a way, Joong Hyuk.

372
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,600
That was expected.

373
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,040
He couldn't deny a phenomenon that clearly existed.

374
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,180
Up until then, I thought Dong Jin had given up.

375
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,880
- You're here. - Yes.

376
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,420
Do you want to drink?

377
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,900
There are strange laws in the world.

378
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,800
What if there's actually...

379
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,800
a law like that?

380
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,910
Someone is haunted by the law of death like a curse.

381
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,210
If I can understand that law, couldn't I break the curse?

382
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,320
Doesn't it mean I could save the person from the curse?

383
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,990
Dong Jin was talking about me.

384
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,490
Dong Jin didn't give up.

385
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,300
Hey, Joong Hyuk...

386
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
No.

387
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,370
He never gave up even for a moment.

391
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,210
Hey, Joong Hyuk. Let's go and eat.

392
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,309
- Okay. - What should we get today?

393
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,850
I hear today's meal in the cafeteria tastes awful.

394
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,520
Is that so?

395
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,450
Why did you come?

396
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,760
There was something to check.

397
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,620
Check what?

398
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,390
I knew I was the cause.

399
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,890
But I didn't know why.

400
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,300
I'm done now.

401
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,560
And...

402
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,730
I do believe it.

403
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,270
Pardon?

404
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,910
That people will die when they get close to you.

405
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,480
I know that better than anyone...

406
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,180
what it means.

407
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,720
As I didn't know why,

408
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,320
I put a very thick wall between me and the world.

409
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,590
As I didn't know why,

410
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,690
I turned away from everyone around me.

411
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,200
Just like Ms. Park Mi Jung did.

412
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,909
But according to Dong Jin's hypotheses,

413
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,140
there are rules.

414
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,549

While looking into the people around Ms. Park Mi Jung,

422
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,870
Dong Jin also looked into people who were in accidents from my past.

423
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,040
Next time, give me a heads-up.

424
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,410
What if I wasn't here?

425
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,980
This is fun, though.

426
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,850
Fun, my foot.

427
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,320
So what brings you here today?

428

Friends don't need a reason to hang out.

429
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,890
You know I didn't mean it like that.

430
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,220
I was in the neighbourhood to look into something.

431
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,400
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

432
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,710
Sure.

433
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,909
Just "sure?"

434
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,909
Only using the people who were in accidents around Ms. Park...

435
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,409
didn't give him a big enough sample size.

436
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,849
(December 21, 2022: This is heartbreaking.)

437

439
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,150
he was trying to save me...

440
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,490
on top of Ms. Park.

441
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,530
If the rules Dong Jin uncovered are indeed valid,

442
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,500
I might be able to live a bit more harmoniously...

443
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,540
with other people within the rules.

444
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,080
Now, I get it.

445
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,880

446
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,320

447
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,460

No.

452
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,100
I'm not.

453
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,899

a bit more time.

a bit more time.

464

465
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,450
Wait. I didn't know you could smile.

466
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,550

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,050

It's me, Heo Eun Shil.

00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,660
Why did Mr. Lee leave far away from here?

476
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,790
It's rare for two people to fall in love at the same time.

477
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,060
He expressed himself...

478
00:40:57,061 --> 00:40:59,160
in every possible way for quite some time.

479
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,270
He must have thought she would need time to open up too.

480
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,770
How long have you known...

481
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,410
that Mr. Lee left far away from here?

484
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,380

488
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,390
You're right. It won't be easy.

(Country: Austria, Purpose of Travel: Vacation)

490
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,130
Dong Jin might've risked everything on the last variable...

491
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,070
he discovered.

492
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,870
"The last variable?"

493
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,970
He hoped...

494
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,940
Ms. Park would love him back.

495
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,980
Even to them,

496
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,220
time is the issue.

497
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,260
Hallstatt.

498
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,100
This place produces a lot of salt.

499
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,240
I see.

500
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,940
That's why there are many traces of salt mines.

501
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,410
Much like Taebaek, where we grew up.

502
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,350
Thanks...

503
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,190

504
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,360
Don't thank me.

505

506
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,500
My mom...

507
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,670
wanted me to let you know if we ever met...

508
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,370
that she felt terrible about back then.

509
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,880
But she doesn't have to.

510
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,980
Your mother...

511
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,190
was a very nice person.

512
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,460
It took such a long time...

513
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,900
to get here.

514
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,570
I'm sorry I couldn't come here...

515
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,370
much earlier.

516
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,940
No.

517
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,040
This is more than enough.

518
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,880
You came early enough.

519
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,090
How was the trip?

520
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,390
Let's see.

521
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,090
I was very anxious...

522
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,000
and worried.

523
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,770
Even so, I made the right choice.

524
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,370
You finally did what you wanted.

525
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:02,970
I did.

526
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:04,780
Congratulations.

527
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,920
Had it not been for you,

528
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,750
I wouldn't have dared to.

529
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,290
Thank you so much...

530
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,430
for pulling me out into the world.

531
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:28,830
I'm glad.

532
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,510

have passed.

535
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,270
Am I okay now?

536
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,770
We'll have to talk more.

537
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,010
Right.

538
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,680
We’ve barely spoken ten words.

539
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:23,460
I brought your phone from Korea, Dong Jin.

540
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,360
I love you.

541
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,700
Park Mi Jung.

542
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,500
I love you.

543
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,240
I love you, Park Mi Jung.

544
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,410
I wanted to tell you that.

545
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,560
But these are simply my feelings.

546
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,800
Your feelings,

547
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,130
thoughts,

548
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,340
decisions, and everything. I will respect them.

549
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,110
Thanks.

550
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,600
Wait, Dong Jin.

551
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,480
While travelling,

552
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,050
I kept thinking about you.

553
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,990
You just...

554
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,790
naturally crossed my mind.

555
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,790
And most of them...

556
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,160
were worries...

557
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,730
about you.

558
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,170
I didn't want you to get...

559
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,370
hurt more.

560
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,720
Like you did, Dong Jin,

561
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,090
I studied the data...

562
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,030
about you.

563
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,030
Did you make...

564
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,560
any progress?

565
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,830
I figured something...

566
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,070
you didn't know.

567
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,590
I like you.

568
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,400
I have a crush on you.

569
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,170
All of those who liked me...

570
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,910
got into an accident...

571
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:09,810
after drifting away from me.

572
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:14,890
But when they were with me,

573
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,490
nothing happened.

574
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,930
The last variable.

575
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:30,500
Dong Jin.

576
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,210
Don't leave my side.

577
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,050
And...

578
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,120
I wanted to tell you this.

579
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,890
I love you, too.

580
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,830
Lee Dong Jin.

581
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,400
Are you busy?

582
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,270
What?

583
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,440
You must be working overtime again.

584
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,250
Were you here all along?

585
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,030
How much longer must we meet from such a distance?

586
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,760
For just a little longer.

587
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,980
How much longer must we only share a few words like this?

588
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,890
I'm sorry.

589
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,020
Just how much longer?

590
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,030
It's just that I'm anxious.

591
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,200
About what?

592
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:53,070
I have no way of knowing what this feeling is,

593
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:55,240
so I have no other choice.

594
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,640
Is it that hard to find out?

595
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,410
I need more time.

596
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,110
Why don't you get what it is?

597
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,750
I've never once felt such emotions in my life before.

598
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:09,650
That's why I don't get it.

599
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,290
You're an idiot. Why don't you get it?

600
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,130
Let me check.

601
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Ms. Heo.

602
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,570
Ms. Heo?

603
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:32,980
Mr. Kim.

604
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,210
I...

605
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,450
really like you.

606
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,490
Ms. Heo.

607
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,530
Ms. Heo!

608
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,070
I've totally gone mad.

609
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,470
I have terrible taste in men.

610
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:01,740
Rules, my foot.

611
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,510
Idiot.

612
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,580
Why don't you get it?

613
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,820
Can't you just make a variable?

614
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,319
(Lee Dong Jin)

615
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,920
(The last variable. Don't ever leave her side.)

616
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,700
"Don't ever leave her side."

617
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,470
(Heo Eun Shil)

618
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,680
(Mr. Full-of-Himself)

619
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:43,949
Hello?

620
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,380
Ms. Heo. Get off at the next stop.

621
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,190
Get off immediately no matter what happens.

622
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,450
What?

623
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,520
What are you talking about?

624
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,020
Don't go too far.

625
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,830
I'm coming. I'll come and pick you up.

626
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,300
- Dong Jin. - Yes?

627
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,240
Is the last variable really the last one?

628
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,240
Who knows?

629
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,880
Could there be another variable?

630
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,090
Nobody knows that, either.

631
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,660
Sir. Can you stop the bus?

632
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,730
What?

633
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Please stop the bus. Stop it now.

634
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,280
What if there's another rule?

635
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,950
Then...

636
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,250
there may be another variable.

637
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,580
Ms. Heo.

638
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:44,440
Don't leave my side.

639
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,280
I won't.

640
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:22,270
Will we really be all right?

641
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,580
Why do you ask?

642
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,080
I'm terribly anxious.

643
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,790
Everyone is like that.

644
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,390
All people are anxious.

645
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,090
We're only...

646
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,760
a little different.
