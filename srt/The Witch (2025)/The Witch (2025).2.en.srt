1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:16,760
(Park Jin Young, Roh Jeong Eui)

2
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,530
(Lim Jae Hyuk, Jang Hee Ryung)

3
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,148
(The Witch)

4
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,149
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

5
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,149
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

6
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,095
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

7
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,689
Like Murphy's law...

8
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:48,820
or Sally's law?

9
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,490
Right. A law.

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,829
There are...

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,060
strange laws in the world.

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,729
There's no law.

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,369
It's all coincidence.

14
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:02,900
What if there's actually...

15
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:06,670
a law like that?

16
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,578
What if there's someone haunted by that dreadful curse...

17
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,079
for their entire life?

18
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:17,519
Their life must be so hard.

19
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,260
What on earth are you talking about?

20
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,560
Someone is haunted by the law of death like a curse.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,930
If I can understand that law, couldn't I break the curse?

22
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,870
Doesn't it mean I could save the person from the curse?

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,340
Joong Hyuk.

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,579
Do you think...

25
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,549
there's a witch?

26
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,018
Such a beautiful monastery...

27
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:57,629
This towering castle...

28
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,089
Also known as a background...

29
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,560
It's also known as a background...

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,150
of the fairy tale written by the Brothers Grimm,

31
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,869
- "Rapunzel." - Rapunzel was trapped alone...

32
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,039
in a high castle because of the witches.

33
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,939
Because of the witch's curse.

34
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,949
(Because of the witch's curse.)

35
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,530
I rarely go out.

36
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,879
I've been isolating myself from the world...

37
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,189
and living here.

38
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,430
The minimal space of freedom granted to me,

39
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,939
where I can be alone...

40
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,870
and no one can reach me.

41
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,110
Sometimes I feel like this space I've confined myself to...

42
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,550
is actually confining me.

43
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,509
Whenever I feel that way, I remind myself again.

44
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,240
"It's okay."

45
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,180
"I'm fine."

46
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,189
(Episode 2: Witch Park Mi Jung)

47
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,970
How about tteokbokki?

48
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,329
Sounds amazing!

49
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,970
Strange things have often happened around me since I was little.

50
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,638
- One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

51
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,569
- Cinderella's parents died - Cinderella's parents died

52
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,110
- When she was little - When she was little

53
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,679
- Her stepmother and stepsisters - Her stepmother and stepsisters

54
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,180
- Made fun of her - Made fun of her

55
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:09,778
- Shabashaba ai shaba - Shabashaba ai shaba

56
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,089
- She must've cried so much - She must've cried so much

57
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,720
- Shabashaba ai shaba - Shabashaba ai shaba

58
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,360
- The 1980s - The 1980s

59
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:20,898
- Shabashaba ai shaba - Shabashaba ai shaba

60
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,375
- What did you just do? - What on earth?

61
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,300
Hey, Park Mi Jung. Tease you.

62
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,629
- Hey! - What are you doing?

63
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,300
- Hey! - What are you doing?

64
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,040
(Danger)

65
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,509
That boy fell into a manhole and was seriously injured.

66
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,350
Well... Mi Jung.

67
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,750
You know tomorrow is White Day, right?

68
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:50,259
Here. This is for you. These are candies.

69
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,379
I thought...

70
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,879
it was just a coincidence.

71
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:20,759
Are you okay?

72
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,560
Can you get up?

73
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,929
- The Lord's love - The Lord's love

74
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,970
- Blossoms - Blossoms

75
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,509
- He embraces me - He embraces me

76
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,439
- With mercy - With mercy

77
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,309
- Every day - Every day

78
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,480
- Every moment I breathe - Every moment I breathe

79
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,959
- He comforts my heart - He comforts my heart

80
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,888
- The Lord's - The Lord's

81
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,259
- Merciful touch - Merciful touch

82
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,500
- He always gives me good things - He always gives me good things

83
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,180
Mi Jung.

84
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,620
He called my name.

85
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:33,189
Can we talk for a moment?

86
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,199
Sure.

87
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,069
I wrote this. It'll be useful.

88
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:43,969
Take it. This is nothing.

89
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,170
Just take a look.

90
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,480
Thank you.

91
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,610
I'm moving to Seoul.

92
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,519
I was accepted to Hankuk University.

93
00:07:58,689 --> 00:07:59,750
Congratulations.

94
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,259
Well...

95
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,529
Didn't you come first in class this time?

96
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,529
Yes.

97
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,160
I did.

98
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:13,269
Study harder. Don't let your guard down.

99
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,699
It'd be nice...

100
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,399
if we could go to the same university later.

101
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,379
It's quite impossible, considering my grades.

102
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,079
But you'll go to a university in Seoul anyway.

103
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,720
Then...

104
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,528
- Hey. - Hey!

105
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:43,529
Ik Jong.

106
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,700
Wake up!

107
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,700
What's the matter?

108
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:47,070
- What's wrong? - I don't know.

109
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,899
I think he was stung by a wasp.

110
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:51,340
A wasp?

111
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,615
Why is there a wasp in the middle of winter?

112
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,480
- What on earth is going on? - Hold on.

113
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,610
Oh, gosh.

114
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,519
He was immediately taken to a hospital for treatment.

115
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:28,408
(Congratulations on your acceptance to Hanguk University!)

116
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:29,610
(Year 3, Im Ik Jong)

117
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,779
When the new semester started, he left the town.

118
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,250
I haven't seen him since then.

119
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:58,408
Didn't you pay to learn it?

120
00:09:58,409 --> 00:09:59,940
- No. - It's so nice.

121
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,750
Oh, my.

122
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,299
It seems Park Mi Jung is our classmate.

123
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:29,039
I have a reason not to be absent now.

124
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,440
- Hey, Min Ho. - Yes?

125
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,409
- Do you have a death wish? - That's so random.

126
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,679
What's up with the loving gaze?

127
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,409
- Me? - Yes, you.

128
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:41,979
My goodness. It hurts so much.

129
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:45,889
She only does this to me.

130
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,220
Are you okay?

131
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,190
- It was so loud. - It hurts so much.

132
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:55,399
You were there when Ik Jong was hurt, weren't you?

133
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,500
What?

134
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,100
Yes. In front of the church.

135
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,340
What did you talk about with him at that time?

136
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,740
Well...

137
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,610
Ik Jong...

138
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:14,009
was hurt because of you, right?

139
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,320
Right?

140
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,320
What?

141
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,899
Can you stop talking about that? Aren't you tired of it?

142
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,230
Mi Jung did nothing. Why do you keep asking?

143
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,629
He completely recovered and went to Seoul ages ago.

144
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,009
(Seoul Milk)

145
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,580
Jung Hwan.

146
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,990
- You're a man. - That was cool.

147
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,330
Is it good?

148
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,370
Yes. It's delicious.

149
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,639
How's school going?

150
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,699
Have you made any friends since the new school year began?

151
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,850
Well, I just...

152
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,679
I haven't even spoken to some of my classmates.

153
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,495
Isn't Da Eun who used to go to church with you in the same class?

154
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,860
The postmaster's daughter.

155
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,230
She is in the same class as me,

156
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,059
but we're not that close.

157
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,169
Friendships don't always thrive.

158
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,399
You argue, make up, and argue again.

159
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,070
That's what friends do.

160
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,639
And the friendship grows as time passes by.

161
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,309
Right.

162
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,580
Don't focus on study only. People don't like it.

163
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,580
You need friends too.

164
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,490
Daughter.

165
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,629
Happy birthday.

166
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,700
I prepared cash instead of a gift.

167
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:12,029
Is that okay with you?

168
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,970
Yes, but...

169
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,139
Thank you, Dad.

170
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,210
Treat your friends to good food. Okay?

171
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,630
You'll be able to get along with everyone then.

172
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:30,720
Yes.

173
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:34,419
Dad.

174
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:36,936
You can't even have a memorial service for Mom...

175
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
because of me.

176
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,219
Who holds a memorial service on their daughter's birthday?

178
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,000
To me,

179
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:52,870
you're more important.

180
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,450
Mom would be upset if she heard it.

181
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,480
Mom passed away giving birth to me.

182
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:08,659
It means my birthday is the anniversary of her death.

183
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:12,490
Why would she be upset?

184
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,000
No one told her to leave us in such a rush.

185
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:29,539
I...

186
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,509
will make sure she isn't upset.

187
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,850
So don't worry about that.

188
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,500
It seems like there's a food poisoning outbreak at school.

189
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,500
Apparently, 12 boys from our class have been affected.

190
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,969
The headteacher is trying to identify the cause.

191
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,539
So don't worry too much.

192
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,781
Everyone, be careful with what you eat during the summer.

193
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,940
Many students have been absent, but don't get too relaxed.

194
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,178
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

195
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:05,679
Good. Class dismissed.

196
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:08,580
- That's what I'm saying. - It's possible.

197
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:10,720
Food poisoning?

198
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:13,419
So many people got it.

199
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,519
Does it make sense?

200
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,159
And all of them are boys.

201
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,090
What's going on?

202
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,769
There were unusually frequent accidents at school.

203
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:34,710
And most of the injured were boys.

204
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,679
Mi Jung.

205
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,090
What are you doing here?

206
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,990
Jung Hwan.

207
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,089
I don't have an umbrella.

208
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,929
So I've been waiting for the rain to stop.

209
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,759
Do you think it will stop?

210
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:55,929
Let's share an umbrella.

211
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,399
No. I don't mind getting rained on.

212
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,500
You'll catch a cold.

213
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,139
You always walk home instead of taking a bus, don't you?

214
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,940
I actually walk home too.

215
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,060
My house is in the same direction as yours.

216
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,210
Is that so?

217
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,110
Let's go.

218
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:22,419
By the way, why do you always walk home? It's really far.

219
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:26,129
I bet it's not to save money on bus fares.

220
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:30,360
No. I just like walking.

221
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,730
You like walking?

222
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,110
Sorry.

223
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,679
- For what? - Nothing.

224
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,950
My house is just a little further down.

225
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,960
How far is your house?

226
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,410
My house isn't in this direction.

227
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,759
What?

228
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,640
It's in the opposite direction from the school.

229
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:06,930
Why did you come all the way here then?

230
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,140
Do you remember when our classmates got food poisoning?

231
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:16,140
They actually talked about you.

232
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,109
About me?

233
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,579
Yes. All the boys said...

234
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,349
your English is amazing, and you're pretty.

235
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,529
When you stood up to give your presentation in English class,

236
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:36,660
the boys in our class had heart eyes.

237
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,269
What do you mean by that?

238
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,640
I'm saying many boys like you.

239
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:47,470
(Intra-city Bus)

240
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:58,920
Are you okay?

241
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:12,470
I like you.

242
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,970
Jung Hwan.

243
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,670
Take the umbrella with you.

244
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,009
I'll get going.

245
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,450
(Midong High School)

246
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,220
If Jung Hwan hadn't bumped into me that day,

247
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,859
would he have lived?

248
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,789
A riddling sense of guilt tortured me...

249
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,130
after Jung Hwan's death.

250
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,470
(Midong High School)

251
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,900
I began to talk less and less.

252
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,940
I was afraid of meeting people.

253
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:14,009
Hey, what is that? That's crazy.

254
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,319
Hey. Right here.

255
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,759
Mi Jung.

256
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:27,529
Why are you eating alone?

257
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,039
Well...

258
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,970
No.

259
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,109
I don't want to hear it.

260
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,079
I'll get going now.

261
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,859
On my count of three.

262
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:01,130
All right. One...

263
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,699
Hey, what are you doing?

264
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,170
- My legs hurt. - Okay.

265
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:11,440
Okay. One, two, three.

266
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,739
- Move out of my way. Move! - Did it come out well?

267
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,880
Hey, Hae In just farted.

268
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,779
- Move! - No, I didn't fart. Seriously.

269
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,109
Hey, isn't that Bang Ju Song?

270
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,549
There was never a shortage of both small and big accidents at school.

271
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,900
Hey, are you all right?

272
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,839
Hey!

273
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,139
- It's his shoulder. - He hurt his shoulder.

274
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,140
What?

275
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:57,849
As time went by, more students got hurt.

276
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,930
Hey, there she is.

277
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,970
Hey, let's go.

278
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,568
Boys who got injured...

279
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:17,700
didn't want to be around me and avoided me for some reason.

280
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,049
A boy who liked her got hurt.

281
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,159
Gossips about me...

282
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,819
Boys who like her get hurt.

283
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,936
Started to spread like an infectious disease.

284
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,960
Her? Anyone who likes her will end up dead.

285
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,029
Then did Jung Hwan die because of Park Mi Jung?

286
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,520
Even her mother died when she was giving birth.

287
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,339
See? Park Mi Jung is really a witch.

288
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,819
Someone had sparked...

289
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,430
the rumour that I was a witch.

290
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,380
Sweetie, can I come in for a second?

291
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Yes.

292
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
Strawberries.

293
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,650
Here.

294
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:40,650
Thank you.

295
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Sweetie.

296
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,730
I can send you to an academy.

297
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,569
I'm fine.

298
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,640
I have enough money to send you to an academy.

299
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,680
I get good grades even when I don't go to an academy.

300
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:08,250
Sweetie, what was that?

301
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:09,950
Did you just brag?

302
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:13,650
Yes. I did.

303
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,960
You're my daughter and all, but you can be a bit snobbish.

304
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,299
But tell me when you need to get more books and so on.

305
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Okay.

306
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,039
Mi Jung.

307
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,740
How's school?

308
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,539
It's good.

309
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:40,079
What about your friends? How are you getting along?

310
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,720
They're all nice.

311
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,160
Think of me as your mother.

312
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,129
You can talk to me about your boyfriend...

313
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,730
or gossip about your friends with me.

314
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,730
Okay.

315
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:00,400
Aren't children supposed to make their parents worry?

316
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,970
So don't grow up so fast. Okay?

317
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:12,750
If something's wrong, tell me right away. Understood?

318
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,279
Okay.

319
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,750
Well,

320
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:26,589
everything is fine. I'm serious.

321
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,460
Okay.

322
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,970
Have the strawberries.

323
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,970
Okay.

324
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
A new year began, and I began my third year.

325
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:56,019
I went to school quietly as if I was trying to hide.

326
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,079
Park Mi Jung.

327
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:32,089
Why are you always hiding as if you did something wrong?

328
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,859
Do I know you?

329
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,219
I'm a science major, so we barely ran into each other.

330
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:40,549
I'm Park Sang Ho, a 3rd year from Class 7.

331
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,069
I have nothing to say to you. Bye.

332
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:48,339
Jung Hwan's death isn't your fault.

333
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,250
What?

334
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,210
The truth is,

335
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,449
I saw you and Jung Hwan...

336
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,290
sharing an umbrella on your way home that day.

337
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,169
Do you think he might not have died if he didn't walk...

338
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,980
with you that day?

339
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,849
Is that why you haven't been talking to anyone after that way?

340
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,549
Is that why you've been alone and you won't eat in the cafeteria?

341
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,390
You...

342
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,289
What are you talking about?

343
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,259
Why is it your fault that he died?

344
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:42,059
Maybe, he was fated to die there that day.

345
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,759
Why must you suffer?

346
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,399
Stop it.

347
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,920
Just blame it on the weather that day.

348
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:49,768
Since Taebaek has a mountain climate,

349
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,970
blame it on the monsoon front.

350
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:54,508
It would be more scientific if you blamed it on the weather.

351
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,779
- Isn't that Park Mi Jung? - I think so.

352
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,549
Who's that next to her?

353
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,910
Blame it on the rain.

354
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,719
- Blame it on the lightning... - Is something wrong?

355
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,640
- that hit exactly in that spot. - I don't know.

356
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,319
I told you to stop.

357
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:11,589
You don't know anything.

358
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,759
Why are you getting worked up about it?

359
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,930
I'm sorry.

360
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:21,369
I didn't mean to...

361
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:49,329
Mi Jung.

362
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,759
I actually like you.

363
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:57,970
I thought I would regret it...

364
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,740
if I didn't tell you that.

365
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,990

What was it this time?

369
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,298
You didn't hear?

370
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:30,858
You know the pharmacy around the downtown area?

371
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,299
There was an accident.

372
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:35,640
But did you know that Park Mi Jung was with him?

373
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,799
Gosh, that's so creepy.

374
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,440
Is it true that Park Mi Jung is a witch?

375
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,809
Hey, don't even go near her.

376
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,480
You might die too.

377

Let's all have a moment of silence.

378
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,549

a single place for me in school.

386
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,890
Just like that, I left my school.

No.

388

419

431
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,590
Just because.

432
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,260

00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:08,050
Mi Jung.

551
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,280
Are you studying these days?

552
00:50:19,659 --> 00:50:20,960
Make a promise with me.

553
00:50:22,429 --> 00:50:23,699
Start studying again.

554
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,159
What?

555
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,569
If you take that GED or something,

556
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:29,299
you can get a high school diploma...

557
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,639
and even go to college.

558
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:33,840
You can do it. You're smart.

559
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,610
Let's go to Seoul.

560
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,149
But this is where you and Mom lived...

561
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,889
From now on, I will take the subway instead of the truck...

562
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:51,260
and see the N Seoul Tower instead of the potato fields.

563
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,860
And with a first-class cable car ticket.

564
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,829
Dad...

565
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:02,630
The medicine...

566
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:04,570
It's okay.

567
00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:06,539
It'll get better in no time.

568
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:10,210
This gum disease is killing me.

569
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:14,210
Get it treated at a dental clinic, Dad.

570
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,449
Okay, I will.

571
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,050
If this year's potato harvest goes well,

572
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:25,460
we can save some money.

573
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:28,559
Let's sell the farm and the house and move to Seoul.

574
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:30,400
When we get there,

575
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:33,099
I'll get my teeth treated.

576
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,570
Good grief.

577
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,199
Even if houses are expensive in Seoul,

578
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,670
I'm sure we can find a place for us two.

579
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,780
I've got your back, okay?

580
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:54,349
When we move to Seoul,

581
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,989
let's keep a little garden on the rooftop.

582
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,260
How about I make it into a potato field?

583
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,440
It felt like Dad was telling me with all his heart.

584
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,569
And so, I started studying again.

585
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,409
(English Key Points)

586
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:39,260
(Potato)

587
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:46,070
Dad.

588
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:48,409
I'm tagging along today.

589
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,409
Mi Jung?

590
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,280
Isn't today seed potato planting day?

591
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:56,409
Since you keep getting into fights, the others don't help you.

592
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,980
And you refuse to hire people. The only option is for me to help.

593
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:06,159
If the potato farming goes well, it'll do us good.

594
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,730
All right.

595
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,159
Like a date, shall we go together...

596
00:53:14,269 --> 00:53:15,329
just this once?

597
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:17,769
I'm in.

598
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,809
Okay. Here.

599
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:25,639
Up you go. Now then.

600
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:54,840
Mi Jung.

601
00:53:56,469 --> 00:53:58,280
If you're tired, take some rest in between.

602
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:01,210
I will.

603
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,909
Dad...

604
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:36,980
What is it?

605
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,429
Mi Jung!

606
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,059
Mi Jung!

607
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,369
What happened? Mi Jung?

608
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:12,349
Mi Jung. Wake up.

609
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,650
Mi Jung! Wake up!

610
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:18,190
Mi Jung! Wake up! Please!

611
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:20,219
Mi Jung!

612
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:22,130
Wake up!

613
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,289
Dad?

614
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,630
Dad...

615
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,730
Dad!

616
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:02,329
Mi Jung...

617
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:06,969
Mi Jung. Don't wait around.

618
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,309
Go to the hospital.

619
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,309
Dad... Don't tell me...

620
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,480
Dad had suffered from a severe gum disease for years.

621
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:23,519
Dad. Hang in there just a bit.

622
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,360
Just a bit, okay?

623
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:29,030
Excuse me! Please help us!

624
00:56:29,659 --> 00:56:31,800
- Mi Jung... - Over here!

625
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:34,928
Please help us!

626
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:37,969
- Someone, please help us! - Mi Jung...

627
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,239
Stop shouting.

628
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:43,980
Don't call the people over.

629
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,880
If they see us, they will...

630
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:50,050
No.

631
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:52,420
Mi Jung.

632
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:55,250
Leave me here,

633
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:57,559
and go home.

634
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,289
No.

635
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:03,130
I won't go.

636
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,369
Answer me, Mi Jung.

637
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,539
Isn't my daughter a good girl?

638
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:17,340
You're obedient, aren't you?

639
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,320
Mi Jung.

640
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:29,219
I'm sorry.

641
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,320
I'm so sorry, Mi Jung.

642
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:43,369
I'm a foolish dad...

643
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:46,300
who doesn't know if not told.

644
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:50,809
I'm sorry.

645
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,650
Stop crying.

646
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:05,960
Nobody must know about this, okay?

647
00:58:18,139 --> 00:58:20,300
My good-hearted, pretty daughter.

648
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:29,349
Mi Jung...

649
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,690
Nobody knows, right?

650
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:38,719
Oh, no.

651
00:58:39,389 --> 00:58:40,789
- See that? - What's going on?

652
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,190
- My goodness. - No.

653
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,940
Nobody knows.

654
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,929
- What happened? - Good grief.

655
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,010
I became all alone...

656
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,119
and was called a witch...

657
00:59:41,289 --> 00:59:42,650
who even killed her father.

660
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,340
As if making a run for it,

661
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:36,510
I left the village.

(Statistics)

663
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,510
Why did you choose statistics?

664
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:11,909
Through statistics,

665
01:01:12,679 --> 01:01:15,110
I have a life problem to solve.

666
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,920
Isn't he in our department?

667
01:01:20,019 --> 01:01:23,150
There's a reason the guys call him a psychopath.

668
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:27,730
You're wrong.

669
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:30,590
Your report was useless from the start.

670
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,260
It was full of errors.

(2017 Traffic Accident Fatality Statistics)

672
01:01:35,731 --> 01:01:37,769
The one who kicked her out...

673
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:40,000
was me.

674
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:48,010
I'll leave.

(Park Mi Jung)

677
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,619
was Park Mi Jung.

678
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,659
Is Park Mi Jung...

679
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:05,059
a real witch?
