00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:16,590
(Park Jin Young, Roh Jeong Eui)

2
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,299
(Lim Jae Hyuk, Jang Hee Ryung)

3
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:40,878
(The Witch)

4
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,879
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

5
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:42,879
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,949
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

7
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,469
(Taebaek, Jeongseon)

8
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,509
I'm going back to the very beginning.

9
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,639
In Taebaek, where we were both born and raised,

10
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,380
I will find a clue to lift her curse.

11
00:01:56,589 --> 00:02:00,800
(Episode 5: The Law of Death)

12
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,400
Welcome.

13
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,270
Hey.

14
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,710
Give me a minute.

15
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,550
How pretty.

16
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,219
Our flowers have a 100 percent success rate.

17
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,619
- Is that so? - Yes.

18
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,890
Good luck.

19
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,089
Thank you.

20
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:33,520
Bye.

21
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,189
Take a seat.

22
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,760
He's proposing today.

23
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,930
Proposing. I see.

24
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,929
I hope it goes well.

25
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,270
You came earlier than expected.

26
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,369
It's a weekday, so there was no traffic.

27
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,439
Do you want some tea?

28
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:54,710
No, I'm good.

29
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,610
I have another place to be.

30
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,779
Hey. How long has it been?

31
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,249
Let's see.

32
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:03,580
Three years after my mom passed away.

33
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,020
You're so indifferent.

34
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:08,689
- I'm sorry. - No. I'm the same.

35
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,589
But will everyone be free?

36
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,130
Min Jae and Ho Young will be happy to see you.

37
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,200
Remember Da Eun?

38
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,298
Yes, I do. Da Eun from liberal arts.

39
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:21,869
Yes. She's going to come, too.

40
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,000
Midong High's Korean teacher.

41
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,510
- She also lives in Taebaek. - Really?

42
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,479
That's good. As a matter of fact, I have to drop by school.

43
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:30,609
I'll see you again tomorrow.

44
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,710
- I'll get going. - Lee Dong Jin.

45
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,978
What's this?

46
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,349
Explain what's going on if you've called up all your friends.

47
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:40,589
You left your hometown. So why are you back all of a sudden?

48
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,320
Did something happen?

49
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,260
I'll tell you tomorrow when we all meet up.

50
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:02,239
I patrolled and cleaned the house every now and then.

51
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:04,080
But it might not look as nice.

52
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,010
Thank you for looking after an empty house.

53
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:08,450
You really don't have to.

54
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,260
By the way, are you going to keep that pretty place empty?

55
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,020
It's where I was born and raised.

56
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,229
And my mom's and dad's memories live there.

57
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,858
No matter how grand a palace is,

58
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:27,738
if no one lives in it, it soon collapses like scaffolding.

59
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:29,870
The same goes for the Park's house in Jeongun-ri.

60
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,870
Speaking of which,

61
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,739
there's some good news around here...

62
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,409
in Jeongun-ri.

63
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,179
I heard a resort would be built.

64
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,549
Land prices have nearly doubled.

65
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,289
It's the talk of the town.

66
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:47,859
How about it? Should I put it up for sale?

67
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,789
That house. Near that house...

68
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,099
Yes, right here.

69
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,960
There. That should be it.

70
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:00,129
This whole area, surrounding this house.

71
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,169
Right. It's quite large.

72
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,070
You've heard of KG Construction, right?

73
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,609
The biggest construction company in Korea.

74
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,408
Rumours have spread like wildfire that they won...

75
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:10,579
the contract or whatnot.

76
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,679
Did anyone get injured or die in this area?

77
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,219
What's this out of the blue?

78
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,560
To be precise, from the early 1990s to 2012.

79
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:22,859
What?

80
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,088
If it's you,

81
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:26,929
you must know everything that has happened in this town.

82
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:29,000
You're the village chief,

83
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:32,069
the long time respected elder, and a native of this town.

84
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,669
- Right? - Well...

85
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:36,539
I'm sure people die everywhere.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,109
But there were a number of strange incidents in that town.

87
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,279
All because of that pretty daughter of Park's.

88
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,419
Sir. That's totally groundless.

89
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:50,950
Anyway, it might've been a coincidence.

90
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,289
But after Park's daughter left this town,

91
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,219
nothing happened.

92
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,960
That is if I remember correctly.

93
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,158
The wild boar attacking Hyun Kyu,

94
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,729
the dry cleaner's son, was the last incident.

95
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:05,969
Are you, by any chance, in touch with Hyun Kyu?

96
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,500
That's it. Roll back. Lie on your side.

97
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,039
Lie on your side again.

98
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,279
Now pull your butt back.

99
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:16,608
That's it.

100
00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:17,848
One last time.

101
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:19,178
Go back to the other side...

102
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:23,219
and pull your butt back.

103
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,890
That's it.

104
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,390
You're doing great.

105
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,500
Hey, Dong Jin.

106
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,799
Don't kick me.

107
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,909
- Take this. - You're out.

108
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:47,739
No, I'm not.

109
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,778
Hyun Kyu. Can I record our conversation?

110
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:53,010
Go ahead.

111
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,779
(Voice Recording)

112
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:02,719
Are you writing a thesis or something?

113
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,358
You see...

114
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,460
Yes, it's sort of a thesis.

115
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,299
It's already been ten years.

116
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,929
Time really flies.

117
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:14,299
- Right? - Yes.

118
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,038
Back then, after what happened to Mi Jung's father,

119
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,510
I got worried she might not be eating...

120
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,940
and headed over with some bread.

121
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,109
That was everything.

122
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,289
Mi Jung. It's me, Hyun Kyu.

123
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:41,299
I thought you'd be refusing to eat,

124
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,059
so I brought some bread for you.

125
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,140
How long were you at Park Mi Jung's place?

126
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:54,539
Let's see.

127
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,049
I soon left after some words of consolation.

128
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,880
It wasn't that long.

129
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,220
Mi Jung.

130
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,449
I...

131
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:10,929
Stay strong.

132
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,199
Hyun Kyu was at Mi Jung's place...

133
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:23,169
for about 12 minutes and 35 seconds.

134
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,990
Darn it. What's that?

135
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,380
In three, let's run. Okay?

136
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,949
One,

137
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,919
two.

138
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,568
Seriously.

139
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:29,039
Is it even possible?

140
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,709
Of all times and places, a wild boar was there.

141
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,078
Did you also have feelings for Park Mi Jung?

142
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:37,610
Come on. That was all in the past.

143
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,049
You must've confessed to her that day.

144
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,380
No...

145
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,919
Must I even tell you that?

146
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,289
Oh, right.

147
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:50,688
I'm sorry. You don't have to if it bothers you.

148
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,260
No, it's not that.

149
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,730
I'm just embarrassed.

150
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,239
I couldn't confess my feelings,

151
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,500
and that happened in front of her house.

152
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,610
Gosh.

153
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,409
But...

154
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:14,250
After what happened, I got scared.

155
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,390
Like the rumours, I wondered if she was a real witch.

156
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:23,188
Name, Choi Hyun Kyu.

157
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:25,229
He had a crush on Park Mi Jung but couldn't confess.

158
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,389
Lived in the same town.

159
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,129
Got into a serious injury, taking 20 weeks to heal,

160
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,199
after a boar attacked him.

161
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,870
- Goodness. - Look at all of these.

162
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:40,740
Hurry up and give it to us.

163
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,880
Give what?

164
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,709
Your wedding invitation.

165
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,250
It's always the quiet ones who bring a baby home.

166
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:49,549
We understand. Now give it to us.

167
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,849
It's not that. How many times must I say it?

168
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,159
Then are you here to shop for land because of the resort development?

169
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,760
Gosh, Min Jae.

170
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,289
Do you have no brain?

171
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,730
Does Dong Jin seem the type?

172
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,859
What about your nonsense?

173
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,999
We'll soon be turning 30, but a baby?

174
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,400
Really, you two.

175
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:09,669
That's enough. We're sick of it.

176
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,870
Give me a second.

177
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,549
Did you even write a book, Dong Jin?

178
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,419
"Park Mi Jung?"

179
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,528
Don't tell me it's the Park Mi Jung we know.

180
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:35,600
(Translated by Park Mi Jung)

181
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,600
It's her.

182
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:41,739
I haven't heard that name in years. Park Mi Jung.

183
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,038
Wasn't she with Park Sang Ho when he got an electric shock?

184
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,809
She's the one Min Jae went on about being a witch, right?

185
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:51,579
The late Jung Hwan also had a crush on her, didn't he?

186
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:53,079
The same with Hong Mo.

187
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:54,849
"Hong Mo?"

188
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,620
Kim Hong Mo. Don't you remember him?

189
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,818
Back in the first year of middle school,

190
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:02,189
he was on crutches for the whole semester.

191
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,188
He transferred to Yeongwol right after the semester ended.

192
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:05,730
I've heard about it, too.

193
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,929
He got into a motorcycle accident on his way back...

194
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:11,529
from giving Mi Jung some candy.

195
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,799
Did you hear it from Hong Mo?

196
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
No.

197
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,299
From Mi Jung.

198
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,970
There was a moment when I was close to her.

199
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:27,110
Ho Young. Are you in contact with Hong Mo?

200
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,418
Not at the moment.

201
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:31,620
But I bet I could find him if I made some calls.

202
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:34,860
Dong Jin. We haven't seen each other in ages.

203
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:37,689
But why would you bring up the Witch?

204
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,400
So...

205
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,929
you still call her Witch.

206
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,439
Let's stop calling her that.

207
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,679
It's something I couldn't bring up in the past.

208
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,110
Honestly, there were many incidents and accidents around Park Mi Jung.

209
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,719
The male students got hurt, needed stitches,

210
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,779
or broke their bones.

211
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:06,689
Both the late Jung Hwan and Sang Ho...

212
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,720
were also involved with her.

213
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:11,730
He's right, Dong Jin.

214
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,990
Weren't we all scared back then?

215
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,400
Unexplainable events kept happening.

216
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,340
People just needed someone to blame because they were frightened.

217
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,939
But they meant no harm.

218
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,809
Why are you bringing Park Mi Jung up out of the blue?

219
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:32,579
Not long ago,

220
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:37,380
I coincidentally bumped into Park Mi Jung on the subway.

221
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,689
I hoped she was living a happy life.

222
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,620
But like a cursed person, she lived in hiding.

223
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,329
It looked as if life itself was still a burden.

224
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,270
We may have forgotten everything,

225
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,870
but it's still ongoing for Park Mi Jung.

226
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:59,340
Dong Jin. We were kids back then.

227
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,140
You're right. Everyone was immature.

228
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:06,679
But Mi Jung was also too young to endure it...

229
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,720
all by herself.

230
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:12,949
Either way,

231
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,120
it's in the past.

232
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:19,689
We can't turn back time, can we?

233
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:24,329
Exactly. If this were golf, we could take a mulligan.

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,069
"Mulligan?" What's that?

235
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,599
If you make a bad swing in golf,

236
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,370
you pretend it never happened and take another.

237
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:34,240
That's nice.

238
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,380
It'd be great if there was a mulligan in life. Right?

239
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:38,909
You're right.

240
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,449
As you said, those incidents can't be undone.

241
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,548
But if you guys can help me a little,

242
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:48,990
maybe she can come out of hiding and lead a normal life.

243
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,959
Help me.

244
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:55,600
What...

245
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,130
can we help you with?

246
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,000
Collecting data.

247
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:03,470
"Data?"

248
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:06,168
All the data on the incidents and accidents that happened...

249
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:07,980
around Mi Jung. I believe...

250
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:10,610
there's a pattern in it.

251
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:12,110
"A pattern."

252
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,579
Yes, an accident pattern.

253
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,619
If we can find the pattern, we can predict it.

254
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,020
And if we can predict it,

255
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,990
we can prevent unfortunate accidents from happening.

(Donated by Oh Mi Sook)

257
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,968
Since 2014, everything has been digitized...

258
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,370
and stored only on the server.

259
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,140
But back in our days,

260
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,438
a lot of records were still handwritten.

261
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,909
Most of what you need should be here.

262
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,040
The regulations require us to store them.

263
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:54,580

264
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,979
Thanks.

265
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,390
Don't mention it.

266
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,620
It's a relief that I work here.

267
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,699
I'll be in the teachers' room.

268
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,769
Search through them and if you need anything, call me.

269
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,040
I will.

270
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,439

271
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:55,709

326
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:44,999
there's this guy named Do Hoon.

327
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,969
He lived in Jeongun-ri when he was in elementary school.

328
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:49,570

329
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,509

I don't. I went to a different school.

you had a crush on her, right?

I didn't know since I was only a kid.

342
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:31,509

00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,830
He ran into Hong Mo by chance.

364
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,928
He couldn't exchange numbers or know his unit number.

365
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:26,070
What do we do?

366
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,659
How can I help you?

367
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
I'm looking for Kim Hong Mo.

368
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
What?

369
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,840
What's that? Are you here to sell me study guides?

370
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,070
My family doesn't need study guides.

371
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,640
What?

372
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:01,259
(Under maintenance)

373
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,439
Is anyone home?

374
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:11,769
Is anyone home?

375
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,780
- How can I help you? - I'm looking for Kim Hong Mo.

376
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,850
- Who? - Kim Hong Mo.

377
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:20,949
You got the wrong house.

378
00:27:21,979 --> 00:27:24,178
- Who is it? - I'm looking for Kim Hong Mo.

379
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:25,179
Wrong house.

380
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,900
Hello.

381
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:43,699
(Unit 505, no answer)

382
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,080
The elevator is under maintenance.

383
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
Darn it.

384
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,718
- Excuse me. - What?

385
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:57,380
Do you know a guy named Kim Hong Mo?

386
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,519
- Who? - Kim Hong Mo.

387
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:01,350
- I don't know him. - Okay.

388
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:45,830
- What's this about? - Well,

389
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,100
is this Kim Hong Mo's house?

390
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,439
Yes. Who is this?

391
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,810
Are you...

392
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,749
Lee Dong Jin, the son of Poongnyeon Agrochemicals' owner?

393
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,580
Hold on.

394
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:10,290
Do you recognize me?

395
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,030
Of course. You were close to Ho Young.

396
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,060
Hey, how did you find me here?

397
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:18,060
It's a long story.

398
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,769
Anyway, I heard from Sung Sik.

399
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:22,540
I see. Okay.

400
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,570
What's this about?

401
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,380
I have some questions for you.

402
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:30,540
Okay.

403
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:32,380
It's about Park Mi Jung from middle school.

404
00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:33,979
Park Mi Jung?

405
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,779
Hey, hold on. There's a playground in our apartment complex.

406
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,849
Could you wait there? I won't be long.

407
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,989
Okay.

408
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,870
- Hey, Dong Jin. - Gosh.

409
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:00,239
Hey.

410
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,919
- I'm sorry for making you wait. - No.

411
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,949
My baby kept crying because of you.

412
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:15,689
I see.

413
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,530
Well... Mi Jung.

414
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,998
You know tomorrow is White Day, right?

415
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,330
Here. This is for you.

416
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,479
Are you okay?

417
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:41,408
Can you get up?

418
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:42,479
Oh, no.

419
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:44,718
My body flew up in the air.

420
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,419
- Then I fell to the ground. - Are you all right?

421
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:49,860
Who knew my bones could break that easily?

422
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,590
Then...

423
00:30:55,429 --> 00:30:57,129
did you give her the candy because you liked her?

424
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,699
Yes. That's right.

425
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:00,199
She was quite pretty.

426
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:02,799
So you must have stayed in front of her house...

427
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,239
for about ten minutes.

428
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,439
Well, probably. Yes.

429
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:13,478
By the way, the insurance policy my mom bought for me...

430
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:15,309
didn't cover any of the treatment for fractures.

431
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,380
My gosh. Just thinking about that scares me.

432
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,249
But nowadays,

433
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,790
there's this insurance policy that covers simple fractures...

434
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:25,219
as well as cancer diagnosis.

435
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,130
(Clean Comprehensive Insurance)

436
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:32,268
Hey, I'm just giving it to you, so you can take a look.

437
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:33,300
I'm not trying to sell it to you.

438
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,238
I don't know why you're curious about that incident.

439
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:38,570
But I'm just worried about you. Okay?

440
00:31:39,209 --> 00:31:41,439
I know that not a lot of people in their 30s get injured.

441
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,739
But once it happens to you, there's no avoiding it.

442
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,610
Here.

443
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,120
You said you weren't trying to sell the policy.

444
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,120
I'm not. Just give it a read.

445
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:56,620
Name, Kim Hong Mo.

446
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:58,119
He liked Park Mi Jung when he was in middle school.

447
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,130
He stayed with her for about ten minutes.

448
00:32:00,189 --> 00:32:01,329
He needed seven weeks of medical treatment...

449
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,729
after a car accident. A minor injury.

450
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:06,469
(Fight as one)

451
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:18,409
(Let's fight as one, our fellow coal miners.)

452
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,299
(Let's fight as one, our fellow coal miners.)

453
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,169

(Analytical Manufacturing Office)

455
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,919
Hello. Do you know where Bang Ju Sung is?

456
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:00,850
Bang Ju Sung?

457
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:03,790
Oh, him. Why don't you check all the way over there?

458
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:07,290
- Okay. Thank you. - Check over there.

459
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:21,909
(Raw Coal Unit 4)

460
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,739
Bang Ju Sung?

461
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,290
Was it the spring picnic?

462
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,189
The fall picnic.

463
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:43,900
Right. I do remember seeing the fall foliage.

464
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:46,030
The fall picnic.

465
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,339
No wonder. The gimbap is so good!

466
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,810
- My gosh. - Can I get some kimchi?

467
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,179
Mi Jung.

468
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,689
Why are you eating alone?

469
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,900
Well...

470
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
No.

471
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,340
I don't want to hear it.

472
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:31,180
I'll get going now.

473
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,860
I get goosebumps just thinking about that day.

474
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,959
What do you mean?

475
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,269
Imagine if I actually confessed my feelings to her that day.

476
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:55,329
I would have ended up like Sang Ho or Jung Hwan.

477
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,739
Name, Bang Ju Sung.

478
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,268
He tried to confess his feelings to Park Mi Jung but failed.

479
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:01,340
He broke his ankle and needed ten weeks of medical treatment.

480
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,638
Park Mi Jung was watching me.

481
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,849
I wanted to make a good impression, and that's when it happened.

482
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,919
- Hey. - Hey. Are you all right?

483
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:15,249
Oh, right.

484
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:17,889
I think that might have happened because Park Mi Jung...

485
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,530
was farther away.

486
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,769
I was merely in the school infirmary with Park Mi Jung. That was all.

487
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,469
But I smashed my head the next day while playing basketball.

488
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,340
- Stop him. - We have to stop him.

489
00:35:34,209 --> 00:35:35,639
We weren't in the same class.

490
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:37,510
No one really noticed my presence.

491
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,650
I doubt she knew my name.

492
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:43,518
It's a bit of a stretch to say...

493
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,320
that the accident occurred because of her.

494
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:49,519
Park Mi Jung?

495
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,389
I'm not sure.

496
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,130
My crush tends to change quite quickly.

497
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,098
I'm not sure if I had a crush on her...

498
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,629
- when I got injured. - Hey. Are you okay?

499
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,729
- Hey. How bad is it? - Are you all right?

500
00:36:23,189 --> 00:36:26,329
In 2011, 28 students were in Year 2 Class 3.

501
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:28,188
In the first semester,

502
00:36:28,189 --> 00:36:29,829
our numbers were assigned based on our height.

503
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,598
The columns of desks were rearranged every month.

504
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,700
(Park Mi Jung, Bang Ju Sung)

505
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,570
Her number was five.

506
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,009
The people in the accidents were in the same room as her...

507
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,110
and within 10m of her.

508
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,180
The space isn't limited or confined only to the classroom.

509
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,260
Up, down, left, and right. Space in all directions...

510
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,660
counts.

511
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,510
The people in the accidents were about 10m away from her.

512
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:28,748
(List of Accidents and Incidents at Midong High School)

513
00:38:28,749 --> 00:38:30,680
The collected data was converted into statistics.

514
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,888
To find differences and similarities among the people in the accidents,

515
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:35,089
I categorized them by severity.

516
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,388
Minor injuries, serious injuries, and death.

517
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:37,689
(Food poisoning, minor injury)

518
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,260
(Space, time, name)

519
00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:52,539
Based on the data I analysed,

520
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:55,070
I found a common pattern.

521
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,879
Space, time, name, conversation, and expression.

522
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,380
(Space, time, name, conversation, and expression)

523
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,919
Based on the pattern, a hypothesis was established.

524
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,150
One.

525
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,659
Being in the same space with her is dangerous.

526
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:16,099
(1. Being in the same space with her is dangerous.)

527
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,959
Two. Holding...

528
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,998
Holding a conversation with her is dangerous.

529
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:23,240
(2. Holding a conversation with her is dangerous.)

530
00:39:23,669 --> 00:39:25,438
Three. Being...

531
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:27,109
Being acquainted with her is dangerous.

532
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,139
(3. Being acquainted with her is dangerous.)

533
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:31,138
Four. Confessing your feelings to her is dangerous.

534
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:34,150
(4. Confessing your feelings to her is dangerous.)

535
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:35,809
Five.

536
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,719
Breaking all of these rules...

537
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,450
Breaking all of these rules...

538
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,789
could result in death.

539
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:48,329
(5. Breaking all of these rules could result in death.)

540
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,800
(Breaking all of these rules...)

541
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,729
Breaking all of these rules...

542
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,900
will...

543
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:58,998
result in death.

544
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:02,209
(Breaking all of these rules will result in death.)

545
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,679
(Hypotheses)

546
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,579
However, the precondition for all these hypotheses is...

547
00:40:12,749 --> 00:40:15,019
that one must have feelings for Park Mi Jung.

548
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:29,269
Da Eun.

549
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:31,340
Did I come at a late hour?

550
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,768
(Space: Midong High School, Jeongun-ri Village Hall, downtown)

551
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,578
(Time spent with Park Mi Jung: 5 to 50 minutes, over 10 minutes)

552
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:38,478
(Had conversations between 5 to 10 exchanges)

553
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:40,279
(Park Sang Ho, Kim Jung Hwan: Dead)

554
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,279
(Name: People Park Mi Jung knew the names of)

555
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,220
(Did they confess their feelings to her?)

556
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,689
Here.

557
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:50,260
Thank you.

558
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,590
Let's sit down.

559
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,700
Are you all right?

560
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,939
Why are you asking me that?

561
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:07,809
Did you look in the mirror?

562
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:09,380
The mirror?

563
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,439
Oh, this? I couldn't shave. That's all. I'm fine.

564
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,680
What brought you here this late at night?

565
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:22,050
Well...

566
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:24,019
After Mi Jung...

567
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,430
quit school,

568
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,260
I felt so uncomfortable.

569
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:38,340
I saw you in front of her house...

570
00:41:38,669 --> 00:41:40,439
on the graduation day.

571
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:42,570
You put our yearbook in her mailbox.

572
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:45,709
I see.

573
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:50,249
I liked...

574
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,519
Ik Jong a lot.

575
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,590
The day...

576
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,189
when Ik Jong got into an accident,

577
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:03,829
he gave his reference books to Mi Jung...

578
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,229
and encouraged her.

579
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,769
I hated her so much.

580
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,539
My mom said...

581
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:17,939
her mom had died giving birth to her.

582
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,849
I told you.

583
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,079
Mi Jung is really a witch.

584
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,530
I hated her so much.

585
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:42,939
Actually,

586
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,680
I was the one who started the rumour...

587
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,720
saying that she was a witch.

588
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,019
I see...

589
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:08,160
I didn't know things would get out of hand like that.

590
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:12,800
When I realized that I put a heavy rock...

591
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:16,030
on a drowning person,

592
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,070
I regretted it a lot.

593
00:43:21,669 --> 00:43:23,110
If you meet Mi Jung,

594
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,309
please...

595
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,650
tell her...

596
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,059
that I'm truly sorry...

597
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,630
for what I did.

598
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,030
I came to say this.

599
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:54,709
It'd be nice for me to deliver the message,

600
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,410
but it'd be better...

601
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:00,249
if you told her directly.

602
00:44:07,889 --> 00:44:09,320
I still don't have the courage to do so.

603
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:11,260
You'll have a chance.

604
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:13,459
Maybe...

605
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:18,030
Mi Jung is waiting for you too.

606
00:44:24,939 --> 00:44:25,939
Right.

607
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,979
Did you find the pattern you wanted?

608
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,680
Well...

609
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:39,889
I did find a meaningful pattern,

610
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,058
but there are too many variables.

611
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:47,689
There's no data on Mi Jung from 2012 to the present.

612
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,200
Ik Jong told me...

613
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,530
that Mi Jung was accepted into Hanguk University...

614
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:57,400
and ended up majoring in the same department.

615
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,499
Im Ik Jong?

616
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:03,539
Yes.

617
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:22,459
(Lee Seo A, Nam Ye Bin)

618
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,598
(Park Seong Hun, Lee Min Ho, Ju Han Sol)

619
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:25,959
(Heo Il Kyun, Bang Ju Sung)

620
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:38,578
You're here.

621
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:40,110
A visitor has been waiting for you.

622
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:41,910
Oh, hello.

623
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,280
I'm Lee Dong Jin, your junior from Midong High School.

624
00:45:46,889 --> 00:45:48,950
I heard it from Da Eun.

625
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:50,320
Come on in.

626
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:55,889
(Attorney Im Ik Jong)

627
00:45:59,229 --> 00:46:00,229
So...

628
00:46:01,229 --> 00:46:02,970
what brought you here?

629
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,139
I know it's strange.

630
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:12,610
But I came to ask about when you were stung by a wasp.

631
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,010
A wasp? Me?

632
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,180
Yes.

633
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:19,950
I heard you had been stung by a wasp around February 2011...

634
00:46:20,749 --> 00:46:22,789
in front of Jeongun Church.

635
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,919
In front of Jeongun Church?

636
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,828
I think that's right.

637
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,629
But I don't remember it clearly...

638
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,169
because it was a long time ago.

639
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:36,769
Why is that important, though?

640
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:41,510
Do you perhaps remember Park Mi Jung?

641
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:45,539
Mi Jung?

642
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:52,919
Well, we often met because we went to the same church.

643
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:57,089
Later, we met again when she joined our department.

644
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,220
That's all.

645
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:01,090
How was her college life?

646
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:04,828
She dropped out soon,

647
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:07,329
so I don't remember clearly.

648
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:14,509
Name, Im Ik Jong.

649
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:15,808
He went to Jeongun Church with her.

650
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:17,939
He doesn't remember the wasp incident clearly.

651
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:33,360
Mr. Lee Hyeon Cheol.

652
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,329
Do you know Park Mi Jung?

653
00:47:42,499 --> 00:47:43,539
Yes.

654
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:47,138
(Recording)

655
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:50,010
She usually came late at night.

656
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,409
The movie that is screening at 12:30am will start shortly.

657
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:53,780
Please enter the theatre.

658
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:57,978
I wondered if she had come...

659
00:47:57,979 --> 00:47:59,849
only after checking that there was no audience.

660
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:02,820
Because I found it odd that...

661
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,320
she always came...

662
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,329
when there were just a few people or no one.

663
00:48:10,459 --> 00:48:12,200
Have a good time.

664
00:48:26,709 --> 00:48:28,708
- Where are you going? - I was going to meet you.

665
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:30,518
It's open only during the day. So if you set the tables...

666
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:32,249
and open a food stall here at night, it'll be successful.

667
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:54,709
Did you have a crush on her?

668
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:57,979
Yes.

669
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,880
Did you stay in the same place with her for a long time?

670
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,510
Yes.

671
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,479
Did you talk a lot?

672
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,619
Yes, we did.

673
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,019
Did she know your name?

674
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,019
Yes.

675
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,389
Did you follow her in the subway and tell her your feelings?

676
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,430
Yes, I did.

677
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:27,470
You could've died, but you didn't.

678
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,209
The doctor said...

679
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:34,450
it would've been very dangerous if they had been any later.

680
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,320
The rules of death in my hypothesis didn't apply to him.

681
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:43,389
What variable...

682
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,260
saved him?

683
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,530
Is it a serious crime?

684
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,229
Sorry?

685
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:57,269
The fact that I followed her.

686
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:02,240
I also know I shouldn't have done that.

687
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,039
It feels like I almost died as punishment for that.

688
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,280
She reported me, right?

689
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:15,689
- No. - What?

690
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:20,829
Why would you, a police officer, come then?

691
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:22,660
Pardon?

692
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:27,030
I'm not a police officer.

693
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,939
I was scared for no reason.

694
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:35,369
Who are you then?

695
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,510
I'm Lee Dong Jin.

696
00:50:38,439 --> 00:50:40,049
That's not what I asked.

697
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,180
Does Mi Jung...

698
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,419
still come?

699
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,150
No.

700
00:50:47,789 --> 00:50:49,950
I haven't seen her since then.

701
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,360
(Manager Brad)

702
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,970
"Brad?" Is that your English name, Hyeon Cheol?

703
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:03,169
This?

704
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:05,840
We use nicknames in the theatre.

705
00:51:06,269 --> 00:51:08,369
And I like Brad Pitt.

706
00:51:09,209 --> 00:51:10,240
That's why I'm Brad.

707
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,010
Did Mi Jung know your nickname,

708
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,280
not your real name?

709
00:51:18,749 --> 00:51:20,749
Come to think of it, yes.

710
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,320
I didn't tell her my real name.

711
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,168
(1. Being in the same space with her is dangerous.)

712
00:51:36,169 --> 00:51:38,098
(2. Holding a conversation with her is dangerous.)

713
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,139
(3. Being acquainted with her is dangerous.)

714
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:49,110
(3. Being acquainted with her is dangerous.)

715
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,228
(3. If she knows...)

716
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:10,499
If she knows your name,

717
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,840
it is dangerous.

718
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:19,379
(3. If she knows your name, it is dangerous.)

719
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:25,450
(3. If she knows your name, it is dangerous.)

720
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,789
It's not simply being acquainted with her.

721
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,820
If she knows your name, it is dangerous.

722
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:44,869
Being in the same space is dangerous.

723
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,939
Then what's the range of that space?

724
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,439
Got it.

725
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,079
Let me see.

726
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,309
It's about 8m.

727
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,749
Okay.

728
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,919
The range of dangerous space is approximately 10m.

729
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,419
It's just an estimate.

730
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,360
The distance from my room to the rooftop rail is about 8m.

731
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:44,659
Considering the distance from the rooftop rail to her room,

732
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,860
it's roughly 10m away.

733
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:49,930
This should be safe, right?

734
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,559
What's wrong with this?

735
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,760
Is it broken?

736
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,800
She takes a walk...

737
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,869
in such a small space.

738
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:55,550
I'm facing her.

739
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,419
I see her,

740
00:57:01,329 --> 00:57:02,990
but she can't see me.

741
00:58:35,789 --> 00:58:36,849
It's 10m.

742
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,419
Being within a 10m radius of her is dangerous.

743
00:58:54,369 --> 00:58:58,339
(1. Being in the same space is dangerous.)

744
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,809
(Being in the same space)

745
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:09,918
(Being within a 10m radius...)

746
00:59:09,919 --> 00:59:13,688
(of her is...)

747
00:59:13,689 --> 00:59:18,998
(1. Being within a 10m radius of her...)

748
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:24,598
(is dangerous.)

749
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:25,669
Being...

750
00:59:26,439 --> 00:59:29,110
within a 10m radius of her...

751
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:31,639
is dangerous.

752
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,970
The scratch made me realize...

753
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,169
that I...

754
01:00:04,939 --> 01:00:07,039
meet all the prerequisites...

755
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:12,380
of this hypothesis.

756
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,150
Someone came to see you earlier.

757
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,689
He said he would be waiting at the nearby cafe.

758
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,618
Who?

759
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:55,689
I'm Lee Dong Jin.

760
01:00:56,229 --> 01:00:57,229
(Lee Dong Jin)

761
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,300
"Data analyst?"

762
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:00,999
Mi Jung.

763
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:04,099
Can I get your number?

764
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:07,439
Park Mi Jung?

765
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,269
You're talking about that freshman girl, right?

766
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:10,879
But she's quite popular.

767
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,579
People from other departments come to see her too.

768
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,019
Seriously. Why do you have to live in the slums?

769
01:01:19,249 --> 01:01:20,889
And all alone as a woman, to boot.

770
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:24,119
This is the only way I can live alone.

771
01:01:24,289 --> 01:01:25,820
Please stand there for a moment.

772
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,059
What an odd guy he is.

773
01:01:31,459 --> 01:01:32,999
What am I even doing right now?

774
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:35,800
There's only one way...

775
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,470
to minimize errors.

776
01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:40,498
How?

777
01:01:40,499 --> 01:01:41,769
It's to...

778
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,180
test out the rules myself.
