1
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,251
Shh!

2
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:38,695
Don't interrupt me!

3
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,242
Shh!

4
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:45,867
- They might hear you.
- Keep going.

5
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:47,945
The neighbors will hear you.

6
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:53,749
It feels amazing, daddy!

7
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:55,703
Keep going!

8
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:57,921
Keep it down, April.

9
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:03,679
- You feel so good, daddy!
- Babe, wait.

10
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:05,029
Shh!

11
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:06,719
Hey! They might hear you.

12
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:09,389
More, Daddy. More!

13
00:01:10,114 --> 00:01:11,328
You feel amazing.

14
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:13,327
Go all out!

15
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,339
Don't stop!

16
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:18,724
Faster!

17
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:21,014
Keep going!

18
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:24,250
Pull my hair. Pull it!

19
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:27,233
So good!

20
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,378
More!

21
00:01:28,403 --> 00:01:31,247
Push harder. Hurry up,
you're too slow!

22
00:01:31,906 --> 00:01:33,604
Give it to me, daddy.

23
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:34,788
Give it to me.

24
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,266
- Go all the way.
- Okay, okay!

25
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,351
- Harder.
- Yes. I said yes.

26
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,936
Babe, I think I'm getting dehydrated.

27
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:46,860
Give me something to drink.

28
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:49,057
Do you want water,
or soda?

29
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:51,179
Water. Just water.

30
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:52,359
Here.

31
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,541
Speed up!

32
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:55,296
Push harder.

33
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:56,885
More.

34
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,369
Keep going.

35
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,242
Want this?

36
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:01,947
Nope.

37
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:03,434
Hun...

38
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:05,675
Enough, April.

39
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:07,249
Stop.

40
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:09,710
One last round, please?

41
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,578
Have mercy on me, babe.

42
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:17,718
The next thing that will come out
of me, if not blood, are my innards.

43
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:20,370
You're annoying.

44
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:23,679
I told you to take vitamins and ginseng.

45
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,734
We're only human.

46
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:26,861
Okay?

47
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:28,733
Let me try.

48
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:30,047
Believe me.

49
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:31,812
- That one is useless now.
- You can do it.

50
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:33,015
Come on.

51
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,519
April, that's enough.

52
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:38,187
Cut it out!

53
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:40,867
I said stop it!

54
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:43,273
Damn it!

55
00:02:47,674 --> 00:02:50,158
Are you really sure
you don't want to stay?

56
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:52,702
Enough, April.

57
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:54,328
Dad.

58
00:02:54,353 --> 00:02:56,585
April, we've talked
about this. Right?

59
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:59,456
It's over. Okay?

60
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm just here, okay?

61
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:03,780
Anytime.

62
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:06,724
Thank you.

63
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:18,164
Goodbye, April.

64
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,022
You're annoying!

65
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:25,164
I wasn't satisfied!

66
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,631
Mommy, please buy me a toy gun.

67
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:31,583
- In what color?
- Blue.

68
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:33,710
- Blue? Don't you like red?
- Are you sure about blue?

69
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,093
No, blue.

70
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:36,701
- How about you?
- Barbie.

71
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:39,424
- Barbie? Alright, Daddy will buy it.
- How many do you want?

72
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,281
Five? Five right away?

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,960
And you, just one?

74
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:48,578
It's good that you've split
with April, you know.

75
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:52,695
Even the first time you
introduced her to me,

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,858
I could already feel she won't
bring anything good to your life.

77
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,793
You're too harsh with your words.

78
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:02,559
You know, April has
some good points too.

79
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:05,076
Sure, good points like what?

80
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:09,274
The woman who gives the
best blowjob in the world?

81
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:16,181
Oh. Why just that?

82
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:19,367
Aren't you taking the
vitamins I gave you?

83
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:24,880
Didn't you yourself tell me

84
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:27,190
that when April opens her mouth

85
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:28,447
she can handle both of your...

86
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:31,046
Okay, enough. Stop it.

87
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:34,601
Hey, someone's being sensitive.

88
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,800
I'm not sensitive.

89
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,162
Just sensible.

90
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,888
Really? You've really
had 33 girlfriends?

91
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:43,700
You know, I was only thirteen
when I started flirting.

92
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:44,864
Wow!

93
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,406
You did not discover the joys
of jerking off.

94
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,489
You went straight
to having girlfriends.

95
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:52,674
Yeah, that's why I don't believe
in those joys of masturbation.

96
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:54,963
From now on, Orson...

97
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:58,007
every drop counts.

98
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:01,101
Miyo? Boss Tony
is calling for you.

99
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:06,297
Copy, copy.

100
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,510
You've been giving excellent
service as our front desk officer,

101
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:20,781
giving extraordinary hospitality
and accommodation to our guests, Miyo.

102
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,180
Thank you, sir.

103
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:28,466
That's why I thought of
recommending you as supervisor,

104
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:32,816
since our previous supervisor will be
reassigned to our new hotel in Cebu.

105
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:35,370
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much!

106
00:05:35,395 --> 00:05:36,788
Okay, okay.

107
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:39,030
But then, just chill
and stay cool for now

108
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:41,317
because it's still just
a recommendation.

109
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:45,615
Of course, you realize that the final
decision still remains with Ma'am Bianca.

110
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,023
Yes, I do know that, Sir Tony.

111
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:49,559
I just wanted to say that

112
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,140
I do not want to waste
the trust you've given me.

113
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,436
Well, that's only fair.

114
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:58,342
Because if you do something foolish
and disrespectful in front of Ma'am Bianca,

115
00:05:58,367 --> 00:05:59,548
I'll be embarrassed as well.

116
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:01,416
- Remember that. Okay?
- Yes, sir.

117
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,575
Enjoy your stay at La Destino, sir.
Thank you.

118
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,766
The eagle has landed,
The eagle has landed.

119
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:12,444
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

120
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,702
I'll see you tonight?

121
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,034
Of course.

122
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:18,445
Good morning, Ma'am Bianca.

123
00:06:24,457 --> 00:06:26,405
Has Ma'am Bianca already passed by?

124
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:27,901
Yes, she has just gone upstairs.

125
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:32,209
Too bad I didn't see her.
I could have at least said good morning.

126
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:35,254
Why are you so eager
to see the goddess?

127
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:38,413
It's because Boss Tony said

128
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:41,811
he recommended me to be the
supervisor of the concierge services.

129
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:43,796
Orson, can't you see?

130
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:44,852
See what?

131
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,172
This is a sign.

132
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:51,196
A sign for me to finally settle down,

133
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,571
and start a family.

134
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:56,149
Hey, you don't seem excited.

135
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:57,719
What should I have done, then?

136
00:06:57,744 --> 00:06:59,616
Clap and do a
somersault in happiness

137
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:01,725
because you want to increase
the world population?

138
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:45,647
Dude.

139
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,593
What happened?
Why did you suddenly disconnect?

140
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:50,509
Ivy?

141
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:51,949
Miyo?

142
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:55,350
Miyo, it is you!

143
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:58,183
How have you been?

144
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,108
- Do you have company?
- No, I don't. Have a seat.

145
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:01,210
Alright.

146
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,689
I can't believe
we crossed paths here.

147
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:06,394
What are you doing here?

148
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:07,668
Oh, this is where I work.

149
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:09,612
- At the front desk.
- Wow!

150
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:12,037
You know, I never thought
you'd turn out like this.

151
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:17,038
I used to think you'd become a pervert
or maybe even a male prostitute.

152
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:20,402
You're too much.
Oh, do you live here in Manila now?

153
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:22,519
No. I still go home to Ibaan.

154
00:08:22,574 --> 00:08:25,699
But I rent a condo
in Pasig for work.

155
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:26,724
Hold on.

156
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,270
Hey.

157
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:33,994
So, you're the one handling
the family business now, huh?

158
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:35,605
Just the sales.

159
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,308
Production and management is
still handled by Mom and Dad.

160
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:40,138
How about you,
have you been here for a while?

161
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,155
Just about right.
Around twenty years.

162
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,766
Twenty years?

163
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,151
No, I'm just kidding.

164
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:47,230
Did you enjoy it, though?

165
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:48,902
I did enjoy those twenty years.

166
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,710
Does that make me forty years old now?
It was just a joke.

167
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:54,896
How about you order something for us?
I'm afraid you'd ignore my offer.

168
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:56,507
Hey, no way. I won't ignore you.

169
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:57,572
I promise.

170
00:08:57,597 --> 00:08:58,830
You did ghost me.

171
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:03,373
That was in the past.
Okay, fine. I'll buy now.

172
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:04,733
Hello?

173
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:08,064
- You're such a jerk.
- Orson, are you there?

174
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,457
Nothing has changed about you.

175
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,785
Just a bit.
Something still changed.

176
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:14,254
Good change.

177
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,199
Good change.

178
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:19,816
Buddy.

179
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:21,590
Oh, perfect.

180
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:24,088
Let me introduce you to my
childhood friend. Meet Ivy.

181
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:25,113
Hi.

182
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:26,199
Hi!

183
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:33,011
We need to go back to the counter.
Ma'am Bianca might come down.

184
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:34,990
Buddy, let me pass for now.

185
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:37,183
It's been a while since
Ivy and I last saw each other.

186
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,371
- How many years, Ivy?
- More than twelve years.

187
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:40,705
Wow, that long?

188
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,207
- That long.
- Miyo.

189
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,214
We need to go back.

190
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:45,611
Come on, buddy.

191
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:47,879
- Handle it first.
- It's okay, Miyo. I have to go, anyway.

192
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:49,075
Alright.

193
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,449
- Bye. See you!
- Bye-bye.

194
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:53,879
- See you.
- Bye.

195
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,590
See you! Take care.

196
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:01,330
"Take care"? Really?

197
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,098
What?
Look, you're getting hard.

198
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:06,442
Walk. Walk!

199
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:07,467
Go ahead!

200
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,738
Enjoy your stay at
the La Destino Hotel.

201
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:15,698
Oh, no.

202
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:18,323
Buddy, she was my first love.

203
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:22,731
And we were neighbors in Ibaan.

204
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,485
That's why our families became close.

205
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:29,214
And when my parents separated,

206
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,323
she was the one
who supported me, man.

207
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:37,254
Is this the part where we
play some background music?

208
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:40,618
That's when we developed
feelings for each other.

209
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,433
Really?

210
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,425
And she's the kind of girl
without any social media accounts.

211
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:49,525
Oh no.

212
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,793
People like that have secrets.

213
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:53,428
No, dude.

214
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,014
She doesn't have a ring.

215
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:59,713
And the surname she uses
on her calling card is still the same.

216
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:04,293
But I think she's already taken.

217
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,699
Oh right, I haven't asked.

218
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:12,726
But if it's just a boyfriend--

219
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:15,596
It's Errol. Bro!

220
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:17,491
Errol! Come here.

221
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:21,831
Hey bro, what's up?

222
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:25,008
The girl I was talking to earlier,

223
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,795
have you been seeing her here?

224
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,464
Actually, yeah, bro.

225
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:32,269
She's a mistress.

226
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:35,713
Confirmed.
She's hiding something.

227
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:36,762
No, no.

228
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:40,129
Ivy wouldn't agree being a mistress, man.
Her family is strictly Catholic.

229
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,559
Is she your friend, bro?

230
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:44,918
Sorry, but...

231
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:46,898
I'm telling the truth.

232
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,590
Earlier...

233
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,636
I saw her on CCTV.

234
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,278
She went up to the twelfth floor.

235
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:53,753
Twelfth floor, bro.

236
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,323
Do you want to see?

237
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:58,120
No, no. This can't be.

238
00:11:58,145 --> 00:11:59,151
I'm sure there's a reason

239
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,228
- why Ivy is there.
- Paps...

240
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:03,119
we know that when someone
goes straight to the twelfth floor,

241
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:04,917
they go straight to the special suite.

242
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:08,777
There's a reason
why Ivy is there, okay?

243
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:10,964
Your girl is leaving, Miyo.

244
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:14,433
Shit!

245
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:16,064
Hey. Hey!

246
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:17,783
Hey, wait. Where are you going?

247
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,776
Miyo, where are you going?

248
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:22,768
I'll check the special suite
to see what's going on there.

249
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:24,176
Are you crazy?

250
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:27,021
You know who uses
the special suite, right?

251
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:30,212
I can only confirm that
when I see the room.

252
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:32,559
You do know you're breaking
the rules, don't you?

253
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,456
You might lose that promotion.

254
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:35,650
I'll be quick, dude.

255
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:37,738
If there's a problem, just radio me.

256
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:38,965
I'll go ahead.

257
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:02,115
I'm inside, dude.

258
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:05,585
What do you see?

259
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,421
There are two plates.

260
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:10,866
Only two people ate.

261
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:12,649
And there's wine.

262
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:16,510
But...

263
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,067
There's no sign
that they had sex.

264
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:24,757
Wait, I'll check the bathroom.

265
00:13:24,782 --> 00:13:26,331
No, dude. Don't!

266
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:36,640
Shit. It's wet, man.

267
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:39,484
Dude, you better leave.

268
00:13:46,152 --> 00:13:48,082
Only one towel was used.

269
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:50,584
Maybe just for the client.

270
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,413
Hold on, let me check the bedroom.

271
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:55,472
Dude, don't bother.

272
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,816
Dude!

273
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:10,296
I can't believe this.

274
00:14:13,863 --> 00:14:15,564
They actually did it.

275
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,968
Orson, Ivy is back!

276
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,654
Miyo! Miyo!

277
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,737
Mayday!

278
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:32,171
Ivy is back.

279
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:35,402
Miyo, where are you?

280
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:38,124
Why?

281
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,683
Ivy came back.
Leave. Hurry!

282
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:46,053
Shit.

283
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:47,078
Shit. Shit!

284
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:48,101
Shit.

285
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:49,749
Shit.

286
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:00,607
I'm here.

287
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,341
Did you find it?

288
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,749
No, not yet.

289
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:06,013
Then let the housekeeping find it.

290
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,971
I don't want to leave things here.

291
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:09,676
We might have issues later.

292
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:12,748
Alright, I'll help you.

293
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:23,832
Found it.

294
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:27,809
Finally.

295
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,267
- Thank you.
- You see?

296
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:33,341
There's nothing to be upset about.
I don't know why you're acting grumpy.

297
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,115
I'm not grumpy.

298
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:36,201
Yes, you are.

299
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:37,896
Good thing you're cute.

300
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:48,490
I thought you had a meeting?

301
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,586
Let them wait.
I'm the boss.

302
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:13,835
Dude!

303
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,049
So, were you caught?

304
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:19,260
Who's with your friend?

305
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:24,480
Who?

306
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:28,054
Hey!

307
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:35,592
Dencio.

308
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:36,737
One shot of tequila.

309
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,144
Isn't it too early for that?

310
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:43,385
Is there a problem?

311
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,079
None.

312
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,612
Don't let yourself be too affected.

313
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:51,643
It won't make you any more handsome.

314
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:58,564
What are you doing here?

315
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:01,768
Well, I wanted to have a bite
before heading home.

316
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:04,069
It feels like all my energy
has been drained.

317
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:05,648
Really?

318
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,495
Like all my strength has been sucked out.

319
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:09,368
I feel so weak.

320
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:15,807
Are you okay?

321
00:18:16,524 --> 00:18:18,784
You might want to be alone.

322
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:20,548
Maybe I'm bothering you.

323
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:22,767
I'm fine.

324
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:24,354
Why don't you join me?

325
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:26,308
Instead of looking like a fool there.

326
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,292
I still can't believe
that you don't have a girlfriend yet.

327
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,601
Back when we were together,

328
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:34,995
You managed to get away with
two girlfriends without me knowing.

329
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:37,922
You know, I only got
a break from it now.

330
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,368
And also...

331
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:41,292
I want to take things seriously now.

332
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,331
You? Getting serious?

333
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:44,547
For sure?

334
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:48,120
My next one
will be the last.

335
00:18:48,204 --> 00:18:49,628
Really?

336
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:50,876
How about you?

337
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:51,969
Me?

338
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:53,971
I mean, who's your boyfriend?

339
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:55,876
No one.

340
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:57,933
I'm focused on my career right now.

341
00:18:58,257 --> 00:19:01,030
Are you sure you didn't
have a boyfriend after me?

342
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,951
I got traumatized by you, that's why.

343
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,089
Just kidding.

344
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,377
I haven't really been
thinking about it.

345
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:12,276
Don't you think of having a family?

346
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:14,174
Of course, I do.

347
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,096
I'm still old school.

348
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,464
I still want to get married.

349
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:19,903
Have kids.

350
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:22,861
Wait, when did
Grace get married?

351
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:24,596
What?

352
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,284
She has kids now?

353
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:29,050
Yes, she has two.

354
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,770
Seven, and two years old.

355
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:34,104
Wow, Uncle Bobet and Aunt Nena
are grandparents now.

356
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:37,324
They're even pressuring me
because their grandkids are all girls.

357
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:41,433
They want me to give them a boy
to carry on the family name.

358
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:43,268
Looks like we're in the same boat.

359
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:45,128
My mom is the same way with me.

360
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,972
She always pressures me
into settling down.

361
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:50,597
How are Aunt Sally and Uncle Ric?

362
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,011
They each have their own families now.

363
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:59,822
Papa's in Dubai. He married
his fellow OFW there.

364
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:01,784
And now they have three children.

365
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,611
Mama, on the other hand, is in London.

366
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,447
She married a British guy.

367
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,908
Now they have two green-eyed daughters.

368
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:15,893
My mom keeps telling me that
she really wants to have a grandson.

369
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:17,815
We're the same, then.

370
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:20,308
Why don't we make it
a joint project?

371
00:20:23,617 --> 00:20:25,581
Hello? Miyo?

372
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:28,721
What happened to you?

373
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:29,901
Nothing, nothing.

374
00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:37,229
You know, I've been thinking about
how to make my condo family-friendly.

375
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,574
Let me see.

376
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:39,611
Sure, sure.

377
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:41,190
Wait, let me turn my video on.

378
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,003
There you go, see it?

379
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:46,517
Oh, right.

380
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:48,397
Do you really live there?

381
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:51,025
Is that not a model unit?

382
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,664
- That's why...
- Daddy, I'm home!

383
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:55,689
Hello!

384
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,280
Daddy, who is she?

385
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:58,954
- Hi!
- Wait, wait!

386
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:01,455
My God, Miyo!
Who is that?

387
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,744
- Wait, wait.
- Kiss!

388
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:05,433
Wait a minute, April.

389
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,532
April, April.

390
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,838
What are you doing here?

391
00:21:07,863 --> 00:21:11,876
I've been thinking about what
you said about wanting a family.

392
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:15,102
So, let's go.
Let's make a family!

393
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:16,127
What?

394
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:20,050
Baby, it's okay.

395
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:22,097
Fertilize me.

396
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:24,049
What the heck are you saying?

397
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,838
Daddy, plow my wet field

398
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:30,377
and plant your seeds.

399
00:21:31,076 --> 00:21:32,196
April, April.

400
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:33,244
Wait a second, okay?

401
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:34,495
You know what?

402
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,170
You're just adjusting to this.

403
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:39,000
Because it's our first day
without sex.

404
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,048
Okay?

405
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:41,753
It will pass.

406
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:43,016
You think so?

407
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,759
Yes, yes.

408
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:47,430
Well, Daddy.
I'm here, so...

409
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:50,479
let's just have
one last breakup sex.

410
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:51,597
No, April.

411
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,033
No, it's not possible.

412
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:54,424
You might get ill.

413
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:57,046
Put this on
and better go home, okay?

414
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:59,000
- Good night!
- Just for ten minutes, please?

415
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:00,079
Ten minutes, promise.

416
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:01,144
No, no.

417
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,454
- Five minutes?
- Good night!

418
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:03,479
Four minutes?

419
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:05,110
Three? Come on, Daddy.

420
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:07,002
Damn it, April.
Three minutes?

421
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:08,425
What am I, a rabbit?

422
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,450
Go on.

423
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,641
- Oh come on, Daddy.
- Take care, okay?

424
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,596
- Bye-bye!
- Daddy!

425
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:23,472
Ivy!

426
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,886
Damn it...

427
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:29,657
Screw you!

428
00:22:30,353 --> 00:22:31,633
So annoying!

429
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:36,901
What are you doing here?

430
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:40,050
Why do you have that expression?

431
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,698
It's like you don't want to see me
in the hotel you work for.

432
00:22:43,723 --> 00:22:47,367
No. It's not that, but,
it's about last night.

433
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:49,518
Look, Miyo.

434
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,940
- If this is about what I saw last night...
- No, Ivy. Please,

435
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:55,284
let me explain.

436
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:58,694
Okay, I didn't expect to be
ambushed by my ex last night.

437
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:01,822
But nothing happened
between us, I promise.

438
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:03,857
You don't have to explain anything.

439
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:07,830
No, I just want you to know that
I'm serious about what I said

440
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:09,246
about wanting to settle down.

441
00:23:10,152 --> 00:23:14,126
And when I get promoted to
supervisor for concierge services,

442
00:23:14,446 --> 00:23:17,630
I'll be able to save up
for my future family.

443
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:19,269
Okay.

444
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:24,307
That's all you have to say, "Okay"?

445
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:27,181
I believe you.

446
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:32,603
Just in time though, my friend whom I was
going to introduce to you just messaged me.

447
00:23:33,882 --> 00:23:36,315
But, I don't think I want
to start from zero anymore.

448
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:41,153
I kind of want someone
I already know.

449
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:43,030
Ah.

450
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,480
So you'll choose from your exes?

451
00:23:46,836 --> 00:23:48,436
It's kind of like that.

452
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:50,422
Well, that's understandable.

453
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:52,373
Because you've been
through stuff together.

454
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,209
Especially if you both
have similar life goals.

455
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:05,687
Miyo, I need to leave now.

456
00:24:06,397 --> 00:24:08,730
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll escort you to the exit.

457
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,057
Wait, Miyo. I need to use
the restroom. You go ahead.

458
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:15,440
No, I'll come with you.
I mean, I'll wait for you.

459
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:17,346
I'm on break anyway.

460
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:21,591
Daddy, Daddy!

461
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:25,245
Hey, wait.
I'm not your dad.

462
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,499
Oh my God, finally!

463
00:24:27,524 --> 00:24:29,204
You two have finally met.

464
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,002
Honey, meet our child, Lebron.

465
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:35,587
What are you saying?

466
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:36,757
I get it.

467
00:24:36,782 --> 00:24:40,430
You don't want me to force you to
have a child because we're still young,

468
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:42,667
so we can travel and do a lot of things.

469
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:44,800
That's why I adopted him.

470
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:47,199
Did you adopt overnight?

471
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:49,643
Maybe you kidnapped this child.
Are you okay?

472
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:51,487
Don't be so over the top!

473
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:54,433
He's the son of our family driver.

474
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:57,848
He's on loan, but if you want,
I can replace him.

475
00:24:57,917 --> 00:24:58,917
Replace?

476
00:24:58,942 --> 00:24:59,958
Yes.

477
00:24:59,983 --> 00:25:02,878
Wow! April, come with me.

478
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:04,583
Here's your child.

479
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:08,270
I don't get you!

480
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:10,958
You're so confusing, Miyo!

481
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:13,339
You said you wanted a family,

482
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:15,591
and I'm willing
to give you a child!

483
00:25:15,793 --> 00:25:16,856
Then what?

484
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,419
You're mad again.
What do you want, really?

485
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:22,969
Sorry. Sorry if it's confusing.

486
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:25,012
Alright? But let me clarify.

487
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:26,309
Listen carefully, please.

488
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:27,395
Okay?

489
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:30,074
You're beautiful, April.

490
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:31,824
Intelligent,

491
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:34,115
and you have a strong personality.

492
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,520
I know.

493
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:38,122
But you're too much!

494
00:25:38,192 --> 00:25:39,192
Too much!

495
00:25:39,661 --> 00:25:41,817
You know, you're never contented.

496
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,918
And every time we meet, it's like
you won't stop until you've extracted

497
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:50,051
- every bit of energy from me.
- That is because you're so good!

498
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:51,708
April, April.

499
00:25:52,441 --> 00:25:53,816
You deserve somebody better.

500
00:25:53,964 --> 00:25:55,418
I'm not the man for you.

501
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:57,778
April.

502
00:26:02,483 --> 00:26:03,763
I'll pray for you.

503
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,311
Believe that I will pray for you.

504
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:09,466
So you can find someone
who matches your skill

505
00:26:09,593 --> 00:26:13,106
and most importantly, your stamina.

506
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:14,811
I'll go back to the hotel.

507
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:16,265
Dad!

508
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:17,311
Dad!

509
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:18,895
Damn you!

510
00:26:22,356 --> 00:26:23,480
Ivy?

511
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:28,692
I'm sorry, but did you
notice a woman in there?

512
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:31,507
There was one, but she has left.

513
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,570
Babe.

514
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:38,176
I've never asked for a favor
from you about work, right?

515
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:40,489
Why, what's up?

516
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:43,732
Well, I have a friend
who's working here.

517
00:26:44,014 --> 00:26:46,547
He's applying for a position
in the concierge services.

518
00:26:46,812 --> 00:26:48,012
It's Emilio Mala.

519
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:51,669
Yes...

520
00:26:51,762 --> 00:26:55,779
I've seen his file. He's highly
recommended by the manager

521
00:26:55,804 --> 00:26:59,208
but he still lacks the experience
to be a supervisor.

522
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:03,856
But I know him and even though
he lacks the work experience,

523
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:07,083
I'm sure he'll make up for it
with his dedication.

524
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:09,723
You've never been like that.

525
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,755
What's with this friend of yours?

526
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:13,958
He's also from Ibaan.

527
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:15,513
My childhood friend.

528
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:19,163
He wants to settle down,
have a family.

529
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,166
So, I wanted to help.

530
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:24,939
I'll think about it.

531
00:27:25,616 --> 00:27:26,962
That works for me, babe.

532
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,219
Ma'am Bianca is a lesbian?

533
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:33,093
That's crazy!

534
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:35,345
I wonder if Sir Mark knows about it.

535
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:37,281
I don't care about those two anymore.

536
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:39,585
I'm more stressed about April.

537
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,238
She really should be
banned from the hotel.

538
00:27:42,382 --> 00:27:44,480
Dude, this isn't your condo.

539
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:45,781
This is a hotel.

540
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:48,960
We can't just ban
whoever we want

541
00:27:48,985 --> 00:27:51,880
because of your lesbian friend.

542
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:53,265
I know.

543
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:56,567
But you might come up
with an idea,

544
00:27:56,967 --> 00:28:02,017
because I feel that she hangs
out here because of Bianca.

545
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:03,084
Why?

546
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,567
Do you think Ivy
will go back to you?

547
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:09,569
You think she'd leave
Ma'am Bianca for you?

548
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,215
Yes, I'm sure.

549
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:13,781
I know she still
has feelings for me.

550
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:16,519
And why are you so negative?

551
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:17,930
I thought you were my best friend?

552
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:20,590
It's like you're taking Bianca's side.

553
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:23,476
Don't be silly.

554
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:24,544
You're a jerk.

555
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:34,515
Yes, ma'am?

556
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,186
Please tell Mr. Emilio Mala
to come to my office.

557
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:38,211
Okay, ma'am.

558
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:46,520
Miyo, Ma'am Bianca
is calling for you.

559
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,475
Miyo?

560
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:51,046
What for?

561
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:53,406
I don't know, but she needs you now.
Go upstairs.

562
00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:56,762
See. I told you, buddy.

563
00:28:56,991 --> 00:28:59,638
You're getting yourself into trouble.

564
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:01,695
I haven't done anything yet.

565
00:29:02,077 --> 00:29:06,374
What if Ma'am Bianca finds out
you came from her suite yesterday?

566
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,607
After all, they own this hotel.

567
00:29:08,632 --> 00:29:11,525
They have ways of finding out
what's happening here.

568
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:19,482
We shall see what we can do
to accommodate your request.

569
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:23,317
The presidential suite is reserved
for your party but,

570
00:29:23,342 --> 00:29:25,942
I can't assure that I can close down
the entire floor.

571
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,036
Wanna join us, Mr. Mala?

572
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:01,356
Mr. Mala!

573
00:30:02,054 --> 00:30:03,094
Are you sick?

574
00:30:03,724 --> 00:30:04,948
No, ma'am.

575
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:06,980
Okay, so you're Mr. Mala.

576
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,006
Yes, ma'am.

577
00:30:08,078 --> 00:30:11,052
You might want to sit down.
There is a seat, right?

578
00:30:11,077 --> 00:30:13,341
You're right, ma'am.
That's what I was thinking.

579
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:18,038
You're highly recommended by Tony

580
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:21,528
for the position of supervisor
in the concierge services.

581
00:30:22,217 --> 00:30:24,217
But I have to be honest with you,

582
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:28,034
you lack experience for
the supervisorial work.

583
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,216
- But ma'am--
- But despite of that,

584
00:30:30,366 --> 00:30:33,794
one of my good friends told me
you can do the job.

585
00:30:36,412 --> 00:30:37,871
Which friend are you...

586
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:39,335
Excuse me?

587
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:42,780
I mean, which friend recommended me?

588
00:30:43,382 --> 00:30:44,645
Ivy Bian.

589
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:47,612
Oh, it's Ivy.

590
00:30:48,101 --> 00:30:49,659
She's my childhood friend.

591
00:30:49,896 --> 00:30:52,362
I didn't know you were friends.

592
00:30:54,523 --> 00:30:59,448
Okay, Mr. Mala. Tell me where
you see yourself a year from now.

593
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:03,297
A year from now?

594
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,421
Honey, I'm home.

595
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:16,379
And are you willing to do
everything for that to happen?

596
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,742
Yes, ma'am.

597
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:22,673
Actually, I'm already starting
to work towards my dreams.

598
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:25,037
Okay, good. Thank you, Mr. Mala.

599
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,758
Thank you as well, ma'am.
Thank you so much.

600
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,701
Ma'am Bianca's schedule
for the month is fully booked.

601
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:36,601
But if it will be quick, I can try to fit
you in for thirty minutes next Friday.

602
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,461
Alright, I'll schedule you in.

603
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:44,485
Ma'am, excuse me.
Boss Bianca is looking for you.

604
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,758
Can you help me with
my schedule adjustment?

605
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,187
Why, is Ma'am Bianca firing you?

606
00:31:57,672 --> 00:31:58,891
No.

607
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,570
She interviewed me earlier
for my application.

608
00:32:03,163 --> 00:32:05,282
But what's the schedule adjustment for?

609
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,994
I took a picture of
Ma'am Bianca's schedule.

610
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:12,552
Okay, okay. Here's the plan.

611
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:16,238
I'll accompany Ivy whenever
Ma'am Bianca is busy.

612
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:21,109
I just want to show her
that I am the one.

613
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:26,563
Please fix my schedule for today.

614
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:27,610
Got it, ma'am.

615
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:29,649
Perfect.

616
00:32:34,773 --> 00:32:35,996
- Hello?
- Hello.

617
00:32:36,493 --> 00:32:37,586
Are you free later?

618
00:32:37,611 --> 00:32:39,131
I'm just finishing something.

619
00:32:39,382 --> 00:32:40,440
I'm already off work.

620
00:32:40,465 --> 00:32:42,145
Take a break, let's go out.

621
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:43,960
I can't.

622
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:47,781
You're too serious about your work.
It will just be quick.

623
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:48,968
I'll treat you.

624
00:32:49,725 --> 00:32:50,992
Where are we going?

625
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,960
Do you still go home to Ibaan?

626
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:03,966
I have nothing to go back to there.

627
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:06,031
Don't you want to follow your parents?

628
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:07,944
No.

629
00:33:07,969 --> 00:33:10,281
They already have their own families there.

630
00:33:10,328 --> 00:33:11,328
And so...

631
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:13,531
I don't want to bother them.

632
00:33:13,944 --> 00:33:15,769
You can visit my family, can't you?

633
00:33:17,192 --> 00:33:20,318
Why? Has your dad forgiven me
after he caught us in your room?

634
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:21,748
Why didn't you lock the door?

635
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:24,691
Well, you didn't tell me to lock it.

636
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:26,258
Well, Mom likes you.

637
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:29,352
So if you want to go back there,
she'll take care of you.

638
00:33:32,992 --> 00:33:34,696
I envy them.

639
00:33:35,428 --> 00:33:37,681
Someday, we'll experience that too.

640
00:33:43,983 --> 00:33:46,617
Are you okay?
Did I say something wrong?

641
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:51,422
No. It's just that the
family makes me envious.

642
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,826
You know, I feel like I won't
experience something that.

643
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:57,022
Why not?

644
00:33:57,866 --> 00:34:01,360
You weren't my last relationship, Miyo.

645
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,250
Wait, I thought you didn't
have a boyfriend after me?

646
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:05,585
No, I didn't.

647
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,586
But I did have a girlfriend.

648
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:10,947
I'm a lesbian, Miyo.

649
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Ivy...

650
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:19,427
Am I the reason why
you became a lesbian?

651
00:34:19,452 --> 00:34:23,244
Wow, seriously? I've been
attracted to girls for a long time.

652
00:34:24,016 --> 00:34:25,724
Even when we were together?

653
00:34:25,749 --> 00:34:28,949
Yes, why? Did you not
get attracted to other guys?

654
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:30,552
Hey... What? No.

655
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:32,266
- Really?
- No.

656
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,789
Isn't that like a part of growing up?

657
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:38,123
Well it's not a part of
my growing up, so...

658
00:34:38,148 --> 00:34:39,148
I understand.

659
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:41,717
But how many girlfriends
have you had?

660
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:44,703
One in fourth-year high school,

661
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:48,975
one in college, and then...

662
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,271
Is there someone now?

663
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,061
It's a bit complicated, you see.

664
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:59,565
Why? Wasn't your parents' reaction
good when you came out to them?

665
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:02,592
Actually, they don't know yet.

666
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:05,086
No one in my family knows.

667
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:10,057
So I'm just hoping that one day,
they'll understand

668
00:35:10,082 --> 00:35:11,998
and there won't be any
awkward moments coming out.

669
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,554
Times have changed, you know.

670
00:35:15,511 --> 00:35:17,655
And maybe it'll be okay with them.

671
00:35:17,738 --> 00:35:19,576
You know my family, right?

672
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:20,975
Conservative.

673
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:23,522
Close to the church.
Close to God.

674
00:35:23,815 --> 00:35:27,975
Ivy, I'm sorry but I can't fully
relate to what you're going through.

675
00:35:29,038 --> 00:35:31,400
But I can assure you one thing.

676
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:34,816
- What is it now?
- That...

677
00:35:35,315 --> 00:35:37,257
I'll always be here for you.

678
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:39,717
Jerk. I've heard that before.

679
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:43,483
That's why I want to make up
for the mistakes I've made in your life.

680
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:46,995
And I just want to promise you that

681
00:35:47,198 --> 00:35:50,290
this time around,
I won't make you cry.

682
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,575
Oh come on, why would I
cry because of you?

683
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,386
Cut it out, Miyo.

684
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,380
- Well, there's that.
- You talk too much.

685
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:10,557
Thanks for the treat.
Until next time!

686
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:16,280
Of course. Anything for you.

687
00:36:20,768 --> 00:36:24,452
What a joke. Good night!

688
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:26,811
Good night.

689
00:36:32,495 --> 00:36:33,925
You're doomed, Ma'am Bianca.

690
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,152
This is it!

691
00:36:38,844 --> 00:36:40,920
Yes, Mr. Lim?

692
00:36:41,962 --> 00:36:44,561
Okay, okay. We're on our way.

693
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:48,488
- Let's go, Monette.
- To room 420.

694
00:36:48,513 --> 00:36:49,858
I'm out, bro.

695
00:36:49,883 --> 00:36:52,249
I'll go ahead.
I'm done here, no more problems.

696
00:36:52,274 --> 00:36:53,953
Excited much? Got plans?

697
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,336
Hello, Ivy?
What are you doing?

698
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:58,436
Nothing, just finishing up at work.

699
00:37:05,712 --> 00:37:06,712
Ivy...

700
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:09,533
Why are you crying?

701
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:16,238
We're watching cartoons.

702
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:18,668
Don't you get it?

703
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,153
I'm having PMS right now.

704
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:23,887
I'm emotional.

705
00:37:26,462 --> 00:37:28,371
Come over here.

706
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,337
Hi!

707
00:37:35,362 --> 00:37:37,042
Nice seeing you again.

708
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:38,244
Let's take a seat.

709
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:42,672
- Hello, Ivy.
- Hello?

710
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:44,283
You have a bike, right?

711
00:37:55,884 --> 00:37:58,166
So that dog that passed by the...

712
00:37:58,704 --> 00:38:00,663
So that dog that passed by the...

713
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:03,633
Have you looked at my wheel?
Didn't I ask you to check it earlier?

714
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,260
Oh my goodness!

715
00:38:07,563 --> 00:38:10,638
Do you want to hold this instead?
You're really crazy, huh?

716
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,557
- Here.
- Crazy.

717
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:17,205
Let's head to Terminal 3.

718
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:22,579
Hello?

719
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:23,802
Are you busy right now?

720
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:28,157
Can you come over here?
I'm only working half-day.

721
00:38:57,552 --> 00:38:59,300
Please apply this.

722
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:05,296
- Where?
- Here. Just here.

723
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:06,761
- Here?
- Yes.

724
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,812
Go lower.

725
00:39:08,837 --> 00:39:09,837
Here, like that?

726
00:39:09,862 --> 00:39:10,862
No, here.

727
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:11,973
Oh, there.

728
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:16,063
There you go.

729
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:18,047
You're acting as if we're not friends!

730
00:39:18,072 --> 00:39:19,703
- What? Why?
- Move them down, I said.

731
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:21,603
- Down?
- Yes!

732
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,899
- Here?
- Yes, there.

733
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:24,946
Alright.

734
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:26,914
Amazing!

735
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:29,156
And don't forget my back, okay?

736
00:39:29,181 --> 00:39:30,181
Oh, sure.

737
00:39:35,922 --> 00:39:37,522
Where... Where do you want?

738
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:39,078
Right there, you decide.

739
00:39:39,103 --> 00:39:40,935
- Somewhere down?
- All of it.

740
00:39:44,052 --> 00:39:46,615
- Here?
- Then move up.

741
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,683
- Up?
- Yes.

742
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:51,480
- Here?
- There.

743
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:53,055
Got it.
Is that okay?

744
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:55,140
- That's okay.
- That's okay?

745
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:56,364
Absolutely okay!

746
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:00,898
Just there, okay?

747
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:03,224
Yes. I'm not leaving.

748
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:04,929
Wow!

749
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,270
Miyo!

750
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:41,873
What are you doing?

751
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,934
Why are your eyes rolling back?

752
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,799
- Is there something wrong?
- Nothing, nothing!

753
00:40:47,824 --> 00:40:49,067
Nothing's wrong, right?

754
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,041
No, that was nothing.

755
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:56,981
- Is there a problem?
- No, no.

756
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,136
- Just relax.
- Okay.

757
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:01,536
Keep it there, okay?

758
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:06,256
Can I ask something?

759
00:41:06,301 --> 00:41:07,301
What is it?

760
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:11,989
You think you can forgive me for all the
things that I have done to you in the past?

761
00:41:12,175 --> 00:41:13,175
Seriously?

762
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:14,981
Do I look like I'm kidding?

763
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:17,445
You still are a bit slow, huh?

764
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:24,856
You can be a pervert but when it comes to
human behavior, you're incredibly clueless.

765
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:27,768
Your response is quite extreme.

766
00:41:28,387 --> 00:41:32,675
You took my simple question and
complicated it with "human behavior."

767
00:41:32,918 --> 00:41:38,220
If I had a grudge against you, do you
think I would let you inside this condo

768
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,966
and grab a pizza while we chat?

769
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:43,629
Simple logic, isn't it?

770
00:41:45,974 --> 00:41:48,307
If I've hurt you in the past--

771
00:41:48,332 --> 00:41:50,551
Yes, you really hurt me.

772
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:53,864
I'm really sorry.

773
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:57,980
To be honest, I really hated you

774
00:41:58,762 --> 00:42:01,474
because you just
disappeared in an instant.

775
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:04,474
Then you even made
an effort to avoid me.

776
00:42:04,846 --> 00:42:08,963
I really prayed every night
for your dick to shrink.

777
00:42:10,285 --> 00:42:11,372
My God, Ivy.

778
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:13,950
And fortunately,

779
00:42:14,285 --> 00:42:17,208
God does not answer
to those kinds of prayers.

780
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:22,052
As it seems, your masculinity
equipment is still operational.

781
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:23,776
But don't worry.

782
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:29,620
Now, twelve years later, I can
look back and tell you honestly

783
00:42:30,269 --> 00:42:31,309
I understand.

784
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:34,619
I understand why you did it.

785
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,090
You do?

786
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:38,981
Of course.

787
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:43,924
Nothing is more important to you
than your uncontrollable erections.

788
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:49,590
You think you're so manly,
but the truth is...

789
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:52,387
Ask me what's the truth.

790
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,158
What is it?

791
00:42:56,192 --> 00:42:57,192
You're scared.

792
00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:00,081
Scared of what?

793
00:43:00,387 --> 00:43:01,573
You're scared of love.

794
00:43:02,738 --> 00:43:03,947
You're scared of me.

795
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,583
Be honest.

796
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:08,275
You were really falling for me back then.

797
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:09,691
So you got scared.

798
00:43:12,115 --> 00:43:15,080
Deny it and I might smack
this pizza at you.

799
00:43:17,496 --> 00:43:18,496
See?

800
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,083
You know, you're the only one.

801
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,657
The only one who understands me.

802
00:43:29,268 --> 00:43:30,268
You're out of luck.

803
00:44:40,402 --> 00:44:41,402
You're the only one...

804
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:45,360
The only one who understands me, Ivy.

805
00:44:58,346 --> 00:45:00,008
Damn you, Ivy!

806
00:45:01,151 --> 00:45:02,459
I love you!

807
00:45:03,586 --> 00:45:05,142
Shit!

808
00:45:09,608 --> 00:45:11,236
Dude, the development is great.

809
00:45:11,782 --> 00:45:15,095
Do you know that it's Ivy herself
who invites me out?

810
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,931
And I think I'm getting there.

811
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:21,415
Ivy has fallen for me.

812
00:45:21,671 --> 00:45:25,540
She's only inviting you out, and
you're acting like the girl is into you.

813
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:30,471
What if you're just in the
friendzone in this situation?

814
00:45:32,415 --> 00:45:33,633
You know what's the problem with you?

815
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:35,511
You're such a downer!

816
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:37,190
You're so negative.

817
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,462
I'm having a great time,
and you're dampening my spirits.

818
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,544
I'm just giving you a reality check.

819
00:45:43,376 --> 00:45:45,039
Excuse me, boys. Excuse me.

820
00:45:45,064 --> 00:45:47,079
We have a very special guest.

821
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:54,469
Miyo. Okay, this is Ms. April. I want
you to take care of her, okay?

822
00:45:54,494 --> 00:45:55,798
Hi, Miyo.

823
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:57,668
What are you doing here?

824
00:45:57,785 --> 00:45:59,519
Miyo, what are you saying?

825
00:45:59,939 --> 00:46:02,381
I'm sorry, Miss April, about that.

826
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:03,798
Okay? I'm really sorry.

827
00:46:03,823 --> 00:46:07,155
It's fine. I know him well.
Miyo is just a playful person.

828
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,742
- Oh, okay.
- Hi, Miss April.

829
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:11,555
Sunset Suite is ready.
Thank you so much.

830
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,152
I hope you enjoy your stay.

831
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:14,219
Thank you so much.

832
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:15,563
See you, Miyo.

833
00:46:15,588 --> 00:46:17,268
Piolo, Piolo. The bag.

834
00:46:17,293 --> 00:46:18,293
Ma'am.

835
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:24,195
Shit!

836
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,220
Bro.

837
00:46:25,245 --> 00:46:26,245
Behave.

838
00:46:26,657 --> 00:46:27,854
Just behave.

839
00:46:28,492 --> 00:46:29,492
Behave.

840
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:32,585
Hold on!

841
00:46:34,116 --> 00:46:35,390
I said hold on.

842
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:40,930
Oh! Now it's my turn to ask.
What are you doing here?

843
00:46:40,955 --> 00:46:43,108
Pack your things. You can't be here.

844
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,592
Why, what's the problem?

845
00:46:45,204 --> 00:46:46,749
You. You're my problem.

846
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:48,454
What am I even doing?

847
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:50,107
You know what?

848
00:46:50,556 --> 00:46:52,978
You just can't be here.
I'm not joking.

849
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:55,913
Is that so? Do you
want me to call security?

850
00:46:55,956 --> 00:46:59,892
I am a guest of this hotel
and you are harassing me.

851
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,506
What are you even doing here?

852
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,845
Daddy, I've been missing you.

853
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,868
And she's missing you too.

854
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,978
- Don't you miss her?
- April.

855
00:47:14,003 --> 00:47:18,359
April, April. Can you just go back
to your condo and stay quiet there?

856
00:47:18,384 --> 00:47:21,520
- Okay?
- No. I don't wanna be alone there.

857
00:47:21,545 --> 00:47:25,681
Because every time I'm alone,
you're all I think about.

858
00:47:26,284 --> 00:47:27,517
Why, what are you thinking?

859
00:47:27,542 --> 00:47:28,691
What's wrong with you?

860
00:47:28,716 --> 00:47:33,100
Trying to be clueless? Of course,
I miss what's inside your underwear.

861
00:47:34,654 --> 00:47:37,127
That's it? You're only thinking
about what's in my pants?

862
00:47:37,152 --> 00:47:41,382
Aren't you attached to your own dick?
Then, of course, I miss you too.

863
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:42,825
So what now?

864
00:47:43,453 --> 00:47:44,861
What do you mean?

865
00:47:45,034 --> 00:47:47,121
You know, you're getting annoying.

866
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,302
Since you're already here, might as well...

867
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:54,770
Look, are you out of your mind?
I'm working, okay?

868
00:47:54,812 --> 00:47:56,207
Exactly.

869
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:58,371
Isn't your job to serve me as well?

870
00:47:58,396 --> 00:47:59,941
What kind of service?

871
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:01,899
You're being annoying!

872
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:03,917
April, I don't have time.

873
00:48:03,942 --> 00:48:05,072
Okay?

874
00:48:05,097 --> 00:48:09,888
Right. You don't have time
so let's hurry, then!

875
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,622
I don't want it, April!

876
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:12,857
Just ten minutes!

877
00:48:12,882 --> 00:48:14,082
I'm not in the mood, okay?

878
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:15,787
You're being silly.

879
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:18,457
Hey!

880
00:48:18,498 --> 00:48:20,565
You're too persistent.
What the heck!

881
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:21,913
- This is rape.
- Why?

882
00:48:21,938 --> 00:48:24,282
- Admit that this is your fantasy too.
- What fantasy?

883
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:26,307
Let me take care of you, okay?

884
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:37,570
- They might hear us.
- Cut it out.

885
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:42,199
Hey!

886
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,297
Shit. Oh my God.

887
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,094
Stop it.

888
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,210
April, stop it.

889
00:48:53,404 --> 00:48:54,417
What are you doing?

890
00:49:07,866 --> 00:49:08,977
April.

891
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,569
Sir, are you okay?

892
00:49:32,116 --> 00:49:33,959
I'm fine, I'm fine.

893
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:35,319
Why do you look so pale?

894
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:38,506
How can I not become pale?

895
00:49:39,446 --> 00:49:43,116
She wouldn't stop until all my
body fluids have been used up.

896
00:49:44,062 --> 00:49:45,062
Sir?

897
00:49:46,601 --> 00:49:47,601
Sir.

898
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:49,514
Nevermind, nevermind.

899
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:53,798
Let me have these.

900
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,920
Before I forget...

901
00:50:22,534 --> 00:50:23,974
Happy anniversary.

902
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:27,727
Happy anniversary! What's this?

903
00:50:31,389 --> 00:50:34,947
You don't need to shower me
with these expensive gifts.

904
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:38,053
You've already spent so much
when we visited Paris.

905
00:50:40,734 --> 00:50:42,389
About Paris...

906
00:50:43,899 --> 00:50:47,545
Daddy has a request
that I can't refuse.

907
00:50:48,707 --> 00:50:51,041
Our family is going to Europe.

908
00:50:51,858 --> 00:50:55,366
He wants Mark and I
to go with them.

909
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:01,496
So it's scheduled
on our anniversary?

910
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:04,154
So that's why you
have an apology gift?

911
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,110
I hope you understand.

912
00:51:07,153 --> 00:51:08,381
I'm going home.

913
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:10,537
Sit down.

914
00:51:11,431 --> 00:51:13,764
If someone's going
to be upset, that's me.

915
00:51:14,689 --> 00:51:16,555
And what would
you be upset about?

916
00:51:16,936 --> 00:51:20,272
I noticed recently that you
haven't been answering my calls.

917
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:22,873
So are you getting jealous?

918
00:51:23,517 --> 00:51:25,952
You're going to have me
followed by your pet dogs again?

919
00:51:26,738 --> 00:51:28,671
You're overreacting again.

920
00:51:29,385 --> 00:51:31,514
I just want to know if
something is wrong.

921
00:51:34,213 --> 00:51:35,396
You know what's wrong?

922
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:39,990
We've been together
for three years, Bianca.

923
00:51:40,076 --> 00:51:41,295
Three years.

924
00:51:41,574 --> 00:51:45,063
But until now I sneak into
the hotel just to see you.

925
00:51:45,496 --> 00:51:46,737
Three years.

926
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:48,232
I'm the official one.

927
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,803
But I'm hiding as if
I'm the secret lover.

928
00:51:51,086 --> 00:51:53,169
You know I don't have a choice, right?

929
00:51:53,925 --> 00:51:55,647
This is for my father.

930
00:51:58,725 --> 00:52:00,350
But I've spoken with Mark.

931
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:02,467
So, what did you talk about?

932
00:52:03,147 --> 00:52:05,614
We can continue with our act.

933
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,732
We're going to get married.

934
00:52:07,986 --> 00:52:10,436
But I'll let him be,
he'll let us be, and...

935
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,469
Really?

936
00:52:11,494 --> 00:52:12,694
You'll marry him?

937
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:15,739
Ivy, I don't have a choice.

938
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,085
I can't go against my family's will.

939
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:21,061
There are millions at stake.

940
00:52:21,398 --> 00:52:23,473
Let's just talk after the wedding.

941
00:52:42,648 --> 00:52:43,834
Hello?

942
00:52:44,506 --> 00:52:45,506
Miyo?

943
00:52:46,702 --> 00:52:50,226
Imagine that. We were together
for a year when she told me that

944
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,375
she needed to pretend to be engaged
to his closeted best friend.

945
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:58,993
And they even have to get married just
so their families wouldn't disown them.

946
00:53:01,424 --> 00:53:03,104
You don't deserve that.

947
00:53:03,924 --> 00:53:04,924
I know.

948
00:53:06,745 --> 00:53:08,025
Why did you agree?

949
00:53:08,195 --> 00:53:10,667
Well, because I'm stupid.
Because I love her.

950
00:53:11,823 --> 00:53:16,233
You know, if she truly loves you
she wouldn't do that to you.

951
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:20,244
And it's not fair that you're
always the one sacrificing.

952
00:53:21,658 --> 00:53:23,925
Since when has love been fair?

953
00:53:26,363 --> 00:53:28,453
Since when has life been fair?

954
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:31,989
You're right.

955
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,523
But it also depends on the person
and what they wish to do in life.

956
00:53:39,515 --> 00:53:42,885
Because in life, there are
things we cannot control

957
00:53:43,324 --> 00:53:45,058
and things we can control.

958
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:47,679
You really have a way with words.

959
00:53:47,918 --> 00:53:50,990
If only I weren't feeling like this,
I might've already smacked you.

960
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:53,544
Is there any tequila left?

961
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:55,423
You've finished it.

962
00:53:57,914 --> 00:54:00,322
Damn, this thing called love.

963
00:54:01,181 --> 00:54:06,129
You know, you should think about
the things you're getting into.

964
00:54:06,425 --> 00:54:11,976
You shouldn't always
be reckless and then...

965
00:54:13,044 --> 00:54:14,044
Ivy.

966
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:16,579
Ivy.

967
00:54:26,124 --> 00:54:28,599
There. Stay here.

968
00:54:29,616 --> 00:54:31,988
Lie down properly.

969
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,069
Stay here.

970
00:54:49,984 --> 00:54:51,937
I'll just stay on the sofa.

971
00:54:54,074 --> 00:54:57,390
Stay here. I don't
want to be alone.

972
00:55:13,286 --> 00:55:17,683
Okay. But you have to move a bit, okay?

973
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:18,862
Just a little.

974
00:55:48,764 --> 00:55:50,322
Damn this guy.

975
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:53,955
I wonder where he is.

976
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:56,315
Damn you...

977
00:55:56,943 --> 00:55:58,822
Your day will come.

978
00:56:23,392 --> 00:56:25,824
Do you think I don't know
what you're doing?

979
00:56:26,931 --> 00:56:28,461
Ma'am Bianca?

980
00:56:28,775 --> 00:56:30,262
You're a bad boy, huh?

981
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:32,703
Taking something that's not yours.

982
00:56:32,728 --> 00:56:34,265
Did you think I'm unaware?

983
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:37,281
I don't know what you're
talking about, ma'am.

984
00:56:39,307 --> 00:56:42,251
Don't worry.
Ivy won't wake up.

985
00:56:42,765 --> 00:56:44,961
How did you know she was here?

986
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:47,429
Do you know what turns Ivy on?

987
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:49,193
I'll show you.

988
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,920
Ma'am, ma'am.

989
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:08,616
I'm ticklish, ma'am. I'm ticklish.

990
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:10,741
Do you want Ivy?

991
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,347
Show her who's the boss.

992
00:57:13,386 --> 00:57:14,538
Dominate her.

993
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:18,190
Alright, show me your manliness.

994
00:57:18,338 --> 00:57:19,341
Ouch, ouch!

995
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:21,609
Ma'am, ma'am.
Ouch, ouch!

996
00:57:21,634 --> 00:57:22,875
How does it feel?

997
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,953
It hurts, it hurts!

998
00:57:23,978 --> 00:57:25,769
- Ma'am. It hurts, it hurts.
- You deserve it

999
00:57:25,794 --> 00:57:28,291
because you're a bad boy!

1000
00:57:28,316 --> 00:57:31,194
Ouch, son of a bitch!

1001
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:38,592
Are you okay?

1002
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,171
Yes.

1003
00:57:40,455 --> 00:57:41,455
Yes, yes.

1004
00:57:41,521 --> 00:57:43,610
Here, you left your phone last night.

1005
00:57:45,325 --> 00:57:46,325
Did you cook?

1006
00:57:46,613 --> 00:57:49,170
Yes. Sorry, I used your kitchen.

1007
00:57:49,195 --> 00:57:50,195
No.

1008
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,265
It's fine, it's fine.

1009
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,333
- You didn't have to bother.
- It was nothing.

1010
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,414
Where are you?

1011
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:02,217
The ants have bitten me while
waiting for you. This means war!

1012
00:58:04,654 --> 00:58:06,091
I need to go to work.

1013
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:07,607
Have breakfast first.

1014
00:58:07,632 --> 00:58:09,548
Oh no, I really have to go to work.

1015
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:12,523
You stay here and if you want
to chill here, you can do so.

1016
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,440
Miyo, why are you late?

1017
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:20,199
I woke up late.

1018
00:58:20,242 --> 00:58:22,094
Where did April go?

1019
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,023
That's what I was going to tell you.

1020
00:58:24,149 --> 00:58:25,269
She left.

1021
00:58:25,516 --> 00:58:28,008
But she came to see
me earlier, very upset,

1022
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,251
asking about you.

1023
00:58:29,938 --> 00:58:31,282
Where did she go then?

1024
00:58:32,062 --> 00:58:34,329
I don't know. Seems like to war.

1025
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:37,110
To the condo.

1026
00:58:38,751 --> 00:58:43,078
Guard, it's Miyo. I just wanna inform you
that my friend April might come over.

1027
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:47,016
She is here.
But don't worry, we won't let her in.

1028
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:48,774
Alright, thank you so much.

1029
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,413
Hey, what did Miyo say?
Not to let me in?

1030
00:58:51,438 --> 00:58:53,499
Well, I can wait here.

1031
00:58:53,586 --> 00:58:56,265
Miss, please relax.
Don't cause trouble here.

1032
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,040
You don't have any say in whether
I want to cause a scene here or not.

1033
00:59:00,148 --> 00:59:01,196
Excuse me.

1034
00:59:01,797 --> 00:59:04,265
You're Miyo's friend, right?

1035
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,546
I'm April.

1036
00:59:05,571 --> 00:59:08,298
Yes, I've seen you.
You're the one in the video, right?

1037
00:59:08,647 --> 00:59:09,647
Yeah.

1038
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:10,805
Are you an ex of Miyo?

1039
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:12,905
Nice to meet you.

1040
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,837
Can we talk? Let's bond!

1041
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,030
Okay.

1042
00:59:21,513 --> 00:59:24,325
I met a friend of yours.

1043
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:26,999
No, no!

1044
00:59:27,024 --> 00:59:28,024
No!

1045
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:29,485
Son of a bitch!

1046
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:30,813
Do you know that in the U.K.

1047
00:59:30,905 --> 00:59:32,452
- Yeah?
- We had sex in the car,

1048
00:59:32,477 --> 00:59:34,163
in the back, and then,

1049
00:59:34,188 --> 00:59:35,188
Where exactly?

1050
00:59:35,213 --> 00:59:37,383
We were caught by the guard.

1051
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:38,553
Where was that?

1052
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:40,133
I was on top, of course.

1053
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:41,170
Ivy!

1054
00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:42,421
- Oh my God, Miyo!
- Hi!

1055
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,030
We were just talking about you!

1056
00:59:44,055 --> 00:59:46,359
I am sure. Can I borrow
April for a second?

1057
00:59:46,384 --> 00:59:47,969
- Join us!
- No, just join us.

1058
00:59:47,994 --> 00:59:49,186
- No, no.
- Why?

1059
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,546
I have something to tell you.

1060
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:52,488
- Hurry up.
- Ouch. It hurts!

1061
00:59:52,513 --> 00:59:54,529
- Are you violent now? You're overreacting.
- Just come.

1062
00:59:54,554 --> 00:59:56,302
What kind of foolishness
are you doing now?

1063
00:59:57,045 --> 00:59:59,731
- What do you want to prove?
- Why are you so dramatic?

1064
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:04,060
I just want to get to know the woman you're
crazy about and you're acting like this?

1065
01:00:06,147 --> 01:00:07,147
April.

1066
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,115
Why do you need to introduce yourself?

1067
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,073
Haven't you gotten used to me yet?

1068
01:00:11,545 --> 01:00:14,209
I'm naturally a friendly person.

1069
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:15,234
Oh my God.

1070
01:00:15,259 --> 01:00:17,163
April, please go back
to your hotel room.

1071
01:00:17,188 --> 01:00:18,188
Later.

1072
01:00:18,213 --> 01:00:20,460
We're still bonding.
We're not done talking yet.

1073
01:00:20,485 --> 01:00:22,966
By the way, she's smart, huh?

1074
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:26,529
And all this time, I thought that

1075
01:00:26,734 --> 01:00:28,734
she's the one
you'll replace me with.

1076
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,410
It's just your imagination, okay?

1077
01:00:31,435 --> 01:00:32,670
I'm sorry.

1078
01:00:33,286 --> 01:00:35,535
Can I make it up to you somehow?

1079
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,592
Even if you don't, it's fine.

1080
01:00:37,617 --> 01:00:38,749
My room later.

1081
01:00:38,774 --> 01:00:40,201
- No.
- Excuse me.

1082
01:00:41,014 --> 01:00:42,567
Is everything alright?

1083
01:00:44,381 --> 01:00:45,508
Go back to your work.

1084
01:00:45,533 --> 01:00:48,366
You might lose your promotion
because of me.

1085
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:50,328
- April, come on.
- No, no, Ivy.

1086
01:00:50,353 --> 01:00:51,748
Ivy, can I explain?

1087
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:53,200
- Explain?
- Yes.

1088
01:00:53,225 --> 01:00:54,716
Is there anything to explain?

1089
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,224
Do you need an explanation?

1090
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:00,152
No. Why, is there something?

1091
01:01:00,177 --> 01:01:01,676
There's nothing, then.

1092
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:02,786
Come on, April.

1093
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:04,724
Go ahead. Bye!

1094
01:01:04,749 --> 01:01:05,749
What's going on?

1095
01:01:05,774 --> 01:01:07,420
- Nothing.
- What's happening?

1096
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:10,966
Damn it!

1097
01:01:12,796 --> 01:01:17,185
Sorry for only calling now.
I've been busy with a lot of things.

1098
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:21,552
Be honest,
what did April tell you?

1099
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:25,148
Can you be frank with me?
Why are you so tense?

1100
01:01:25,623 --> 01:01:29,645
What does April have to say
to cause you to be so agitated?

1101
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:32,811
For your information
I feel perfectly fine.

1102
01:01:32,914 --> 01:01:35,178
You still haven't
answered my question.

1103
01:01:35,843 --> 01:01:38,387
Well, because April is really crazy.

1104
01:01:38,623 --> 01:01:40,154
She harbors resentment against me.

1105
01:01:40,514 --> 01:01:41,607
Resentment?

1106
01:01:41,632 --> 01:01:45,740
Yes, because I don't like her anymore,
and she can't move on from me.

1107
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:46,820
Is that so?

1108
01:01:49,286 --> 01:01:51,340
Is it too much if I come over
to your place?

1109
01:01:51,522 --> 01:01:52,522
Why?

1110
01:01:53,154 --> 01:01:54,787
I'm starting to be bothered.

1111
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:56,943
Be careful with that girl.

1112
01:01:57,607 --> 01:02:00,802
I don't know what you did
for her not to move on.

1113
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:02,959
Did you put a spell on her,

1114
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:05,758
or are you just really good
at showing off?

1115
01:02:08,394 --> 01:02:10,599
Tell me the truth, Miyo.

1116
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,662
Are you really that good in bed?

1117
01:02:13,873 --> 01:02:17,202
Well, practice makes perfect.

1118
01:02:17,227 --> 01:02:18,771
You're so confident.

1119
01:02:18,858 --> 01:02:20,350
I almost believed you.

1120
01:02:20,842 --> 01:02:22,202
But seriously,

1121
01:02:22,748 --> 01:02:24,574
why wouldn't you
give her a chance?

1122
01:02:25,397 --> 01:02:26,397
Come on, Ivy.

1123
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:28,849
It's just sex that we're after.

1124
01:02:29,148 --> 01:02:30,428
And look,

1125
01:02:30,819 --> 01:02:33,373
we don't even know
each other's birthdays.

1126
01:02:34,905 --> 01:02:36,029
So what?

1127
01:02:37,146 --> 01:02:38,325
What does that mean?

1128
01:02:38,928 --> 01:02:39,928
Ivy.

1129
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,631
Your birthday is on July 12.

1130
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:46,232
So we're close friends
if you know my birthday?

1131
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,491
Alright, when's my birthday then?

1132
01:02:51,163 --> 01:02:52,584
You forgot, right?

1133
01:02:52,664 --> 01:02:54,123
April 5.

1134
01:02:54,243 --> 01:02:56,224
Your birthday is on April 5.

1135
01:02:58,927 --> 01:03:01,007
Damn.

1136
01:03:01,032 --> 01:03:03,032
You know, she really loves you.

1137
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:07,359
She said she's willing to do
anything to get back with you.

1138
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,716
I know. But...

1139
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,372
You do know me, right?

1140
01:03:13,906 --> 01:03:16,935
Do you think I'll marry
a woman like that?

1141
01:03:17,781 --> 01:03:19,521
She'll be the mother
of my children?

1142
01:03:21,492 --> 01:03:22,951
I can't answer that.

1143
01:03:23,102 --> 01:03:24,670
Only you know the answer.

1144
01:03:26,234 --> 01:03:27,234
Why?

1145
01:03:29,508 --> 01:03:33,724
Nothing. I just remembered
a suggestion that April made.

1146
01:03:34,814 --> 01:03:36,646
What is it?

1147
01:03:36,671 --> 01:03:39,326
Nothing, forget that I said anything.

1148
01:03:40,536 --> 01:03:41,835
Hey, that's not right.

1149
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,013
You got me curious,
and now, you left me hanging.

1150
01:03:47,443 --> 01:03:48,443
Alright, fine.

1151
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:53,560
She told me since
we're close now,

1152
01:03:53,695 --> 01:03:58,709
maybe it would be easier for you
to reconcile if we have a threesome.

1153
01:04:00,936 --> 01:04:01,936
A threesome?

1154
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,250
Yes.

1155
01:04:03,275 --> 01:04:04,275
Who?

1156
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,631
Obviously, April, me,

1157
01:04:07,656 --> 01:04:08,656
and you.

1158
01:04:08,906 --> 01:04:11,349
It's not like I'm talking
about the guard downstairs.

1159
01:04:13,818 --> 01:04:16,241
She already planned everything, you know.

1160
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:19,876
The first step, let's
have drinks at my condo.

1161
01:04:24,062 --> 01:04:28,739
And because of the alcohol,
my inhibitions will disappear.

1162
01:04:33,117 --> 01:04:36,610
Then I won't feel awkward
when April kisses me.

1163
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:45,192
See, and then you'll get jealous.

1164
01:04:45,217 --> 01:04:46,591
You'll come too.

1165
01:04:46,989 --> 01:04:50,198
And then, you'll be in the middle!

1166
01:05:05,827 --> 01:05:07,267
And from there,

1167
01:05:07,292 --> 01:05:09,527
we'll go straight to having sex.

1168
01:05:14,695 --> 01:05:16,188
See? Does that work?

1169
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:21,609
Possibly.

1170
01:05:22,008 --> 01:05:24,074
The details are really explicit.

1171
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:26,117
It's like she's done it several times.

1172
01:05:27,054 --> 01:05:28,574
Are you okay, Miyo?

1173
01:05:31,086 --> 01:05:32,206
I'm fine.

1174
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:36,937
I'm just a bit tired because
it's been a long day.

1175
01:05:37,108 --> 01:05:38,975
How about you
spend the night here?

1176
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:41,039
Oh, no.

1177
01:05:41,156 --> 01:05:42,499
- I'm good.
- Are you sure?

1178
01:05:42,531 --> 01:05:43,531
Yeah.

1179
01:05:46,608 --> 01:05:47,726
Good night.

1180
01:05:51,617 --> 01:05:55,604
April has been putting
dirty thoughts into Ivy's head.

1181
01:05:56,225 --> 01:05:58,600
Can you believe she even
plans on having a threesome?

1182
01:05:58,711 --> 01:06:01,623
What will my children say?

1183
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,398
My grandchildren?

1184
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:07,500
Dude, those women are grown-ups.

1185
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:09,945
They have their own ways
of dealing with things.

1186
01:06:10,648 --> 01:06:15,058
And you can't stop their
friendship, you know.

1187
01:06:15,734 --> 01:06:17,445
It needs to be stopped.

1188
01:06:17,648 --> 01:06:18,755
I'll tell you this, dude.

1189
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,929
It's better if you just
move on from Ivy.

1190
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:26,092
I have a feeling that Ma'am Bianca already
suspects something between you.

1191
01:06:27,226 --> 01:06:28,906
What are you saying?

1192
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,499
I was called to Ma'am Bianca's office
that one time you were taking undertime.

1193
01:06:33,703 --> 01:06:35,641
Ivy was with you then.

1194
01:06:35,873 --> 01:06:40,344
And someone was asking about you,
someone named Brix.

1195
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,744
Brix... Brix...

1196
01:06:42,937 --> 01:06:45,349
I don't know anyone named Brix.
Who's that? What was he asking?

1197
01:06:45,374 --> 01:06:47,641
Why you work under time often.

1198
01:06:49,609 --> 01:06:52,164
How did Brix know my schedule?

1199
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:53,856
I don't know either.

1200
01:06:54,201 --> 01:06:57,687
But I think Ma'am Bianca hired
a private eye to investigate you.

1201
01:06:59,554 --> 01:07:02,074
Miyo, Ma'am Bianca
wants you at her office.

1202
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:03,849
I told you.

1203
01:07:04,349 --> 01:07:05,349
You see?

1204
01:07:06,192 --> 01:07:07,200
Miyo?

1205
01:07:07,366 --> 01:07:08,366
Miyo?

1206
01:07:08,505 --> 01:07:10,185
I know what you're doing.

1207
01:07:11,419 --> 01:07:14,919
You often take undertime
to spend time with my friend Ivy.

1208
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:18,776
I'm really sorry, but...

1209
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:22,552
I shouldn't have told you
that she recommends you.

1210
01:07:22,943 --> 01:07:27,036
Because of that, you take her
out to expedite your promotion.

1211
01:07:27,685 --> 01:07:28,685
Am I right?

1212
01:07:30,896 --> 01:07:33,590
Yes, ma'am.
I apologize.

1213
01:07:33,615 --> 01:07:38,326
I don't blame you. I'm actually impressed
by your courage and determination.

1214
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,013
So, alright then.

1215
01:07:42,013 --> 01:07:43,192
The job is yours.

1216
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:44,676
Really?

1217
01:07:44,701 --> 01:07:46,381
Yes, congratulations.

1218
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:49,269
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you so much.

1219
01:07:49,294 --> 01:07:50,294
By the way,

1220
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:53,146
since you often spend time with Ivy,

1221
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:55,149
Has she mentioned anything?

1222
01:07:57,942 --> 01:07:59,733
What do you mean, ma'am?

1223
01:08:00,154 --> 01:08:03,797
Is she seeing someone?
She is a bit secretive.

1224
01:08:07,442 --> 01:08:10,000
Dude, the promiscuous queen is here.

1225
01:08:18,301 --> 01:08:19,707
Oh, shit!

1226
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:24,236
Actually, ma'am, she did
mention a name to me.

1227
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:27,008
And I believe she's
also a guest at your hotel.

1228
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:29,008
Ma'am, a woman.

1229
01:08:34,869 --> 01:08:37,992
I don't understand why
I'm being thrown out!

1230
01:08:38,017 --> 01:08:40,907
I'm sorry, Miss April,
but the management

1231
01:08:40,932 --> 01:08:43,900
of this hotel would like to
thank you for your patronage

1232
01:08:43,925 --> 01:08:48,651
but we have to ask you to leave
because of certain technical problems.

1233
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:50,625
What technical problems?

1234
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:52,439
I'm not a computer!

1235
01:08:52,464 --> 01:08:56,021
Well, apparently, we have
discovered that you are using

1236
01:08:56,046 --> 01:08:59,767
this hotel for certain
meetups and transactions.

1237
01:08:59,792 --> 01:09:01,164
What meetups?

1238
01:09:01,362 --> 01:09:05,955
Apparently, we also discovered that you are
using our hotel for your sex operations.

1239
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:08,478
What? Are you accusing me
of being a prostitute?

1240
01:09:08,503 --> 01:09:10,344
Do I look like a prostitute to you?

1241
01:09:12,587 --> 01:09:14,961
Yeah. Right? Right?

1242
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:20,406
I am going to sue you.
I am going to sue this hotel.

1243
01:09:20,431 --> 01:09:21,689
You better get ready.

1244
01:09:21,714 --> 01:09:24,026
Okay. Thank you so much anyway,
and that...

1245
01:09:24,051 --> 01:09:25,171
Throw her out.

1246
01:09:25,196 --> 01:09:26,316
Throw her out!

1247
01:09:26,785 --> 01:09:27,905
Let's go, miss.

1248
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,055
What the hell!

1249
01:09:32,761 --> 01:09:33,961
That prostitute!

1250
01:09:39,347 --> 01:09:40,347
You know,

1251
01:09:40,372 --> 01:09:42,689
It's so obvious that
she's obsessed with you.

1252
01:09:42,714 --> 01:09:47,680
She even suggested a threesome
just to have sex with you.

1253
01:09:47,846 --> 01:09:49,038
Seriously,

1254
01:09:49,354 --> 01:09:50,611
glad you found out.

1255
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:53,328
You know what, I'm really
going to block her now.

1256
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,840
That's right.

1257
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:56,710
And Ivy,

1258
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,232
Thank you, by the way.

1259
01:09:58,768 --> 01:09:59,891
Thank you for what?

1260
01:10:00,691 --> 01:10:04,403
Because if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have been promoted.

1261
01:10:05,378 --> 01:10:08,300
You're looking at the new supervisor
of concierge services.

1262
01:10:08,511 --> 01:10:09,511
Really?

1263
01:10:09,777 --> 01:10:11,943
Congratulations!

1264
01:10:13,823 --> 01:10:16,089
You know, I can start saving now.

1265
01:10:16,776 --> 01:10:19,068
The only thing missing is my bride.

1266
01:10:21,511 --> 01:10:23,193
I'm proud of you.

1267
01:10:28,129 --> 01:10:29,176
Wait.

1268
01:10:29,713 --> 01:10:31,213
I can't breathe.

1269
01:10:31,238 --> 01:10:32,269
Oh, sorry.

1270
01:10:32,296 --> 01:10:33,420
Sorry, sorry.

1271
01:10:33,847 --> 01:10:35,033
But congratulations!

1272
01:10:36,386 --> 01:10:39,577
For the first time,
you look so happy, Emillio.

1273
01:10:39,801 --> 01:10:40,823
Wow.

1274
01:10:41,122 --> 01:10:43,222
Did you know that it's been
a long time since

1275
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:45,560
anyone has ever called me by that name?

1276
01:10:45,863 --> 01:10:47,177
Like your birthday.

1277
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:49,335
How can I forget your real name?

1278
01:10:51,257 --> 01:10:53,057
You know, I'm happy because

1279
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,930
I feel like everything
is falling into place.

1280
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:57,485
I got promoted,

1281
01:10:57,656 --> 01:10:59,513
my salary has increased significantly,

1282
01:10:59,908 --> 01:11:01,508
and I've made plans.

1283
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,220
I'm planning to settle down.

1284
01:11:04,918 --> 01:11:08,139
I'm going to buy a house,
maybe a townhouse.

1285
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:10,024
And then I'm gonna have two kids.

1286
01:11:10,592 --> 01:11:12,187
One boy and one girl.

1287
01:11:12,212 --> 01:11:13,568
Wow, a planner.

1288
01:11:14,388 --> 01:11:17,138
But, the "Lucky Wife" is still missing.

1289
01:11:17,411 --> 01:11:19,882
Isn't that supposed to be
in the blueprint of your life?

1290
01:11:21,829 --> 01:11:24,107
Actually...

1291
01:11:24,194 --> 01:11:25,194
I already have one.

1292
01:11:26,053 --> 01:11:27,661
Really? Who?

1293
01:11:31,152 --> 01:11:33,091
The only woman who understands me.

1294
01:11:34,535 --> 01:11:36,535
Can you stop?

1295
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,611
You're still so lame
after twelve years.

1296
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,213
Hey, why are you so quiet?
Are you annoyed?

1297
01:11:48,348 --> 01:11:49,348
Screw you.

1298
01:11:49,815 --> 01:11:52,573
Sorry. You can no longer screw me.

1299
01:12:13,216 --> 01:12:15,303
What happened?

1300
01:12:15,328 --> 01:12:16,768
I don't know either.

1301
01:12:16,793 --> 01:12:19,560
But it's likely that Miyo
reported you to our bosses.

1302
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,152
Even Ivy isn't answering my calls.

1303
01:12:22,177 --> 01:12:23,935
What should we do now?

1304
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,497
I don't know.

1305
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:27,849
Well, think of something.

1306
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:30,227
Find a way for me
to return to the hotel

1307
01:12:30,252 --> 01:12:32,333
so we can finish what we've started.

1308
01:12:32,497 --> 01:12:33,497
April...

1309
01:12:33,598 --> 01:12:36,685
- Should we just leave them alone?
- No way, highway!

1310
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:38,856
You know what?
Do you want me to tell Miyo

1311
01:12:38,881 --> 01:12:41,217
that it was your idea for
me to stay at the hotel?

1312
01:12:41,267 --> 01:12:43,103
And you think he'll believe you?

1313
01:12:43,381 --> 01:12:46,896
Why? Are you ready to lose
the trust of someone you love?

1314
01:12:46,921 --> 01:12:50,032
- As a friend!
- Idiot. "As your friend" your face!

1315
01:12:50,088 --> 01:12:52,232
- I'll kiss you, then.
- Okay, go ahead.

1316
01:12:55,202 --> 01:12:56,202
Find a way

1317
01:12:56,227 --> 01:12:57,227
or else,

1318
01:12:57,252 --> 01:12:59,557
say bye-bye, Miyo.

1319
01:12:59,582 --> 01:13:01,954
Take care, bye.

1320
01:13:05,858 --> 01:13:06,858
It's sweet.

1321
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:09,798
It does look like you.

1322
01:13:09,823 --> 01:13:10,823
Really?

1323
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:15,796
The two-year engagement of
hotel heiress Bianca Delfino and

1324
01:13:15,821 --> 01:13:19,271
real estate taipan Mark Cabral
is about to end

1325
01:13:19,767 --> 01:13:24,755
as they have finally settled on the
date for their much-anticipated wedding.

1326
01:13:24,828 --> 01:13:29,240
Actually, I have right here on the other
line is Miss Bianca to confirm the news.

1327
01:13:29,265 --> 01:13:30,265
Miss Bianca.

1328
01:13:30,752 --> 01:13:33,487
Yes! We will hold
our wedding next June

1329
01:13:33,512 --> 01:13:37,474
which will coincide with the fiftieth
anniversary of La Destino Hotel.

1330
01:13:43,187 --> 01:13:44,581
Ivy, wait.

1331
01:13:48,414 --> 01:13:50,993
Sorry if you had to find out
my secret this way.

1332
01:13:51,753 --> 01:13:53,450
I just can't understand

1333
01:13:53,514 --> 01:13:57,448
why they need to get married
when he's not even a real man.

1334
01:13:59,136 --> 01:14:00,355
Sir Mark is gay?

1335
01:14:00,453 --> 01:14:02,718
Why don't you ask
your sidekick at the hotel?

1336
01:14:03,088 --> 01:14:04,578
This isn't news.

1337
01:14:10,269 --> 01:14:11,814
I'm such an idiot.

1338
01:14:12,007 --> 01:14:14,002
Why did I trust her?

1339
01:14:17,267 --> 01:14:19,067
That's not foolishness.

1340
01:16:47,154 --> 01:16:49,255
I didn't expect this to happen.

1341
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:52,407
But...

1342
01:16:54,028 --> 01:16:55,708
it's just nice that

1343
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:59,783
we were brought together again now
that we both want the same things in life.

1344
01:17:04,762 --> 01:17:05,762
Why?

1345
01:17:06,528 --> 01:17:07,528
Nothing.

1346
01:17:08,295 --> 01:17:09,975
It's just really amazing.

1347
01:17:16,838 --> 01:17:17,838
I love you.

1348
01:17:20,521 --> 01:17:21,521
Thank you.

1349
01:17:34,795 --> 01:17:36,585
Everything is in order now, ma'am.

1350
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,329
So, thank you again for
staying at La Destino Hotel

1351
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:40,948
and we hope to
see you again soon.

1352
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:46,133
What have you done?

1353
01:17:47,266 --> 01:17:48,454
Nothing, nothing.

1354
01:17:48,704 --> 01:17:50,939
What? You've been staring
at me for a while now.

1355
01:17:51,154 --> 01:17:53,421
I just wanted to say something.

1356
01:17:53,547 --> 01:17:55,930
Miyo? Miyo, you're being called
to Ma'am Bianca's office.

1357
01:17:57,122 --> 01:17:58,122
Copy, copy!

1358
01:17:58,825 --> 01:18:00,185
What were you going to say?

1359
01:18:00,771 --> 01:18:02,430
I'll tell you when you get back.

1360
01:18:04,402 --> 01:18:05,402
Okay.

1361
01:18:07,409 --> 01:18:10,048
Mr. Mala, thank you for coming.

1362
01:18:10,785 --> 01:18:13,613
I'm not sure if you're
still talking to Ivy, but

1363
01:18:13,638 --> 01:18:15,337
may I make a small request?

1364
01:18:15,613 --> 01:18:16,634
Yes, ma'am.

1365
01:18:17,738 --> 01:18:19,993
Please tell her to answer my calls.

1366
01:18:20,018 --> 01:18:22,626
I need her for Daddy's 65th birthday.

1367
01:18:22,926 --> 01:18:24,992
And congratulations, by the way.

1368
01:18:25,888 --> 01:18:28,832
I saw your announcement
on the news.

1369
01:18:31,394 --> 01:18:33,445
I've broken up with my fiance.

1370
01:18:34,324 --> 01:18:35,384
There's no wedding.

1371
01:18:35,814 --> 01:18:37,337
You can tell Ivy that.

1372
01:18:37,887 --> 01:18:41,606
It's too late, ma'am. Ivy doesn't
want to see you anymore.

1373
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:42,665
I know.

1374
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:44,678
And I also know that

1375
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:47,090
you're more than friends.

1376
01:18:47,872 --> 01:18:49,672
I've noticed it from the start.

1377
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:52,349
But, ma'am...

1378
01:18:52,481 --> 01:18:54,192
You still gave me the promotion?

1379
01:18:54,217 --> 01:18:55,217
Yes.

1380
01:18:55,242 --> 01:18:57,216
Because I want Ivy to be happy.

1381
01:18:58,043 --> 01:19:00,840
When you love someone,
don't you want them to be happy?

1382
01:19:02,214 --> 01:19:06,011
Shouldn't Ivy be
the one deciding

1383
01:19:06,331 --> 01:19:08,393
who makes her happy?

1384
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:10,278
You

1385
01:19:10,551 --> 01:19:11,551
or me.

1386
01:19:20,132 --> 01:19:22,599
Why did Ma'am Bianca call for you?

1387
01:19:23,056 --> 01:19:25,368
She was just asking for a favor.

1388
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:26,530
What is it?

1389
01:19:28,718 --> 01:19:31,518
Help her talk to Ivy again.

1390
01:19:31,841 --> 01:19:33,001
Dude.

1391
01:19:33,377 --> 01:19:34,844
Can you do that?

1392
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:37,790
I love Ivy, you know.

1393
01:19:38,332 --> 01:19:39,446
Obviously.

1394
01:19:41,383 --> 01:19:44,183
You know, Ma'am Bianca
said something earlier.

1395
01:19:44,656 --> 01:19:45,656
She said,

1396
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:51,621
when you love someone,
you should prioritize their happiness.

1397
01:19:52,689 --> 01:19:54,976
Don't just think about yourself.

1398
01:19:58,578 --> 01:20:01,100
By the way, you said you had
something to tell me earlier.

1399
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:03,853
Oh, that was nothing.
Forget about it.

1400
01:20:04,197 --> 01:20:05,182
Are you sure?

1401
01:20:05,207 --> 01:20:07,873
Yeah, never mind.
Just forget about it.

1402
01:20:16,337 --> 01:20:17,337
Miyo.

1403
01:20:18,289 --> 01:20:19,599
Ivy.

1404
01:20:20,175 --> 01:20:21,383
Can we talk?

1405
01:20:22,499 --> 01:20:23,886
Seems like we need to.

1406
01:20:34,614 --> 01:20:36,982
- There's something...
- Miyo, let me go first.

1407
01:20:38,745 --> 01:20:41,345
This is about the last time
you were here.

1408
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:44,344
Okay.

1409
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:46,040
What happened was just

1410
01:20:46,789 --> 01:20:49,490
a result of the circumstances.

1411
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,044
Have you thought
of anything, Orson?

1412
01:20:52,151 --> 01:20:55,628
Nothing. The reason why we teamed up
in the first place is because

1413
01:20:55,653 --> 01:20:57,587
we both love Miyo.

1414
01:20:58,299 --> 01:20:59,334
But,

1415
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:02,337
I saw how much Miyo loves Ivy.

1416
01:21:02,412 --> 01:21:05,717
Seriously, is that
your mindset now?

1417
01:21:05,975 --> 01:21:06,975
Miyo,

1418
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:08,381
I love you.

1419
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:12,014
After all, we've been friends
for a very long time.

1420
01:21:15,182 --> 01:21:16,182
But...

1421
01:21:17,816 --> 01:21:18,816
But?

1422
01:21:22,268 --> 01:21:24,245
I'm not the woman for you.

1423
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:28,659
I'm not gonna be the mother
of your children.

1424
01:21:29,233 --> 01:21:31,889
Actually, Ma'am Bianca is seeking help

1425
01:21:31,914 --> 01:21:34,415
- to speak with Ivy again.
- Wait, wait.

1426
01:21:34,969 --> 01:21:35,969
Oh my God.

1427
01:21:36,824 --> 01:21:38,230
Don't tell me...

1428
01:21:39,172 --> 01:21:40,551
Oh my God!

1429
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:45,277
Why is Bianca Delfino
asking for help about Ivy?

1430
01:21:45,803 --> 01:21:49,391
Are you saying
Bianca and Ivy are...

1431
01:21:55,074 --> 01:21:56,178
Ivy.

1432
01:21:58,987 --> 01:22:00,671
Did you know that Ma'am Bianca's wedding

1433
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:02,926
with her closeted boyfriend
didn't push through?

1434
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,653
Who told you that?

1435
01:22:06,318 --> 01:22:07,598
Ma'am Bianca did.

1436
01:22:07,694 --> 01:22:09,494
She told me earlier.

1437
01:22:10,273 --> 01:22:14,424
And she also knows about us.

1438
01:22:15,141 --> 01:22:16,141
Us?

1439
01:22:17,592 --> 01:22:19,272
Miyo, we're not even a thing.

1440
01:22:20,685 --> 01:22:22,365
We're just friends.

1441
01:22:23,633 --> 01:22:25,052
That's what I told her.

1442
01:22:25,077 --> 01:22:26,282
Oh my God!

1443
01:22:26,307 --> 01:22:29,496
Miyo is going crazy for a...

1444
01:22:29,919 --> 01:22:30,919
Well...

1445
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:33,864
Perhaps he already knows
that no matter what he does,

1446
01:22:33,889 --> 01:22:36,156
he would never get
anything from Ivy.

1447
01:22:36,181 --> 01:22:38,098
He probably does, right?

1448
01:22:38,251 --> 01:22:41,676
But why is she doing that then?
He's being so foolish.

1449
01:22:41,701 --> 01:22:43,699
Because he loves her!

1450
01:22:43,908 --> 01:22:46,027
Hey, enough with
that "love" stuff, okay?

1451
01:22:46,105 --> 01:22:48,081
Love is different from stupidity.

1452
01:22:48,106 --> 01:22:52,113
When you're too in love,
it can make you stupid.

1453
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,450
Alright, go ahead.

1454
01:22:54,475 --> 01:22:56,408
Repeat everything that you said

1455
01:22:56,663 --> 01:22:58,448
but do it in front of the mirror.

1456
01:22:58,473 --> 01:22:59,914
Damn you, Orson.

1457
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:01,598
No, damn you!

1458
01:23:16,281 --> 01:23:17,281
Ma'am.

1459
01:23:18,562 --> 01:23:22,781
I am sorry if I surprised you
by coming here all of a sudden.

1460
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,412
It's okay, ma'am.
Please come in.

1461
01:23:26,545 --> 01:23:27,545
Okay.

1462
01:23:39,736 --> 01:23:42,392
Miyo, about what I said before...

1463
01:23:42,691 --> 01:23:44,880
Oh, ma'am. About that, well...

1464
01:23:45,672 --> 01:23:49,634
I don't want you to think that
I gave you the promotion because

1465
01:23:50,461 --> 01:23:52,327
I asked for a favor from you.

1466
01:23:53,222 --> 01:23:56,400
Involving Ivy, it's not true.

1467
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:59,801
But ma'am, Ivy herself
talked to you, right?

1468
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:00,830
Yes, true.

1469
01:24:00,967 --> 01:24:04,036
But if you weren't deserving,
I wouldn't have given it to you.

1470
01:24:05,949 --> 01:24:08,140
Can we sit down
and talk, Mr. Mala?

1471
01:24:14,766 --> 01:24:18,996
Ma'am, may I ask why you're here?

1472
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,624
I just want to clarify something.

1473
01:24:24,254 --> 01:24:26,030
Did you know that Ivy and I have
been together for three years?

1474
01:24:27,919 --> 01:24:29,439
She mentioned it, ma'am.

1475
01:24:31,748 --> 01:24:35,012
And I need you to tell you that
I love her so much.

1476
01:24:37,613 --> 01:24:39,812
I kind of get it, ma'am.

1477
01:24:40,888 --> 01:24:47,484
As I've said, I know there was,
or something, between the two of you.

1478
01:24:49,266 --> 01:24:50,946
How did you find out?

1479
01:24:52,144 --> 01:24:53,820
When you truly love someone,

1480
01:24:54,009 --> 01:24:57,976
you don't need words to know
what they feel.

1481
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:03,038
From the moment Ivy first mentioned you,
I know there's something.

1482
01:25:04,761 --> 01:25:06,378
- But...
- But wait.

1483
01:25:06,586 --> 01:25:08,120
I'm not done yet.

1484
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,269
Do you love Ivy?

1485
01:25:15,406 --> 01:25:16,647
Yes, ma'am.

1486
01:25:18,233 --> 01:25:19,589
If that's the case,

1487
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,514
I want her to be happy.

1488
01:25:24,668 --> 01:25:27,268
I won't be the reason for her

1489
01:25:28,466 --> 01:25:30,639
to be deprived of her happiness.

1490
01:25:30,664 --> 01:25:32,628
Ma'am, what do you mean?

1491
01:25:34,711 --> 01:25:35,778
If she loves you...

1492
01:25:35,803 --> 01:25:36,849
Wait, ma'am.

1493
01:25:36,874 --> 01:25:39,092
- Wait.
- Don't hurt her.

1494
01:25:40,327 --> 01:25:41,327
Ma'am...

1495
01:25:44,173 --> 01:25:46,373
I know I love Ivy, ma'am.

1496
01:25:48,383 --> 01:25:51,391
But I also know
who she truly loves.

1497
01:25:55,787 --> 01:25:58,249
Ma'am, I understand that.

1498
01:25:59,411 --> 01:26:00,952
I understand that

1499
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,948
I will never be enough for Ivy.

1500
01:26:08,437 --> 01:26:10,433
No matter how much I love her,

1501
01:26:12,415 --> 01:26:14,472
she could not love me like the way...

1502
01:26:15,468 --> 01:26:17,073
like the way I want her to.

1503
01:26:19,458 --> 01:26:20,738
Like you, ma'am,

1504
01:26:21,888 --> 01:26:23,488
because I love her,

1505
01:26:25,561 --> 01:26:27,561
I want her to be happy.

1506
01:26:31,657 --> 01:26:36,303
I can't give her the family
and the future she wants.

1507
01:26:39,225 --> 01:26:43,988
You can give everything
that she wants, ma'am.

1508
01:26:48,959 --> 01:26:52,939
That's something I can't give her,
no matter how much I love her.

1509
01:27:01,702 --> 01:27:03,285
I want her to be happy, ma'am.

1510
01:27:35,147 --> 01:27:36,272
Go ahead.

1511
01:27:37,811 --> 01:27:39,488
She's been waiting for a while now.

1512
01:28:00,453 --> 01:28:01,923
Do you want a drink?

1513
01:28:04,634 --> 01:28:05,790
Are you okay?

1514
01:28:08,088 --> 01:28:09,408
How about you?

1515
01:28:11,459 --> 01:28:13,171
What do you want to drink?

1516
01:28:13,196 --> 01:28:14,438
You decide.

1517
01:28:14,463 --> 01:28:15,912
Anything?

1518
01:28:17,324 --> 01:28:18,352
Okay.

1519
01:28:19,181 --> 01:28:20,541
Did you really manage?

1520
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:24,324
It wasn't that difficult.

1521
01:28:26,766 --> 01:28:28,446
What happened to them?

1522
01:28:30,241 --> 01:28:31,438
I don't know.

1523
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:34,500
But I think...

1524
01:28:34,831 --> 01:28:36,360
They'll get back together?

1525
01:28:43,176 --> 01:28:44,764
They love each other, after all.

1526
01:28:46,681 --> 01:28:50,874
Have you accepted the fact
that you'll lose Ivy?

1527
01:28:53,692 --> 01:28:56,301
How can you lose something
that was never yours?

1528
01:28:57,049 --> 01:28:59,382
Why did you help Ma'am Bianca?

1529
01:29:00,803 --> 01:29:02,195
Because I love Ivy.

1530
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:07,792
And also

1531
01:29:08,749 --> 01:29:11,949
loving someone doesn't mean

1532
01:29:13,674 --> 01:29:16,062
that they're required to love you back.

1533
01:29:18,376 --> 01:29:20,128
Makes sense.

1534
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,000
You know it.

1535
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:28,278
I know that you know that.

1536
01:29:44,947 --> 01:29:45,947
Dude!

1537
01:29:45,972 --> 01:29:47,692
- Hey!
- How's everything at the front desk?

1538
01:29:47,717 --> 01:29:49,716
Have our delegates arrived yet?

1539
01:29:49,741 --> 01:29:52,820
One by one, but we have
a lot of guests already.

1540
01:29:53,411 --> 01:29:56,794
How's my supervisor doing?

1541
01:29:57,361 --> 01:30:01,736
Can't you see it? I'm burning up
in this uniform they gave me.

1542
01:30:01,991 --> 01:30:03,827
You can handle it, dude!

1543
01:30:07,546 --> 01:30:09,097
- Hi, Miyo!
- Hello.

1544
01:30:09,122 --> 01:30:11,864
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

1545
01:30:16,186 --> 01:30:17,771
Looks like they're happy, right?

1546
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:20,236
I think so.

1547
01:30:22,508 --> 01:30:24,494
Excuse me, boys. Excuse me!

1548
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:28,685
I'd like to introduce the latest
member of our front desk staff.

1549
01:30:28,908 --> 01:30:29,962
Hi!

1550
01:30:30,064 --> 01:30:31,064
Irish.

1551
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:33,200
What's your name?

1552
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:35,630
Irish. My name is Irish.

1553
01:30:36,021 --> 01:30:37,661
- Irish.
- Yes.

1554
01:30:38,118 --> 01:30:39,402
Irish.

1555
01:30:49,306 --> 01:30:50,306
Cut!
