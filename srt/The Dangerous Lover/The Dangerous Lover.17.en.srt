00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,180
(Hu Mansion)

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,710
Will it be too much for you to stay

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,640
at the Hu Mansion after marriage?

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,680
How could that be?

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,470
I obtained this grace from His Majesty

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,750
to accompany you
at your family home for a while.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,680
Humph.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,840
Once your mansion is renovated,

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,990
you'll move out immediately.

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,270
No matter where I am,

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,920
you must follow me.

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,320
Marry a dog, follow the dog.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,160
Understand?

16
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,070
Are you calling yourself a dog?

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,710
Her Ladyship is here.

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,460
Greetings, Mother.

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,390
No need for the formalities, my child.

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,420
Your father has allowed me
to accompany you.

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,340
From now on, we can

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,420
finally be together.

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,780
I will serve Mother and His Highness

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,140
more diligently.

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,980
Good.

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,780
Mother,

27
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,380
this is your daughter-in-law.

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,380
Greetings, Mother.

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,980
Tiantian,

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,580
I never expected

31
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,620
you would become my daughter-in-law.

32
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,100
I didn't look at you closely last time,

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,320
but seeing you today,

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,980
not bad.

35
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,660
Truly a well-matched pair.

36
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,180
Mother,

37
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,350
His Highness treats Tiantian
exceptionally well.

38
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,260
I envy her greatly.

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,860
Miss Liu, you will surely
find a good match too.

40
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
I'm afraid I don't have
the good fortune you do.

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,020
I can't bear to see you leave me.

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,220
How about this,

43
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,900
Yanli, you take Fufeng in

44
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,740
as a concubine, how does that sound?

45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,060
Please retract that decree, Mother.

46
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,540
His Highness and Tiantian

47
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,060
are a match made in heaven.

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,860
I can't ruin this harmony.

49
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,340
Mother loves to joke,

50
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,860
you needn't take it seriously.

51
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,860
Since you've also left the palace,

52
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,060
where is your family?

53
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,060
I'll have someone escort you back home.

54
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,780
Fufeng is my adopted daughter,

55
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,540
wherever I am,

56
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,820
that's where she will be.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,620
Tiantian, arrange a room for Fufeng too.

58
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,660
I've already arranged it.

59
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,860
I don't ask for much,

60
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,420
just give me a maid's room.

61
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,380
Of course.

62
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,660
My mother-in-law

63
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,020
isn't easy to deal with.

64
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,860
You married me,

65
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,220
not my mother.

66
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,220
As for your relationship,

67
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,260
honey, rest assured,

68
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,620
I stand on your side.

69
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,860
You are so smooth-tongued.

70
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,660
I have something nice
to show you in our room.

71
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,540
You pervert.

72
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,820
Hurry up then.

73
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,180
Are you having inappropriate thoughts?

74
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,500
I just want to give you a gift.

75
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,220
Su Yanli, you...

76
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,460
Who knows who's the real pervert here.

77
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,060
What were you thinking about?

78
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,140
You are teasing me.

79
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,220
This is for you.

80
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,940
Consider it an apology from my mother.

81
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,380
It's so beautiful!

82
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,340
Thank you, honey.

83
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,300
Su Yanli,

84
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,300
you are destined to be mine.

85
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,220
Thank you so much, Tiantian.

86
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,420
Not only did you clean the room so well,

87
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,260
you also prepared such a lavish feast.

88
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,660
It's been many years

89
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,020
since I enjoyed this.

90
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,100
It's what I should do.

91
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,340
To make your stay comfortable,

92
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,340
Tiantian prepared for three whole days.

93
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,020
Let me taste this.

94
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,020
Hmm, not bad.

95
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,820
Mother, if you like the food,

96
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,420
I'll have the cook prepare more.

97
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,140
Tiantian,

98
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,100
the hairpin you're wearing

99
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,700
looks similar to the one

100
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,260
Fufeng is wearing.

101
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,740
Mother, this hairpin is called
the "Double Flower Gold Hairpin".

102
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,540
It's rare in Nankang.

103
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,740
The one on my head

104
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,940
was bought from a street stall.

105
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,860
You two have a similar taste.

106
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,860
But the price is not

107
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,940
what matters the most,

108
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,860
but the love behind it is.

109
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,450
Fufeng's care for me is pretty rare.

110
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,140
Of course,

111
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,700
Fufeng is your favorite girl,

112
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,620
I will definitely treat her well.

113
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,220
Then I can rest assured.

114
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,860
Fufeng,

115
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,260
I will definitely find you a good husband,

116
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,740
so you can get married in splendor.

117
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,210
Yanli,

118
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,550
you know very well

119
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,220
that's not what I meant.

120
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,100
This matter is settled.

121
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,740
I shall take my leave.

122
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,820
You... You all...

123
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,060
Alright, alright. Mother, don't be angry.

124
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,460
His Highness is a wise man.

125
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,340
He will know
how to weigh pros and cons.

126
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,380
When I ordered you
to establish the Tianji Game,

127
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,820
I wanted you
to investigate public sentiment

128
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,940
and strengthen the country's foundation

129
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,580
to alleviate the people's worries.

130
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,380
Now it seems that

131
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,860
I can rest easy.

132
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,420
Hahaha...

133
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,540
The celestial phenomena are revealing,
but the heart of man is unpredictable.

134
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,500
That Hu Tiantian

135
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,580
has already cracked your Tianji Game.

136
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,460
In this game, you've lost.

137
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Oh, really?

138
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,740
Once the prediction appears,

139
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,460
it will inevitably happen.

140
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,500
There's no exception.

141
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,380
Your Majesty,

142
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,060
