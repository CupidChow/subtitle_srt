3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,540
(Hu Mansion)

4
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,420
Why do you

5
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,740
have so many scars?

6
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,020
They're from years ago.

7
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,460
It seems everyone

8
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,060
has their own secrets.

9
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,060
(Good thing my secret)

10
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,540
(is resolved.)

11
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,460
I almost died just now.

12
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
Why do you seem so happy?

13
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,780
Do I?

14
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,820
Since you're out of the palace now,

15
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,580
let's treat your wounds here first.

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,860
You did this to help me,

17
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,060
I'll take responsibility for you.

18
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,540
Thank you then, Miss Hu.

19
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,460
My problem has finally been resolved.

20
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,340
But what if the Seventh Prince
comes back to life?

21
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,980
How could a dead man come back to life?

22
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,060
If he does,

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,020
I'll poison him again.

24
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,780
Tianba.

25
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,500
Hu Tiantian, what trouble
did you cause again?

26
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,580
Greetings, Your Highness.

27
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,660
(You are)

28
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,660
(the Seventh Prince?)

29
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,780
I'm Xia Jiu.

30
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,420
Xia Jiu, listen to me,

31
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,660
don't have any pity

32
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,740
for your enemies.

33
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,780
Why?

34
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,660
The Hu family
no longer means anything to me.

35
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,860
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,340
To take you away.

37
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,020
(Su Yanli,)

38
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,780
(long time no see.)

39
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,420
(General Hu,)

40
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,780
(nice to meet you again.)

41
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,340
(Happiness)

42
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,620
Miss Hu,

43
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,980
I am your husband.

44
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,860
Why would you want to harm me?

45
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,980
Xia Jiu,

46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,380
what's going on?

47
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,950
Call me Su Yanli!

48
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,540
Su Yanli!

49
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,700
I hate you!

50
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,380
Su Yanli!

51
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,900
I hate you!

52
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,860
Su Yanli!

53
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,940
What?

54
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,500
You are calling the name of
the Seventh Prince even in your dream?

55
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,420
Where is he?

56
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,740
What's wrong with you again?

57
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,700
Tianlin,

58
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,820
kill him!

59
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,660
Do you know what you're saying?

60
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,060
This man is very cunning.

61
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,540
He is using the Hu Family to climb up.

62
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,140
Our entire family will die miserably
by his hands.

63
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,540
Tiantian, the Seventh Prince
is just a commoner now.

64
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,540
What storm can he stir up?

65
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,020
Besides, Tianba forbids us from
meddling in court affairs.

66
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,460
Stop overthinking.

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,900
Tiantian has been self-willed,

68
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,900
she must have caused trouble
for Your Highness.

69
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,780
It's okay,

70
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,340
this commotion she caused

71
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,620
actually helped me.

72
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,020
You must have suffered

73
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,140
in the past years.

74
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,740
Tiantian! Tiantian!

75
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,420
What... What are you doing?

76
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,100
- Hu Tiantian! Where are your manners?
- Tiantian.

77
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,220
Su Yanli,

78
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,140
you're quite dramatic.

79
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,020
Tiantian,

80
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,300
I'm sorry I lied to you.

81
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,180
I just didn't want you
to get involved in trouble.

82
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,460
Tiantian, are you crazy?

83
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,380
Put down the sword.

84
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,700
Tianba, don't believe him.

85
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,420
He will only harm the Hu Family.

86
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,900
I never meant to harm you

87
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,820
or the Hu Family.
