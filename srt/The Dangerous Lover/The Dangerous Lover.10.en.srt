=Episode 10=

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
Dear Siyue.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,760
Are you crazy, Hu Tiantian?

5
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, Yanli, my buddy!

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,040
Greet him.

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,190
Mr. Su!

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,350
What's with this attire?

9
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,110
You don't want him to fall for you,

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,640
yet you don't want to be enemies with him.

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,560
Then just be his buddy!

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,920
What? Don't I look cool?

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,600
Go back to your seats.

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,790
Yeah, you are cool.

15
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,680
Everyone, open your Tao Teh King.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,920
Today we'll learn Chapter 25.

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,040
Humans follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven,

18
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,070
Heaven follows the Tao,
and the Tao follows nature.

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,040
Yanli, my buddy!

20
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Since you want to be buddies with me,

21
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,560
let's do something

22
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,510
manly together.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,240
Sure.

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,190
Pick a brothel

25
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,360
and it'll be my treat today.

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,840
It looks like rain is about to fall.

27
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,750
Let's go to the hot spring pool to warm up.

28
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,750
I'm not used to bathing with others.

29
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,280
Who said anything about bathing with you?

30
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,520
I have some good liquor there

31
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,680
and I want to share a drink with you.

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,590
You...

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,280
But if you want to bathe,

34
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,360
I'm willing to accompany you.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
You rogue.

36
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,280
Tiantian, umbrella.

37
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,030
No need.

38
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,520
A real man isn't afraid of

39
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,750
a little rain and wind.

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
Listening to the storm in the quiet night,

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000

You wake up!

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,840
You are useless!

74
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,630
Master, forgive me.

75
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,430
Who is that person?

76
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,070
I suspect it's Su Yanli.

77
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,000
Find out for sure.

78
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,120
I'll feed you to the fish
if this happens again.

79
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,560
But, Master,

80
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,870
are you really going to assassinate your sister

81
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,510
to shift the blame onto Su Yanli?

82
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,000
Those who achieve great things

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,700
must learn to make sacrifices.

84
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,910
Yes.

85
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,860
(Hu Mansion)

86
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,630
Tiantian, you've been here all night.

87
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,750
Go and have some rest.

88
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,920
Tianlin, how is he?

89
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,070
Although most of the poison has been
expelled,

90
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,750
a small portion has penetrated into
the bone marrow.

91
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,390
It's a miracle

92
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
he survived.

93
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,400
Tianba,

94
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,720
Tiantian said that

95
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,040
the Seventh Prince was so seriously injured
because of her.

96
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,040
I wonder who would want to kill her.

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,750
Shouldn't we investigate?

98
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,560
I'll look into this matter.

99
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,830
Don't worry about it.

100
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,040
It's just a resemblance.

101
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,800
How could it be the same person?

102
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,680
(Three years ago, wasn't he...)

103
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,470
Don't be afraid.

104
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,470
Don't be afraid.

105
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,390
Three years ago,

106
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,270
it was you in the Archives, right?

107
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,270
You still remember me?

108
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,160
How could it be you?

109
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,040
So, you've known who I am all along

110
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,870
but didn't tell me.

111
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,720
Would you never have told me

112
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,150
if I hadn't asked?

113
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,200
Su Yanli, why did you keep this from me?

114
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,600
I'll go get Tianlin.

115
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,080
Wait.

116
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,440
Weren't you trying to kill me?

117
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,870
I won't press you for reasons anymore.

118
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,750
If you consider me an enemy,

119
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,270
now is the time to get rid of me.

120
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,630
You can finally get what you wanted.

121
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,790
Su Yanli, don't go too far.

122
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,270
What do you want from me?

123
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,750
I just want you

124
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,750
not to hate me anymore.

125
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,470
Bear it.

126
