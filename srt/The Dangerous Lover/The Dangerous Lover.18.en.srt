00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:13,260
=The Dangerous Lover=

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,940
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,480
- Tianlin.
- Yeah?

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,800
What are you looking for?

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,880
When I was tidying the study,

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,920
I found a woman's purse.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,430
It must be Tiantian's.

8
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,950
No,

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,960
this was obviously hidden here
by someone.

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,670
Is there money inside?

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,030
This purse is quite nice though.

12
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,520
Since it's found, I'll keep it.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,520
Don't tell me you'll give it to Miss Qi.

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,640
What's wrong with that?

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,280
Tianfang,

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,840
a gift should at least be new.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,680
Tianlin,

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,280
in love,

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,680
you should also do cost accounting.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,960
Excuse me.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,480
Tiantian!

22
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,950
What are you doing?

23
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,070
I have been waiting for you here
for a long time.

24
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,640
If we can't resolve
this misunderstanding,

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,120
I will be uneasy day and night.

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,040
You don't need to kneel no matter what.

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,070
Please get up.

28
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,510
About the hairpin,

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,310
I happened to see it

30
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,560
and found it beautiful, so I bought it.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,510
I didn't know you also have one.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,230
If you don't like it,

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,710
I'll throw it away.

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,510
You misunderstood,

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,710
I didn't get upset.

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,660
I will not get up.

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,310
Tiantian, please forgive me.

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,360
Hu Tiantian!

39
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,860
(Blessing)

40
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,080
Fish! Fish!

41
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,150
Freshly caught fish!

42
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,430
Delivered just this morning!

43
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,680
Wow, is this for me?

44
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,840
Yes, carefully selected for you.

45
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,750
Thank you.

46
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,430
Was this used by someone else?

47
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,080
Of course not, how could it be?

48
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,000
It has another woman's scent on it!

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,120
(This scent is so familiar.)

50
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,030
Why does this scent resemble Fufeng's?

51
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,910
Fufeng?

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,800
Oh...

53
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,360
- I don't know her well.
- Hu Tianfang!

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,680
Are you doing that again?

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,870
Siyue, let me explain.

56
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,080
I won't listen to your explanations.

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,400
You're always like this.

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,520
- Are you...
- I'll buy you a new one.

59
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,560
Are you fooling around with other women?

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,470
- Tell me!
- No.

61
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,750
It's just a hairpin

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,120
and you made Fufeng
apologize to you by kneeling?

63
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,680
Tiantian, aren't you
being a bit too much?

64
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,680
Firstly, I don't mind if Miss Liu and I
have the same hairpin.

65
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Secondly, I didn't make her kneel.

66
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,800
She did it on her own.

67
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,310
Are you suggesting

68
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,910
Fufeng is framing you?

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
I don't know why Miss Liu

70
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,680
would do that.

71
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,680
Hu Tiantian,

72
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,520
it's okay for you to be jealous,

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,430
but now you're slandering others!

74
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,280
With your behavior,

75
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,280
how can you be worthy
of being my daughter-in-law?

76
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,150
Mother, you've misunderstood.

77
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,470
Though I'm old,

78
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm not blind.

79
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,150
Kneel!

80
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,150
Mother,

81
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,120
Tiantian really didn't bully me.

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,280
It was my own mistake.

83
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,310
So I went to explain to her voluntarily.

84
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,120
With me here,

85
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,520
you don't need to fear her.

86
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,270
Hu Tiantian,

87
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,030
I didn't want to resort to family law,

88
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,960
but you've only been married
for a few days,

89
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,120
and already being jealous and possessive.

90
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,520
Go to the ancestral hall
and copy scriptures.

91
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,420
This is the Hu Mansion,

92
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,660
which family law are you talking about,
Mother?

93
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,780
Yanli, Hu Tiantian bullied Fufeng first.

94
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,260
Why are you defending an outsider?

95
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,420
You, me, Tiantian,

96
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,700
we're all family.

97
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,020
Who is the outsider you are saying?

98
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,380
Fufeng is also family.

99
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,060
Fufeng is your adopted daughter, not mine.

100
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,540
Naturally, I defer to my own wife.

101
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,020
Besides, everything requires evidence.

102
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,660
If I find out someone

103
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,820
wrongly accused Tiantian intentionally,

104
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,180
don't blame me for being ruthless.

105
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,860
I suffered in the palace

106
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,820
for decades,

107
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,580
now that I'm out,

108
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,460
do I have to behave submissively

109
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,980
in front of the younger generation?

110
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,980
It's okay, it's okay.

111
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,420
I enjoy practicing calligraphy anyway.

112
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,780
I'll do it.

113
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,020
This thing happened because of me.

114
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,980
- I'll accompany her...
- Shut up!

115
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,500
Yanli,

116
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,020
let's have a private conversation.

117
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,700
Wait for me.

118
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,180
What a trouble.

119
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,900
You and I haven't seen each other

120
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,420
for over ten years,

121
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,620
why do we end up like enemies now?

122
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,100
I have no objection over

123
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,420
you defending your wife,

124
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,900
but you could've talked to me nicely.

125
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,620
Fufeng has been taking care of me
for three years,

126
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,700
naturally, I'll favor her more.

127
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,300
The days in the palace were so hard.

128
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,060
Mother, you have suffered a lot
over these years.

129
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
From now on,

130
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,900
I'll consider your feelings more.

131
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,700
Do you remember when you were little?

132
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,620
You loved the flower cakes

133
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,300
from Jinfu Bakery just like I did.

134
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,500
I used to

135
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,620
secretly send people out of the palace

136
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,060
to buy them for you.

137
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,460
I really want to go back to those times.

138
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,420
Since you want to eat flower cakes,

139
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,380
I'll go to Jinfu Bakery right away.

140
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,780
Fufeng.

141
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,300
Mother.

142
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,300
You can rest assured.

143
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,780
I will definitely let Yanli marry you.

144
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,060
Mother,

145
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,460
I'm not fortunate enough for that.

146
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,220
Maybe we should

147
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,940
just forget it.

148
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,900
I don't believe

149
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,380
I can't handle a young woman.

150
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,580
Tiantian.

151
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,980
Mother.

152
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,020
Fufeng has already explained to me.

153
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,020
It was my fault for suspecting you.

154
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,100
It's okay.

155
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,460
I'm glad the misunderstanding is cleared.

156
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,740
To apologize to you,

157
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,460
I've specially prepared a gift for you.

158
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,300
It's okay.

159
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,620
You're the elder,
no need to apologize to me.

160
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,900
Tiantian,

161
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,820
you've been married to my son
for a while,

162
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,780
but you are still not

163
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,900
pregnant.

164
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,900
I've found a miraculous medicine for you.

165
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,260
Take it and eat it.

166
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,500
Mother, what is this?

167
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,140
Why does it smell so strong?

168
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,060
It's a miraculous medicine made from
horse dung and pig blood.

169
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,540
Well, Mother,

170
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,260
both Yanli and I aren't ready yet.

171
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
I don't need it.

172
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,900
Continuing the royal lineage
is a great matter.

173
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,980
Starting from your wedding day,

174
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,420
you should be prepared.

175
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,540
Listen to the experienced,
and take the medicine.

176
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,020
Tiantian, Mother is doing this
for your own good.

177
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,300
Mother!

178
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,460
Hu Tiantian!

179
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,460
I'm doing this for your own good,

180
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,900
why did you push me?

181
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,580
Yanli.

182
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,900
Look, you've married a woman who doesn't
want to continue the royal lineage.

183
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,860
If you inherit the throne in the future,

184
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,700
how will she manage the country?

185
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,220
I just wanted to help you,

186
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,060
but it ended up...

187
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,060
Mother, please don't cry.

188
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,940
Tiantian didn't mean it.

189
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,460
I didn't do it.

190
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,700
Tiantian, what happened?

191
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,980
Mother wants me
to continue the royal lineage

192
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,500
and eat horse dung and pig blood.

193
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,900
Having a child also concerns me.

194
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,900
Then shouldn't I also take this medicine?

195
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,140
Yanli!

196
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,820
Yanli, what problems could you have?

197
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,540
Your Highness, it's not for you.

198
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,500
You are my mother,

199
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,780
so I'm accommodating you in every way.

200
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,620
But if you continue
to make things difficult for Tiantian,

201
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,660
you and Fufeng can move outside the city

202
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,980
to spend your retirement there.

203
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,100
Or you can return to the palace.

204
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,380
You...

205
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,220
Fufeng, let's go.

206
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,460
Thank goodness you came on time,

207
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,060
otherwise, I would've eaten horse dung.

208
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,660
I came back late.

209
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,220
It's not your fault.

210
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,380
You were sent away.

211
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,900
One is your mother,

212
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,700
the other is your newlywed wife.

213
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,060
You're caught in the middle, it's tough.

214
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,500
I understand you.

215
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,820
Tiantian,

216
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,060
don't worry,

217
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,900
I'll handle

218
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,060
