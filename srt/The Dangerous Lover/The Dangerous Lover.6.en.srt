=Episode 6=

3
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,440
I'd rather die on a flower.

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,680
No!

5
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,110
It's just a dream.

6
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,740
(Imperial Academy)

7
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,150
Why is she here?

8
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,820
(Imperial Academy students)

9
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,780
(Imperial Academy students)

10
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,680
Hu Tiantian?

11
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,760
Oh, hurry up and leave.

12
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,710
What do you want?

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Miss Hu, do you think

14
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,920
this outfit of mine

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,120
suits me better than usual plain clothes?

16
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,680
It's just like your personality,
Your Highness,

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,950
all show and no substance.

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,860
Yanli.

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,960
Yanli.

20
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,150
(Qi Siyue?)

21
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,190
Tiantian, long time no see.

22
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,849
(Qi Siyue, daughter of
the Minister of Household)

23
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:15,630
I've missed you so much.

24
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,360
(Why aren't you dead yet?)

25
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,150
Our families are only 500 meters apart.

26
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,280
If you miss me, you can come
see me anytime.

27
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,630
(Your act is getting more and more fake,
Qi Siyue.)

28
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,630
I thought you didn't like studying,

29
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,310
why come to the Imperial Academy?

30
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,840
Thanks to His Majesty's favor,

31
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,870
I'm here to cultivate myself.

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
You are quite special though.

33
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,910
After studying here for years,

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,630
you are still so lively and active.

35
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,710
By the way,

36
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,280
this is the gift I prepared for you two.

37
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,120
I embroidered them myself.

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,150
Hope you will like it.

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,200
Here.

40
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,280
(A pouch from the Embroidery Workshop.)

41
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,360
After several years,

42
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,430
your embroideries

43
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,280
are comparable to those sold outside.

44
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,910
What gift did you prepare for His Highness?

45
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,630
I didn't prepare anything of course.

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,910
- Nothing?
- That's understandable.

47
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,310
With General Hu's current status,

48
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,910
whatever you do, nobody will neglect you.

49
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,310
Unlike me...

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,910
It's not our first meeting.

51
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,910
No need to be so formal.

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
A gift is unnecessary.

53
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,710
Thank you, Miss Qi, I'll return it to you

54
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,150
to avoid misunderstanding.

55
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,870
What's your relationship?

56
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,150
We don't have any relationship.

57
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,470
Now, and in the future.

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,360
Don't make noise.

59
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,280
(Wei Zhiqiu, Grand Preceptor)

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,710
Everyone, open your book.

61
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,070
This class is about The Analects.

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,480
The use of ritual is about peace.

63
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,750
Hey, she's here.

64
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,160
Oh, your jade pendant!

65
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,480
(This is fake jade.)

66
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,910
Sorry.

67
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,310
You'll have to compensate me.

68
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,720
This jade pendant is a

69
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,270
rare treasure from the Western Regions.

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,120
Can you afford it?

71
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,240
Maybe just forget about it.

72
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,480
Although I don't know
why you're picking on me,

73
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,240
I don't want trouble.

74
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,310
This is a genuine tribute from the
Western Regions,

75
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,200
just take it.

76
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,630
Are you humiliating me?

77
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,710
You...

78
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,310
Your Highness's sword injury
hasn't healed yet.

79
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,870
After several years, how did you become
so meddlesome?

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,310
This academy is a

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,480
dangerous place for Tiantian.

82
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,160
Tiantian studying here
might be a good thing for the Hu family.

83
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
What do you mean?

84
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,510
The Hu family has made military merits
and holds high status and power.

85
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,750
This extreme power will easily

86
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,310
lead to arrogance and conceit,

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,630
a poisonous trait based on achievements.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,720
Miss Hu's intelligence

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,830
might change this crisis.

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,480
I understand, Preceptor Wei.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,840
By the way,

92
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,240
please take this sword back.

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you for keeping it for me

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,120
all these years.

95
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,720
Your Highness,

96
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,120
please don't

97
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,870
be blinded

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,040
by the past.

99
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,000
Of course.

100
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,870
(What a waste.)

101
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,390
My clothes may not be as luxurious as yours,

102
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,720
but no matter how dirty, I won't wear
anything from your Hu family.

103
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,920
Who said it was for you?

104
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,310
It's up to you.

105
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,560
Why are you treating me like this?

106
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,870
Because you deserve it.

107
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,430
Your family has received seventy percent of
the Emperor's rewards.

108
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,800
All the students in the academy

109
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,120
dislike your Hu family.

110
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,310
Especially you,

111
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,720
who has contributed nothing to Nankang.

112
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,560
(Even though Hu family's military
achievements were all won by Tianba,)

113
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,750
(what Qi Siyue says makes sense.)

114
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,870
(The nail that sticks out
gets hammered down.)

115
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,830
(If Hu family keeps advancing like this,)

116
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,680
(even without Su Yanli,)

117
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,480
(it will still attract disaster.)

118
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,920
(Now, in the academy,)

119
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,160
(I can't try to kill Su Yanli again,)

120
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,750
(I need to think of another way)

121
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,590
(to stop the Tianji Game.)

122
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,310
Prince Yi is now the Emperor's favorite,

123
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,240
you must be here

124
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,870
because you are plotting against him.

125
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,750
Who do you think you are?

126
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,000
