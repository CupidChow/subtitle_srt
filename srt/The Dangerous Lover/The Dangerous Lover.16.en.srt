=The Dangerous Lover=

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,980
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,800
By the grace of heaven,

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,320
(Decree)
the Emperor decrees:

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,320
Miss Hu Tiantian of the Hu Mansion

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,670
is gentle, virtuous, and beautiful.

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,030
I am happy for this.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,110
Now, the Seventh Prince, Su Yanli,
and Hu Tiantian

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,070
are both of marriageable age,

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,880
the two make a perfect match.

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,240
Therefore, I decree
that you two get married,

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,600
and the wedding shall be held
on an auspicious day.

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,350
By decree.

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,900
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,440
Please get up.

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,430
- Congratulations!
- Sir, please come inside.

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,310
Please.

18
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,560
Tiantian,

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,040
what's going on here?

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,230
I have no idea.

21
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,870
Should I go and ask?

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,120
This is absurd!

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,710
I wonder who schemed

24
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,000
and manipulated

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,350
to have His Majesty issue this decree!

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,420
Actually, it was...

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,180
In fact,
I requested His Majesty's approval.

28
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,860
I have loved Tiantian for a long time.

29
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,220
I hope you would approve, Mother.

30
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,100
You...

31
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,940
Your Highness,

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,540
- what is this?
- It's the betrothal gift.

33
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,660
It's all prepared in advance.

34
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,460
Tiantian is so fortunate.

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,860
(One day earlier)

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,300
Although I am a woman,

37
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,660
I know that after Tianba
came back to the capital,

38
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,340
the military token
should be returned to the court.

39
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,180
After my eldest brother's downfall,

40
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,420
our family received clemency
from Your Majesty.

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,780
At the behest of my second brother,
I've come to return the military token,

42
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,300
hoping that Your Majesty
will continue to trust the Hu family.

43
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,680
But my other two brothers and I
just want to live out the rest of our lives

44
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,320
peacefully with our loved ones.

45
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,200
Loved ones?

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Okay. I will grant you
and the Seventh Prince's marriage

47
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,120
and have the Ministry of Rites
handle the arrangements.

48
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,500
His Highness and I have agreed that

49
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,300
due to the current situation
of the Hu family,

50
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,900
the wedding will be kept simple

51
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,420
and ceremonial rites will be completed
after everything has settled.

52
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,500
I only ask for a betrothal gift
from Your Majesty.

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,740
What else do you want?

54
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,300
A pardon token.

55
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,540
Why do you need that?

56
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,380
There are often rumors and gossip that

57
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,020
the Hu family's power is too great.

58
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,380
It is to safeguard against
any unforeseen circumstances.

59
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,980
What did you say to His Majesty?

60
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,940
Why did he agree so readily?

61
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,540
It's a secret.

62
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,300
Regardless,

63
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,340
you are finally going to be mine.

64
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,150
But before that,

65
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,660
there are a few conditions
you must agree to.

66
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,660
I agree to them.

67
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,420
You're more decisive than your father.

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Firstly, I decide
the venue for the wedding.

69
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,340
(Happiness)
Hurry, come help me with this.

70
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,860
Gui, come here.

71
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,930
Yeah, coming.

72
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,090
I don't know why Her Ladyship

73
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,820
- insists on doing it in this dilapidated house.
- Put it here.

74
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,460
- Hurry, hurry.
- Okay.

75
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,020
Make sure everything is in place.

76
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,580
You two, help me lift this up.

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,540
Careful with the wine jug.

78
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,940
How does it look?

79
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,860
Is it straight?

80
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,020
- It's leaning a bit to the left.
- Secondly, the fewer guests, the better.

81
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:07,060
(Happiness)

82
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,540
Our little sister has grown up.

83
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,580
How unreasonable!

84
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,980
How come we are not allowed
to attend our sister's wedding?

85
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,460
I know!

86
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,940
Tianfang, will you invite me
to your wedding?

87
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,260
Of course, I will!

88
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,220
Tianlin, will you come to my wedding?

89
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,660
I must attend!

90
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,080
- Tianlin!
- Tianfang!

91
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,020
- Tiantian!
- Tiantian!

92
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,620
And lastly,

93
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,340
within a radius of five kilometers,

94
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,180
not a single soldier should be present.

95
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,340
(It should be foolproof this way.)

96
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,020
(The Hu family's extermination...)

97
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,940
(No, it won't happen.)

98
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:01,260
(Happiness)

99
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,220
Chui'er.

100
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,860
Chui'er, has Su Yanli not arrived yet?

101
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,700
Not yet.

102
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,660
What's the situation at the Hu Mansion?

103
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,940
The second young master

104
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,540
has deployed guards to protect
the Hu Mansion as you said.

105
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,100
If anything happens,

106
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,700
they will immediately inform us.

107
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,820
Okay, good.

108
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,700
(Su Yanli, I trust you.)

109
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,700
The Hu family's power
threatens the throne.

110
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,140
You deserve it.

111
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,620
Sorry, I'm late.

112
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,300
At Yanling Temple outside the city,

113
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,060
I waited a long time
to obtain this safety talisman.

114
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,540
Bow to heaven and earth.

115
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,940

You're holding him the wrong way.

135
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,100
Let me do it.

136
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,620
- Look at him crying.
- Look what I bought you.

137
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,340
Tianfang, put it on the table too.

138
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,260
Put it there.

139
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,660
- Wait and see what he chooses later.
- I bought you a tambourine.

140
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,660
- Isn't it cute?
- Tianlin.

141
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,460
- This turner,
- Look.

142
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,900
why is it here?

143
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
What's wrong with the turner?

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,500
What if our little nephew
wants to learn cooking in the future?

145
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
This child is so smart,

146
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,980
he's definitely going to make big money.

147
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,940
Oh, that's not certain.

148
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,540
Cooking is also a skill, you know.

149
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,220
- How can this turner be put here?
- Look, an abacus.

150
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,940
Do you want it?

151
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,780
Oh,
