3
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:30,540
(Happiness)

4
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,160
Honey.

5
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
Your Highness.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,310
Today is our wedding day.

7
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,760
His Majesty has specially
issued an edict saying that

8
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,680
the Frontier-pacifying General Hu Tianba

9
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,230
and his younger brothers,

10
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,680
Hu Tianlin and Hu Tianfang,

11
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,590
tried to kill a prince
and plotted rebellion.

12
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,840
Their entire family will be executed.

13
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
Why?

14
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,800
The Hu family's power
threatens the throne.

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,240
You deserve it.

16
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,680
Since I married you,

17
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,680
I am no longer part of the Hu family.

18
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,310
Honey.

19
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,430
But the Hu family no longer

20
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,680
means anything to me.

21
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,560
How does it feel to kill your loved one

22
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,080
by yourself?

23
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,000
I should have known it was you.

24
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,870
You are an accomplice of Hu Tianba.

25
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,360
General Hu said he would come for me.

26
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,520
If it weren't for you,

27
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,960
we would be happy together now.

28
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,150
How did you know my plan?

29
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,870
I have to admire you.

30
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,310
Your trap was truly clever.

31
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,560
First, you used the list of remnants as bait

32
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,510
and staged a good show with Hu Tianfang.

33
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,160
Then, you let Qi Siyue

34
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,830
pretend to be tracked by me

35
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,000
and lured me into a trap

36
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,800
to show me where Hu Tianfang was.

37
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,920
You calculated that

38
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,510
I would take action when Hu Tianlin

39
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,600
and Hu Tianfang exchanged the list.

40
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,600
Unfortunately,

41
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,510
you forgot about her.

42
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,190
Miss, be careful.

43
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,160
You love Hu Tiantian so deeply,

44
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,600
how could you let her risk her life?

45
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,120
That's when I knew

46
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,870
the list was fake

47
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,800
and that you intended to fool me.

48
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,430
It seems to be fate for you all

49
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,870
to accompany General Hu in death.

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,830
So you brought His Majesty's men

51
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,120
to exterminate the entire Hu family

52
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,120
and framed me unjustly.

53
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,120
That's right.

54
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,000
I thought you would use tonight

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,430
to rescue Hu Tiantian.

56
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,800
I had already prepared the ambush here.

57
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,950
I didn't expect you to kill her.

58
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,920
You really made it easier for me.

59
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,750
If you kill me here,

60
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,870
you won't escape His Majesty's pursuit.

61
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,800
Don't worry about me.

62
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,720
I will tell

63
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,190
His Majesty that

64
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,950
you killed your wife
and then took your own life in tears.

65
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,270
Isn't that a perfect ending for you?

66
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,270
You madwoman.

67
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,510
His Majesty won't believe your words.

68
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,720
I have the military token.

69
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,390
He has to believe me.

70
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,270
You want to rebel?

71
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,120
I won't spare anyone

72
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,310
who killed General Hu.

73
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,790
Do it!

74
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,200
Eunuch Zhang.

75
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,830
Eunuch Zhang, why are you...

76
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,040
Have you heard

77
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,270
what she said just now?

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,240
And what she's holding

79
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,000
is the best evidence.

80
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,240
- Guards! Seize her!
- Yes!

81
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,720
Su Yanli, you are ruthless.

82
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,360
To lure me out,

83
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,160
you sacrificed the entire Hu family.

84
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,720
My death is worth it.

85
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,430
You'll be disappointed.

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,920
Impossible!

87
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,830
You're already dead.

88
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,360
The blood on your dagger...

89
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,510
Don't move.

90
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,630
Believe me.

91
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,720
You really scared me just now.

92
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,920
It's okay, just a minor injury.

93
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,790
I wouldn't have made her fall for it

94
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,040
if I hadn't done this.

95
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,720
You're right.

96
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,120
This woman

97
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,270
is indeed very cunning.

98
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,190
Tianlin, Tianfang,

99
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,120
you are fine?

100
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,560
Liu Fufeng,

101
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,070
your people out there

102
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,510
have all been wiped out by us.

103
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,960
It's impossible.

104
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,340
It's impossible.

105
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,870
I already saw through your plan!

106
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,630
You should have all died! All died!

107
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,840
Your natural suspicion

108
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,720
and meticulous thoughts

109
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,390
made it difficult to lure you in.

110
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,720
If you weren't so sure of victory,

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,720
you wouldn't have
revealed your true color.

112
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,440
So the only variable

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,320
was Tiantian's involvement.

114
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,230
Don't move.

115
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,510
I simply went along with the mistake,

116
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,720
- reported to His Majesty,
- Tiantian?

117
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,510
- and let everyone help me stage this play.
- Why are you here?

118
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,080
Su Yanli!

119
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,720
You traitor! Traitor!

120
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,120
Let's stage a good play together.

121
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,320
Believe me.

122
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,240
Father, I have one more request.

123
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,510
If it was just to lure you out,

124
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,150
Tiantian truly knew nothing about this.

125
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,790
That's why,

126
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
just now,

127
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,080
you didn't suspect.

128
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,550
You're really silly.

129
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,510
What if I had actually
stabbed you just now?

130
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
If you had actually stabbed me,

131
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,720
I would have deserved it.

132
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,270
