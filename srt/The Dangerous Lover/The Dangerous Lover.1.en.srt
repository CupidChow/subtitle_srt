00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,980
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,100
(Happiness)

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,740
(Happiness)

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,970
- Chui'er.
- Yes?

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,490
(Tie Chui'er, Hu Tiantian's maid)
Is my husband handsome?

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,740
Miss, don't be impatient.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,730
I'm going to sneak a peek.

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,180
Alright.

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,340
(Hu Tiantian,
Fourth Young Lady of the Hu family)

11
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,260
Chui'er,

12
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,420
have you left?

13
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,140
(Su Yanli, Seventh Prince of Nankang)

14
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,090
Honey.

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,130
Your Highness.

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,700
Is it you?

17
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,730
I am not ready yet.

18
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,170
You don't need to prepare for this.

19
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,020
Today is our wedding day.

20
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,570
His Majesty has specially
issued an edict saying that

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,860
the Frontier-pacifying General Hu Tianba

22
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,700
and his younger brothers,

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,500
Hu Tianlin and Hu Tianfang,

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,940
- are plotting rebellion.
- Don't run, stop!

25
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,330
Their entire family

26
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,530
will be executed.

27
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,450
Why?

28
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,290
The Hu family's power
threatens the throne.

29
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,730
You deserve it.

30
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,370
Since I married you,

31
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,970
I am no longer part of the Hu family.

32
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,250
Honey.

33
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,370
But the Hu family no longer

34
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,570
means anything to me.

35
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,620
(Tianji Game)

36
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,460
A cup of Tianji Tea

37
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,490
(Master Tianji)
to foresee the future.

38
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,940
I wonder what

39
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,820
your husband looked like

40
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,050
in the Tianji Game.

41
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,890
I didn't see clearly,

42
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,210
but I know who he is.

43
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,660
Yeah?

44
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,170
The Seventh Prince,

45
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,450
Su Yanli.

46
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,730
He killed my whole family.

47
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,010
But three years ago,

48
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,170
he was demoted to commoner status.

49
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,770
How could a fallen Seventh Prince

50
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,250
destroy the illustrious Hu family?

51
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,970
Is there a way to break this Tianji Game?

52
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,610
Oh.

53
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,930
Blessing or disaster,

54
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,650
all is heaven's will.

55
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,170
Once the game begins,

56
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,250
the outcome is predetermined.

57
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,940
Where is

58
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,330
Su Yanli now?

59
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,290
Remember,

60
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,290
the heavenly secret must not be leaked.

61
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,820
(Hu Mansion)

62
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,570
Chui'er!

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,410
Miss, you're finally back.

64
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,370
- Um...
- Chui'er.

65
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,690
What's going on?

66
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,410
(Thank goodness.)

67
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,730
(A false alarm.)

68
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,300
Tiantian, where did you go?

69
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,260
(Hu Tianlin, Second Young Master)
Tianba will triumphantly return tomorrow,

70
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,090
yet you're never home.

71
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,620
Look,

72
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,740
these are gifts sent by
His Majesty's envoy, Eunuch Zhang.

73
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,780
This Black Fox Cape, try it on.

74
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,980
(Hu Tianfang, Third Young Master)

75
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,860
Hmm.

76
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,700
Not bad.

77
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,140
You're young and

78
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,900
this color makes you look older.

79
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,860
I'll keep it for you.

80
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,700
Hey!

81
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,180
Tianlin.

82
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,580
Tianfang.

83
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,300
Tiantian.

84
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,540
I'll return it to you.

85
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,900
Why are you crying?

86
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,980
Alright, alright.

87
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,300
Seeing our Hu family gaining more glory,

88
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,540
look,

89
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,860
the noble families in Nankang

90
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,580
sent so many marriage proposals.

91
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,940
From seventh-rank officer
to first-rank general,

92
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,540
they're all lining up to marry you.

93
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,260
You should settle down.

94
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,300
Stop running around all day,

95
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,780
or Tianba will break your legs.

96
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
(Marriage proposals?)

97
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,020
(Marry me?)

98
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,700
(Getting married?)

99
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,940
(This is...)

100
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,540
(that ring.)

101
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,740
(I didn't expect this person)

102
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,580
(to show up so quickly.)

103
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,220
The Hu family's power
threatens the throne.

104
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,060
You deserve it.

105
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,420
Tianba has not yet been appointed
as Frontier-pacifying General,

106
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,820
and I have not yet settled my marriage.

107
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,420
There's still time for everything.

108
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,460
The fabric of this scroll painting

109
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,340
appears to be exclusively for palace use.

110
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,620
(There's only one place in the palace)

111
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,540
(that uses such simple fabric.)

112
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,620
(The Archives.)

113
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,660
(The Archives)

114
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,420
(Why is there no one here?)

115
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,900
(Could it be that Su Yanli)

116
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,100
(is not in the Archives?)

117
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,940
Oh dear.

118
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,140
Donglan.

119
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
I'm here.

120
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,220
What do you think?

121
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,620
How do I look in this outfit?

122
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,660
(Could he be the Seventh Prince?)

123
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,300
You look good in anything you wear.

124
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,380
(Xia Jiu, Palace Servant in the Archives)
Yeah?

125
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,580
Such luxurious attire

126
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,660
indeed suits me best.

127
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,980
(Donglan, Palace Maid in the Archives)
Why did you summon me here?

128
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,900
It's just the two of us in the Archives.

129
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,100
It's been so long.

130
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,580
We are both lonely.

131
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,860
Why don't we...

132
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,940
- Let go of me!
- As long as you cooperate...

133
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,740
(He still has no shame
after being demoted.)

134
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,660
- (They want me to marry him?)
- Let go of me!

135
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,780
Who's there?

136
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,020
(Tiantian?)

137
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,980
Don't let him escape.

138
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,270
Find him and kill him.

139
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,260
Yes!

140
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,660
Hurry!

141
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,700
- Hurry.
- What are you doing?

142
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,740
(Three years ago)

143
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,580
What do you want?

144
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,100
Where is he?

145
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,300
Keep searching.

146
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,500
Yes.

147
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,580
Hurry.

148
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,820
Not here.

149
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
You're injured.

150
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,060
Let me help you.

151
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,500
Bear it.

152
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,460
Be quiet. Help me out.

153
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,020
Wait.

154
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,600
It's not appropriate for you
to go in like this.

155
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,020
Cut the crap.

156
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,100
Just go in.

157
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,380
Are you looking for me?

158
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,180
Did you see anyone?

159
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,380
No.

160
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,300
Is this floor clean?

161
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,540
It's clean.

162
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,980
Then why

163
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,100
are my shoes so dirty?

164
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,780
Remember,

165
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,940
the Archives can tolerate you

166
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,980
only because of my kindness.

167
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,300
If my heart were a bit darker,

168
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,700
you'd be dead by now.

169
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,380
The assassin

170
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,740
hasn't been found yet.

171
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,420
Clean this up.

172
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,300
Donglan,

173
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
let's go.

174
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,900
(This Seventh Prince is so mean.)

175
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,340
There's no need to hide.

176
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,020
He won't come back anytime soon.

177
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,740
Thank you.

178
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,270
Here, put this on.

179
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,180
I'm not cold.

180
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,820
It's cold outside.

181
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,860
You might catch a cold.

182
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,220
You...

183
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,820
work for the Seventh Prince?

184
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,300
(So she mistook Xia Jiu for me?)

185
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,820
Tell me,

186
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,300
what's your name?

187
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,620
I'm Xia Jiu.

188
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,500
I thought you were going to report me
to him just now.

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,340
You saw it too.

190
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,780
They don't like me.

191
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,820
Besides, I was also afraid
you'd report me

192
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,500
for sneaking to bathe in the hot spring.

193
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,540
I'm always grateful.

194
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,660
Next time, I'll go to your supervisor

195
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,140
and put in a good word for you,

196
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,300
see if I can get you transferred
from this place.

197
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,820
And who are you?

198
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,460
You speak pretty boldly.

199
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,540
And why sneak into the palace
late at night?

200
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,460
I'm looking for someone
with deep enmity against me.

201
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,940
Who?

202
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,100
