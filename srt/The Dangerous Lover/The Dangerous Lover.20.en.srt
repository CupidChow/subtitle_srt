=Episode 20=

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,280
Miss Tiantian
asked me to come back first,

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,870
so I did.

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,320
I didn't expect her to be...

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,670
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
Those two scoundrels were so menacing.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,470
A whole night has passed,
I'm afraid Tiantian...

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,670
It's all my fault.

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,430
I shouldn't have left her alone there.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,240
When did these scoundrels

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,710
abduct Tiantian?

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,470
I don't remember the exact time.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,070
Probably at dusk yesterday.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,070
Then why did you
only return to report at noon today?

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,520
This is the first time
I have encountered such a situation.

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,470
I panicked

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,000
and forgot the way back.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,680
Liu Fufeng,

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,560
don't you think

21
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,590
the reason you gave is too far-fetched?

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,760
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,560
I know my sins are grave,

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,790
but what I said is true.

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,920
If I lied, I'd...

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,000
Don't curse yourself.

28
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,920
Since she is missing,

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,040
we just need to find her.

30
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,840
What's the use of venting on Fufeng?

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
Find her?

32
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,000
It's easy for you to say.

33
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,510
Your Ladyship,

34
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,510
I've been tolerating you

35
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,870
because you are an elder.

36
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,150
But I will never let you
and your adopted daughter

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,560
belittle my family.

38
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,710
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,040
I didn't take good care of Tiantian.

40
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,480
I've dispatched all troops to find her.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,680
If anyone harms her even slightly,

42
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,150
I'll make them suffer.

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
I'll immediately mobilize all scouts

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,710
to inquire about Tiantian's whereabouts.

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,400
Let's go.

46
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,990
Your Highness,

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
we traced Miss Tiantian's trail

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,470
to a bandit's den outside the city.

49
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,800
Here's ten taels.

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,870
- And charge 20 taels here.
- Good idea.

51
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,750
This is a profitable
and risk-free business.

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,680
I like it.

53
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,800
Tiantian!

54
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
Tiantian!

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,200
Yanli!

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,280
You finally came.

57
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,980
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,780
Did they bully you?

59
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,700
No.

60
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,980
Come and see.

61
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,780
I'm showing them the banquet plan

62
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,940
from back then.

63
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,180
I suggested that

64
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,060
during festivals and holidays,

65
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,220
they could organize similar events

66
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,740
to bring everyone together

67
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,780
to enjoy the bustling

68
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,260
and increase local trade.

69
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,220
This way, they won't resort
to bad deeds for a living.

70
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,300
Miss Hu is so clever.

71
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,420
We've benefited a lot.

72
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,140
Mr. Bai is a good person.

73
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,020
He treated me well.

74
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,220
Thank you. Let's go home.

75
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,060
This is my territory.

76
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,580
You can't come and go

77
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,940
as you please.

78
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,860
You want to stop me?

79
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,940
Su Yanli, we had a deal.

80
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,260
I will help you by taking care of
your mother's adopted daughter.

81
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,180
But things went wrong,

82
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,140
and I almost lost my life.

83
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,580
I haven't settled the score with you yet.

84
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,460
I asked you to take away Liu Fufeng,

85
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,460
not my wife.

86
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,420
It was them.

87
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,660
We are sorry.

88
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,060
- We are sorry.
- We won't dare to do it again.

89
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,140
They said they had a girl to sell,

90
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,780
and then they took her to me.

91
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,100
It was not me who did it.

92
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,020
Alright, alright.

93
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,380
You both know each other
and it was a misunderstanding.

94
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,220
Let them put their swords away.

95
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,980
Let go of her hand.

96
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,660
Alright, I'm a big-hearted person.

97
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,220
I'll forgive you

98
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,300
for Tiantian's sake.

99
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,020
But let me remind you as a friend,

100
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,060
Liu Fufeng is not easy to deal with.

101
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,900
You better take good care of Tiantian.

102
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,580
That's none of your business.

103
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,100
Tiantian,

104
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,220
I'll miss you.

105
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,300
- Remember to visit often.
- Ignore him!

106
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,260
Visit often!

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,220
Why are you upset?

108
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,860
I'm not.

109
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,300
Are you blaming me for being kidnapped

110
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,700
or are you upset because of Mother?

111
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,300
Don't be mad.

112
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,940
Su Yanli, if you keep this up,
I won't talk to you.

113
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,420
Tell me, what are you upset about?

114
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,460
Bai Wushuang,

115
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,860
he actually touched your hand.

116
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,780
That is why you're upset?

117
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,620
Yes.

118
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,860
Bai Wushuang

119
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,020
even put his arm around me.

120
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,900
What's wrong with him?

121
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,020
I'm going to sleep.

122
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,500
Su Yanli,

123
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,020
do you know

124
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,700
why I wasn't afraid

125
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,020
when I was there today?

126
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,420
It's because I knew you would come.

127
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,660
You don't know
how worried I was about you.

128
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,460
