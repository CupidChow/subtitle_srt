00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,980
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,340
My name is Liu Fufeng.

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,900
Greetings, Your Highness.

5
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,940
Graceful in dance,

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,660
fragrance lingering on the sleeves,

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,140
Miss Liu truly possesses
both talent and beauty.

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,820
Fufeng is a palace maid

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,220
responsible for my daily life,

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,100
but she is talented

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,660
in music, chess,

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,620
calligraphy, and painting.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,980
When I fell seriously ill before,

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,540
she risked her life to save me.

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,620
A feat unmatched
by other palace attendants.

16
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,060
Thus, I adopted her as my daughter.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,100
Tiantian,

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,900
you should learn from Miss Liu.

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,660
Over these years, my son has grown up.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,500
Mother, you've endured so much
over the years.

21
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,620
Your Ladyship gracing the Hu Mansion

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,860
brings radiance to our estate.

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,380
You are so kind, Mr. Hu.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,860
Thanks to His Majesty graciousness,

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,780
I could reunite with my son.

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,540
I should thank you all

27
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,180
for helping him

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,980
in the past period of time.

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,700
Oh, by the way,

30
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,100
I heard that neither of

31
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,860
Tianlin and Tianfang
has yet been married.

32
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,260
If you don't mind,

33
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,060
I could help in that area.

34
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,620
- Thank you...
- No need. Thank you.

35
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,380
Tiantian, are you betrothed?

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,180
Not yet.

37
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,740
I have a nephew who has

38
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,180
just been promoted to governor.

39
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,060
I think he and Tiantian
would make a perfect match.

40
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,980
Shall I arrange it for you?

41
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,900
Mother,

42
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,420
Tiantian is still young.

43
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,300
You're thinking too far ahead for her.

44
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,060
You should consider me first.

45
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,780
I don't need to do that.

46
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,460
Because you are about to be with Yanli.

47
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,860
Mother, I...

48
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,860
Mother,

49
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,500
I just want to stay by your side
and take care of you.

50
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,700
Alright, I know you are a good girl.

51
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,100
Are you alright, Tiantian?

52
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,860
I'm fine.

53
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,060
Don't take Her Ladyship's words

54
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,340
to heart.

55
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,100
She doesn't know about you

56
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,420
and His Highness's feelings.

57
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,140
Miss Liu, you're overthinking it.

58
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,500
I'm not bothered.

59
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,700
Rest assured, Tiantian.

60
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,180
As long as you truly love each other,

61
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,940
no one can make you break up,

62
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,340
including Her Ladyship.

63
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,260
You will be the wife,
and I'll be the consort.

64
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,100
I am willing to serve you
and His Highness for life.

65
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,300
Are you saying that

66
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,540
you want to marry Su Yanli?

67
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,620
By the command of parents,

68
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,420
marriage isn't something I can decide.

69
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,900
His Highness is a prince after all.

70
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,940
What are you thinking?

71
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,420
Nothing.

72
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,740
What's wrong?

73
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,860
Do you have something on your mind?

74
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,580
No, nothing.

75
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,540
If you don't say it, I'll leave.

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,820
Hey, don't go!

77
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,740
What's wrong?

78
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,140
Did someone upset you?

79
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,420
How many consorts

80
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,740
did your father have
before he married your mother?

81
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,420
Three.

82
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,780
How many consorts does he have?

83
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,020
Seven in total.

84
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,580
As an imperial prince,

85
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,180
will you also have many consorts
in the future?

86
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,420
Oh, you know,

87
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,020
we princes must obey

88
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,780
the imperial edicts.

89
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,540
I'm leaving.

90
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,180
I was just teasing you.

91
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,300
You really took it seriously.

92
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,620
Su Yanli, I'm asking you seriously.

93
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,300
Alright,

94
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,420
then I'll answer you seriously.

95
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
I, Su Yanli,

96
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,660
will either not marry at all

97
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,620
or marry only you.

98
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,180
So, if I can't marry in this lifetime,

99
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,780
will you remain unmarried for life?

100
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,620
Yes.

101
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,500
Tiantian,

102
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,780
from the moment I first saw you,

103
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,020
- I fell in love with you.
- I'll help you.

104
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,820
For three years,
I hid in the dark Archives,

105
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,020
repeatedly sketching
your face in my mind,

106
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,860
barely enduring those endless nights.

107
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,740
Miss Hu?

108
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,260
You're like a bright moon

109
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,780
falling into my embrace.

110
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,940
I think of you, long for you,

111
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,780
- Give it back!
- and pursue you.

112
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,180
You deceived me, harmed me,
and avoided me,

113
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,020
yet I don't blame you.

114
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,380
Tiantian,

115
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,780
I won't marry anyone but you.
