=The Dangerous Lover=

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,980
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,740
Let me out!

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,140
- Let me out!
- Tiantian,

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,650
this is Tianba's order.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,260
Tianlin,

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,490
is Su Yanli dead?

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,970
Tiantian, what's wrong with you?

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,890
The Seventh Prince didn't do anything
against the Hu Family.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,700
Tianlin, Tianba,

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,890
trust me.

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,140
Su Yanli must die!

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,180
Thank you.

14
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,060
Your Highness, please forgive us.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,260
I don't know why Tiantian has

16
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,880
hostile feelings towards you lately.

17
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,650
She must have been misled.

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,420
I'll discipline her

19
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,700
as much as I can.

20
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,450
Miss Hu didn't mean to harm me.

21
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,900
She didn't

22
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,730
hit any vital parts of me.

23
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,140
I came here

24
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,980
to clear up the misunderstanding

25
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,700
at the Archives.

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,100
Please don't

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,380
blame her, General.

28
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,340
Thank you, Your Highness,

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,060
for your magnanimity.

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,420
Three years ago,

31
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,580
I was framed

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,420
and spared by His Majesty

33
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,980
to work as a servant in the Archives.

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,980
Only you still acknowledge me

35
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,740
as the Seventh Prince.

36
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,420
I've endured humiliation these years,

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,420
determined to expose the traitor

38
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,420
and clear my name.

39
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,580
But Miss Hu is innocent, naive,

40
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,980
intelligent, and candid.

41
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,140
It has nothing to do with her.

42
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,300
I don't want her involved.

43
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,020
Of course.

44
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,220
As long as she behaves,

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,510
she'll forever be my sister.

46
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,500
Miss, it's time to eat.

47
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,420
You can't escape.

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,780
Save some energy.

49
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,580
(Feast Permit)

50
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,700
With this permit,

51
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,380
you can freely enjoy

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,860
food and drink in any of

53
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,700
the taverns

54
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,660
in Nankang without worry.

55
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,100
Just pretend to faint.

56
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,860
When Tianba asks,

57
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,300
just say I drugged you.

58
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,500
Alright, good for you.

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,860
Then eat these pastries.

60
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,100
I have no appetite.

61
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,420
Miss, think positively.

62
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,660
The Seventh Prince is gone.

63
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,260
There's nothing

64
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,180
you can do...

65
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,780
(Su Yanli, in this case,)

66
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,380
(I'll bring you down with me.)

67
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,140
(South Gate)

68
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,100
Hu Tiantian,
His Majesty wants to see you.

69
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

70
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,220
(The Emperor)

71
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,060
Hu Tiantian,

72
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,740
I heard you knelt at my palace gate

73
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,100
for six hours.

74
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,420
Do you have any grievances?

75
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,300
I came to turn myself in.

76
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,260
Yeah?

77
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,420
Xia Jiu, the servant in the Archives,

78
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,340
was killed by me.

79
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,740
Why did you kill a palace servant?

80
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,820
Your Majesty,

81
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,020
I love books and paintings.

82
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,780
That day, I sneaked into the Archives
to see them,

83
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,420
but Xia Jiu caught me.

84
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,420
Afraid of being exposed,

85
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,620
I killed him.

86
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,180
Do you know that

87
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,420
murder demands a life in return?

88
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,820
I do.

89
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,140
I'll confess everything

90
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,700
and hope for a lighter punishment.

91
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,500
Who was your accomplice?

92
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,180
The Seventh Prince, Su Yanli.

93
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,780
Is this true, Yanli?

94
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
No, Father.

95
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,940
Miss Hu

96
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,020
saw Xia Jiu mistreat me

97
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,420
and felt pity,

98
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,300
so she gave me a mildly toxic potion

99
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,420
for self-defense.

100
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,700
Unexpectedly, Xia Jiu died,

101
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,700
and Miss Hu felt guilty,

102
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
so she came to confess.

103
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,060
Your Majesty, what he says is not true.

104
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,100
Please punish us.

105
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,580
Enough. Yanli has already

106
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,780
told me everything about it.

107
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,180
Don't mention it anymore.

108
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,580
Your Majesty...

109
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,700
Your Majesty, General Hu has come.

110
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,180
Let him in.

111
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,020
- (Tianba?)
- Yes.

112
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,140
Your Majesty.

113
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,180
Tiantian has recently been
under some stress

114
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,190
and inadvertently offended Your Majesty
and His Highness.

115
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,700
Please forgive her.

116
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,420
Alright, General Hu,

117
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,660
the matter concerning

118
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,620
your sister is now settled.

119
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

120
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,060
Your Majesty,

121
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,500
General Hu has just come in time.

122
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,860
I happened to come across an item

123
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,380
and wanted to ask if General Hu

124
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
(Hu)
recognizes it.

125
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,860
Xia Jiu gave it to me before he died.

126
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,540
(Hu)

127
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,020
Three years ago, Xia Jiu asked me
to lead troops into the palace.

128
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,380
And I was able to pass through
the former court hall

129
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,300
(Three years ago)
thanks to this.

130
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,700
Your Highness, His Majesty was attacked!

131
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,300
Father, sorry for not coming earlier.

132
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,100
Seventh Prince,

133
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,700
are you really going to rebel?

134
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,620
Arrest him!

135
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,180
General Hu, what are you doing?

136
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,620
Where is my father?

137
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,220
Your Majesty,

138
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
this is indeed my forbidden palace pass,

139
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,100
but it was lost three years ago.

140
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,980
Many people in the palace
can confirm this.

141
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,180
It appears that

142
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,100
Xia Jiu stole it.

143
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,300
Your Highness,

144
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,980
please don't suspect me.

145
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,460
(Xia Jiu is dead)

146
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,660
(and he is alarmed now.)

147
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,220
(It will be detrimental to both sides
if I continue pursuing.)

148
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
On the contrary,

149
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,780
I am just concerned that

150
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,820
three years ago, it was not only me
who was framed.

151
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,660
The villain also wanted to cause conflict

152
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,100
between us and sit back
to reap the rewards.

153
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,220
Your Majesty, please

154
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,720
reconsider the matter
from three years ago

155
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,260
and clear the Seventh Prince's name.

156
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,580
I will continue to investigate

157
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,420
who was behind Xia Jiu.

158
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,820
Yanli, since General Hu
is willing to vouch for you,

159
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,380
I will restore your position as a prince.

160
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,860
As compensation,
you will be appointed as Prince Yi.

161
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,700
Thank you, Father, for your grace.

162
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,460
From today,

163
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,060
you will return to the Imperial Academy

164
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,060
and receive tutoring from Preceptor Wei.

165
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,020
Also, you,

166
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,420
Hu Tiantian,

167
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,900
as a daughter of a prominent family,

168
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,820
dared to trespass into the Archives.

169
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,860
You love books so much, don't you?

170
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,300
So you will also go with him.

171
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,140
Huh?

172
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,500
Your Highness,

173
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,180
His Majesty has sent us secretly
to assist in thoroughly

174
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,700
investigating the rebellion
from three years ago.

175
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,540
Now it seems that

176
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,700
we have a clue.

177
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,700
Hu Tianba has sensed my suspicion of him.

178
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,260
He must be more restrained
in his actions recently.

179
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,460
We should observe and be patient.

180
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,660
Remember

181
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,940
not to harm Tiantian in any situation.

182
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,620
Do we need to send someone

183
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,380
to keep an eye on the Imperial Academy?

184
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,300
No need.

185
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,300
Yes.

186
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,820
Oh,

187
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,980
now I have to be with her day and night.

188
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,780
I can understand
if they send me here to study,

189
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,300
but to sweep the Imperial Academy?

190
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,020
It's too big to sweep all by myself.

191
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,060
Every time I encounter Su Yanli,
it's always trouble.

192
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,660
Are you sent
by Master Tianji to torture me?

193
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,700
Are you talking about me?

194
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,620
How dare you come again.

195
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,180
Aren't you afraid
I'll try to kill you again?

196
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,940
You tried to kill me

197
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,260
because you were afraid
I'd annihilate the Hu family.

198
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,900
I am now Prince Yi.

199
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,060
If you kill me, the Hu family will be
wiped out immediately.

200
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,260
Do you dare?

201
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,140
I warn you not to mess around.

202
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,780
Instead of worrying about the future,
we should seize the present.

203
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,660
Su Yanli, what are you up to?

204
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,380
I'd rather die on a flower.
