=Episode 14=

3
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,200
In the next life...

4
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,750
I promise to marry you.

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,920
(Was I out of my mind?)

6
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,000
(Why did I say something so foolish?)

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,790
(If I open my eyes now,)

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,750
(will it be a bit embarrassing?)

9
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,510
Get up, I know you are awake.

10
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,510
You did it on purpose.

11
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,760
Just trying to tease you a bit.

12
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,790
What are you looking at?

13
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,680
I'm looking at my future wife.

14
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,480
What? You still want to say no?

15
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,400
Su Yanli,

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,920
I admit it

17
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,680
that I like you.

18
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,680
I really like you.

19
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,960
I really want to be with you.

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,710
But, can we not get married?

21
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,280
- Because...
- Okay.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
No problem.

23
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,400
I've waited so long.

24
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,870
Just being with you is enough for me.

25
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,400
I failed to make perfect arrangement

26
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,840
and caused you distress,
Father. I'm sorry.

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,280
Your actions in eliminating the rebels

28
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,750
were excellent.

29
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,960
Three years ago, I secretly asked you
to stay in the Archives

30
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,870
and investigate the palace coup.

31
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,120
Now we finally have a conclusion.

32
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,630
I've made you suffer all these years,

33
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,630
but this is the necessary path
for a prince to achieve great things.

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,150
Tell me what reward you desire.

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,910
I have only one request.

36
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,870
You want to plead for the Hu family?

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,960
Father, you are wise.

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,710
Although Hu Tianba
committed grave offenses,

39
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,310
the rest of the Hu family
are loyal subjects.

40
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,030
I hope Father will show mercy

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,910
and spare the Hu family
from extermination.

42
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,310
Hu Tianlin and Hu Tianfang

43
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,710
have merits from protecting me.

44
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,190
As for Hu Tiantian,

45
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,520
she risked her life to protect you.

46
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,630
I grant your request,

47
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,630
and will spare them
from collective punishment.

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,630
But although death penalties
can be spared,

49
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,870
crimes cannot go unpunished.

50
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,520
I will confiscate half
of the Hu family's property

51
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,840
and transfer it to the national treasury

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,190
as a deterrent to others.

53
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,840
Thank you, Father, for your mercy.

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,520
Yanli, I have always been fair.

55
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,750
These days,

56
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,870
I have been thinking of your mother,

57
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,710
who has been in the palace all these years,

58
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,520
cultivating herself,
observing fasting, and praying.

59
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,630
I will allow her to leave the palace

60
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,590
and accompany you for a while.

61
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,190
Thank you, Father.

62
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,630
By the grace of Heaven,

63
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,960
(South Gate)
the Emperor decrees:

64
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,310
The traitorous intentions
of General Hu Tianba

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,030
merit immediate execution

66
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,310
by beheading.

67
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,410
By order of the Emperor.

68
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Su Yanli,

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,160
even if I become a ghost,
I will not let you go!

70
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,820
Tiantian!

71
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,100
(Mourning)

72
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,960
Tianba,

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,630
let's be good brothers

74
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
in a common family in the next life.

75
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,190
Tianba, rest in peace.

76
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,240
Be a good person in the next life.

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,120
Tianba, in the next life,
I'll be the older brother

78
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
to protect you.

79
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,260
(Palace)

80
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,710
Mother.

81
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,380
(Concubine Yu)
Come here.

82
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,230
Mother,

83
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,310
I heard that His Majesty
allows us to leave the palace now.

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,240
Could it be that the Seventh Prince
will become the Crown Prince?

85
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,160
Fufeng,

86
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,360
only you can marry my son

87
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,070
and be the future Crown Princess.

88
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,000
Mm.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,460
(Liu Fufeng, Concubine Yu's maid)

90
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,680
It's almost time.

91
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,980
I wonder who spread the news that

92
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,460
the Seventh Prince
will become the Crown Prince.

93
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,740
All these civil and military officials,

94
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,940
and royal relatives

95
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,780
are sending portraits of their daughters,

96
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,340
asking the Seventh Prince
to choose a wife.

97
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,140
They are just wasting efforts.

98
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,180
Who is Liu Fufeng?

99
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,420
Oh,

100
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,860
my mother had someone send it over.

101
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,100
Probably some young relatives
from her family.

102
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,300
(Liu Fufeng)

103
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,100
My name is Liu Fufeng.

104
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,580
