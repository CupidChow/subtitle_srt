=Episode 9=

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,160
I've already chosen my wife in my heart.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,760
Who? I can help you matchmake.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,640
Hu Tiantian!

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,120
I've wasted three years,

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,670
and now I just want to study.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,070
You don't need to bother
with these useless things.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,520
Not necessarily.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,430
I saw Qi Siyue invite you for tea,

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,790
and you didn't refuse.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,150
You mind that?

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,990
I don't.

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,240
(Imperial Academy)

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,240
Both the Qi family and the Hu family
are important to me.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,350
(Yang's Private Kitchen)
But my relationship with Qi Siyue

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,880
is different from our relationship.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,640
(I have always been fair.)

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,670
(And I am a grateful person.)

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,430
(You helped me win the pitch pot,)

21
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,200
(so I should do something to thank you.)

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,640
Yanli, you wanted to see me?

23
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,870
You say you don't like her,

24
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,870
but your actions are honest.

25
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,380
What a liar!

26
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,740
But he didn't say he doesn't like Qi Siyue.

27
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,900
I misunderstood.

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,660
(Yang's Private Kitchen)

29
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,260
(What's there to be upset about?)

30
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,980
Isn't this what I wanted?

31
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,060
I should be happy.

32
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,060
Hu Tiantian, you vixen!

33
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,940
Vixen? Me?

34
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,100
Yanli, you wanted to see me?

35
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,300
There's something

36
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,180
I need to clarify with you.

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,700
What?

38
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,460
Between us, we're just friends.

39
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,860
Don't do anything
that could be misunderstood.

40
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,420
Yanli, what are you saying?

41
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,980
Let's go eat, okay?

42
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,180
Stop pretending. You understand.

43
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,980
Did Hu Tiantian tell you something?

44
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,220
I'll go ask her.

45
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,300
This is the second thing I wanted to tell you.

46
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,620
From now on, stop harassing Tiantian.

47
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,980
What's so good about

48
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,060
a martial arts girl like her?

49
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,660
Why do you side with her so much?

50
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,660
She's perfect to me because I like her.

51
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,340
Don't pretend you don't know.

52
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,420
You two are conspiring against me.

53
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,660
Siyue,

54
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,420
why are you here?

55
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Why are you crying?

56
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,700
Who made you angry?
I'll beat their whole family.

57
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,940
Why did you come to me?

58
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,940
I came to find Tianfang.

59
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,140
Oh.

60
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,020
What did Qi Siyue tell you?

61
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,180
She said...

62
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,420
It's nothing.

63
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,540
Okay then,

64
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,980
I'll go now.

65
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,220
Goodbye.

66
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,220
Oh.

67
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,260
By the way,

68
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,500
the food you sent was delicious.

69
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,260
Huh?

70
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:29,100
(Yang's Private Kitchen)

71
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,020
(Is Su Yanli really in love with me?)

72
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,740
Are you humiliating me?

73
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,940
(Upon careful thought,
he has been protecting me.)

74
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,700
(Or is he just)

75
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,140
(using me and the Hu family?)

76
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,860
I've already chosen my wife in my heart.

77
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,100
What's wrong?

78
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,460
Are you troubled by love?

79
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,700
Tianfang, let me ask you,

80
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,700
what would you do
if there's a girl who likes you

81
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,780
but you can't like her?

82
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,060
There's no girl in this world I can't like.

83
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,260
Be serious.

84
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,820
Tiantian, I'll teach you a move

85
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,660
to cut off karmic ties.

86
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,820
Please.

87
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,860
Stop looking for her.

88
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,700
She's definitely avoiding you.

89
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,980
Hu Tiantian doesn't like you,

90
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,820
we are fundamentally the same.

91
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,140
Hu Tiantian?

92
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,780
Dear Siyue.

93
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,620
