00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,550
Chui'er. Chui'er.

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,280
Miss, what's the matter?

5
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
Where did you go?

6
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,520
Why are you so out of breath?

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,720
Nowhere.

8
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,230
Give it to me.

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,920
- What?
- Give it to me.

10
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,350
Miss, this...

11
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,660
(Tomorrow, 3:45 AM, cabin in the woods)

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,760
What does this mean?

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,400
Young Master Tianlin instructed me

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,070
that this must not be known to anyone,

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,040
including you.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Could Tianlin and Tianfang

17
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,510
really be planning a rebellion?

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,150
Miss, please promise me

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,070
not to get involved in these disputes,

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,320
okay?

21
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,920
Don't move.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,360
Tiantian? What are you doing here?

23
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,750
Tianfang.

24
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,590
Su Yanli sent you here?

25
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,520
No, he doesn't know.

26
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,960
Tianfang, are you really
planning a rebellion?

27
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,680
Please stay out of this matter.

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,800
How can I stay out of it?

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,310
I've already lost Tianba.

30
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,280
I can't lose you and Tianlin too.

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Tianfang, tell me,

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,430
you are falsely accused, right?

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,630
Tianba was like a father to us.

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,630
He sacrificed everything

35
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,870
for us

36
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,800
and for the Hu family.

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,120
But in the end, he faced such a fate.

38
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,430
How can I, as his younger brother,

39
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,750
swallow this humiliation?

40
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,560
You're really foolish.

41
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,400
Take all my savings

42
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,310
and leave Nankang, okay?

43
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,520
Tiantian, please stop
getting involved in this matter.

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,590
It's already come to this.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,590
We can't turn back now.

46
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,960
Traitors inside the house,

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,240
come out and surrender!

48
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,430
Su Yanli, you followed me!

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,120
Tiantian, why are you here?

50
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,080
Su Yanli,

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,630
you promised to protect me
and the Hu family.

52
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,920
Stay back!

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Tiantian, calm down.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,310
Tianfang, leave quickly!

55
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
Tiantian, listen to me.

56
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Drop the dagger.

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Tianfang, go quickly.

58
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,710
I'm fine.

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,520
Tiantian.

60
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,560
This concerns the safety of Nankang.

61
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,310
Don't blame me for doing this.

62
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,030
Your Highness, have mercy!

63
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,750
Su Yanli,

64
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,070
you never intended to spare the Hu family
from the beginning.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,190
Our marriage,

66
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,600
our vows,

67
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,040
were they all lies you made up?

68
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,000
Tiantian, I'm sorry.

69
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,350
Stop!

70
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,510
Your Highness,

71
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,560
His Majesty sent me to ask you

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,240
if the traitors have been captured.

73
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,120
Eunuch Zhang,

74
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,950
I've apprehended

75
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,830
all the Hu family traitors.

76
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,270
Su Yanli,
do you consider me a traitor too?

77
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,190
How dare you speak, you traitor!

78
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,980
Your Highness demonstrated justice.

79
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,860
I admire you greatly.

80
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,020
Liu Fufeng, why are you here?

81
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,420
Thanks to Miss Liu's report,

82
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,980
we've caught all the Hu family traitors.

83
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,100
Afterwards,
His Majesty will reward her.

84
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,660
Thank you, sir.

85
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,140
Apprehending traitors is my duty.

86
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,380
I should thank His Highness

87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,940
for cooperating with me from within.

88
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,220
(Tomorrow, 3:45 AM, cabin in the woods)

89
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,980
Let me out!

90
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,740
Liu Fufeng!

91
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,300
Liu Fufeng,

92
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,380
Su Yanli,

93
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,300
you two colluded
to frame the Hu family up.

94
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,820
Tiantian,

95
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,860
it's the Hu family's own fault.

96
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,500
Don't blame others.

97
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,040
(Pardon Token)
Eunuch Zhang,

98
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,660
this is a pardon token.

99
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,180
I hope His Majesty keeps his promise
to spare the Hu family.

100
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
Hu Tiantian,

101
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,580
you used the military token to exchange

102
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,500
for this pardon token from His Majesty.

103
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,540
But you were so audacious

104
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,340
as to give a fake military token

105
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,140
to deceive the emperor.

106
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,500
So the pardon token doesn't count at all!

107
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,380
A fake military token?

108
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,460
That's impossible.

109
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,420
I got it from Tianba's room.

110
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,540
Hu Tiantian, do you still dare to claim
you're not a traitor?

111
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,380
The real token must still be
in the possession of the Hu family.

112
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,580
Capture the traitors

113
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,500
from the Hu family immediately!

114
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,580
Yes.

115
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,300
Move! Get in!

116
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,660
- Let go of my sister!
- Women prisoners here,

117
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,540
men prisoners over there.

118
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,940
Let go of her!

119
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,900
Let me go!

120
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,940
Tianfang!

121
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,540
- Tianfang!
- Tiantian!

122
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,260
Don't be afraid.

123
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
Tianfang, I'm not afraid.

124
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,420
- I'm here for you.
- Tianfang.

125
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,830
- Tiantian.
- Tianfang.

126
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,620
- Don't be afraid.
- Tianfang!

127
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,660
I want to see Su Yanli.

128
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,740
Do you know what this place is?

129
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,580
Behave yourself.

130
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,660
Impossible, impossible.

131
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,700
I've already broken the Tianji Game.

132
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,140
How could this happen?

133
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,620
Su Yanli, explain it to me.

134
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,620
If you keep making noise,

135
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,180
I'll make you suffer.

136
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,660
Su Yanli,

137
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,620
