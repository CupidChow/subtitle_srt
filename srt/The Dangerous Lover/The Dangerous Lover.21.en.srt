=The Dangerous Lover=

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,980
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,280
Hu Tiantian actually used a fake
military token to deceive me!

4
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,190
Does she

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,340
want to follow in Hu Tianba's footsteps

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,980
and rebel against me?

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,780
Father, I spend every day with Tiantian

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,020
and can guarantee

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,540
she has no such intentions.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,580
I suspect

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,820
the real military token has long been
swapped by Hu Tianba's remnants.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,580
I will personally investigate

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,100
and give you an explanation.

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,900
You have three days.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,220
Thank you, Father.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,860
Fufeng,

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,700
if something happens to me,

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,460
this genuine military token

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,900
(Hu Tianba's Private House)
can mobilize a hundred soldiers

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,780
to protect you, if not thousands.

21
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,660
You must live well.

22
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,020
(Three years ago)

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,860
Fufeng,

24
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,180
starting tomorrow,

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,660
go to the palace

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,140
and accompany Concubine Yu.

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,100
She's Su Yanli's birth mother,

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,340
foolish and ignorant,

29
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,060
but she'll be useful in the future.

30
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,860
I can't bear to part with you.

31
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,060
Take this,

32
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,500
my general, don't ever forget me.

33
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,700
When I ascend the throne,
I'll bring you back.

34
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,820
You'll be my only empress.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,300
General,

36
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,060
they've started to come after me.

37
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,180
Don't worry.

38
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,300
I'll make Su Yanli and the Hu family pay,

39
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,660
one by one!

40
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,380
Lamb skewers.

41
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,380
Where did you get this dagger?

42
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,060
Tianfang gave it to me.

43
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,100
You know what?

44
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,540
This dagger is really sharp.

45
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,820
It's late. Where were you?

46
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,300
I was hungry,

47
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,940
so I made some skewers with Chui'er.

48
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,140
Don't hold it like that.

49
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,140
You might get hurt.

50
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,380
Got it.

51
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,980
Let's go eat skewers together.

52
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,340
Enjoy.

53
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,860
Chui'er, bring more cumin.

54
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,300
What are you thinking about?

55
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,020
I'm thinking,

56
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,820
if a sheep knew

57
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,740
it would eventually die,

58
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,140
how would it choose to live?

59
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,260
It would probably
struggle to free itself

60
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,140
just like what I did.

61
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,420
I used to believe
that fate couldn't be changed,

62
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,700
but now I want to try to change it.

63
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,300
Tiantian, do you trust me?

64
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,260
I trust you.

65
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,340
I will always firmly trust you.

66
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,900
It smells good.

67
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,940
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,820
Mother asked me
to bring incense to Your Highness.

69
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,460
I am sorry for the disturbance.

70
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,860
Please leave it outside my room.

71
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,900
Thank you.

72
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,540
Miss Liu.

73
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,020
You are a clever girl.

74
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,260
Some things can't be forced,

75
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,380
and you should understand that.

76
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,740
Thank you for your advice, Tiantian.

77
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,420
You're too lenient with her.

78
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,660
She's been faithfully serving Mother

79
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,380
in the palace for so many years.

80
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,420
She must be a loyal person.

81
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,300
At times, people make mistakes

82
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,460
when they're desperate.

83
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,540
I think we should
give her another chance.

84
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,980
Do you think I'm wrong?

85
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,300
I think maybe we should continue

86
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,900
what we were doing earlier.

87
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,580
I'm not in the mood anymore.
