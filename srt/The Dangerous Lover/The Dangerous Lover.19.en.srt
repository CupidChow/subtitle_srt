=Episode 19=

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,760
Coming.

4
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,030
Miss Liu.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,510
Mother is still sleeping.

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,710
What's the matter?

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,960
I'm not here for Her Ladyship.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,800
I'm looking for you.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,080
Looking for me?

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,070
Although Mr. Bai is not a nobleman,

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,110
he comes from a good family, is honest,

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,000
and does some small business.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,690
He's quite well-off

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,760
and would never mistreat you.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,440
Yanli,

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,460
why didn't you
discuss this matter with me

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,260
before making a decision?

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,140
It's just a small matter,
no need to trouble you. Mother.

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,620
After all, Fufeng is my adopted daughter.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,900
I disagree
with this marriage arrangement.

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,020
Besides,

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,340
I've grown accustomed
to Fufeng's company.

23
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,500
Then Mother, why don't you go with her?

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,340
You...

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,820
I don't want to get married.

26
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,220
I want to stay with Mother forever.

27
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,820
Don't say things
that go against your heart.

28
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,500
Instead of serving others as a maid,

29
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,340
why not go with Mr. Bai?

30
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,020
You can do things you like.

31
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,020
If you don't want to marry so early,

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,700
then go with him now

33
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,860
and start building a relationship.

34
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,860
Miss Liu,

35
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,340
you can rest assured.

36
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,180
If Mr. Bai mistreats you,

37
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,300
our Hu family will support you.

38
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,890
Nobody can take Fufeng away today!

39
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,100
I can.

40
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,780
Don't worry, Miss Liu.

41
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,900
Once everything is settled,

42
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,460
(Bai Wushuang, Head of Bai Village)
I will take you back to see your mother.

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,700
To tell you the truth,

44
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,780
Lady Yu takes me
as her only daughter-in-law,

45
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,540
and I will marry the Seventh Prince soon.

46
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,420
But

47
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,580
the Seventh Prince asked you to marry me.

48
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,820
Today's scene

49
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,940
was just a show for Hu Tiantian.

50
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,540
If you keep bothering me,

51
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,140
you'll regret it.

52
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,500
Miss Liu,

53
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,500
are you afraid that I'll mistreat you?

54
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,700
Don't worry.

55
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,900
Since the Seventh Prince said it,

56
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,900
I will treat you well

57
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,020
and won't do anything against your will.

58
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,140
How about this?

59
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,180
Let me explain

60
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,740
the specific situation of my family first.

61
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,740
My family...

62
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,460
Bah!

63
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,180
What would you like to eat?

64
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,540
Candied hawthorns!

65
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,700
Not that.

66
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,140
Our home is finally at peace.

67
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,780
Miss Liu, what are you doing here?

68
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,140
Where's Mr. Bai?

69
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,900
He's just a swindler.

70
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,180
After stripping me of all my money,

71
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,140
he ran away.

72
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,340
That's impossible.

73
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,900
Yanli picked him carefully.

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,140
He should be reliable.

75
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,380
Please don't blame His Highness.

76
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,940
Perhaps he was also deceived.

77
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,540
What will you do next?

78
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,340
I will have to rely on myself.

79
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,140
Fortunately, I know a little needlework

80
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,220
and can support myself.

81
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,300
After all, there's no place for me
in the Hu family.

82
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,580
Since you said that,

83
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,980
I can't just ignore you.

84
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,060
Take this money.

85
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,620
It's enough for you to live for years.

86
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,060
You must take care of yourself

87
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,340
and live well.

88
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,900
Thank you, Tiantian.

89
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,340
Miss, why did you help her?

90
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,420
What do you want?

91
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,700
No! No!

92
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,900
Let go!

93
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,020
Don't touch me!

94
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,540
Get off!

95
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,660
Hey!

96
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,020
Let her go!

97
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,980
- Here come two more beauties.
- Tiantian.

98
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,140
Let's have fun together.

99
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,140
Okay, let's have fun!

100
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,440
Come on! Run!

101
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,740
You can stay here with peace of mind.

102
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,740
I'll take care of all the daily expenses.

103
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,300
You have shown great kindness to me.

104
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,940
I don't know how to repay you.

105
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,820
Come in.

106
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,740
Are you sure

107
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,660
she won't be coming back?

108
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,540
Don't worry. We take care of troubles
for money.

109
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,540
We're experienced

110
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,100
in this kind of stuff.

111
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,820
Great.

112
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,660
Who are you?

113
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,740
Why am I tied up?

114
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,740
Let me go!

115
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,540
Honey, you're awake.

116
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,140
Who's your honey?

117
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,140
(How could it be him?)

118
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,140
You're more to my taste

119
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,300
than that Liu Fufeng.

120
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,740
You're talented

121
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,860
and have a bright future,

122
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,820
but please don't do anything foolish.

123
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,860
Help!

124
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
Miss Tiantian
asked me to come back first,

125
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,580
so I did.

126
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,700
I didn't expect her to be...

127
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,300
