00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,220
(Hu Mansion)

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,660
(Pardon Token)

5
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,640
Miss, bad news!

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,710
Chui'er, what happened?

7
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,550
Calm down and tell me.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,030
Young Master Tianfang was attacked.

9
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,350
Tianlin, where is Tianfang?

10
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,640
His whereabouts are unknown.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't know if he's alive or dead.

12
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,670
I've dispatched people
to search thoroughly.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,040
Who did this?

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,840
Su Yanli.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,430
How could Yanli harm Tianfang?

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,590
Do you have evidence?

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,950
How can you still speak up
for the traitor at this time?

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,480
Impossible! Impossible!

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,350
- Tiantian! Tiantian!
- Miss!

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,260
(Hu Mansion)

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,920
Surround the Hu Mansion.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,760
Yes.

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,280
Su Yanli, what are you doing?

24
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,470
Until we find Hu Tianfang,

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,870
no one can enter or leave the Hu Mansion
without permission.

26
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,750
Today, I will seek justice for Tianfang.

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Even if I die, I'll take you down with me.

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,400
Hu Tianfang held a list
of Hu Tianba's remnants

29
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,240
and kept it secret.

30
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,680
This is a serious act of treason.

31
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,550
Impossible.

32
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,840
Hu Tianfang has confessed.

33
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,870
If you are also involved in this,

34
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,590
I advise you to confess early.

35
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,360
I can plead for leniency for you.

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,680
Guards,

37
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,870
arrest him.

38
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,430
Where are my brothers?

39
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,430
You are my wife.

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,190
I will plead with His Majesty for you.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,870
The Hu family's affairs

42
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,150
have nothing to do with you.

43
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,520
I'm asking you,

44
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,800
where are my brothers?

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,960
Hu Tianfang worked for Hu Tianba.

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,870
He escaped with the list of remnants.

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,000
Hu Tianlin has been detained by me.

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,000
He needs to reflect on himself.

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,470
How could this happen?

50
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,590
Stay in the Hu Mansion

51
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,120
until we catch Hu Tianfang.

52
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,470
Don't go anywhere.

53
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,360
Fufeng,

54
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,720
why is every member

55
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,430
of the Hu family so ambitious?

56
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,160
First, there was Hu Tianba,

57
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,040
and now it's Hu Tianfang.

58
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,680
Maybe

59
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,560
even Hu Tianlin is involved.

60
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,200
Oh,

61
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,680
and Hu Tiantian too.

62
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,510
Miss, it's windy outside.

63
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,800
Let's go inside.

64
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,710
Have they

65
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,950
found Tianfang?

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,510
Not yet.

67
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,070
What about Tianlin?

68
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,070
He's fine.

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,680
That's good.

70
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,320
Chui'er,

71
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,720
you may leave.

72
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
Yes.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,070
Why are you here?

74
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,430
I have something to ask you.

75
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,430
If Hu Tianfang is really a rebel,

76
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,040
will you kill Hu Tianfang

77
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,950
together with your husband

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,270
like how you killed Hu Tianba...

79
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,440
Tianba,

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,240
come to your senses, please.

81
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,630
or will you side with your brothers

82
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,830
and kill your husband?

83
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,480
What are you thinking about?

84
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,680
Step back, Tiantian.

85
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,190
Nobody can take her away today.

86
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,270
This Black Fox Cape,

87
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,510
try it on.

88
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,160
I'll return it to you.

89
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,000
How can I not care about you?
