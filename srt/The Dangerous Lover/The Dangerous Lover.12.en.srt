(Spring Banquet)

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,020
(Entrance to the Spring Banquet)

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,350
The Spring Banquet has begun!

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,520
(Hu Mansion)
Miss, there's no one here.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,790
Our efforts are all in vain.

9
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,950
Hu Tiantian.

10
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,190
Hmm?

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,220
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,020
To see you make a fool of yourself.

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,660
You might be disappointed then.

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,660
Yeah?

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,700
Preceptor Wei, what's wrong?

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,900
I originally
persuaded the students to come

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,420
to the Hu Mansion today.

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,540
Oh...

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,500
But this morning,

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,660
they and various officials

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,980
went to the Minister
of Household's house as guests

22
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,060
and refused my invitation.

23
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,940
Chui'er.

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,580
Alright, alright.

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,100
Go and bring the Li family here,

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,220
along with their child.

27
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,300
The more people, the better.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,220
Hu Tiantian,
are you not embarrassed enough?

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,020
The Spring Banquet

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,460
is such a joke.

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,180
Miss Qi, please step aside

32
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,460
and don't block Miss Hu's guests.

33
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,500
Guests? I haven't seen any.

34
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,980
Miss Hu, what can we do for you?

35
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,900
Nothing major.

36
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,860
I've organized a fair
at the Spring Banquet

37
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,620
and want you to set up stalls

38
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,860
to support me.

39
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,260
You have been helping us a lot.

40
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,380
We will do our best to pay you back.

41
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,700
Thank you all. Please come in.

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,700
Please, come inside.

43
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,820
(Woodcut Workshop)

44
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,020
- You're here too!
- Yes.

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,500
Please, come in.

46
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,350
Miss Hu, long time no see.

47
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,660
Please, come inside.

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,300
Please, everyone, come inside.

49
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,140
Please.

50
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,860
You can only bring these kinds of people!

51
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,380
Hurry up,

52
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,900
we might not get a good spot.

53
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,260
Hey, why are you here?

54
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,500
- Where's my father?
- Siyue.

55
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,860
Come on.

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,980
I'm here.

57
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,140
Dad!

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,020
Sixty percent of the proceeds

59
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,260
(One day ago)
goes to the state treasury.

60
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,700
It's just a banquet.

61
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,340
How much can you earn?

62
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,660
At least a hundred taels of gold.

63
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,180
And if that can't be achieved?

64
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,180
Then I'll pay out of my own pocket

65
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,220
to make up the difference.

66
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,260
Excellent.

67
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,660
I'll let all of the officials

68
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,060
of Nankang

69
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,540
come and support you.

70
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,340
(All officials shall go
to the Spring Banquet.)

71
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,260
Qi Siyue,

72
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,620
if you want to leave,

73
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,940
I won't stop you.

74
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,660
No,

75
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,700
I want to see how you manage
this Spring Banquet.

76
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,340
Chui'er, let's go.

77
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,220
Yeah.

78
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,820
Tiantian.

79
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,020
This red silk band is for you.

80
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,180
It will bring you good luck.

81
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,820
I hope you have

82
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,100
a successful day.

83
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,460
Thank you.

84
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,980
I'll tell you something tonight.

85
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,340
Alright.

86
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,380
Here, we have

87
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,700
a glass-like jadeite here.

88
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,820
Look at how shiny it is.

89
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,100
Mr. Minister, take a look at this.

90
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,300
The starting price is thirty taels.

91
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,180
Not bad.

92
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,340
Thirty-five taels!

93
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,740
- This painting...
- Excuse me.

94
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,940
The next item is a treasure from

95
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,940
the northern border of Nankang,
agarwood amber.

96
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,340
Starting at eighty taels.

Take a look, take a look!

00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,020
Fine silk fabric!

102
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,780
And the next item

103
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,140
is a colorful glass cup
from the Western Regions,

104
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,740

117
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,700
Thank you, thank you.

118
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,940
Congratulations to this young lady

119
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,500
who just won the colorful glass cup
from the Western Regions.

120
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,770
- The arrangement is done.
- Got it.

121
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,620
Next up for auction,

122
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,580
we have an even
bigger surprise for you all.

123
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,780
Sir, why are you selling

124
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,180
this ugly thing at such a high price?

125
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,820
You don't have to buy it.

126
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,980
Miss Qi.

127
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,620
You know me?

128
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,380
You are the only daughter

129
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,380
of the Minister of Household,
Nankang's top talented lady.

130
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,300
Of course I know you.

131
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,300
You are?

132
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,420
I'm just like you,

133
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,900
strongly disliking Hu Tiantian.

134
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,780
I have a method

135
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,700
to make Hu Tiantian disappear forever.

136
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,340
Are you interested?

137
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,300
Go.

138
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,300
This poison is colorless and tasteless,

139
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,780
just a bit will make Hu Tiantian

140
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,540
breathe her last by the second day.

141
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,140
By then,

142
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,940
who would suspect you or me?

143
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,660
Siyue.

144
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,940
Tianfang.

145
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,500
Yeah.

146
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,060
So many people are here

147
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,740
on today's Spring Banquet,

148
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,940
you, a young girl, should be careful.

149
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,780
Yeah.

150
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,740
How about I

151
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,900
show you around?

152
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,220
- Sure!
- Let's go.

153
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,500
Our people are eliminated, retreat!

154
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,180
Thank you all for attending
today's Spring Banquet.

155
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,780
As everyone knows,

156
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,380
my father left me a family treasure,

157
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,540
that is my dowry, the Night Bright Pearl.

158
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,740
Tonight, at this Spring Banquet,

159
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,380
I'll auction it off
as the heir of the Hu family

160
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,380
to enrich our nation's wealth,

161
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,300
and also to declare to all of Nankang

162
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,980
that I will never

163
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,830
be wed in my life.

164
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,300
The starting price
is one hundred taels of gold.

165
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,380
Let the bidding begin.

00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,580
