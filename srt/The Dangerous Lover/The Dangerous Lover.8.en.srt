(Qi Zero Hu Zero)

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,670
Today, let's determine the winner.

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,510
The loser can't pester Yanli anymore.

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,350
I concede.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,520
Hu Tiantian, are you humiliating me?

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,560
Not at all.

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
Let's do it then.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,560
Qi Siyue and Hu Tiantian

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,790
will take turns to throw arrows.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,920
After eight arrows,

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,280
whoever gets more in the pot wins.

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,000
One match to decide the winner.

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,630
Impressive!

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,510
Wow!

18
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,510
Excellent!

19
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,020
(Qi Three Hu Zero)

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,200
So, the Hu Mansion also produces
worthless people.

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,590
(If I win,)

22
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,920
(I won't disgrace the Hu family.)

23
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,710
(If I lose,)

24
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,590
(I won't have to marry Su Yanli.)

25
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,760
(It can save the lives of my family.)

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,560
Hu Tiantian, you're cheating.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,760
I didn't mean to.

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,510
You can call for help too.

29
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,310
No, no, no.

30
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,350
No.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,320
I'll help you.

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Tianfang? Why are you here?

33
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,430
To play.

34
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,750
Humph.

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,520
I want to challenge Mr. Hu.

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,360
It's a tie.

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,870
What now? Let's do it again.

43
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,310
This time, no one can ask for help.

44
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,520
Let's end this farce.

45
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,080
The ten taels I owe you.

46
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,560
I'm penniless,

47
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,680
so I can't

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,120
pay you back.

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
Forget it.

50
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,680
I forgot about last time.

51
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,800
Did you ever want...

52
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,680
Huh?

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,200
... to win?

54
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,800
You asked Hu Tianfang to come?

55
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,710
Just a game.

56
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,800
Shameless.

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
I heard

58
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,290
you all bullied my little sister before.

59
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,050
No, no, no.

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,140
Martial artists who bully the weak

61
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,500
deserve ridicule.

62
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,620
Thank you all for what you did.

63
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,700
My little sister and I

64
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,300
have always been against each other.

65
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,220
I had to break up with many girls

66
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,260
because of her.

67
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,500
Thank you for teaching her a lesson.

68
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,580
Good to hear that.

69
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,380
But my eldest brother and second brother

70
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,060
have always indulged her since childhood.

71
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,980
If Hu Tiantian conflicts with anyone,

72
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,300
regardless of right or wrong,

73
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,380
they'll rush out and beat them up.

74
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,340
Don't take me wrong.

75
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,340
Just a reminder.

76
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,060
Don't let my brothers find out.

77
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,300
Women must be careful outside.

78
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,340
Walk less for a month.

79
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,660
In a few days, I'll have someone

80
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,900
send some trauma medicine.

81
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,940
Remember to use it.

82
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,860
Okay.

83
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,540
I won't bother you all.

84
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,100
Go to Jiren Clinic and mention my name,

85
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,340
you'll get a free treatment.

86
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,140
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.

87
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,060
Why are you smiling?

88
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,940
None of your business.

89
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,660
Is your foot okay?

90
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,940
Do you need some medicine?

91
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,140
No need.

92
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,660
Are you here to humiliate me?

93
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,500
I just want to tell you that

94
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,060
the pitch pot competition isn't important.

95
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,180
If you like him, go after him boldly, got it?

96
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,540
Enough, you're more nagging
than my mother.

97
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,540
Hey!

98
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,340
How come you don't understand...

99
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,300
Stop trying to matchmake Qi Siyue and me.

100
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
I've already chosen my wife in my heart.

101
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,420
Who? I can help you matchmake.

102
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,300
