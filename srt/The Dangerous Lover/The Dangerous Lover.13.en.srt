=Episode 13=

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,110
General Hu,

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,600
how dare you barge in like this!

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,550
Your Majesty!

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,760
Your Majesty!

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,760
Your Majesty!

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,920
General Hu, are you trying to rebel?

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,950
Your Majesty,

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,560
Su Yanli, the Seventh Prince,
murdered my little sister.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,520
I am deeply grieved.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,520
Several generations of my Hu family

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,110
has served Nankang.

14
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,560
I implore Your Majesty

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,560
to give justice to us.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,150
What evidence do you have?

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,320
If everything requires evidence,

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,520
then what meaning is there in my wielding

19
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,470
this sword all these years?

20
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,150
Hu Tianba, leading troops to invade
the palace is a capital offense.

21
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,350
Guards! Guards!

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,310
Your Majesty,
there are no guards for you now.

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,710
Su Yanli, the Seventh Prince,

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,510
wantonly murdered a loyal subject,

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,070
and yet Your Majesty

26
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,310
privately absolves the criminal.

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,040
Today, I, Hu Tianba,

28
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,070
will heed the will of the people
and deliver justice.

29
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,680
What... What are you doing?

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,920
Hu Tianba,
you've disappointed me greatly.

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,120
Your Majesty, if you are clever,

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,920
you should know what to do.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
Do it!

34
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,710
You...

35
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,510
It's the two of you!

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,510
Tianba, give up.

37
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,280
General Hu,

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,310
you've planned quite a big game.

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,430
Su Yanli!

40
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,680
Don't be deceived by him.

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,470
He's the one who killed our little sister.

42
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,520
Kill him!

43
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,520
Tiantian.

44
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,520
Su Yanli,

45
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,710
you tricked me.

46
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,590
Someone just gave me this poison,

47
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,870
asking me to use it on Hu Tiantian.

48
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,800
Although I dislike her,

49
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,960
I wouldn't stoop
to such despicable means.

50
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,520
If I commit murder,

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,030
that will ruin the reputation

52
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,700
of my Qi family for generations.

53
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,420
Well done.

54
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,820
This concerns Tiantian's life.

55
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,220
I believe you won't stand by
and watch her die.

56
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,060
Humph.

57
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,540
Why should I believe you?

58
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,540
I do.

59
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,820
Hu Tianfang,
do you know what you're saying?

60
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,310
Tianlin,

61
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,620
Tianba might really want to kill
Tiantian.

62
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,820
Between Tianba and the safety
of all in Nankang,

63
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,700
we can only choose one.

64
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,820
After taking this,

65
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,980
you'll remain in a state of

66
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,100
feigned death
until you take the antidote.

67
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,540
Tianba,

68
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,100
do you really want to kill me?

69
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,500
People say my Hu family

70
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,180
is overbearing

71
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,140
and disloyal,

72
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,540
but have they ever considered that

73
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,260
Nankang is the kingdom
we, the Hus, established?

74
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,780
I just don't understand!

75
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,620
Why did we end up with such a reputation

76
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,700
after generations of dedication?

77
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,700
Instead of living in fear,

78
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,100
it's better to strike first.

79
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,870
Protect the Emperor!

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,800
Protect the Emperor!

81
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,940
Father, please leave!

82
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,780
Your Majesty!

83
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,220
Protect the Emperor!

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,100
Be careful!

85
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,620
Tiantian!

86
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,580
Tianba,

87
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,500
come to your senses, please.

88
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,100
Let go!

89
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,620
Su Yanli,

90
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,700
I'm so scared.

91
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,420
I'm afraid
we won't make it out alive today.

92
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,100
In the next life...

93
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,220
I promise to marry you.

94
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,500
The next life can wait.

95
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,700
I only want you this life.
