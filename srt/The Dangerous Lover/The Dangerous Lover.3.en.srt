(The Archives)

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,640
Are you serious?

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,760
Do you know
that murder is a capital crime?

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,760
I know,

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,640
but I don't have a choice now

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,830
Why should I help you?

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,200
They say accompanying the ruler
is like accompanying a tiger.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,960
Even as a commoner now,

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,350
he dares to bully you.

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,390
If he gains power in the future,

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,350
your life will be in danger.

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,960
Someone like him is not worth pity.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,750
If you're willing to help me,

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,030
I'll find a way
to get you out of the palace.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600
I guarantee

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,110
a life of

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,520
luxury for you.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,710
If you refuse to help me,

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
consider this a hush fee.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,600
Don't speak a word about this to anyone.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,840
Whether to help or not

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,070
is up to you.

25
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,920
I'll do whatever you ask.

26
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,280
I'll wait for your good news then.

27
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,430
But

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,070
when and where did

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,400
the Seventh Prince kill your family?

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,280
It hasn't happened yet,

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,430
but it will in the future.

32
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,280
How can you be so sure
that it will happen?

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,950
Even if there's
a one in a million chance,

34
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,920
I can't risk my family.

35
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,760
So you want to kill him?

36
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,190
Xia Jiu,

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,870
listen to me,

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,200
don't have any pity

39
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,510
for your enemies.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,520
Donglan,

41
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,480
bring some refreshments.

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
Donglan!

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Why are you here?

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,310
To serve Master Xia

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,870
with some refreshments.

46
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,560
Just leave them here and get lost.

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,630
Hmm, it's good tea.

48
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,750
It's a pity that Master Xia

49
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,430
won't enjoy it.

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,400
Are you out of your mind today?

51
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,200
Humph.

52
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,590
Master Xia,

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,520
do you know
someone wants to poison you?

54
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,200
Who?

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,520
Me.

56
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,080
You think I'd let a waste
like you harm me?

57
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,550
Bah!

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,840
I was acting on someone else's orders.

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,840
But I don't think I need to do it
personally now.

60
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,120
What do you mean?

61
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,960
You will be taken care of
by someone else.

62
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,400
You jerk! I'll make you...

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,870
Do you want to know who it is?

64
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,120
Three years ago, you falsely claimed
that His Majesty was in danger

65
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,630
and asked me to lead the troops
into the palace to rescue him.

66
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,590
Whose orders were those?

67
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,920
Say it!

68
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,120
(I wonder if Xia Jiu succeeded or not.)

69
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,310
Tiantian,

70
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,640
I heard that

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
you're looking for the Seventh Prince,
Su Yanli.

72
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,870
Do you know him?

73
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,680
Not really,

74
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,960
just met him once.

75
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,870
When and where did you meet him?

76
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,280
Tianlin, just leave me alone.

77
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,630
How can I not care about you?

78
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,630
Tianba said

79
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,310
not to let you roam freely,

80
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,120
let alone to meet a prince who previously

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,630
attempted rebellion.

82
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,560
His cunning surpasses yours tenfold.

83
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
What are you doing?
This is the Hu Mansion.

84
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,160
There has been a murder in the Archives,

85
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,270
and Hu Tiantian is suspected
of being in the vicinity.

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,240
We were ordered to take her back
for questioning.

87
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,720
Stay here quietly.

88
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,040
I'll go out and assess the situation.

89
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,950
It must be a misunderstanding.

90
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,560
My sister would never be involved
in murder,

91
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,120
especially within the palace.

92
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,630
We are just following orders.

93
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,720
You want to take her away like this?

94
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,800
Do you have evidence?

95
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,490
(Ministry of Punishments)
This is an order from the palace.

96
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,190
The Hu Family is being too arrogant.

97
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
Are you openly defying the court now?

98
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,430
Don't scare me with the court.

99
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,630
The Hu Family

100
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,920
will not be bullied.

101
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,000
What? Is the Hu Family rebelling?

102
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,600
Miss, stay out of this.

103
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,440
Enough of this!

104
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,600
Tiantian, what's going on?

105
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,440
Step back, Tiantian.

106
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,950
Nobody can take her away today.

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,040
Officers, the Hu Family will comply

108
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,190
the imperial decree.

109
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,000
I wonder which big figure
has passed away.

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Humph, big figure?

111
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,390
Just a servant named Xia Jiu.

112
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,120
(What?)

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,840
It's cold outside.

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,840
You might catch a cold.

115
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,510
Take this.

116
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,830
I'll do whatever you ask.

117
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,120
(Xia Jiu,)

118
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,920
(you died because of me.)

119
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,720
Xia Jiu!

120
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,830
You are not dead?

121
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,560
Miss Hu,

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,270
I have come to tell you that

123
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,600
the Seventh Prince is dead.

124
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,190
You've succeeded?

125
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,390
It wasn't me who killed him.

126
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,560
Then who did?

127
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't know.

128
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,750
I just drugged his tea,

129
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,000
but before he could drink it,

130
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,190
a figure in black appeared
and ended him with a single stroke.

131
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,430
It frightened me.

132
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,560
Seems like he had many enemies.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,840
That's great.

134
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,800
Nobody will suspect us now.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,160
(Thank goodness, the Hu Family is safe.)

136
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,830
By the way, were you discovered?

137
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,360
I almost was,

138
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,560
but I managed to escape.

139
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,360
Master, when I tried to kill Xia Jiu,

140
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
Su Yanli intervened.

141
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,310
It seems three years

142
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,600
haven't dulled his fangs.

143
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,360
Did he recognize you?

144
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,600
I don't think so.

145
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,870
That's good. Keep monitoring him.

146
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,270
Master, there's another matter.

147
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,030
Say it.

148
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,030
Hu Tiantian

149
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,120
has visited the Archives several times.

150
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,750
