3
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,240
Su Yanli, you're shameless.

4
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,820
(An hour ago)

5
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,700
You detained me here after the class ended.

6
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,900
Miss Hu, what do you want?

7
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,980
I believe in fairness,

8
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,580
a favor for a favor.

9
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,020
Today, you helped me,

10
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,340
and I'll compensate you.

11
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,100
Robe, seven taels.

12
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,060
Belt, six taels.

13
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,060
Jade pendant, seven taels.

14
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,500
Total of twenty taels.

15
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,860
And these food and liquor

16
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,260
must be worth thirty taels.

17
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,300
Your Highness, enjoy yourself.

18
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,620
I'm penniless,

19
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,740
so I can't

20
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,220
pay you back.

21
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,740
With the remaining ten taels,

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,660
I want to buy an answer from you.

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,420
That's a good deal for you.

24
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,540
Is there something in this liquor?

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,660
I'm a decent person, you know.

26
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,100
What's wrong?

27
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,060
Don't move.

28
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,260
I feel a bit drunk.

29
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,260
Su Yanli, you drugged me?

30
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,900
It's not me.

31
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,220
(Innkeeper)
Chui'er, Chui'er.

32
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,860
Miss Tiantian only asked us to prepare

33
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,900
food and liquor, why drug the wine?

34
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,540
She has been wanting to teach him a lesson
for a long time.

35
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,100
Shouldn't we help?

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,060
Oh.

37
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,220
How is it going? Is he unconscious?

38
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,460
Quickly, tell me, the answer.

39
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,260
What answer?

40
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,860
What kind of woman do you like?

41
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,220
I like...

42
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,940
Wait, why do you have a wound here?

43
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,860
Stabbed by the woman I like.

44
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,540
Yet you still like her?

45
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,100
I fell for her a long time ago.

46
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,620
Can't change that.

47
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,900
How about you? Do you like any man?

48
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,140

thirty taels of silver?

Yanli,

71
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,260
wait for me.

72
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,980
(Qi Siyue, get a grip.)

73
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,500
(Hurry and take this troublemaker away.)

74
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,380
Yanli.

75
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,020
Ah!

76
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,300
These shoes are not practical,

77
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,860
bad for the brain too.

78
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,060
Don't wear them next time.

79
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,460
Qi Siyue, you're useless.

80
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,620
Just wait and see.

81
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,060
No man can resist me.

82
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,860
It's hot!

83
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,100
Yanli, could you get me another cup?

84
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,180
Sure.

85
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,820
(What's she saying? Can't hear clearly.)

86
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,700
Hmm, this cup is just right.

87
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,260
Yanli is so good to me.

88
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,620
(Su Yanli isn't anything special.)

(Tch, men.)

90
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,500
I knew it.

91
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,500
This is still the same cup.

92
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,420
(If Su Yanli falls for Qi Siyue,)

93
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,780
(he won't marry me.)

94
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,860
(The Tianji Game's prediction
won't come true.)

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,900

97
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,300
(But...)

98
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,700
Bound by fate...

99
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,580
Return it to me!

100
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,790
with you, promises made.

101
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,200
Return it to me!

102
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,490
Hand in hand,

103
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,040
- Su Yanli, return it to me.
- we'll be together forever.

104
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,620
So far apart, I'm hardly alive.

105
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,820
- So far apart,
- Give it back!

106
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,220
our promises are empty.

107
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,900
Give it to me!

108
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,220
That's pretty good,
why not let others read it?

109
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,860
I wrote it for others, not for you.

110
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,260
Miss Hu,

111
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,260
you're indeed a bit special to me.

112
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,420
You can keep it!

113
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,220
Don't be angry, I'll return it to you.
