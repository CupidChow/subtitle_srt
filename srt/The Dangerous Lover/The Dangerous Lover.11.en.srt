(Hu Mansion)

4
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,550
Hey,

5
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,100
you really made it.

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,980
Money is a good thing.

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,380
If Tiantian hadn't spent a fortune

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,660
on millennium ginseng to keep you alive,

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,300
who knows how long you'd be lying here?

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,220
Where's Tiantian?

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,540
She is resting.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,340
If you're feeling better,

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,260
you should go home.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,140
Doesn't she want to see me?

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,820
Su Yanli,

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,340
you should've consulted me
about this matter.

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,500
You don't know how to pursue a girl.

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,420
(Imperial Academy)

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,060
(Half a month later)

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,900
(She's probably still mad at me.)

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,300
(I hereby order Preceptor Wei to organize
the Spring Banquet with his students)

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,140
This year's Spring Banquet

23
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,860
will be organized by our Imperial Academy.

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,060
Why us?

25
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,900
Yeah, why?

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,980
Isn't hosting the Spring Banquet
a good thing?

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,300
It's a joyous occasion,
gathering everyone together.

28
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,740
Why wouldn't you want to do it?

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,820
You can't make everyone satisfied.

30
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,140
If it's successful,
you'll be praised as a hero.

31
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,900
If not, you'll be remembered
for a long time.

32
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,860
Besides,

33
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,900
the only ones who want to

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,060
attend the Spring Banquet
are older officials.

35
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,300
Would you like to

36
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,340
spend the festival
with only elderly relatives?

37
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,500
Who's willing to take charge?

38
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,860
(With many guests at the Spring Banquet,)

39
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,740
(maybe it's a good chance to defuse
the Tianji Game prediction.)

40
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,260
I'll do it.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,200
(Plan for the Spring Banquet Garden Party)

42
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,780
This year's Spring Banquet

43
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,140
won't just be about drinking and poetry.

44
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,140
I'm adding a garden party to the mix.

45
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,500
We'll keep the traditional customs

46
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
while adding some youthful activities.

47
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,660
It's suitable for all ages.

48
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,940
Chui'er, when the time comes

49
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,260
you need to divide our backyard
into several areas.

50
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,060
I want each area to be rented out

51
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,940
for a fee.

52
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,820
Sure.

53
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,980
(Plan for the Spring Banquet Garden Party)

54
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,660
In these areas,

55
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,540
you can do whatever you like—

56
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,340
buying and selling, making friends,

57
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,900
even performing talents.

58
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,780
All is fine.

59
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,060
I'm the daughter
of the Minister of Household,

60
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,500
and you want me to run a stall?

61
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,540
Hu Tiantian,
what do you think of our status?

62
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,180
Wait a minute.

63
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,700
Besides students of the Imperial Academy,

64
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,850
everyone attending the Spring Banquet
will have to pay for admission.

65
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,980
We'll split the proceeds evenly.

66
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,940
Evenly?

67
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,840
Evenly.

68
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,220
I have a mountain of novels.

69
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,420
I can sell them.

70
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,340
I can sell my jade pendants.

71
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,120
- I've learned a new sword technique.
- I like these things.

72
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,960
Exactly.

73
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
We won't charge a lot,
just ten taels each.

74
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,620
Everyone in Nankang knows

75
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,900
General Hu Tianba doesn't like

76
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,340
socializing with outsiders.

77
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,900
You sure he'll agree to host

78
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,740
the Spring Banquet at your house?

79
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,980
Hosting the Spring Banquet
at our residence

80
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,540
can improve relations between the Hu family
and officials and citizens.

81
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,500
It'll change people's perception of us.

82
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,700
It's a great thing for the Hu family.

83
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,260
I know, but Tianba won't listen.

84
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,380
You know he hates
those sycophantic courtiers the most,

85
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,500
yet you'll invite them home?

86
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,020
So, I need you to convince him for me.

87
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,060
Me? I can't do it.

88
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,900
Yes, you can.

89
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,140
Of course, I can,

90
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,580
but I don't want to.

91
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,820
Is this enough?

92
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,020
Yeah,

93
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,540
but it takes time.

94
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,340
Then forget it.

95
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,220
Give it to me first, and I'll try.

96
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,340
How can I persuade Tianba?

97
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,940
He definitely won't allow the banquet
to be held at home.

98
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,020
Who says I won't allow it?

99
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,300
Tianba.

100
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,380
My dear sister

101
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,180
has been helping me a lot recently.

102
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,580
She has to be tangled up with Su Yanli,

103
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,060
so don't blame me for being ruthless.

104
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,700
Donglan.

105
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,620
Master.

106
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,780
Your chance to make amends has come.

107
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,940
Do your job during

108
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,700
the Spring Banquet.

109
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,020
Yes.

110
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:18,100
(The Story of Yingying)

111
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,620
Your Highness, a spy sent this.

112
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,020
(They will act at the Hu Mansion
on the day of the Spring Banquet.)

113
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,700
(Imperial Academy)

114
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Preceptor Wei, here's my plan.

115
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,100
Um, the Minister of Household

116
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,100
just went to request the Emperor's decree

117
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,260
to cancel this year's Spring Banquet.

118
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,260
Why?

119
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,500
He said it's too extravagant and wasteful

120
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,500
and meaningless.

121
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,260
How can a traditional event
be meaningless?

122
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,380
I'll figure something out.

123
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,540
The Spring Banquet must go on
as scheduled.

124
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,500
Why are you so determined?

125
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,660
I must find my other half

126
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,700
at the Spring Banquet.

127
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,780
Huh?

128
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,940
Preceptor Wei,

129
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,860
can you help me

130
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,620
persuade the students?

131
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,420
I'll try my best.

132
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,660
I'll talk to His Majesty and...

133
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,500
No need.

134
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,300
