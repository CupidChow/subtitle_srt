00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,980
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
(After so many years,)

4
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,320
(the Archives)

5
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,030
(looks just like it was back then.)

6
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,880
Who are you? I am...

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,030
I don't care who you are.

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,670
Our master ordered us

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,430
not to leave anyone alive.

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,430
- Don't be afraid.
-Search inside.

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,950
Come with me now.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,680
Miss.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,880
What were you doing here
during the palace upheaval

14
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,470
three years ago?

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,790
Three years ago,

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,070
my brothers and I came to congratulate
His Majesty's birthday.

17
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,950
I happened to pass by the Archives

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,710
and wanted to take a look
at these treasures.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,310
Then I encountered that Seventh Prince

20
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,070
leading soldiers into the palace
with rebellious intentions.

21
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,640
Who said the Seventh Prince
was for rebellion?

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,920
- What else could it be?
- Maybe someone framed him.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,710
Impossible.

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,070
With his heinous face,

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,920
he's definitely capable of such things.

26
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,070
Do you hate him so much?

27
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,430
He killed my whole family,

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,040
how could I not hate him?

29
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,070
(Oh no, it's almost dawn.)

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,840
I have something to do.

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
I'll leave first.

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,960
Here,

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,040
take this.

34
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,710
If someone finds you,

35
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,070
it can prove you belong to the Archives.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,520
(Order)
Thank you.

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,310
You resemble someone from my past.

38
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,680
If there's a chance in the future,

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,280
I'll take you out of the Archives.

40
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,750
My name is Hu Tiantian.

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
Master,

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,560
when Su Yanli was a prince,

43
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,310
he often opposed you.

44
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,840
He frequently advised His Majesty
to minimize conflicts.

45
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,520
Now he's always sickly.

46
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,280
Why don't we just...

47
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,590
We should have a righteous reason
for anything.

48
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,870
Although he's been deposed,

49
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,080
the incident three years ago

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,240
didn't lead to His Majesty killing him.

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,840
Instead, he spared him to work
as a servant in the Archives.

52
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,800
It shows he has a liking

53
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,560
for this Seventh Prince.

54
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,870
Your ring...

55
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,520
Su Yanli

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,240
gave it to me to please me.

57
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,080
Humph.

58
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,750
It suits you well.

59
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you, Master.

60
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,680
The palace gate is about to open.

61
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,240
I'll take my leave.

62
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,120
I don't like

63
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,360
ambitious people.

64
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,310
I understand.

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,710
Chui'er, get up quickly.

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,870
Tianba is coming home soon.

67
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,120
Tianba.

68
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,470
Congratulations for returning in triumph.

69
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,540
(Hu Tianba, Eldest Young Master)

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,470
Why did you keep this portrait?

71
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,840
Do you know who this person is?

72
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,750
The Seventh Prince,

73
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,030
Su Yanli.

74
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,750
During the time I was away,

75
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,000
you've actually been infatuated
with a waste in the deep palace.

76
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,020
No, Tianba,

77
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,340
I'm investigating him.

78
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,980
He's not simple.

79
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,900
Stop fooling around.

80
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,780
Lately, many noble families
have come to propose marriage.

81
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,980
Pick a suitable one

82
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,180
and get married soon.

83
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,180
Time for you to settle down.

84
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,180
- Tianba...
- A decree from the Emperor!

85
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,500
According to the imperial decree

86
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,980
of the Heavenly Undertaking Emperor,

87
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,540
General Hu Tianba

88
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,340
fought bravely

89
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,700
and defended the borders,

90
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,180
making great contributions to Nankang.

91
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,020
To thank his outstanding service,

92
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,940
he's promoted and

93
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,140
rewarded with a thousand taels of gold.

94
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,900
(Decree)
That's all.

95
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,100
Congrats, General Hu.

96
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,940
Please

97
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,700
accept this decree with thanks.

98
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,060
You cannot accept the decree!

99
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,500
Tiantian, what nonsense is this?

100
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,420
Kneel down now!

101
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,660
Hu Tiantian, what are you up to?

102
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,580
Eunuch Zhang,

103
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,780
please listen to my explanation.

104
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,460
My sister is young
and didn't mean any offense.

105
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,500
Eunuch Zhang, please don't be angry.

106
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,770
(Eunuch Zhang, Attendant to the Emperor)
I'll listen to your explanation.

107
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,540
If you can't convince me,

108
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,220
don't blame me for

109
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,300
reporting to the Emperor.

110
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,900
My big brother's duty as a general

111
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,660
is to kill enemies on the front line.

112
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,020
The Hu family has already received

113
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,540
enough favors from the Emperor.

114
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,060
Today, we don't want any rewards

115
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,380
or titles for the Hu family.

116
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,220
Hmm?

117
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,540
Please convey to His Majesty

118
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,620
to retract the decree.

119
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,660
Don't let the court misunderstand
the Hu family

120
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,260
would threaten the throne.

121
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,140
How dare you!

122
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,380
Hu Tiantian.

123
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,780
If I've offended His Majesty today,

124
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,860
please let him demote my family

125
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,780
to commoners.

126
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,820
(As long as we're alive,)

127
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,620
(being commoners
is better than being ghosts.)

128
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,780
Tiantian doesn't know what she's saying.

129
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,300
Please forgive her.

130
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,260
Hahaha...

131
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,780
Good.

132
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,260
His Majesty

133
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,100
indeed foresaw this.

134
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,020
I didn't expect I would really take out

135
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,220
the other decree.

136
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,460
(Another decree?)

137
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,420
His Majesty has long known
that the Hu family is modest.

138
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,660
However,

139
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,260
due to recent rumors,

140
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,460
to silence the public,

141
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,860
His Majesty

142
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,250
asked me to test you.

143
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,500
Hu Tiantian

144
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,780
truly lives up to your family name.

145
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,860
Your outspoken loyalty

146
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,580
and humility

147
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,540
are the blessings of the Hu family.

148
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,180
His Majesty decrees

149
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,580
General Hu Tianba to be

150
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,460
promoted to the first-grade official

151
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,180
and awarded ten thousand taels of gold.

152
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,060
He is appointed
as Frontier-pacifying General.

153
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,820
Thank you, Your Majesty.

154
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,300
Frontier-pacifying General?

155
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,780
The Frontier-pacifying General Hu Tianba

156
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,780
and his younger brothers,

157
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,540
Hu Tianlin and Hu Tianfang,

158
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,820
- are plotting rebellion.
- Don't run!

159
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,180
Their entire family

160
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,580
will be executed.

161
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,380
(Decree)
Frontier-pacifying General.

162
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,780
Hu Tiantian,

163
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,580
marvelous.

164
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,820
Fortunately, His Majesty is wise

165
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,260
and didn't blame our family.

166
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,780
Tiantian,

167
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,460
don't you think
you are being too reckless now?

168
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,780
Alright, alright,

169
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,100
if not for Tiantian,

170
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,220
we wouldn't have

171
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,500
received so many rewards,

172
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,380
right?

173
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,220
We can't accept these things!

174
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,090
Hu Tiantian,

175
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,220
what's gotten into you?

176
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Once we accept these,

177
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
it's over for the Hu family.

178
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,100
Yesterday, in the Tianji Game, I saw that

179
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,660
our Hu family would be destroyed

180
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
because of our power.

181
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,900
What game?

182
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,220
Hu Tiantian,

183
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,060
do you want to be punished?

184
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,420
Alright, alright.

185
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,540
Tiantian,

186
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,900
have you had a nightmare?

187
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,060
You all don't understand anything.

188
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,780
- (Tianba has been promoted.)
- It's fine, it's fine.

189
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,100
(To prevent the Hu family
