=Episode 26=

3
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,510
Your Ladyship.

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,020
Silly girl,

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,420
why did you do that?

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,740
Tell Mother,

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,860
did anybody force you to do that?

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,660
Mother, I made a mistake.

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,020
I deserve all this.

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,260
Mother, please don't cry.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,180
I can't fulfill my filial duty anymore.

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,060
Come here. I have something for you.

13
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,260
Consider it some memories I leave you.

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,460
Open the door.

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,300
Yes.

16
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,820
- Fufeng!
- Mother!

17
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,980
Fufeng, you've suffered.

18
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,540
Liu Fufeng!

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,540
Stay back!

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,900
- What are you doing?
- Otherwise, I'll kill her.

21
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,660
Fufeng.

22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,580
Prepare me a good horse

23
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,220
and ten thousand taels of gold.

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,460
Let me leave Nankang safely.

25
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,820
Otherwise, I'll kill her.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,410
Fufeng,

27
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,500
what are you doing?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,080
I'm your mother!

29
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,340
Shut up!

30
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,620
I only used you as a pawn.

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,500
Do you really think you are my mother?

32
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,780
Liu Fufeng,

33
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,700
let go of my mother

34
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
and I'll spare your life.

35
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,740
- I don't believe you.
- Mother.

36
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,180
Liu Fufeng,

37
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,660
this place has been surrounded.

38
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,380
You can't escape.

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,220
If you truly want to survive,

40
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,660
holding Her Ladyship hostage
is not a good idea.

41
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,220
Let me replace her.

42
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,660
That way,

43
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,500
you'll have a better chance of success.

44
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,180
Hu Tiantian,

45
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,220
you are too cunning.

46
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,500
I don't believe you.

47
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,060
Unless

48
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,940
you disable your right arm.

49
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,300
Tiantian.

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,260
Fufeng,

51
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,860
stop doing foolish things.

52
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,380
I don't believe that after spending

53
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,180
so many years with me,

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,830
you don't see me as family.

55
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,420
Think about it.

56
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,020
Three years ago,
you took care of me when I was

57
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,980
seriously ill, and you nearly died.

58
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,300
I have always treated you
like my own daughter.

59
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,660
Even if I have to
sacrifice my life for you,

60
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,540
I won't hesitate to do that.

61
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,020
But with your actions now,

62
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,540
even if you run out of the city,
how long can you hide?

63
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,100
Fufeng, I will go plead with His Majesty.

64
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,820
We will give up everything

65
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,420
and leave this place.

66
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,260
Let's find a place out of the way,

67
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,780
just the two of us.

68
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,900
I will be with you.

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,100
Don't be afraid.

70
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,420
Fufeng.

71
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,020
Fufeng, what are you doing?

72
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,180
Mother,

73
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,380
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,500
Let's be real mother and daughter
in the next life, okay?

75
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,940
Fufeng!

76
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,620
Fufeng!

77
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,940
Your Majesty,

78
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,060
I request to return
to my palace to reflect.

79
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,180
Everything is already in the past.

80
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,100
The children don't hold any grudges
against you.

81
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,220
Consort Yu, we're both old.

82
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,420
Stay here.

83
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,900
Yanli and Tiantian

84
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,860
also advised me to stay.

85
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,700
They are good children.

86
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,700
But I am

87
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,500
not a good mother.

88
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,780
I feel ashamed.

89
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,180
I just want to pray for them
day and night.

90
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,780
I hope Your Majesty will grant my wish.

91
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,660
By the grace of heaven,

92
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,100
the Emperor decrees.

93
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,100
The Seventh Prince

94
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,860
is exceptionally intelligent

95
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,260
and blessed by heaven,

96
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,540
so he is appointed the Crown Prince,

97
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,500
(Hu Mansion)
and will move to the Eastern Palace.

98
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,900
That's to reign for ten thousand years

99
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,220
and connect the hearts of all people.

100
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,100
Su Yanli has become the Crown Prince?

101
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,940
You are the Crown Princess now.

102
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,660
Miss. Miss.

103
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,100
Miss, wake up.

104
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,020
Miss.

105
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,820
Chui'er, how is it?

106
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,020
Congratulations, Seventh Prince.

107
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,780
Sorry, Crown Prince.

108
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,620
Miss Tiantian...

109
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,820
The Crown Princess is pregnant.

110
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,420
- Really?
- I'm going to be an uncle!

111
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,460
I'm going to be an uncle!

112
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,940
Just in that brief moment,

113
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,100
I've even thought of names.

114
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,940
What should it be?

115
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,860
If it's a boy, Su Tiantian.

116
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,860
If it's a girl, Su Tiantian.

117
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,420
Simple, cute names.

118
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,660
Isn't it nice?

119
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,100
It sounds like our family.

120
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,220
Ah, yes, right.

121
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,220
(Four months later)

122
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,060
Give it to me.

123
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,660
Give it to me.

124
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,500
Let go!

125
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,420
Qi Siyue,

126
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,550
you'll get struck by lightning
for fighting with a pregnant woman.

127
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,100
Are you saying that to yourself?

128
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,180
I can't believe you.

129
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,100
Give it to me.

130
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,500
What are you two arguing about?

131
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,780
Honey, Tiantian is bullying me.

132
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,100
And I can't make her stop.

133
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,500
Please help me.

134
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,420
Oh, it's just a pearl.

135
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,620
Just let her have it.

136
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,180
Besides,

137
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,180
you have this now.

138
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,580
You're all here.

139
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,580
Su Yanli!

140
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,300
Tiantian, what's wrong?

141
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,100
I am sorry.

142
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,380
Why is our token of love with her?

143
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,220
Honey, please let me explain.

144
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,100
Tianfang said Qi Siyue
kept insisting that

145
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,700
this night pearl has her mother's scent

146
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,860
and she feels secure with it.

147
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,260
She kept crying without it.

148
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,780
That's why I lent it to Tianfang.

149
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,860
Is that so?

150
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,620
You borrowed it?

151
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,940
Alright.

152
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,780
- I understand then.
- It's not like that.

153
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,060
Pregnant women are a bit strange

154
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,020
and not easy to deal with.

155
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,500
You lost, old man.

156
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,300
As a reward,

157
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,420
I'll set up a Tianji Game for you
free of charge

158
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,300
to see how your child

159
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,260
will

160
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,460
turn out.

161
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,660
- No need, really.
- No need.

162
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,540
Why?

163
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,860
Our child

164
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,780
will surely surpass us.

165
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,540
And no matter what the future holds,

166
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,780
I believe

167
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,460
