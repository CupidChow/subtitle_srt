=Episode 24=

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,260
I never expected
that remnants of the Hu family

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,540
had been lurking around me all this time.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,100
Yanli,

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,860
thanks to your efforts,
we were able to eradicate

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,260
the remnants of Hu Tianba.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,100
I feel proud of you.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,940
Father, you have the grace of Heaven.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,250
Even the most cunning evildoers

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,740
cannot escape punishment.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,540
However,

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,740
Hu Tiantian

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,140
is still nominally your wife.

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,700
Do you think she was

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,260
involved in this?

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,300
She should be executed as well.

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,540
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,860
You may rise.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,500
Your Majesty, at that time,
you only punished Hu Tianba

21
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,540
and did not implicate the others,

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,620
which led to the Hu family

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,540
continuing their

24
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,580
rebellious activities.

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,100
Especially that Hu Tiantian,

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,820
who is particularly despicable,

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,580
using her beauty to seduce His Highness

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,100
and conspire against us.

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,860
That's right.

30
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,300
Your Highness,

31
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,140
to catch the remnants of the Hu family,

32
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,820
you had to stay
with Hu Tiantian for so long.

33
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,060
You've suffered unjustly.

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,780
And so have you.

35
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,900
Indeed,

36
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,220
Fufeng has also contributed greatly

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,940
and should be rewarded.

38
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,660
Thank you, Your Majesty, Mother.

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,100
I don't feel wronged.

40
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,660
I just feel sorry for His Highness.

41
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,060
I suggest

42
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,380
that His Highness
personally oversees the executions

43
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,340
of the Hu family members.

44
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,860
What do you think?

45
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,660
That's a good suggestion.

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,780
Who are you?

47
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,220
I'm here on the Seventh Prince's order
to visit Hu Tiantian.

48
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,780
What are you doing here?

49
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,660
I'm here to visit you

50
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,500
and bring you good news.

51
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,540
Hu Tianlin and Hu Tianfang
conspired with traitors

52
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,420
and organized rebellious remnants

53
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,420
against His Majesty,

54
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,300
committing treason.

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,580
They were executed this morning

56
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,400
for their crimes.

57
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,980
That's nonsense!

58
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,060
They haven't even been tried.

59
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,540
How could they be convicted and executed?

60
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,460
All of you from the Hu family

61
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,780
have been taking turns rebelling.

62
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,100
His Majesty is fed up with the Hu family

63
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,740
and doesn't want to even look at you.

64
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,660
Where is Su Yanli? Where is he?

65
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,540
Do you really think
he wants to see you again?

66
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,100
This was all his doing.

67
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,540
Every step of getting close to you,

68
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,980
every conversation you had.

69
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,900
From the moment I first saw you,

70
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,580
I fell in love with you.

71
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,100
I won't marry anyone but you.

72
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,380
It was all part of his plan.

73
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,260
Get out!

74
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,780
(Brothers, I'm sorry.)

75
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,060
Why are you kneeling
so early in the morning?

76
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,580
Father, I have committed sins

77
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,380
and have come
to ask for your forgiveness.

78
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,060
What happened?

79
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,740
I committed two major crimes.

80
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,900
First, the crime of incompetence.

81
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,220
I interrogated the Hu brothers all night

82
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,300
and did not obtain
the list of Hu Tianba's remnants.

83
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,700
Second,

84
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,820
the crime of showing sympathy
and sheltering Hu Tiantian,

85
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,860
who deceived me with her beauty

86
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,380
and almost caused a major incident.

87
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,020
What do you propose to do?

88
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,260
I believe

89
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,900
the list is not with the Hu brothers

90
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,500
but with Hu Tiantian.

91
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,700
I want to interrogate her in my own way.

92
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,740
Once I obtain the list,

93
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,500
I will personally kill her.

94
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,140
Very good.

95
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,460
You are becoming more and more like

96
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,300
a future monarch.

97
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,340
Why are you keeping me alive?

98
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,140
When will you

99
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,100
send me to see my brothers?

100
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,140
Are you still

101
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,620
only thinking about your brothers?

102
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,900
Who else would I think about?

103
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,260
You?

104
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,980
A deceiver

105
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,380
who used me

106
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,180
and humiliated me?

107
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,260
Tiantian,

108
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,540
fate has played its tricks on me,

109
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,380
and I can do nothing about it.

110
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,340
I owe you this life,

111
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,540
and I'll repay it in the next.

112
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,860
Your Highness,

113
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,140
I understand fate better than you.

114
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,300
Do you have any other wishes?

115
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,980
Of course, I do.

116
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
I once

117
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,620
betrayed my family

118
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,100
and abandoned my brothers

119
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,020
to be forever with a man.

120
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,780
I even gave up the wedding,
which is one of the most cherished

121
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,460
moments for a woman.

122
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,100
My family,

123
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,580
my brothers.

124
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,380
Tiantian.

125
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,500

126
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,500
