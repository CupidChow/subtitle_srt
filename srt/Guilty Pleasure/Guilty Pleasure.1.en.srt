1
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,156
Ms. A!

2
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,198
Good morning!

3
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,366
Good morning!

4
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,368
- Good morning.
- It's Judge Marina today.

5
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:44,372
So, everyone should be beautiful.

6
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,293
Attorney Miranda.

7
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,670
Attorney Lucero.

8
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,571
Excuse me. Excuse me.

9
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,657
Ms. A! We are going
to the fourth floor, Ms. A!

10
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,700
Excuse me!

11
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,535
Miss!

12
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:29,083
Seven is widely regarded
as a lucky number.

13
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,419
Seven seas upon which we depend on

14
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,754
for survival.

15
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,297
Seven days of the week,

16
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,382
we go on about our lives.

17
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,386
But, seven demons
possessed Mary Magdalene.

18
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,140
And like the famous woman of the Bible,

19
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,976
the defendant does not
consider the number seven lucky.

20
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,232
For seven years,
Mrs. Fariñas endured abuse,

21
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:56,611
hurt, and beatings by her husband.

22
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,033
We have presented police reports

23
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,703
and testimonies from the town's help desk

24
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,666
wherein the defendant
had been rescued several times

25
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,084
from her husband.

26
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:15,546
And on the night of January 13th 2022,

27
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,592
her husband was about to attack her

28
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,927
with a butcher's knife.

29
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:25,974
And so she hit him
with a hammer on the head.

30
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,184
Your Honor,

31
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,980
this woman is not a criminal.

32
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,527
She protected herself from the man

33
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,404
who was meant to protect her.

34
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,949
And that man was her husband.

35
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,786
Your Honor, she acted in self-defense

36
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,956
as proven by the evidence we presented.

37
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,001
With this, Your Honor,

38
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,170
we would like to ask you

39
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:01,009
to find Mrs. Fariñas not guilty of murder.

40
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,637
Oh, I'll get your laundry.

41
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,930
- You have nothing to wear for tomorrow.
- Oh, okay.

42
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,098
- Oh, my God.
- Thank you.

43
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,016
No problem.

44
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,561
Where are my keys?

45
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,478
Oh, no.

46
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,234
Another victory?

47
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,328
You’ve been winning
your cases, Attorney Miranda.

48
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,496
Alexis?

49
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,126
I didn’t know you’ve been
following my cases.

50
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,961
I'm proud of you.

51
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,050
I'm proud of me, too.

52
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,741
Do you realize
the judge would admonish you

53
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,367
with what you're wearing?

54
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,244
It's so awful!

55
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,122
I'm sorry, sir. Sorry.

56
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,916
Because I stayed overnight at the office

57
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,585
to finish everything
you needed for the hearing earlier.

58
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,128
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,714
You are working for Atticus.

60
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,218
You are representing me.

61
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,219
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,138
That is why we give you a clothing budget.

63
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,057
Use it.

64
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,184
Noted, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

65
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,393
I'm so sorry.

66
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,271
Oops.

67
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,781
Attorney Lucero.

68
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,627
I'm sorry, sir.

69
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,878
- It’s fine.
- Let me help you.

70
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:01,838
You're not supposed to do this.

71
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,343
There are interns
and admin staff for this.

72
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,721
No, it’s fine. I’ll do it.
It’s not right, sir.

73
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,890
Where’s your room?
I'll bring your things there.

74
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,144
No need. I can carry that.

75
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,145
Nope.

76
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,605
Which room is it?

77
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,442
Come on. Hop on.

78
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,987
Okay, let’s go.

79
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,989
Am I corny?

80
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,073
Actually, no.

81
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,078
You find me funny?

82
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,538
Yes, I do.

83
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,340
Good morning, Ms. A!

84
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,717
- Good morning.
- Here's your coffee.

85
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,634
Thank you.

86
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,219
Here's your tarot card of the day.

87
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,304
Ace of Pentacles.

88
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,848
Ace of Pentacles. I know this.
It's about money, isn't it?

89
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,016
- Correct.
- I like that.

90
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,434
- Ms. A.?
- I want money.

91
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,477
Good morning.

92
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,103
- I have news for you.
- Read one for me, too.

93
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,938
- Okay.
- Sure.

94
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,190
- Let's do it.
- Here, hear.

95
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:04,942
Okay.

96
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,278
- Good news.
- Good news. I like that.

97
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,446
We got an inquiry!

98
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:13,743
Zachary Chua’s manager
called to set up an appointment.

99
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,122
Why are you all excited? Who is he?

100
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,957
He’s gorgeous, Ms. A.

101
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,376
That’s him. That's Zach.

102
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,088
Zachary is being sued by Madison Valencia.

103
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,215
I don’t understand.

104
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,509
Who is Madison Valencia? Zachary Chua?

105
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,094
- Are these my relatives that I need--
- Ms. A, let me update you.

106
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,138
- Ms. A, they are celebrities.
- Correct.

107
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,224
- Influencers.
- I see.

108
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,767
Okay.

109
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,856
- I'll do the research.
- Of course.

110
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
What case?

111
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,735
Rape.

112
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,279
He raped me.

113
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,864
He violated me.

114
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,784
Zachary Chua sexually assaulted me.

115
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,578
And I will make sure he pays for it.

116
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,923
EXIS
HERE'S YOUR FAVORITE!

117
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,591
He keeps calling me Exis.

118
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,842
Jerk.

119
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,280
- For Attorney Miranda, please.
- Oh.

120
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,698
- Here, ma'am.
- Thank you.

121
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,704
Hi, Attorney!

122
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,879
Sugar rush.

123
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,674
Looks like we won't
be able to have lunch later.

124
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:39,889
Thank you.

125
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,478
Is that the embezzlement case
of Fernando Ladron?

126
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,441
Yes, this is the record
of bank transfers of the company's fund

127
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:54,528
to the personal account of Mr. Ladron.

128
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,323
Good job.

129
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,164
But you might discover something else.

130
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,379
Sometimes the most obvious
is the one we don't see. Right?

131
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,382
You can do it.

132
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,467
You’re good.

133
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,615
Hi!

134
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,427
Happy birthday.

135
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,389
That’s next week.

136
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,391
For you.

137
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,602
- What is this?
- I noticed lately that

138
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,062
you're stressed out.

139
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,814
I hope this makes you happy.

140
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,067
Is that so?

141
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,069
This is an early gift.

142
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,196
Wait.

143
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,700
No way.

144
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,788
Wait, you remembered?

145
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,500
You thought I wasn't listening
when you told me that

146
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,087
your Grade 1 classmate
tore up your stationery.

147
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,547
Wow.

148
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,132
I didn't know
that you were paying attention.

149
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,343
Then my mom didn't buy me a new one.

150
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,512
Thank you.

151
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,687
All right, let's go home.

152
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,646
Okay.

153
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,357
Thank you.

154
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,275
You're welcome.

155
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,655
That's enough.

156
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,326
Wait, I'm almost done.

157
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,828
They might ask for this tomorrow.

158
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,330
Who will ask for it?

159
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,289
Guevarra?

160
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,332
- I'll take care of it.
- Yes.

161
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,250
I’ll talk to him.

162
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,295
I’ll talk to him.

163
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,338
Wait a minute.

164
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,508
Wait. How will you talk to him?

165
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:25,596
I heard he won’t be
at the office tomorrow.

166
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,895
He’s on leave. He’s going to Europe.

167
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,943
So classy.

168
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,947
He travels to Europe
like it's near Quiapo.

169
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,907
I envy him.

170
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,916
Do you want to go
to Europe? We will go there.

171
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,380
To Rome? Paris? Venice?

172
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,799
No.

173
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,511
They say

174
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,807
it’s beautiful in Italy.

175
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,434
Florence?

176
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,813
I heard Florence is
more romantic than Paris.

177
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,743
Okay.

178
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,873
Let's go to Florence.

179
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,959
Stand up.

180
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,089
Stand up.

181
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,090
- Good night.
- Take care.

182
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,716
- All right, thank you.
- Bye, Attorney.

183
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,384
Bye, thank you.

184
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,309
I got it!

185
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,477
Look.

186
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,188
Look at the huge amount
in the money transfer.

187
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:31,068
Every time. And it was not even discreet

188
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,653
in all the transactions.

189
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,780
It all happened in 20 days.

190
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,864
Do you get it?

191
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,033
What are you saying?

192
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,161
Well, what I'm saying is

193
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,664
they want to make it obvious

194
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,582
that he's stealing money from the company.

195
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,335
So this is a setup?

196
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,464
Well, the question is who’s doing it?

197
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,757
And what’s the motive?

198
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,176
Adam. Alexis.

199
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,389
The son of Fernando Ladron called.

200
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,432
Do you think it's time we schedule

201
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,268
a briefing with the new witness?

202
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,854
Uh...

203
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,189
Attorney, I think
we need a little bit more time

204
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,440
to go through the documents

205
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,483
- presented--
- Dad!

206
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,069
- Miss Kate, let me help you with that.
- Hey.

207
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,279
- There you are.
- Hello, Kate.

208
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,156
What are you doing here?

209
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,073
Thank you so much, ma’am.

210
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,449
- You're welcome.
- What's that?

211
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,409
Nice.

212
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,202
Oh!

213
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,706
You know I'm not allowed to have this.

214
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,541
I knew you'd be
working late, so I brought this.

215
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,625
Wait.

216
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,752
You need something, right?

217
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,629
- Dad, how could you say that?
- What do you want?

218
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,965
No, Dad.

219
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,843
You know I always want to see you.

220
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,723
- But there is this trip.
- I knew it.

221
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,727
Try one.

222
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,896
Thank you.

223
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,109
He doesn't like sweets.

224
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,737
Try one, it's really good.

225
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,536
So, about that trip, Dad.

226
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,704
I knew it.

227
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,663
Dad, please!

228
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,874
- No.
- I really wanted to go.

229
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,417
Kate, come on.

230
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:25,807
They’re here!

231
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,269
- This way, please.
- Is the A/C working?

232
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:34,066
So, this is Attorney Alexis Miranda.

233
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,027
- And this is Sir Joni.
- Hi, Attorney.

234
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:42,074
- The manager of the Zachary Chua.
- Nice to meet you.

235
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,408
Nice to meet you.

236
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,371
Okay.

237
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,623
You want coffee? Juice?

238
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,832
Beer!

239
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,084
Do you have beer?

240
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,126
- Just beer.
- Beer?

241
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,420
Water. With lemon.

242
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,047
- Oh, we have that.
- Thank you.

243
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,090
- Excuse me.
- Don't you have beer?

244
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,300
Traffic was so bad.

245
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,387
It's okay. We can get started.

246
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,890
Zachary.

247
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,600
Mr. Chua,

248
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,561
could you tell me exactly what happened

249
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,606
on the night of March 30th 2024?

250
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,150
It was a Saturday night.

251
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,904
Which means date night.

252
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,698
Madison demands that every Saturday

253
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,075
- we must always be together.
- I'm here.

254
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,285
I'm bored.

255
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,121
I've been waiting here since 11 a.m.

256
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,456
I've been wanting to go swimming.

257
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,166
You’re so late.

258
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,335
Are you bored, Mads?

259
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,462
This is it. We’ll do something.

260
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,549
What do you do on your date night?

261
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,345
Well, we can't be seen in public.

262
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,596
So that night,

263
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,808
we went out of town in a rented villa.

264
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,351
Don't you miss me?

265
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,649
You know what?
I'm tired of being your secret.

266
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,863
Mads.

267
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,615
Just give me time.

268
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,119
We will become official.

269
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,582
But let's not rush it.

270
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,046
How about a soft launch first?

271
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,015
So, when?

272
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,850
Soon.

273
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,187
Come on.

274
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,857
- Come on, Mads?
- Okay, fine.

275
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:41,943
Hey wait!

276
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,820
And that's it.

277
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:44,988
We had sex.

278
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,408
Okay. So,

279
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,453
was it consensual?

280
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,871
Of course.

281
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,581
Attorney,

282
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,627
we’ve been doing it for a long time.

283
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,462
Why is she accusing you of rape?

284
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,339
Because she was angry with me that night.

285
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:06,009
She took my phone while I was sleeping.

286
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,386
And then she discovered something.

287
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,349
Wake up, jerk!

288
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,226
Who’s this Christine?

289
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,355
My follower. What are you talking about?

290
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,356
I can’t believe this.

291
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,066
Is this the reason why
you don’t want us to be official?

292
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,692
So you can still flirt with anybody?

293
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,195
Go back to sleep. Just shut up.

294
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,696
- I want to sleep.
- Let’s end this now!

295
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,406
Get out!

296
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,825
- What the hell?
- Get out!

297
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,494
She’s angry. That’s why
she wants to ruin my career.

298
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,788
So, was that the last time you saw her?

299
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:35,956
Yes.

300
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,708
What's this, Joni?

301
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,670
Attorney, can you help us?

302
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,754
I'm not guilty.

303
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,631
I didn’t rape her.

304
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,383
Why Miranda and Associates?

305
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,886
You can go to bigger law firms.

306
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,055
Why me?

307
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,974
It was my idea.

308
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,601
We can pay no matter how much.

309
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,853
And you're right.

310
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,105
We can get the biggest law firm

311
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,274
to represent us. But...

312
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:05,902
But what?

313
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,198
But it’s better if a woman defends Zach.

314
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,660
Someone who comes from a

315
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,872
humble law firm.

316
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,373
Small-time, you mean?

317
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,041
Attorney,

318
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,377
you're one of the best
female lawyers in the city.

319
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,801
So, this is all for optics?

320
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,556
Attorney, they say that guilty people

321
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,100
hire the most expensive lawyers

322
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,852
from the biggest law firms.

323
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,188
But if you represent us,

324
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:46,651
people's perception will be different.

325
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,988
- Two million pesos.
- Whoa!

326
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:53,325
Yes, two million pesos acceptance fee.

327
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:57,996
Plus 20% down payment, non-refundable,

328
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,710
and we also need
a monthly retainer's fee of 50,000 pesos.

329
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,756
That does not include
the 10,000 pesos appearance fee

330
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,299
whenever she goes to the court,

331
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,259
whether there is a hearing or not.

332
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,929
Okay, my team will get back to you
as soon as possible.

333
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,305
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

334
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,848
- Attorney, thank you for your time.
- Yes.

335
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,807
- Joni,
- Yes.

336
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,768
if I'm going to accept this case,

337
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,521
we have to make sure
that Zachary cooperates.

338
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,775
He has to obey everything I say.

339
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,692
- Yes, Attorney.
- Hold on!

340
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,904
We are here

341
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,697
to hire you.

342
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,491
- You're a small-time lawyer.
- Zachary!

343
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,664
Why does it seem
that we owe you a debt of gratitude?

344
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,875
I won’t be following your orders.

345
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,335
Zachary, stop!

346
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,712
Mr. Chua, look at you.

347
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,049
I don't think you understand

348
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,927
or you know the gravity of your situation.

349
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,138
You are being accused of rape.

350
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,642
Don't you know how serious that is?

351
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,727
Don't act like I need you.

352
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,562
You’re the one who needs me.

353
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,899
Do you know why I charge that much?

354
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:13,280
Mr. Chua, I have never lost a case.

355
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,075
Why would I risk my name to defend you?

356
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:20,578
- Attorney. Attorney, it's okay.
- Doesn't it seem like

357
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,455
you need me more than I need you?

358
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,540
My card.

359
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,000
Attorney, it’s fine.

360
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,128
Just make sure that I win this case.

361
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:31,923
Make sure that you are worth every peso
that I'm paying you.

362
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,758
Zach, let's go!

363
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,593
Attorney, we'll see you soon.

364
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,970
Zach, let's go.

365
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,179
Thank you so much for your time.

366
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,098
- Joni, what's that?
- Mr. Chua, Sir Joni.

367
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,725
I thought she was going to be cheap.

368
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,977
Zach!

369
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,812
Why don't we just hire a famous lawyer

370
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,188
from a bigger law firm?

371
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,899
Can you just trust me, please?

372
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,318
Let's not talk here.

373
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,694
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

374
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,988
It’s my money you’re spending.

375
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:55,905
Zachary!

376
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,907
Find someone better.

377
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,993
We can't mess this up.

378
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,995
Zachary, can you just trust me?

379
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,079
This is embarrassing.

380
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,039
Take care.

381
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,666
Okay, let's get started.

382
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,627
Find me anything
about Madison and Zachary.

383
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,255
Previous relationships, dating history,

384
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,090
everything. Okay?

385
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,175
Marisue, that's easy for you

386
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,177
because you’re his follower, right?

387
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,012
Not anymore. He's a turn off.

388
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,348
Ms. A., he’s so entitled.

389
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,515
And arrogant.

390
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,435
There are a lot of people like him.

391
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,603
They come from rich families

392
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,856
who never struggled their entire lives.

393
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,195
And they think that
they can just do anything

394
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,946
and then get away with it.

395
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,492
Ms. A., there's a man looking for you.

396
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,203
Super handsome with dimples.

397
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,121
Ms. A., he is absolutely gorgeous!

398
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,956
Attorney Caliente.

399
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,792
Matthew Caliente.

400
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,173
Okay, tell him he has
five minutes to talk to me.

401
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,841
Just five minutes?

402
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,801
Wait.

403
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,979
Ex!

404
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,523
Exis!

405
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:13,942
How are you?

406
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,902
I'm good.

407
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,404
You?

408
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,780
I'm doing good, too.

409
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,991
Thank you for giving me a few minutes

410
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,828
of your precious time, Attorney Miranda.

411
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,332
I'm sure your time is also limited.

412
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:33,711
I know how stressful
it is to work for Atticus.

413
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,714
So,

414
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,593
how’s life as Adam’s slave?

415
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,138
So, I'm an enemy now?

416
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,014
I know this is your drink.

417
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,934
Why are you here, Math?

418
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:51,104
I mean, Attorney Caliente.

419
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,315
I'm here because there is talk

420
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,277
that you are going
to represent Zachary Chua.

421
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,821
And?

422
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,366
Atticus will be
representing Madison Valencia.

423
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,410
Oh.

424
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,581
So, this is the Trojan horse.

425
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,001
Isn't there something
more expensive than this?

426
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,712
- Sure, give it back.
- But I'll take it.

427
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,384
Ex,

428
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,721
I’m telling you so you won't be surprised.

429
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,598
You'll be seeing more of me

430
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,933
and Attorney Lucero.

431
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,101
Is that a threat?

432
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,979
I just want to make sure
that there is no conflict of interest.

433
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,397
Don't worry, Math.

434
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,733
There's no conflict.

435
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,401
And I can assure you,

436
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,820
there is no interest.

437
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,906
- Your time is--
- Is up?

438
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,699
I know.

439
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,369
I'll see you soon.

440
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,585
Congratulations for winning the case.

441
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,961
Thank you.

442
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,798
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

443
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,924
Congrats.

444
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,259
To more victories!

445
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,678
This is an unbeatable team!

446
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,099
Thank you, sir.

447
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,227
Kudos to Attorney Miranda, sir.

448
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,103
Her research was thorough.

449
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,649
Yes, but you were the team leader.

450
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,069
So, because of that,

451
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,488
the Board of Trustees

452
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:27,659
has decided to promote you
as a junior partner.

453
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,577
- Wow!
- Congratulations, Attorney Lucero!

454
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,412
Thank you!

455
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,330
Adam.

456
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,165
- Yes.
- Congratulations!

457
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,250
Great job!

458
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,378
There is somebody waiting
for you in the office.

459
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,214
Thank you.

460
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,131
Congrats!

461
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,968
I have another announcement to make.

462
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,346
We've been hiding this

463
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,973
- from you for a long time.
- Congrats.

464
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,226
Because I don't want any of you to think

465
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,687
that this announcement has anything to do

466
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,939
with Attorney Lucero's promotion.

467
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:02,151
After all, Attorney Lucero
deserves his promotion, correct?

468
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,863
But Attorney Lucero

469
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:08,950
will soon be a full partner of this firm

470
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:13,746
because he is going
to be a member of our family.

471
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,291
- Wow!
- Congratulations!

472
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:22,005
Adam and Kate are getting married!

473
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,506
Wow!

474
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,510
Congratulations!

475
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,224
Fuck him!

476
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,312
Can you believe?

477
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,481
We've been going out for months.

478
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,233
I can't remember.

479
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,278
We've been together for a few months.

480
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,864
And then I find out
that he’s getting married!

481
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,825
I'm getting married.

482
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,666
And not just with anybody.

483
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,751
What the fuck!

484
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,253
He's marrying our boss's daughter.

485
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,679
It hurts so much. Fuck this!

486
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,932
How's my ego, bro?

487
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:18,269
I can't believe
you're getting married to that rich bitch!

488
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,021
What the fuck?!

489
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,231
Jerk! Stupid!

490
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,942
Fuck him! What a jerk!

491
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,194
Yes, he's a jerk.

492
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,362
Cheers!

493
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,821
For stupid jerks.

494
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,338
Oh, shit!

495
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,469
Excuse me.

496
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,888
I don't talk to strangers.

497
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,350
Okay. Be careful.

498
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,977
Whoa, whoa!

499
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,729
- Uh...
- Be careful, okay.

500
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,981
Excuse me.

501
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,108
I can handle myself.

502
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,567
See, I can do it.

503
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,947
To all the men
who do not know how to love,

504
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,824
fuck you!

505
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,159
Fuck all of you!

506
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,494
- Fuck this!
- Hey.

507
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,745
- Fuck!
- Careful.

508
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,455
- Take a seat.
- I'm fine.

509
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,915
Okay?

510
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:21,833
Are you all right?

511
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,425
I still want to drink.

512
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:31,843
Seems like you had enough.

513
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,760
- No, no.
- Give it to me.

514
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,262
Give it to me!

515
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,305
Son of a bitch! Give me that!

516
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,932
- I want to drink some more!
- Hey, hey!

517
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,726
That's enough!
You already drank enough!

518
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,185
- This is mine now.
- Relax.

519
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,812
Oh, okay.

520
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,022
- That's enough.
- Buy more of this. Quick.

521
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,231
That's enough.

522
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,817
Hey, hey!

523
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,735
Okay, that's enough.

524
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,028
- You're drunk enough already, okay?
- Okay.

525
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,780
- Okay?
- Okay.

526
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:54,866
Okay.

527
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,007
So, you're getting married.

528
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,635
Let's not talk here.

529
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,429
Why not?

530
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,309
You don't want your girlfriend to know?

531
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,270
I'm sorry. I mean, your fiancée.

532
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,859
How was it?

533
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,737
You dated both of us at the same time?

534
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,075
How did that happen, huh?

535
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,535
Since when?

536
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,290
- We don't have a relationship.
- Wait.

537
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,375
What?

538
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,713
So what was that?

539
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,174
We were just colleagues who had sex?

540
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,928
Huh?

541
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,013
Okay.

542
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,057
I get it now.

543
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,685
You just fucked me.

544
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,317
You know what we are and what we are not.

545
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,361
I have to go.

546
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,668
Okay. Yeah, I'll see you.

547
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,169
Yes, I'll be there right away.

548
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,796
Sir.

549
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,549
We have a new intern
who’s coming in today.

550
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,676
He'll be here for about eight weeks.

551
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,387
I want you to be his mentor.

552
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,181
Uh, by mentor, you mean...

553
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,350
Teach him everything
that he needs to learn.

554
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,727
It's up to you, okay?

555
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,312
Okay, sir.

556
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,731
Attorney, they are waiting
for you at the conference now.

557
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,152
- Tell them I'll follow.
- And sir, the intern is here now.

558
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,696
Oh, Matthew. Please, send him in.

559
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,822
You will like Matthew.

560
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,282
Yeah, he's a nice man.

561
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,492
Matthew.

562
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,994
- Hello, sir.
- Welcome to Atticus.

563
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,537
How are you, Attorney Guevarra?

564
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,039
This is Attorney Alexis Miranda.

565
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,791
She will be your mentor.

566
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,918
- Hi.
- Alexis, this is Matthew.

567
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,379
And you’ll handle him, okay?

568
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,714
Yes, sir.

569
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,217
So, your name is Alexis.

570
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,596
Uh, call me Attorney Miranda.

571
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,555
We’re not close.

572
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,807
Don't you remember me?

573
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,226
I'm sorry.

574
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,436
Have we met?

575
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,191
So, where is the jerk who two-timed you

576
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,734
with the boss's daughter?

577
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,618
Oh, my God! Was it you?

578
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,873
You are a law student?

579
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,834
Miss Valencia,

580
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,421
do you personally know Mr. Zachary?

581
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,382
The accused in this case?

582
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,718
Yes.

583
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,678
Please tell us about
your relationship with Zachary.

584
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,305
We’re dating.

585
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,264
Dating?

586
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,808
But he's not your boyfriend?

587
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,478
We're not official.

588
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,938
There's no label.

589
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,691
Can you tell us what happened
on the night of March 30th 2024?

590
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,695
He

591
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,947
raped me!

592
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,039
Can you tell us what happened?

593
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,167
We rented a villa out of town.

594
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,169
Do it.

595
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,566
You said you and Zachary are dating.

596
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,443
Can you make it clear what that means?

597
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,030
We hang out. We go on dinner dates.

598
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,323
Clubbing sometimes.

599
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,200
Most of the time, we go out of town.

600
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,286
And when you go out of town,

601
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,955
what do you usually do?

602
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,374
What people usually do on a date.

603
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,252
- Meaning?
- Kissing. MOMOL...

604
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,879
Sex.

605
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,591
Miss Valencia, what is
the meaning of MOMOL?

606
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,302
Your Honor, MOMOL means

607
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,304
Make Out, just Making Out.

608
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,433
So, you guys have sex often?

609
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,435
Yes.

610
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,867
- Mads! What the hell, Madison!
- What?

611
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,328
What’s this? Just continue.

612
00:38:59,086 --> 00:38:59,920
Who’s that?

613
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,047
Give me the phone.

614
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,214
What the hell.

615
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,718
What made you say that he raped you

616
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,636
on March 30th 2024?

617
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,722
Because he forced me.

618
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,932
I said I didn't want to,
but he did it anyway.

619
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,642
Tell me who's calling.

620
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,145
- Give it to me.
- I told you, stop it.

621
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,229
Give it to me.

622
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,731
Give it to me!

623
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,024
You’re a jerk!

624
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,817
Is that why you don't
want the public to know

625
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,986
that we’re in a relationship?

626
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,155
So that you can continue
flirting with other women?

627
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,616
Are you crazy?

628
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,954
Zach, don't.

629
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,956
Zach, I said stop.

630
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,250
- Zach, what the hell!
- What happened then?

631
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,752
- What the hell!
- He left.

632
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,171
Did you say anything
to him before he left?

633
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,715
Nothing.

634
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,844
Miss Valencia,

635
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,597
what made you decide

636
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,391
to file a case against Zachary?

637
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,064
I know no one will believe me

638
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,234
because Zach and I have
been having sex for a long time.

639
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,113
They think it's useless
for me to complain about rape

640
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,324
because we are almost in a relationship.

641
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:15,121
But women deserve to be respected.

642
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,666
We should not be exploited.

643
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,419
We should not be forced.

644
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,506
We shouldn't be violated.

645
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,432
Your Honor, presenting Exhibit A,

646
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,934
medico-legal filed by
the complainant that same night.

647
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,687
No further questions, Your Honor.

648
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:44,275
Does the defense have
any questions for cross-examination?

649
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,568
Yes, Your Honor.

650
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,570
You may proceed.

651
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,033
Miss Valencia,

652
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,204
how long have you been dating Mr. Chua?

653
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,415
Six months.

654
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:04,086
How long have you been
sexually active with Mr. Chua?

655
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,589
Six months.

656
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,884
In the span of six months,

657
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,053
could you tell me
how many times you’ve had sex?

658
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,306
Objection! Irrelevant.

659
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,223
Your Honor,

660
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,602
we need to establish
the dynamics of the apparent relationship

661
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,438
between the accused and the complainant.

662
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,232
We need to quantify
how often they have sex.

663
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,358
This would help us figure out

664
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,195
if what happened to them
was consensual or not.

665
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,446
Overruled.

666
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,698
Go on, Miss Madison.

667
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,411
Would you know how many times
you've had sex with Mr. Chua?

668
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,246
I can't count anymore.

669
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,623
It's okay.

670
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,874
You can give me an estimate.

671
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,710
Is it once a week? Twice a week?

672
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,378
Every day?

673
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,215
Every week. We have sex every week.

674
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,800
So you have sex almost every week.

675
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,220
That is six months times four weeks.

676
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,347
So more or less, 24 times.

677
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,515
Am I correct?

678
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,602
- More or less.
- How many rounds do you go in a day?

679
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,021
Objection! The question is vague.

680
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,147
Overruled.

681
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,232
Miss Valencia,

682
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,901
could you tell me
how many times you have sex in one day?

683
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,069
Is it once a day,

684
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,779
twice a day, three times a day?

685
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,072
Give me a number.

686
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,158
Three, most of the time.

687
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,952
Sometimes, one or two.

688
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,079
- Maximum is eight times.
- Eight.

689
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,622
Eight times.

690
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,460
I guess it's fair to say
that you enjoy having sex with Mr. Chua?

691
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,170
- Objection!
- Was it good?

692
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,088
Objection!

693
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,506
Sustained.

694
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,219
Miss Valencia,

695
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,179
you've had sex

696
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,391
with Mr. Chua numerous times.

697
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,352
Was there ever a time that he forced you

698
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,105
to have sex when you didn't want to?

699
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,899
That night only.

700
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,277
Did you say no directly?

701
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,946
Of course.
I didn’t want it. That's why I said no.

702
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,864
Did he hear you say no?

703
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,117
I pushed him. I said, "Stop!"
I said, "I don't want to."

704
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,245
Miss Valencia,
I am going to repeat the question.

705
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:06,709
Did Mr. Chua hear you say no?

706
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,545
- Miss Valencia, do you understand
- Stop it!

707
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,629
- that
- You're crazy, right?

708
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,506
- you and Mr. Chua
- Zach, stop!

709
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,134
- would have sex multiple times
- Stop it!

710
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,677
- in a day?
- Zach, stop!

711
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,679
Is there even the slightest chance

712
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,848
- that he might have misunderstood
- Stop it, please.

713
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,349
- what you were saying?
- Stop it!

714
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,101
That what came across was that

715
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:28,147
you didn't want him
to stop what he was doing?

716
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,481
Objection!

717
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,525
- Sustained.
- Miss Valencia,

718
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,529
do you love Mr. Chua?

719
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,159
Could you describe to me

720
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,494
your feelings for Mr. Chua

721
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:48,208
before the alleged rape
on March 30th 2024?

722
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,586
Yes, I like him.

723
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,754
I love him.

724
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,842
Because I wouldn't agree
to have sex with him

725
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,010
if I didn't have feelings for him.

726
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,139
But that night, I didn't want to.

727
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,849
But he continued anyway.

728
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,812
He forced me.

729
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,190
He raped me.

730
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,825
Miss Valencia,

731
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,453
what do you do for a living?

732
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,581
I'm an influencer.

733
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,541
How much is your monthly income?

734
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,834
Objection!

735
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,504
Your Honor, I am curious to know

736
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,506
how much Miss Madison makes.

737
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,049
I used to work for Atticus,

738
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,928
and I know how much
they charge to represent a client.

739
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,179
If she was truly raped,

740
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,389
she wouldn't feel the need

741
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,974
to hire a high-end legal service

742
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,477
unless she sees

743
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,188
this case as an investment.

744
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,482
You invest in it

745
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,401
because you know
you’ll get a lot of money from it.

746
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,069
- Objection!
- Attorney, do you think I'm doing this

747
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,112
for money?

748
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,613
Is that what you think of me?

749
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,864
I did not say that.

750
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,783
Those words came out of your mouth.

751
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,119
No further questions, Your Honor.

752
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,713
I'm tired of this.

753
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,881
- Please.
- I understand.

754
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,383
We'll take care of this.

755
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,385
- Madison, can we talk?
- Fuck! What the hell!

756
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,053
- Zach.
- Look, Madison.

757
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,221
- Please, relax. Look at me.
- Don't come near me!

758
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,014
- What the hell!
- Stop it, Zachary!

759
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,349
- Relax.
- Come on, Madison.

760
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,892
Don't waste your time.

761
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,019
Stop this.

762
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,438
Are you stupid?

763
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,984
Why? You knew from the start
that we were not in a relationship.

764
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,652
Fuck you!

765
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:41,613
- Zach, let's go.
- Fuck you!

766
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,990
Just go!

767
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,367
- Keep him away, please!
- We should leave!

768
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,535
- Madison!
- Just go!

769
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:50,122
And you, Attorney, you’re also a woman.

770
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:53,667
Why are you defending that maniac?

771
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,669
Have you ever been hurt

772
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:59,298
and exploited by the man
you once loved and trusted?

773
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:02,426
Madison, enough. It won't help the case.

774
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,535
Alex.

775
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,415
Alex.

776
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,669
I'm sorry.

777
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,505
I'm sorry.

778
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,716
I'm sorry.

779
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,891
- No.
- Alex.

780
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,870
How did that happen?

781
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,830
It just happened.

782
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,418
Give me a drink.

783
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,179
No. No.

784
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,514
You have no fucking right!

785
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,557
- No!
- No?

786
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,101
Fuck you! No! Get the fuck out of here!

787
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,186
Fine! All right.

788
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,439
Fuck you!

789
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,817
You come in to my home
and take my alcohol as if it's yours?

790
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,652
Fuck you!

791
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:52,953
Fine.

792
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,081
Tell me. Fuck!

793
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,587
How long have you been together?

794
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,092
Four months.

795
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,979
Where was I in those four months?

796
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,945
My feelings for you are real, Alex.

797
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,955
But what?

798
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,126
You’re marrying her.

799
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,260
Kate is pregnant.

800
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,431
Do you love her?

801
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:03,857
Hey.

802
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,568
- I need to marry her.
- Bullshit!

803
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,112
Fuck! Fucking bullshit!

804
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,699
You need to marry her

805
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,910
not because she's fucking pregnant.

806
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:18,080
You need to marry her
because of your fucking ambition!

807
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,206
Your fucking dreams!

808
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,707
Her fucking last name!

809
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,210
So, tell me.

810
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:33,845
Enough.

811
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,263
Enough!

812
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,516
Adam, enough! No!

813
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,730
I said, enough. No!

814
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,612
Stop!

815
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,822
Please.

816
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,407
No!

817
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,368
No! No!

818
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,869
No!

819
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:01,248
No! No! No!

820
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,050
No!

821
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,051
No!

822
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,345
No!

823
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:19,808
No!

824
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,685
No!

825
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,680
Alex.

826
00:50:58,764 --> 00:50:59,931
Good morning.

827
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,101
Let me go.

828
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,603
About what happened to us last night,

829
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:07,063
you can't tell anyone, okay?

830
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,732
So that your fiancée won’t find out?

831
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,485
So that we can continue
to work together well.

832
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,071
We're a team, right?

833
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,115
Let's forget that.

834
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,911
I have no intention of telling
anybody about what happened.

835
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:21,828
Good.

836
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:25,999
Fuck you.

837
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,588
Adam.

838
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,967
Why am I no longer
included in the Tuason case?

839
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,345
Not for now.

840
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:42,474
I already have preliminary research.

841
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,684
I have also talked to the client.

842
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,478
Write it down. Hand it over to me.

843
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,438
We can still use that.

844
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,191
What happened to us being a team?

845
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,528
Now we will keep on
winning cases together?

846
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,154
You have many other cases.

847
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,365
You still have a case
with Mr. Galang, don't you?

848
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,658
The annulment case.

849
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,535
Also, you're still training the new OJT.

850
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,994
That's it!

851
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,247
I didn't go to law school

852
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,582
and top the bar exams to become a nanny

853
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,251
to entitled law students

854
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,127
who just want to explore the legal world.

855
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,048
Why am I always
assigned to train the OJTs?

856
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:18,134
No, I want to be in that case.

857
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,261
See?

858
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,471
See?

859
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,349
That's why I took you
off of the Tuason case.

860
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,226
- You are too emotional.
- Wow.

861
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,437
You're also invested in that case.
That won't help us.

862
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,606
Who knows, you might
suddenly break down during the trial.

863
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,607
Oh, shit.

864
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,193
There will be other chances.

865
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,530
The problem with you women,

866
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,532
is that you easily get carried--

867
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,621
You are not rational
because you are too emotional.

868
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:47,789
No, don't--

869
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,333
Don't give me that bullshit!

870
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,837
What are you saying about us women?

871
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,382
That we are emotional
and you men are rational?

872
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,968
Emotions do not only involve crying.

873
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:04,055
You want to talk about men,
and how men behave?

874
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,683
Being too proud, being hot-headed?

875
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,810
How about being rude and chauvinistic?

876
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,395
Tell me.

877
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,732
- It was Attorney Guevarra's idea.
- Come on.

878
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,984
- I'm just following instructions.
- Come on.

879
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,403
You're my senior associate.

880
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,281
If you really want to, you can find ways.

881
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,659
But you know what? I get it.

882
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,330
I know why you don't want me in this case.

883
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:30,832
Domestic abuse.

884
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,125
Betrayal.

885
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,502
Infidelity.

886
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,088
It hits close to home.

887
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,348
Attorney, Mr. Galang called

888
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,892
to say that we were unable
to submit their annulment case.

889
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:49,976
What?

890
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,854
But I already gave my recommendation

891
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:53,813
to Adam last week.

892
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,775
Attorney Lucero is on leave.

893
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,819
Why is he on leave?

894
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:03,239
Because he is getting married
this weekend to Ms. Kate.

895
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,825
So?

896
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,661
If the wedding is still on the weekend,

897
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,871
why is he taking an early leave?

898
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,248
Because the wedding is in Florence.

899
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,541
Florence?

900
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,001
As in Italy?

901
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,254
Okay.

902
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,839
When are they coming back?

903
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,341
I don't have any idea.

904
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,926
But they will have
their honeymoon in Paris,

905
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,803
then to Vienna.

906
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,262
Then maybe go to Budapest too.

907
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,973
So, maybe next month.

908
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,482
Fuck!

909
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,694
You dozed off?

910
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,112
You're blocking the way.

911
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,656
Sorry, sorry.

912
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,117
Wait.

913
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,785
What am I blocking?

914
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,622
Do you know you look cute
when being teased?

915
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,124
So you think you're cute too?

916
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,375
Yes.

917
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,669
Don't you think I’m cute now?

918
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,714
You're a lawyer now.
You should be acting more mature.

919
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,716
Hold on a second.

920
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,677
We used to be okay.

921
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:10,306
Since the last time we saw each other

922
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,143
I noticed you find me so G.

923
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,061
What does G mean?

924
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,521
You find me gorgeous.

925
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,026
No? How about grumpy?

926
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,029
Why is that?

927
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,614
Is it because I'm with Atticus now?

928
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,908
They hired me.

929
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,162
I didn't force myself on them.

930
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,913
Plus,

931
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,000
you are the reason why
they saw the potential in me.

932
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,878
Exis, we are not enemies here.

933
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,046
Okay?

934
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,547
We’re opposing parties in court.

935
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,842
But we can still be friends, right?

936
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,888
I always tell people

937
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,140
most of the things
I've learned about being a lawyer,

938
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,641
I've learned them from you.

939
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:58,229
You haven't changed at all, Math.

940
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,233
- You think I'm still charming?
- Oh, no.

941
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,110
You’re still arrogant.

942
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,033
Has anyone else read this?

943
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,494
No one, ma'am.

944
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:15,038
Next time, you need to be thorough

945
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,915
if you want to be a lawyer.

946
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,209
If a simple typo slips through you,

947
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,377
small details will also slip through

948
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,421
that will affect your case.

949
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,216
So redo this. You can't go home

950
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,634
until it's done.

951
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:29,886
Your wish is my command.

952
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,180
Mr. Caliente.

953
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,306
Math.

954
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,184
Math.

955
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,021
Okay. Math.

956
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,982
One of the things you should learn

957
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:46,194
if you really want to be a lawyer

958
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:47,862
is to have confidence.

959
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,031
Even though you know you’ll lose,

960
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,951
you should never show fear or doubt.

961
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:55,870
Check this.

962
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,247
When you are sure,

963
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,540
give it back to me.

964
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,168
Remember, if you have a mistake,

965
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,130
you will drive me for a month,

966
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,172
Math.

967
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,549
I agree with one month.

968
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,342
One more tip.

969
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,594
Respect your coworker's time.

970
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,013
Do not submit your work to your boss

971
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,807
during her break time.

972
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,267
Professionalism.

973
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,353
That's one of the things
people like you should learn.

974
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,773
But you know, to be honest,

975
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:28,736
I think you've edged out
a lot more qualified candidates

976
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,905
simply because of your surname.

977
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,659
The perks of being the favorite child

978
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,120
of very powerful parents.

979
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,539
You're wrong about one thing.

980
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,833
The reason I decided to train here

981
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:45,253
is that my dad doesn't want me
to mess up in his firm,

982
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,715
unlike my other siblings

983
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,551
who were educated
in Ivy League schools in the US.

984
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,182
Okay?

985
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,433
But,

986
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,186
I believe in you.

987
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:08,067
There are two typos.
You spelled judgment wrong.

988
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:11,237
There's no letter E before ment.

989
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,283
In US spelling, there is only one E.

990
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:18,203
In the UK, my spelling is correct.

991
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,454
Both spellings are accepted.

992
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,123
Okay.

993
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,668
But in legal documents

994
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,795
they don't use E.

995
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:31,049
This is the only preferred spelling.

996
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,676
Anyway, I already put my address there

997
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,887
because I know you’ll lose.

998
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:39,724
So tomorrow pick me up early.

999
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,856
You’re late.

1000
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,526
Traffic was too heavy.
I live far from here, you know.

1001
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,527
Oh, okay.

1002
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,569
- So it's my fault?
- Let me carry that for you.

1003
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,654
Hmm?

1004
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,330
This is for you.

1005
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,623
I know you haven't had breakfast yet.

1006
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:05,667
Thanks.

1007
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,507
Please come early tomorrow.

1008
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,634
How about some coffee?

1009
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:19,097
Mr. Caliente, you started this bet.

1010
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,182
You said you would drive
for me if you lost.

1011
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,934
Next time,

1012
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,186
don't make promises you can't keep.

1013
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,146
Noted, Attorney.

1014
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,066
Thank you.

1015
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,860
Wait.

1016
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:36,531
I left my heart bag in your car.

1017
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,241
- Your wish is my command.
- Thank you.

1018
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,702
- I'll go get it.
- Thanks.

1019
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:45,206
Is it part of the intern's training
to drive for you?

1020
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,543
You're back.

1021
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,337
Did you miss me?

1022
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,632
Didn't you just come back
from your honeymoon?

1023
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:57,969
Morning.

1024
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,024
Ex.

1025
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,569
Ex!

1026
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,280
Hello?

1027
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,120
What is this for?

1028
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,580
I need you to sign this.

1029
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,791
I’m done with my internship.

1030
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,462
But why me?

1031
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,422
Shouldn't you ask HR for this?

1032
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,299
You are my direct supervisor.

1033
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,259
Okay.

1034
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:42,805
Sign it now.

1035
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,769
So it’s your last day today.

1036
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:53,691
I know our one month deal is not over yet.

1037
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,443
It’s fine, you're off the hook.

1038
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,028
How about if I teach you how to drive?

1039
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,322
I don't have a car,

1040
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,616
and I don't have money to buy my own car.

1041
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:05,495
But one day, you will have one.

1042
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:06,704
Manifesting.

1043
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,081
In exchange for what?

1044
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,374
Nothing.

1045
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,875
Oh, come on.

1046
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,294
Everything has a price.

1047
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,712
Nothing.

1048
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,924
And I'm sure if I teach you how to drive,

1049
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,801
I can still learn something from you.

1050
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:23,262
You can share some tips or advice

1051
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,057
on how to be a good lawyer.

1052
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:29,227
So you want something in return.

1053
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,728
Sustained.

1054
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:32,980
Hey, Caliente!

1055
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,732
- Yeah?
- How about a farewell party?

1056
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,693
- That’s right.
- Sure.

1057
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,027
When?

1058
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,195
Tonight.

1059
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:40,988
- Are you inviting all of us?
- Yes, all of you.

1060
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,365
Yes, all of us. Let's go.

1061
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,493
Attorney, you should come.

1062
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,121
You didn’t give up mentoring me.
I owe you a lot.

1063
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,498
What’s going on?

1064
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:54,794
Attorney, Math will be
having a farewell party tonight.

1065
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,671
You should come, Ms. Kate.

1066
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,881
I’ll go ahead. I have a meeting.

1067
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,386
- Cheers for Matthew!
- Cheers!

1068
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,054
- For Matthew!
- Thank you, guys!

1069
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:08,057
- Finally, I can enjoy my lunch!
- Congrats!

1070
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,183
Thank you, Lord!

1071
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,101
- You’re mean.
- That’s harsh.

1072
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:11,853
He always bothers me.

1073
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:14,272
By the way, Attorney,
how was the honeymoon?

1074
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,357
Of course, it was fun.

1075
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,442
Wow.

1076
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:18,484
Which city is more romantic?

1077
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,069
Paris or Florence?

1078
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:23,156
Actually, it's Florence.

1079
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,574
Nice.

1080
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,326
- He wanted us to go there.
- Well, there you go.

1081
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,537
He made the whole itinerary
and everything.

1082
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,165
- Very sweet.
- That's true.

1083
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,209
But everywhere is romantic

1084
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,669
because I'm with him.

1085
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:41,758
So sweet.

1086
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,384
Who wants to order more food?
You might still want to order.

1087
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,053
Are you having a baby soon?

1088
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,638
That's for sure.

1089
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:48,556
That's my man.

1090
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,725
Cheers for Attorney Lucero and Ms. Kate!

1091
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:51,976
- Congratulations, guys!
- Thank you.

1092
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:54,103
Congrats.

1093
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,899
- Congratulations.
- Sorry.

1094
01:02:57,982 --> 01:02:59,233
Excuse me for a sec.

1095
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,902
Sorry.

1096
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,112
Thank you so much.

1097
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,323
Hey, guys. Let's have a drink.

1098
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:08,576
Matthew is asking
for more food. Let's order.

1099
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,999
What is this? Solo flight?

1100
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:19,712
They're a bunch of losers.

1101
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,177
Does it still hurt?

1102
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,428
Which one?

1103
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,514
Seeing Attorney Lucero

1104
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,849
with his new wife.

1105
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:40,817
Why?

1106
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:45,321
Why are you looking at me like that?

1107
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:47,532
Nothing. For happy vibes.

1108
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:48,991
Oh.

1109
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,078
It's annoying.

1110
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:56,833
Well, what makes you think I'm sad?

1111
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:00,127
Is it because Adam is married,

1112
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:03,464
and they went
on their honeymoon to Florence.

1113
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:07,385
Did you know that I was the one
who told him about Florence?

1114
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,470
That's where I wanted to go with him.

1115
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,430
But that's life.

1116
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,182
It’s no big deal.

1117
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,393
They're having a baby.

1118
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,106
I get you.

1119
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,900
You’re hurt.

1120
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,110
You got angry.

1121
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:28,614
But what stuck with me
during our conversation that time was

1122
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,576
that no matter what Attorney Lucero did

1123
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,120
you still love him so much--

1124
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,204
Idiot.

1125
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:38,082
Fuck you. Keep quiet.

1126
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:39,000
My gosh.

1127
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,294
Shit.

1128
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:45,298
Well.

1129
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:51,762
So, why do you want to be a lawyer?

1130
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:54,599
Aren't you from a family of lawyers?

1131
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,477
Is that the reason why

1132
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,813
that is the path you want to take?

1133
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:04,525
Well, growing up,

1134
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,652
I would always listen to my dad

1135
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,322
talk to his clients during the day,

1136
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,198
and it caught my attention.

1137
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,327
So I said, one day

1138
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,828
I just want to be like my dad.

1139
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:17,830
How about you?

1140
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:22,001
Same. I became a lawyer
because of my father.

1141
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,379
Is he also a lawyer?

1142
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,007
Criminal.

1143
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,011
- Criminal?
- It’s true.

1144
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,804
- Is he a criminal?
- Yes he is.

1145
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:36,557
- Are you serious?
- It's true. He’s a convicted felon.

1146
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,521
Sorry.

1147
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:45,399
There's no need to say sorry.

1148
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,235
Well...

1149
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,864
My father was accused of stealing

1150
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,741
from a pawnshop in our province.

1151
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:55,534
He ran away.

1152
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,911
You see,

1153
01:05:56,994 --> 01:06:00,331
my mom’s world revolved around my father.

1154
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,750
So when my father disappeared,

1155
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:06,087
her life lost meaning.

1156
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,923
She got sick. And then

1157
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,633
she passed away.

1158
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:15,012
So my aunt put me through school.

1159
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:18,641
And here I am.

1160
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,352
Where’s your father now?

1161
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:23,145
I searched for him for a long time.

1162
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:27,066
I finally found him after 15 years.

1163
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,986
He is in jail for a different case.

1164
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,529
Estafa.

1165
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,495
Papa.

1166
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,335
Merry Christmas, Papa.

1167
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,804
I read your name in the newspaper.

1168
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,809
I thought someone has
the same name as you.

1169
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,604
It said that person is a lawyer.

1170
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,860
I strongly believed that it was you.

1171
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,031
Papa, I have a gift for you.

1172
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,952
This is your favorite.

1173
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,903
Sorry.

1174
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,530
I can't help crying.

1175
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:14,465
Papa, I became a lawyer because of you.

1176
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:17,218
And I will make sure
that you will get out of here.

1177
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,970
I will find a way.

1178
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,765
I am not a victim.

1179
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,895
It's true that I stole from the pawnshop.

1180
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:29,980
I was just scared to go to jail,

1181
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,608
so I ran away.
I did not face up to my crime.

1182
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:33,984
It’s all true.

1183
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:37,988
The Estafa case.

1184
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:44,161
I'm not...

1185
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,540
I am not a victim.

1186
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:18,112
- And then what?
- I did not try to see him again.

1187
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,615
Were you able to help him?

1188
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:25,286
No.

1189
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,621
I was unable to help him.

1190
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,333
Because you see, Math,

1191
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,461
the reason I became a lawyer is

1192
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:37,965
because I want to help
people like my father.

1193
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:40,801
Those who were wrongly accused

1194
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,137
who no one believed
or helped to prove their innocence.

1195
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:48,100
Only for me to find out
that my father is actually guilty.

1196
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:54,356
Ex, is that really the reason?

1197
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,692
You probably felt betrayed.

1198
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:59,236
It's like all the reasons why you did that

1199
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,405
was all because of a lie.

1200
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:08,245
Hold that thought.

1201
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:10,372
I'm going to the ladies' room.

1202
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:29,558
Why?

1203
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:30,643
Are you doing this on purpose?

1204
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:31,810
Huh?

1205
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,522
Are you using the kid to make me jealous?

1206
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:36,732
Excuse me.

1207
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,693
Not everything is about you.

1208
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,489
Okay.

1209
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,449
You win.

1210
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:46,909
I'm jealous.

1211
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,955
So that's enough. Please.

1212
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:53,540
Don't drag him into this nonsense.

1213
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,167
What? Hold on.

1214
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:59,296
Who are you to tell me what I should do?

1215
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,799
Let me remind you of something.

1216
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:03,801
You're married.

1217
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:06,470
And your wife is here.

1218
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:09,348
Excuse me, please.

1219
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,434
- Excuse me.
- Alex.

1220
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,894
What?

1221
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:14,895
You are still the one I want.

1222
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,355
Oh, fuck.

1223
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:22,278
Hon?

1224
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:35,457
Oh.

1225
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:37,501
It’s early in the morning.

1226
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:38,419
Let's go.

1227
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:40,963
What?

1228
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,340
I thought our deal was over?

1229
01:11:44,049 --> 01:11:47,094
I promised to teach you
how to drive. Right?

1230
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,430
It’s the weekend.

1231
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:52,224
I made a promise, and I want to keep it.

1232
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:54,518
So you’re serious about that.

1233
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:55,894
Mm-hmm.

1234
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,063
Today is a perfect day.

1235
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,317
Watch your hand.

1236
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,907
Okay. Here are the keys.

1237
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,493
- All right, and then?
- Ignition.

1238
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:15,164
Wait. How do I do this? What should I do?

1239
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:16,165
Turn clockwise.

1240
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,334
- That's it.
- You got it, okay.

1241
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:19,293
And then?

1242
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:21,545
- Slowly go into drive.
- Drive.

1243
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,964
And then slowly press on the gas.

1244
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,008
Are you sure about this?

1245
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,217
- Smoothly, yes.
- Wait.

1246
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:28,802
- Wait.
- Yeah, okay.

1247
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,095
You're doing good.

1248
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,811
Good, they have it!

1249
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,401
Attorney.

1250
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:48,822
What are you getting?

1251
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,450
Stay away from my husband.

1252
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,455
What?

1253
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,415
Do you want me to say it again?

1254
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,835
Should I make it louder
for people to hear?

1255
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:06,006
Look, I don't know what Adam told you.

1256
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,260
I know your kind.

1257
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:12,596
Using their beauty

1258
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:15,849
to succeed.

1259
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,269
Excuse me?

1260
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,398
First, my husband.

1261
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:25,192
Then your intern.

1262
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:26,485
Who's next?

1263
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,195
My father?

1264
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:33,117
Look at me!

1265
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,910
I'm sorry, but I won't stoop down
to your level.

1266
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:36,662
Why not?

1267
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,831
- Because I'm your boss’s daughter?
- No.

1268
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,707
Because you are pregnant.

1269
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:41,834
Who...

1270
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:44,670
- How did you--
- Why don't you ask your husband?

1271
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,088
He told me.

1272
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:47,840
Hmm?

1273
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,217
You are bluffing.

1274
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,469
I'll get a devil's food cake, please.

1275
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:53,887
- One slice.
- One slice.

1276
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,390
Yes, one slice. Oh, do you want some?

1277
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:58,350
Oh, I guess you wouldn't need it.

1278
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,727
You married one.

1279
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:01,937
I'll just be here.

1280
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,021
Thanks.

1281
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:09,903
Hi, sir.

1282
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,238
I have good news.

1283
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:14,741
I discovered something about
the annulment case of Mr. Galang.

1284
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:15,868
So his--

1285
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:17,870
Alexis, sit down.

1286
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:19,788
Okay.

1287
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,044
Did you have a relationship

1288
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:30,299
with the intern, Matthew Caliente?

1289
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:31,758
What?

1290
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:34,428
No, sir.

1291
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,973
How about my son-in-law, Adam?

1292
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:39,850
Sir...

1293
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:43,228
Did he have an affair with you?

1294
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:44,605
No, sir.

1295
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:47,232
Are you in love with him?

1296
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:53,363
Sir, with all due respect,

1297
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,491
there's nothing...

1298
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:57,993
There's nothing going on, sir.

1299
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:04,333
I will not fire you,

1300
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:06,585
but I want your resignation

1301
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:10,088
- on my desk immediately.
- Sir, no.

1302
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:13,133
Sir, I know my rights.

1303
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,593
Sir, you cannot fire me.

1304
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:18,514
What you did with
that young intern, Caliente,

1305
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,558
can be construed as sexual harassment.

1306
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:22,601
Sir, first of all,

1307
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,604
I did not do anything with Mr. Caliente.

1308
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,440
And I know the law.

1309
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,693
Sir, you can't use this against me.

1310
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:32,986
Maybe not now.

1311
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:36,615
Maybe not in two days, not two months.

1312
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:39,785
But in a few years, who knows?

1313
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:42,913
Somebody may file a complaint.

1314
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:46,291
Sir. No one's going
to file a complaint, sir.

1315
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,502
Because there was no sexual harassment.

1316
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:49,878
There was no sexual harassment

1317
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,838
between me and Matthew.

1318
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:56,343
His parents are very influential.

1319
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,971
And they are powerful.

1320
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:00,889
Yes, sir, I understand.

1321
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,349
But sir, I am not afraid.

1322
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:03,559
Because I know the truth.

1323
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,227
I know the truth.

1324
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:09,231
There is nothing going on
between me and Mr. Caliente.

1325
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:12,317
We all have our truths.

1326
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,694
And you know

1327
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:16,697
lawyers can create any version

1328
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,490
of the truth they want.

1329
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:22,578
Your shenanigans with this young Caliente

1330
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,371
can cost me a client,

1331
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,456
can cost me a case,

1332
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:30,377
and even millions of pesos in the future.

1333
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,723
Do you have anything to do with this?

1334
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:46,143
Nothing.

1335
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:50,606
There are malicious rumormongers
who made up stories

1336
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,483
about me and Math.

1337
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,444
It's either you

1338
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:57,946
or your wife.

1339
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:01,491
Maybe you worked together to get me fired.

1340
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:03,869
Alex, you know how much I admire you.

1341
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,455
- Oh, fuck.
- You're competent. You're efficient.

1342
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:07,414
You're an asset here.

1343
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:09,082
You’re a loss to Atticus.

1344
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,668
Save the fucking praises! Enough!

1345
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:13,420
Fuck it.

1346
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:14,504
Even now,

1347
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:17,341
you are still good at gaslighting.

1348
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,676
Be grateful.

1349
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,095
I choose my battles.

1350
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:25,307
I did not tell a single soul

1351
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:27,267
of what you did to me.

1352
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:32,648
But you know what?
One day, we will cross paths,

1353
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,483
and I'll be strong enough.

1354
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:37,694
I'll be fucking strong enough
to tell everybody.

1355
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:40,864
Tell them what?

1356
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:44,618
You know exactly what you did.

1357
01:17:57,422 --> 01:17:59,675
I texted you when I passed my bar exam.

1358
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:03,095
I changed my number when I left Atticus.

1359
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,388
New life?

1360
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:05,389
Starting on a clean slate?

1361
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:07,683
Wait.

1362
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,936
Do you think I won't know
that you're now a lawyer?

1363
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,021
When Atticus hired me,

1364
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:14,940
I thought you were still there.

1365
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:17,484
I was excited.

1366
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:21,905
So why did you leave Atticus?

1367
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:23,657
Let's not talk about it.

1368
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:25,701
It’s over.

1369
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,578
It’s done.

1370
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:29,830
All right.

1371
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:32,749
The important thing

1372
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,293
is that you have your own firm now.

1373
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:39,047
And I’m up against Atticus now.

1374
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:42,884
When I was fired from Atticus,

1375
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:45,679
I thought that was the end of my career.

1376
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:46,847
As in

1377
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:49,057
I felt like I was a failure.

1378
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:50,225
Why did you leave Atticus?

1379
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:51,351
Sorry, we're not hiring.

1380
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,352
You were fired at Atticus?

1381
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,020
No, Attorney. I wasn't fired.

1382
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:55,063
I resigned.

1383
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,816
I was fired. I didn't leave.

1384
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,111
What?

1385
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:02,404
That's stupid.

1386
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:03,697
You're so good.

1387
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,578
You know that Guevarra
fired me because of you?

1388
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:10,662
Me?

1389
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:15,625
Well, not exactly you.

1390
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:21,006
Adam and Kate fabricated this story.

1391
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:24,634
They said things to Guevarra.

1392
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,345
You won't believe this.

1393
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,847
Guevarra fired me

1394
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,600
because he thought

1395
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:34,561
I sexually harassed you.

1396
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:35,645
What?

1397
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:36,730
I know.

1398
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,650
- I had no idea.
- Yeah.

1399
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,571
I'm actually surprised
they never talk about it.

1400
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:47,908
Well, I guess because
Atticus's name will be ruined.

1401
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:51,870
Too bad.

1402
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,457
About what?
That you didn’t find out about it?

1403
01:19:57,292 --> 01:20:00,128
Too bad it’s not true.

1404
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:01,713
I'd be willing.

1405
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:02,631
Wow.

1406
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:03,632
Oh.

1407
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:05,383
Oh, no.

1408
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:06,593
Bad joke.

1409
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:08,762
- Sorry.
- Terrible.

1410
01:20:08,845 --> 01:20:10,472
Terrible joke.

1411
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:12,891
Rape, abuse, harassment.

1412
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:13,934
No.

1413
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:16,686
You can’t joke about this. Bad joke.

1414
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:17,604
And yet,

1415
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:20,065
you are defending someone accused of rape.

1416
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:25,153
Okay.

1417
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,614
Well, it's unethical

1418
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:31,493
to talk about that outside the court.

1419
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,834
I'm sorry. I just...

1420
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,293
I just got carried away.

1421
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,047
To be honest

1422
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:47,092
I'm nervous right now.

1423
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:48,969
Okay.

1424
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:51,638
I know why.

1425
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:53,640
You're scared, right?

1426
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:56,518
You’re scared I’ll beat you.

1427
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:58,478
Well.

1428
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:00,814
No.

1429
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,069
I'm nervous now because

1430
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:08,572
you’re in front of me.

1431
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:15,662
Oh.

1432
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:18,790
Okay.

1433
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:22,252
Well, there's really
nothing to be nervous about.

1434
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:25,630
I mean, we're just two former colleagues.

1435
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:27,632
You know, just catching up.

1436
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,467
I know you remember.

1437
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:38,018
- Okay.
- Nice.

1438
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,520
- All right.
- Just wait.

1439
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:41,563
- Just a little.
- There you go.

1440
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:45,025
I did it! Oh, my God!

1441
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,820
Yeah.

1442
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,281
Yeah, I remember.

1443
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:52,407
Clearly.

1444
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:54,409
Oh, no.

1445
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:26,942
You're beautiful.

1446
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:06,147
May I

1447
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,234
proceed?

1448
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,527
Yes.

1449
01:23:16,616 --> 01:23:18,952
Were you intoxicated
when you went to see Madison?

1450
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:20,161
Objection!

1451
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,621
Irrelevant.

1452
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:23,206
Your Honor, the question will determine

1453
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:24,916
- if the defendant's reasoning
- It's like they're set to eat each other.

1454
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,876
may have been impaired.

1455
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:12,630
Tell me to stop.

1456
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:13,673
Okay.

1457
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:18,094
Stop.

1458
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:47,791
I have to go to work.

1459
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:51,586
Work?

1460
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:53,797
Come work here first.

1461
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:00,386
You can't leave.

1462
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:12,398
Daisy?

1463
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:13,942
Yes, Ms. A.?

1464
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:14,859
Where are you going?

1465
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,611
I’m going out to do some bank errands.

1466
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:18,196
I need you to take care
of something for me.

1467
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,781
- Oh, sure.
- Can you go to this address?

1468
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:21,825
That's the name and that's the address.

1469
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:26,371
- Okay.
- Can you check on his case

1470
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,123
and see if he can post bail?

1471
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:29,749
Okay, will do.

1472
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,795
Oh. Renante Miranda.

1473
01:25:33,878 --> 01:25:34,796
Are you related?

1474
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:36,756
Yes, my father.

1475
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,174
Your father?

1476
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:41,261
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1477
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:43,471
- I got you.
- Thank you.

1478
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:44,848
No problem. I’m going now.

1479
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:45,807
- Bye.
- Bye.

1480
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:46,850
I'll see you.

1481
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:50,436
Ms. A.?

1482
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,231
- Yes?
- Ms. A., we have a big problem.

1483
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:53,898
What is it?

1484
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,109
There is a viral post now on the Internet.

1485
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,320
I was raped by Zachary Chua.

1486
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:03,783
You know him as a sweet, charming guy.

1487
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:06,119
That's exactly what
he wants you to believe

1488
01:26:06,202 --> 01:26:07,787
before abusing you.

1489
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,373
Here.

1490
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,377
This is great for us.

1491
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:16,296
New victim coming out,

1492
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:18,339
we can use that in our case.

1493
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,050
The account was just made a few hours ago.

1494
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:22,427
It’s obviously a dummy account.

1495
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:25,430
If she cannot identify herself
or cooperate with us,

1496
01:26:26,055 --> 01:26:27,307
it's inadmissible.

1497
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:29,350
Then you should look for her.

1498
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:33,938
Madison, we need to talk to your friend.

1499
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,940
Your friend, Sharmaine.

1500
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:37,901
What about her?

1501
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:40,320
She went with Madison

1502
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:42,197
to the police station to file the report.

1503
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,365
When she becomes our witness,

1504
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,242
she can help us win the case.

1505
01:26:49,245 --> 01:26:50,538
Where is Sharmaine now?

1506
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,207
Actually,

1507
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,459
she was the one
who told me to go to Atticus

1508
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:57,545
because the lawyers here are good.

1509
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,173
To be honest,

1510
01:27:00,256 --> 01:27:01,925
I can't contact her anymore.

1511
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:03,718
She blocked my number,

1512
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:05,553
as well as my social media.

1513
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,013
Do you know where she lives?

1514
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:08,848
Where she works?

1515
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,266
We can send her a subpoena

1516
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,352
to force her to be a witness.

1517
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:13,603
She said she went missing.

1518
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:14,979
How do we send a subpoena?

1519
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,231
Let's not waste energy

1520
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:18,900
and time with a hostile witness.

1521
01:27:18,983 --> 01:27:20,818
She was with
the victim hours after the rape.

1522
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:22,570
If she gives her testimony--

1523
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:24,989
She is a friend of the victim.

1524
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,909
So she won't say anything
that's not in our favor.

1525
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:30,578
What we need is
someone not connected to Madison

1526
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:33,748
to say that Zachary raped her.

1527
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:35,416
That will strengthen our case

1528
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,127
because we will be able
to prove Zachary's character

1529
01:27:38,711 --> 01:27:40,964
is that he forces himself on women.

1530
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:43,299
Do we understand
each other, Attorney Caliente?

1531
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:50,223
Attorneys, whoever we talk to,

1532
01:27:50,306 --> 01:27:51,724
it's fine with me.

1533
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,060
Just to prove that Zach raped me.

1534
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:57,438
We will serve
the best possible evidence for your case.

1535
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:00,525
We will set up another meeting
before your trial.

1536
01:28:01,317 --> 01:28:02,819
Thank you, Attorney.

1537
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,783
This is the first and the last time

1538
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:10,785
you will answer back to me
like that in front of our clients.

1539
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:12,370
Do we understand each other?

1540
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:13,538
Make me.

1541
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:17,333
That's fake news.

1542
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,377
Do you know her?

1543
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:21,296
Who is this woman?

1544
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:25,216
He's a monster and a rapist.

1545
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:27,135
He should be in jail.

1546
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:29,637
- It's obvious that it's a troll account.
- Zach, please.

1547
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:30,638
Look, it’s a newly created account.

1548
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:33,308
I'm sure Madison is behind this.

1549
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,893
- Don’t you realize that?
- Have you had a similar experience

1550
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:36,978
with another woman,

1551
01:28:37,061 --> 01:28:39,022
the same thing
that happened between you and Madison?

1552
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:39,981
None!

1553
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:42,317
There’s none.

1554
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,819
- What do you think of me?
- Please, Zachary... Think carefully.

1555
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:46,529
Among all the women you've had sex with

1556
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:48,865
was there a single woman
you forced yourself on to?

1557
01:28:48,948 --> 01:28:49,949
Attorney,

1558
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:51,826
are you blind?

1559
01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:56,497
Look at me.
I don't need to force or rape a woman.

1560
01:28:57,498 --> 01:29:00,460
Girls beg me to have sex with them.

1561
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:03,588
There were even times I got raped!

1562
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:04,756
Tell her, Joni!

1563
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:06,549
Zach, I need your cooperation.

1564
01:29:07,383 --> 01:29:08,843
If this woman

1565
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:11,804
becomes a witness for the opposing party

1566
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,140
we're going to have a hard time.

1567
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:17,477
That's why I'm paying you.
Isn't that part of your job?

1568
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,270
- Fix it.
- Zach!

1569
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,980
- What’s going on, Joni?
- What I'm asking for

1570
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:24,359
- is your cooperation, Zach.
- My God.

1571
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,069
We need to work together.

1572
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:30,323
Joni, I told you,
let's just find someone else.

1573
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:31,949
Zach, can you stop, please?

1574
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:33,451
She doesn’t know how to do her job.

1575
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:34,786
- Zach!
- That's it! Get out!

1576
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,079
- Get out!
- No!

1577
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,497
- Yeah, leave!
- Attorney.

1578
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,582
No, no, no! He's not cooperating.

1579
01:29:39,665 --> 01:29:40,917
- Get out!
- Attorney, Attorney, wait!

1580
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,418
Zach, sit down!

1581
01:29:43,419 --> 01:29:44,295
I'm sorry, Attorney.

1582
01:29:47,673 --> 01:29:48,716
Zach.

1583
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:53,346
Please tell Attorney
everything that happened,

1584
01:29:53,429 --> 01:29:55,098
so she can determine how to help you.

1585
01:29:56,474 --> 01:30:00,019
Your endorsements
are dropping you one by one.

1586
01:30:00,686 --> 01:30:02,939
You are losing followers daily.

1587
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:04,649
Just imagine if this case continues.

1588
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:08,194
Your image depends on this.

1589
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,198
So, please cooperate.

1590
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,118
Attorney.

1591
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:18,496
Zachary is going to listen now.

1592
01:30:19,288 --> 01:30:20,748
Is there something you want to tell us?

1593
01:30:36,722 --> 01:30:38,558
Miss Valencia,

1594
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:41,978
on the night of March 30th 2024,

1595
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:46,107
when Mr. Chua has
left the vacation rental,

1596
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:48,401
what did you do?

1597
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:50,570
I called my friend.

1598
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:52,155
What is the name of your friend?

1599
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:54,490
Sharmaine. Sharmaine Antonio.

1600
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,033
I’m here for you.

1601
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,035
- Don't be afraid.
- How may I assist you?

1602
01:30:58,119 --> 01:31:00,830
Sir, can we file a rape complaint?

1603
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:02,039
Rosario!

1604
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:04,417
She went with me
to the police station to file a complaint.

1605
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,710
Okay, anything else?

1606
01:31:05,793 --> 01:31:08,129
She also accompanied me
to get a medico-legal report.

1607
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:10,798
So, Miss Valencia, you're telling me that

1608
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:12,925
this Sharmaine Antonio

1609
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:16,470
was with you that night
after the alleged rape?

1610
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:18,347
I just said that, didn't I?

1611
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:21,058
Miss Valencia, please answer with respect.

1612
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:25,396
Is Sharmaine Antonio here with us today?

1613
01:31:27,773 --> 01:31:28,733
She’s not here.

1614
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:33,029
Miss Valencia,
we've had three court hearings.

1615
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:35,990
Was there ever a time that she came here

1616
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:37,533
to show support?

1617
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,243
Objection! Irrelevant.

1618
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,620
Sustained.

1619
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:45,333
Miss Valencia, where is Sharmaine Antonio?

1620
01:31:47,793 --> 01:31:48,961
I don't know where she is.

1621
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:51,547
When was the last time you spoke to her?

1622
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:53,424
Objection! Irrelevant.

1623
01:31:53,507 --> 01:31:55,635
Your Honor, I don't get why
the opposing counsel

1624
01:31:55,718 --> 01:31:57,553
is so fixated with this Sharmaine.

1625
01:31:57,637 --> 01:32:00,598
Your Honor, Miss Madison Valencia

1626
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:03,476
has stated that Sharmaine Antonio

1627
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:05,645
was the first person she called

1628
01:32:05,728 --> 01:32:07,021
after the alleged rape.

1629
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:09,106
Miss Madison Valencia

1630
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,776
has stated that Sharmaine Antonio

1631
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:14,987
was with her when
she went to the police station

1632
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:17,365
and had her medical examination

1633
01:32:17,448 --> 01:32:20,117
after the alleged rape.

1634
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:23,037
With these statements, you would assume

1635
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,749
that they would have
a very close relationship.

1636
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:29,043
But Your Honor, isn't it questionable

1637
01:32:29,126 --> 01:32:33,297
that we have not once
seen Sharmaine Antonio

1638
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:36,092
in any of our court hearings?

1639
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:38,594
Why isn't she here?

1640
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:41,430
Why isn't she here to show support?

1641
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:43,724
Why isn't she on the witness stand

1642
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:46,185
giving her own testimony?

1643
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:48,604
Your Honor, I'll tell you why.

1644
01:32:50,147 --> 01:32:53,234
Sharmaine Antonio isn't here

1645
01:32:53,317 --> 01:32:54,986
because everything

1646
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:58,739
that Miss Madison Valencia had stated

1647
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,324
were lies.

1648
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,201
That even her friend

1649
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:05,329
feels disinclined to show support.

1650
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,957
Or maybe Sharmaine Antonio

1651
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,459
doesn't really exist in the first place.

1652
01:33:11,502 --> 01:33:15,298
Maybe she was just some made-up person

1653
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:19,135
just like this made-up rape accusation.

1654
01:33:19,218 --> 01:33:20,469
Objection!

1655
01:33:21,053 --> 01:33:22,430
I am telling the truth!

1656
01:33:22,513 --> 01:33:23,931
I was with Sharmaine.

1657
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,517
I just don't know what happened,
why she suddenly disappeared.

1658
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,227
I don't know where she is.

1659
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:30,229
But she was there the night Zach raped me.

1660
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:31,939
Check the CCTV!

1661
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,107
Check with the precinct!

1662
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:35,443
Order in the court!

1663
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:36,360
She was there!

1664
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,279
Yes, she was there!

1665
01:33:38,362 --> 01:33:41,532
Order in the court!

1666
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:48,331
- Attorney Miranda.
- Oh.

1667
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:49,623
Attorney, I'll go ahead.

1668
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:54,253
How can you defend
that man who abused a fellow woman?

1669
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:56,464
Why are you doing this?

1670
01:33:57,548 --> 01:33:58,841
Miss Valencia,

1671
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:00,718
even criminals

1672
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:04,305
can hire lawyers to defend them.

1673
01:34:04,388 --> 01:34:06,182
So you admit that Zach is a criminal?

1674
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:08,684
I didn't say anything like that.

1675
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:11,062
I took an oath.

1676
01:34:11,937 --> 01:34:14,982
I have to defend
the client who sought my help.

1677
01:34:15,524 --> 01:34:16,525
Even if he is wrong?

1678
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:20,571
The judge will decide that.

1679
01:34:20,654 --> 01:34:21,947
My job

1680
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,491
is to defend my client

1681
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:26,202
to the best of my abilities, okay?

1682
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:29,872
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1683
01:34:29,955 --> 01:34:31,624
We're not done yet!

1684
01:34:31,707 --> 01:34:33,918
Stop!

1685
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:37,004
Madison, please!

1686
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:38,964
Are you okay?

1687
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:40,257
- Ouch!
- What, Attorney?

1688
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,510
- Is this just about the money?!
- Calm down!

1689
01:34:42,593 --> 01:34:43,761
Where is your integrity?!

1690
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:46,222
Is winning the case
more important to you--

1691
01:34:46,305 --> 01:34:48,974
- Stop.
- than upholding the truth?

1692
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:50,726
I want justice, Attorney!

1693
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:52,019
Madison, please.

1694
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:53,938
This won't help the case.

1695
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:55,356
Go home now.

1696
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:57,274
Go home for now.

1697
01:35:03,989 --> 01:35:04,824
Are you okay?

1698
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:09,912
- Are you hurt?
- No. I'm fine.

1699
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:11,330
- What about you? Are you okay?
- Okay.

1700
01:35:11,914 --> 01:35:13,207
Oh, dear.

1701
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:16,127
Aren't we doing anything against Madison

1702
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:17,962
for what she did?

1703
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:19,338
It's annoying.

1704
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:21,340
News spreads fast.

1705
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:24,885
Videos are all over the Internet.

1706
01:35:25,594 --> 01:35:26,971
You know nowadays,

1707
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:30,015
anyone with a cellphone can be a reporter.

1708
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:33,185
But this is the best video.

1709
01:35:33,269 --> 01:35:36,897
Ms. A. This is so sweet!

1710
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:40,234
Sir Math is so tender with you.

1711
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:44,238
All right, back to work.

1712
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:45,197
You look good together, Ms. A.

1713
01:35:45,281 --> 01:35:46,115
Let's go back to work.

1714
01:35:46,198 --> 01:35:48,534
Lester, can you go to the precinct

1715
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:50,786
- where Madison filed a complaint?
- Sure.

1716
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:54,790
Check the CCTV if she really
went with a friend. Got it?

1717
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,709
- Copy.
- Marisue, please

1718
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:58,794
look for Sharmaine Antonio.

1719
01:35:58,878 --> 01:36:00,588
You are no longer
representing Madison's case.

1720
01:36:00,671 --> 01:36:02,590
You're conniving
with the opposing counsel.

1721
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:05,968
Can’t two lawyers
from opposing sides be friends?

1722
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:07,678
Alexis used to work at Atticus.

1723
01:36:07,761 --> 01:36:08,804
She trained me.

1724
01:36:08,888 --> 01:36:10,598
Yes, that’s conflict of interest.

1725
01:36:10,681 --> 01:36:12,808
Your history with her
might impair your judgment.

1726
01:36:13,642 --> 01:36:14,643
Damn it, Adam.

1727
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:16,437
Watch your language, Caliente.

1728
01:36:17,563 --> 01:36:18,814
Sir, you saw the video.

1729
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:20,065
What are your thoughts?

1730
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:24,028
I agree with Adam.

1731
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:26,280
You and Attorney Miranda,

1732
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:28,324
you're too comfortable with each other.

1733
01:36:29,533 --> 01:36:34,038
Opposing counsels cannot have
a relationship with each other.

1734
01:36:34,663 --> 01:36:37,458
Before our client notices

1735
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:38,876
and complains,

1736
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:41,253
you're off the case, Matthew.

1737
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:45,007
Stand by.

1738
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:46,926
What is your message to Madison, Attorney?

1739
01:36:47,009 --> 01:36:48,677
Let your bravery

1740
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:52,598
and resilience inspire others

1741
01:36:53,807 --> 01:36:55,351
to come forward,

1742
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:59,021
to break the chains of silence,

1743
01:36:59,104 --> 01:37:01,357
and to reclaim their lives.

1744
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,816
No one,

1745
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,194
regardless of their relationship status,

1746
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:09,156
should have to endure such an ordeal.

1747
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,492
As a married man with a daughter,

1748
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:13,202
I am doing this

1749
01:37:13,285 --> 01:37:16,080
not only for the justice of one woman

1750
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:19,041
but for the countless victims

1751
01:37:19,124 --> 01:37:21,085
whose voices have been silenced,

1752
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:24,255
- whose pain has been trivialized,
- Fuck it.

1753
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:27,174
whose lives have changed forever.

1754
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:31,303
You are worse than my client.

1755
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:32,596
Starting today,

1756
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,515
I will be representing Madison in court.

1757
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:39,353
I stand by my husband

1758
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,105
in this battle.

1759
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:43,524
If you defend a rapist

1760
01:37:43,607 --> 01:37:45,609
you become an enabler.

1761
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:48,696
You are complicit in the crime.

1762
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:51,991
This is a reminder that we should strive

1763
01:37:52,074 --> 01:37:53,492
for a culture

1764
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:55,286
- Hello?
- where every woman

1765
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:58,622
Ms. A, we have a report
regarding Sharmaine Antonio.

1766
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:00,249
secured and respected.

1767
01:38:00,332 --> 01:38:03,085
Dance properly!

1768
01:38:03,168 --> 01:38:05,671
You, Gab!
You should be in the middle, Ali!

1769
01:38:05,754 --> 01:38:07,256
And you, Kisses.

1770
01:38:07,339 --> 01:38:09,466
Give it your best! Fix your posture.

1771
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:10,759
Is this the way
I taught you to perform?

1772
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:11,719
Grind your hips with sexiness!

1773
01:38:11,802 --> 01:38:14,138
How will you get customers
if you dance like that?

1774
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:15,931
Performance level!

1775
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:19,893
Sharmaine, my baby!

1776
01:38:20,853 --> 01:38:23,355
Hi. You're so pretty.

1777
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:26,525
Your regular customer is already here
Remember to do your job well.

1778
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:27,693
- Go.
- Leave it to me.

1779
01:38:27,776 --> 01:38:29,194
You can do it.

1780
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:31,280
- Dance properly.
- So annoying.

1781
01:38:31,363 --> 01:38:35,618
Spin around. Not like that.

1782
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,369
Excuse me.

1783
01:39:14,531 --> 01:39:15,699
So happy to see you again.

1784
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,785
- How are you?
- I’m doing well here.

1785
01:39:17,868 --> 01:39:19,119
You need something from me,

1786
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:21,246
but you made me
come all the way here instead.

1787
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:22,998
Excuse me, Attorney.

1788
01:39:23,707 --> 01:39:24,875
Attorney Miranda.

1789
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:27,002
Yes?

1790
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:30,798
Maybe you miss Atticus

1791
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:32,800
for nostalgia's sake?

1792
01:39:34,593 --> 01:39:37,054
Trust me, it's not nostalgia I feel.

1793
01:39:39,973 --> 01:39:42,434
Let’s proceed
to Attorney Guevarra’s office?

1794
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:44,687
Okay.

1795
01:39:45,187 --> 01:39:46,563
So, what do you think?

1796
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:51,276
No.

1797
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:53,487
Come on, Alexis.

1798
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:56,782
Attorney Lucero,

1799
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:59,493
we will not agree to a settlement.

1800
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,371
We will not pay your client.

1801
01:40:03,122 --> 01:40:05,916
I will prove that Zachary is innocent.

1802
01:40:05,999 --> 01:40:08,460
Even if he is not really innocent?

1803
01:40:10,796 --> 01:40:12,589
The judge will decide that.

1804
01:40:13,298 --> 01:40:14,383
And besides,

1805
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:20,097
I know of one rapist
who was not convicted.

1806
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,434
And he is even a practicing lawyer.

1807
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:28,897
See you in court,

1808
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:30,733
Attorney?

1809
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:45,831
Sharmaine Antonio?

1810
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:47,833
What do you need?

1811
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:51,920
Do you know me?

1812
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:59,678
You're the lawyer
of Madison's rapist, right?

1813
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:02,097
Why don't you testify?

1814
01:41:03,056 --> 01:41:05,184
You should be happy.

1815
01:41:05,684 --> 01:41:08,979
There's no witness against your client.

1816
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:12,608
I'm just wondering.

1817
01:41:14,276 --> 01:41:16,487
I already went with Madison to the police.

1818
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,739
Maybe that's enough, right?

1819
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:21,158
Are you afraid to speak in court?

1820
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:23,827
Is someone preventing you?

1821
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:28,707
What happened to Madison

1822
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:31,585
also happened to me and my coworkers.

1823
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,171
Each night we deal
with abuse and harassment.

1824
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:36,381
But did they hear anything from us?

1825
01:41:36,465 --> 01:41:38,091
Did we ever complain?

1826
01:41:40,844 --> 01:41:41,720
No.

1827
01:41:43,347 --> 01:41:45,390
Because we need to make money.

1828
01:41:46,433 --> 01:41:48,268
So we put up with it.

1829
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:53,899
Sharmaine, I don't want
to invalidate your feelings,

1830
01:41:53,982 --> 01:41:55,442
even though you and Madison

1831
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,110
went through different experiences.

1832
01:41:57,611 --> 01:41:58,946
It is definitely different.

1833
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:00,864
That Zach?

1834
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,115
He is her boyfriend.

1835
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:04,618
So why would she put him in jail?

1836
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:07,996
If Madison wants attention,

1837
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,500
if she wants
to make money out that incident,

1838
01:42:11,583 --> 01:42:12,876
it's her choice.

1839
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,378
As long as she doesn't drag me into it.

1840
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:15,921
I'm not like her.

1841
01:42:16,004 --> 01:42:18,006
I am not that lucky.

1842
01:42:18,924 --> 01:42:21,051
You see, I have bills to pay.

1843
01:42:21,927 --> 01:42:24,680
I need to pay rent, food,

1844
01:42:26,223 --> 01:42:28,058
and my sibling’s tuition fees.

1845
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:40,279
Criminal Case No. 82539.

1846
01:42:40,362 --> 01:42:42,823
For failure of the prosecution

1847
01:42:42,906 --> 01:42:44,700
to present sufficient evidence

1848
01:42:44,783 --> 01:42:48,161
to prove the guilt
of the accused beyond reasonable doubt,

1849
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:52,124
the accused, Zachary Chua,
is hereby acquitted.

1850
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:55,961
Joni, I'm acquitted!

1851
01:42:56,461 --> 01:42:57,629
Attorney, thank you.

1852
01:42:57,713 --> 01:42:59,089
- Congratulations, guys!
- I'm free!

1853
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:01,508
Very well done, team.

1854
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:04,595
Attorney, thank you very much
for your help.

1855
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:07,097
I will send the full payment
to your office immediately.

1856
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:08,640
Thank you very much.

1857
01:43:08,724 --> 01:43:10,058
Come on, let's take a picture.

1858
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:12,686
Congratulations, guys.
Let’s take a picture.

1859
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:13,812
Finally.

1860
01:43:13,896 --> 01:43:15,564
All right, stay there.

1861
01:43:31,204 --> 01:43:32,623
Hi, Math.

1862
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:34,041
You're here.

1863
01:43:38,253 --> 01:43:39,588
Congratulations.

1864
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,841
Good job.

1865
01:43:44,593 --> 01:43:45,719
Thank you.

1866
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:48,263
Let me carry your bag.

1867
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:55,771
What a day.

1868
01:43:58,523 --> 01:43:59,566
So...

1869
01:44:00,275 --> 01:44:02,235
When are you leaving Atticus?

1870
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:05,864
Effective immediately.

1871
01:44:10,118 --> 01:44:11,536
Where are you moving to?

1872
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:15,123
Well, me and my dad are okay now.

1873
01:44:15,624 --> 01:44:17,709
Wow, that's good.

1874
01:44:17,793 --> 01:44:19,044
Actually, he wants to make me a partner

1875
01:44:19,127 --> 01:44:21,004
in Caliente and Frio.

1876
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:22,965
But I said,

1877
01:44:23,048 --> 01:44:24,883
I can be a Head Associate first.

1878
01:44:24,967 --> 01:44:27,135
- I'm not ready for a higher position yet.
- No.

1879
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:29,346
You can do it.

1880
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:30,681
Look, I saw

1881
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:32,975
how you handled Madison's case.

1882
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:36,895
And you're more than ready.

1883
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:38,939
We still lost.

1884
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:42,401
It's not your fault.

1885
01:44:44,027 --> 01:44:46,405
It's all Adam's fault.

1886
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:48,407
Thank you for this.

1887
01:44:49,282 --> 01:44:51,118
I'm sorry, Papa.

1888
01:44:51,201 --> 01:44:52,703
I was only able to visit today.

1889
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:55,539
Someone came here the other day.

1890
01:44:55,622 --> 01:44:58,417
She said you sent her
and was asking for details.

1891
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,961
Yes, she’s my assistant.

1892
01:45:01,628 --> 01:45:04,006
She’s taking care of your bail.

1893
01:45:04,089 --> 01:45:06,299
I'm fine here.
It's just a waste of your money.

1894
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:09,136
Papa.

1895
01:45:09,761 --> 01:45:11,346
It's just money, Papa.

1896
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:14,266
What's important is for you to be free.

1897
01:45:14,349 --> 01:45:16,393
I have committed a crime.

1898
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:21,064
I have to suffer the consequences.

1899
01:45:23,275 --> 01:45:25,819
Can we be honest here?

1900
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:29,823
There are many guilty people

1901
01:45:29,906 --> 01:45:31,742
who don’t get punished.

1902
01:45:34,911 --> 01:45:36,204
There are so many people here

1903
01:45:36,288 --> 01:45:37,914
who are really innocent.

1904
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:40,000
I know that.

1905
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:42,711
My sentence is almost over.

1906
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,131
I will be free soon.

1907
01:45:47,299 --> 01:45:48,216
Papa.

1908
01:45:49,885 --> 01:45:51,720
The world is not fair.

1909
01:45:51,803 --> 01:45:53,346
Alexis,

1910
01:45:56,266 --> 01:45:57,601
we all make mistakes.

1911
01:45:57,684 --> 01:45:59,603
But it doesn't mean

1912
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:01,646
we are sinners.

1913
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:03,690
All mistakes

1914
01:46:05,108 --> 01:46:06,234
can be forgiven

1915
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:08,779
if we honestly accept our mistakes.

1916
01:46:08,862 --> 01:46:09,821
That...

1917
01:46:11,782 --> 01:46:13,533
That is where learning begins.

1918
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:18,747
That learning will make us

1919
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:21,208
become better people.

1920
01:46:32,302 --> 01:46:33,220
Madison.

1921
01:46:34,763 --> 01:46:35,680
Take a seat.

1922
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:37,182
Thank you.

1923
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:40,268
I ordered coffee for you.

1924
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:43,605
Attorney,

1925
01:46:43,688 --> 01:46:46,066
why do you want to talk to me?

1926
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:48,860
I'm sorry.

1927
01:46:51,696 --> 01:46:52,864
I'm sorry

1928
01:46:52,948 --> 01:46:55,033
I didn't win your case.

1929
01:46:56,326 --> 01:46:59,538
But, we can still do something about this.

1930
01:47:00,205 --> 01:47:02,082
I'm with another law firm, Madison.

1931
01:47:02,999 --> 01:47:04,793
And I want to help you.

1932
01:47:04,876 --> 01:47:07,003
We will file a petition

1933
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:09,506
for certiorari in the court of appeals.

1934
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:12,801
What happens when we do this?

1935
01:47:13,468 --> 01:47:14,970
If granted by the court,

1936
01:47:15,637 --> 01:47:17,722
the decision will be reversed.

1937
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,350
Zachary will go to jail.

1938
01:47:26,898 --> 01:47:28,150
Madison Valencia?

1939
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:29,109
Yes?

1940
01:47:29,192 --> 01:47:30,527
Documents for you.

1941
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:32,737
Who sent these?

1942
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:34,072
Please sign here.

1943
01:47:38,034 --> 01:47:39,161
Thank you.

1944
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:52,424
I think this is for you.

1945
01:48:07,606 --> 01:48:09,065
Attorney Miranda.

1946
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:11,860
I received some research,

1947
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:15,238
transcripts and recordings
of my case against Zachary.

1948
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:19,034
But until now,
I still don't know who sent them.

1949
01:48:20,243 --> 01:48:21,328
Was it you?

1950
01:48:24,956 --> 01:48:28,835
What is this?
An atonement for defending a criminal?

1951
01:48:31,004 --> 01:48:32,422
He really raped me.

1952
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,426
But why did you defend him?

1953
01:48:42,557 --> 01:48:46,436
Because for Zachary...

1954
01:48:48,313 --> 01:48:49,606
it wasn’t rape.

1955
01:48:51,691 --> 01:48:53,068
For him,

1956
01:48:55,278 --> 01:48:57,030
there was nothing wrong with what he did.

1957
01:49:00,617 --> 01:49:02,535
It is what it is, Madison.

1958
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:06,539
The court did not find enough evidence.

1959
01:49:06,623 --> 01:49:09,626
Is that why you are helping me
and Attorney Caliente?

1960
01:49:17,842 --> 01:49:20,512
I was like you in the past, Madison.

1961
01:49:23,807 --> 01:49:25,267
I fell in love.

1962
01:49:27,477 --> 01:49:28,770
I was kept hidden.

1963
01:49:28,853 --> 01:49:32,190
Adam and Kate are getting married.

1964
01:49:32,274 --> 01:49:33,900
I was somebody's secret.

1965
01:49:34,567 --> 01:49:35,819
And

1966
01:49:36,861 --> 01:49:38,196
he abused me.

1967
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:39,114
Adam!

1968
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:41,032
Enough!

1969
01:49:41,116 --> 01:49:43,952
- Stop!
- I loved somebody.

1970
01:49:44,035 --> 01:49:46,371
I trusted him, but...

1971
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,710
he violated me.

1972
01:49:51,793 --> 01:49:52,836
No!

1973
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:56,715
No!

1974
01:50:38,548 --> 01:50:40,050
So I know how you feel.

1975
01:50:41,217 --> 01:50:42,385
I was raped.

1976
01:50:51,936 --> 01:50:53,229
Did you tell anyone?

1977
01:51:01,112 --> 01:51:03,990
That was one of my biggest regrets.

1978
01:51:06,993 --> 01:51:08,536
I was scared.

1979
01:51:09,454 --> 01:51:11,039
I was embarrassed.

1980
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:15,251
But I realized...

1981
01:51:16,336 --> 01:51:18,546
why should I be embarrassed?

1982
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:22,675
Wasn't he the one at fault?

1983
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:27,555
Wasn't he the one who did something wrong?
Why should I be embarrassed?

1984
01:51:29,766 --> 01:51:31,267
He should be ashamed of himself.

1985
01:51:43,071 --> 01:51:46,491
I admire your courage, Madison.

1986
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:49,285
Good for you.

1987
01:51:50,787 --> 01:51:52,789
You did what I couldn't do.

1988
01:51:56,918 --> 01:51:58,837
So, you didn't get justice?

1989
01:52:01,381 --> 01:52:02,549
Legally?

1990
01:52:03,591 --> 01:52:04,717
No.

1991
01:52:07,053 --> 01:52:08,096
But,

1992
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:11,474
justice is not only obtained in court.

1993
01:52:40,545 --> 01:52:41,546
Come in, Sharmaine.

1994
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:07,924
Alexis?

1995
01:54:08,007 --> 01:54:09,050
Yes.

1996
01:54:09,133 --> 01:54:11,261
- Stop that.
- If not, then what?

1997
01:54:11,344 --> 01:54:12,220
I will sue you!

1998
01:54:12,303 --> 01:54:13,555
For what?

1999
01:54:13,638 --> 01:54:15,306
You did worse to me.

2000
01:54:17,016 --> 01:54:19,644
Do you remember
what you did to me that night?

2001
01:54:20,353 --> 01:54:21,229
Huh?

2002
01:54:23,356 --> 01:54:24,983
You raped me.

2003
01:54:26,317 --> 01:54:27,694
No one will believe you.

2004
01:54:27,777 --> 01:54:30,238
Nobody fucking gives a shit!

2005
01:54:34,409 --> 01:54:37,036
All I have to do is show this video.

2006
01:54:38,204 --> 01:54:39,706
And then your wife

2007
01:54:40,415 --> 01:54:42,417
and your father-in-law

2008
01:54:43,084 --> 01:54:46,421
will know the kind of man
that you truly are.

2009
01:54:46,504 --> 01:54:51,259
Disbarment. Grossly immoral conduct.

2010
01:54:53,261 --> 01:54:54,220
Alexis, please!

2011
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:55,471
I'm sorry!

2012
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:57,223
Alexis.

2013
01:54:57,765 --> 01:55:00,310
Don't ruin my life! Don't ruin my career!

2014
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:04,522
I'm sorry for what I did! Please!

2015
01:55:05,023 --> 01:55:05,982
Shit!

2016
01:55:06,065 --> 01:55:07,025
No!

2017
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:09,861
The Supreme Court
has unanimously disbarred

2018
01:55:09,944 --> 01:55:11,529
lawyer Adam Lucero

2019
01:55:11,613 --> 01:55:14,115
over his viral video scandal.

2020
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:21,831
- Thank you.
- Case closed.

2021
01:55:22,415 --> 01:55:25,835
You rant that I bring work on trips,

2022
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:27,211
but you are working right now.

2023
01:55:27,295 --> 01:55:28,588
So what does that mean?

2024
01:55:28,671 --> 01:55:30,381
Well, it means you will drive for me

2025
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:31,925
for a whole year.

2026
01:55:32,008 --> 01:55:33,760
If you want, even forever.

2027
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,021
Let's go.
