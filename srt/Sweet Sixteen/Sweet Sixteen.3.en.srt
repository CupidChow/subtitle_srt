don't worry about me.

194
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,180
What's wrong with Xiaotian?

195
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,700
I think he's pretty good.

196
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,700
Right, Xia Mu?

197
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,540
Oh, Xiaotian!

198
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,980
You're full of ideas!

199
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:25,980
Ya,

200
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,500
we grew up together.

201
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,740
I always thought that

202
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,340
I understood you the best.

203
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,020
To me,

204
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,780
you're the world's

205
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,300
most precious and intriguing mystery.

206
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,340
The one that's mine and mine alone.

207
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,900
I will care for and

208
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,620
understand you for the rest of my life.

209
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,180
Marry me!

210
00:10:51,060 --> 00:11:01,620
Say yes!

211
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,540
When I come back,

212
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,140
we'll get married.

213
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,700
