[Episode 9]

4
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,460
Let's talk.

5
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,380
There's nothing to talk about.

6
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,020
The baby!

7
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,940
Have you spoken to her?

8
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,020
About?

9
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,980
To abort the baby.

10
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:12,940
Why?

11
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,500
Do you want her to keep the child?

12
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,580
This child shouldn't exist!

13
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,820
It's up to her

14
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,420
whether to keep it or not.

15
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,460
Not you.

16
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,540
You want her to keep the child

17
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,780
and always be reminded of what happened?

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,660
The one who doesn't want to be reminded

19
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,780
is you.

20
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:31,900
I advise you

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,900
not to say anything to her.

22
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,780
Ya.

23
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,180
Xiaotian,

24
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,980
we should break up.

25
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,500
Why?

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
I don't care about anything.

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,660
I just want to be with you.

28
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,900
I'll take care of you
for the rest of your life!

29
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,020
Please.

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,980
You don't care

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,540
but I do.

32
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,660
It's not your fault.

33
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,180
I...

34
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,420
Ya, please don't.

35
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,700
Ya...

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,300
You deserve better.

37
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,620
I...

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,140
I'm really tired.

39
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,460
You should go.

[Qu Zhongshan,
Haide Enterprises' Chairman]

41
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:04,900
Dad,

42
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,460
why are you here?

43
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Before going overseas,

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,980
I came to see you.

45
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,820
Our company

46
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,020
doesn't tolerate
these kind of dirty matters.

47
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,580
Has the matter been resolved?

48
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,740
Yes.

49
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,860
There's not enough evidence

50
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,540
for a case.

51
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,220
Spending all your energy on a woman

52
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,380
and managing the company like this...

53
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,820
If your brother was here,

54
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,780
the company wouldn't be given
to someone useless like you!

55
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,340
Unfortunately,

56
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,580
he's no longer around.

57
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,900
I'll be away for six months.

58
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,780
If anything you do outside

59
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,500
affects the company,

60
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,580
I won't let it go.

61
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,780
Wait for me.

62
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,140
I'll go get a parcel.

63
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,620
Long time no see.

64
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,420
I heard Xiaotian has left.

65
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
None of your business.

66
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,420
How could it be none of my business?

67
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,460
Haven't you broken up?

68
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,980
Why don't you consider

69
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,300
being with me?

70
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,300
Your brother has a temper.

71
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,420
I'll leave.

72
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,300
But

73
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
the days are long.

74
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,100
I will be with Yawang

75
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,500
everyday for the rest of my life.

76
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,340
You are here.

77
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,700
This is the place I did it

78
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,580
with your Yawang.

79
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,900
Shut your mouth.

80
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,300
You want to go up against me?

81
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,580
Did you see what I sent you?

82
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,140
Did you like it?

83
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,460
Do you want to see something
more exciting?

84
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
If I put all these on the Internet,

85
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,860
it would be so exciting.

86
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,060
Xia Mu!

87
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:57,980
Mr. Qu,

you're awake.

89
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,820
Help me up.

90
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,700
Alright.

91
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,460
Here.

92
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:04,980
Be careful.

93
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,700
Here.

94
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,340
Be careful.

95
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,580
Call the family doctor.

96
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,620
What's my condition now?

97
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,820
Tell me.

98
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,420
Mr. Qu,

99
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,780
you are recovering well.

100
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,500
However, your internal organs
were injured in the attack.

101
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,300
You won't be able
to have children in the future.

102
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,260
Recovering?

103
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,500
This is called recovering?

Don't worry.
