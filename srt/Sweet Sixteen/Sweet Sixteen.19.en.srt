Mr. Qu,

5
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,020
your father

6
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,300

00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,340
What do we do now?

9
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,860
Our plan has been totally spoiled.

10
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,780
Most importantly, we don't know

11
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,540
where Ya is.

12
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,460
You're so stupid.

13
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,100
Qu Weiran has been home these few days.

14
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,100
She's probably there.

15
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,580
Then there's nothing to talk about.

16
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,900
There are so many security guards
at his place.

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,580
Breaking in is difficult for us.

18
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,100
He could easily accuse us
of trespassing.

19
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,780
Look at Qu Weiran.

20
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,500
Looks like he's totally prepared

21
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
for us to fall into his trap.

22
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,860
If we call the police...

23
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,300
I'm not trying to be a jinx.

24
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,420
I think he has a way

25
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,860
to move her out.

26
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,580
So,

27
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,100
we have to lure him out

28
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,660
and catch him off-guard.

29
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,340
That's the only way
we can go in to look for her.

30
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,820
How?

31
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,420
How?

32
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,380
I have a plan.

Hello?

34
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,340
Is this Mr. Xia Mu?

35
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,260
Go ahead and do it.

36
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,460
We're here.

37
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,660
Wait for me to come back.

00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,900
I'm here to send you off.

44
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,540
So you were all lying to me.

The sun will eventually set.

46
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,860
At that time, I intended
to pass on the company to your father

47
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,100
and even set up a suitable marriage
for him.

48
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,340
However, he gave up everything
for your mother

49
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,260
and even left the family.

50
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,340

Qu Weiran

53
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,940
would have killed me.

54
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,500
You can't handle him either?

55
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,820
I used to think I understood him well.

56
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,260
I didn't know that

57
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,380
he had done so many horrible things.

58
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,260
By the time I found out,

59
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,060
there was nothing much
I could do either.

60

61

65

So are you planning

66
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,140
to continue pretending?

67
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,460
Of course not.

68
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,820
I'm just doing this to confuse him.

69

71

72
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,340
I will protect you too.

73

if you're not going to give Haide to me,

86
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,620
are you going to give it
to your ex-convict grandson?
