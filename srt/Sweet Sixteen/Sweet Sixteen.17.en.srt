[Episode 17]

4
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,380
Yawang,

5
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,500
aren't you happy

6
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,500
to be home again?

7
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,500
Who would be happy
after being brought here

8
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,460
in this way?

9
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,660
Mr. Qu, you really
haven't changed at all.

10
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,380
I'm indeed

11
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,100
not a very good person.

12
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,900
Qu Weiran,

13
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,820
actually to a certain extent,

14
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,860
we are the same.

15
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,900
Yawang,

16
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,860
to let Xia Mu take everything from me,

17
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,740
you've been lying to me.

18
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,420
Actually, all those things

19
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,140
are not as important to me as you think.

20
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,900
After all, you once carried my child.

21
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,420
Qu Weiran,

22
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,540
you're doomed.

23
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,180
If such a day comes,

24
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,500
you can come with me.

25
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,220
Alright?

26
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,260
Why is her car key here?

27
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,660
Xia Mu!

28
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,340
I've searched everywhere.

29
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,300
Qu Weiran must have taken her.

30
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,460
Why did he kidnap her?

31
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,020
Qu Weiran has a larger plan

32
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,060
which he has planned perfectly.

33
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,980
We have no evidence,

34
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,300
so we need to handle this with care.

35
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,460
Mr. Xia Mu,

36
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,940
my boss, Mr. Qu,

37
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,540
would like to invite you
for a chat at his place.

38
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,660
Okay,

39
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,740
let me get my coat.

40
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,180
Please do.

41
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:37,900
Who is it?

42
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,180
Qu Weiran's guy.

43
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,700
I'll go along for now.

44
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,220
Wait for my update.

45
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,140
Welcome.

46
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,700
I've been waiting for you.

47
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,540
Where's Shu Yawang?

48
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,140
Shouldn't she be with you?

49
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,340
Why?

50
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,860
Have you been abandoned so soon?

51
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,260
Where is she?

52
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,300
Maybe she knows some things

53
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,580
and left you deliberately.

54
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,580
That's okay.

55
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,580
I'll be kind and fill you in.

56
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,860
Do you know why

57
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,740
I targeted Shu Yawang?

58
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,860
Isn't it because of Tang Xiaotian?

59
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,860
It's because of you.

60
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,740
Actually, you should

61
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,980
call me Uncle.

62
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,500
Do you remember that car accident
when you were young?

63
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,380
Did you really think it was an accident?

64
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,300
I didn't expect you to survive it

65
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,740
and get adopted by the Shu Family.

66
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,300
His parents died in the car accident.

67
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,940
Dad...

68
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,660
Mom...

69
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,260
Fortunately, the little girl's family

70
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,100
saved him.

71
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,660
What a pity.

72
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,740
Mom...

73
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,500
Don't be afraid.

74
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,420
I'll be here

75
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,500
with you.

76
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,780
If Shu Yawang knows

77
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,500
everything that happened to her

78
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,860
was because of you,

79
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,940
will she hate you

80
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,180
for ruining her life?

81
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,380
Maybe that's why

82
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,140
she wanted to leave you.

83
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,700
She won't.

84
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,780
You will never understand

85
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,300
what love is.

86
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,580
You've never received

87
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,260
love.

88
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,780
What a pity.

89
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,060
She's not here with me now.

90
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,540
Visiting hours are over.

91
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,940
Are you going to force your way in?

92
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,140
Then you may never see her again.

93
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,100
Shu Yawang!

94
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,220
Be strong.

95
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,940
I'll come back for you.

96
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,980
Dad,

97
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,460
are you used to living here?

98
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,780
Today, I have good news

99
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,940
and bad news.

100
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,860
Which do you want to hear first?

101
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,300
Good news?

102
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,020
I found your son.

103
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,140
Unfortunately, he's dead.

104
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,900
Guess who killed him?

105
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,380
But the bad news is

106
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,940
I'll make sure your grandson

107
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,660
gets what's coming to him.
