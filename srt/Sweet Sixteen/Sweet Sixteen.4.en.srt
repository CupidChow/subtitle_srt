00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,300
Xiaotian,

5
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,660
let's work hard together!

6
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:55,900
Mr. Qu,

7
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,780
you wanted to see me?

8
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,540
Yawang,

9
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,500
loosen up a bit.

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,980
You're the boss after all.

11
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,780
Congratulations on joining us.

12
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,900
I look forward to your good work.

13
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:18,980
Thank you, Mr. Qu.

14
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,300
I'll work hard!

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,780
Go for it.

16
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,140
I'll get back to work.

17
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,300
Alright.

18
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,020
If the oldest son
hadn't passed away so early,

19
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,780
he wouldn't be where he is today.

20
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,980
He's an illegitimate child.

21
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,700
Why is he so arrogant?

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,220
Exactly.

23
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,220
But he's pretty good-looking.

24
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,180
What kind of relationship
do you think the new girl has with him?

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,540
Who knows?

26
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,300
Do you think

27
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,380
the oldest son's death...

28
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,980
That's what happens in movies.

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,300
They're talking about me.

30
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,660
Holding such a high position,

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,260
I'm bound to attract
all sorts of rumors.

32
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,060
Don't worry about it.

33
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,260
I won't.

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,300
Instead of staying in the past,

35
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,380
we should look to the future.

36
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,140
You have such a bright future ahead.

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,780
Many people can't attain it
even if they want it.

38
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,500
Weiran,

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,580
I'll go do my work now.

40
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,540
Okay.

41
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,500
Xia Mu.

42
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,980
What brings you here?

43
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,940
Just came to pick you up.

44
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,460
I'm in a skirt.

45
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,860
I'll go get a cab.

46
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,940
Xia Mu, the meal is ready.

47
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,300
Are you avoiding me?

48
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,260
Do you want to know?

49
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,860
Yes.

50
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,820
Xia Mu.

51
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,260
I'll say this once.

52
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,740
You're very important to me

53
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,620
but only as my family.

54
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,900
My brother.

55
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,540
I've never been your brother.

56
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,900
I've never treated you like my sister.

57
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,100
Don't you ever say that again!

58
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,020
You're doing this

59
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,420
because of Tang Xiaotian, right?

60
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,940
It's not just because of him.

61
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,460
What about Mom?

62
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,260
You don't have to feel awkward.

63
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,180
I'll go.

64
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,860
This is your graduation gift.

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,740
I wanted to give it to you that day.

[Case File]

67
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,540
Yawang.

68
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,900
Mr. Qu?

69
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,580
What is it, Mr. Qu?

70
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,500
Well,

71
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,660
tomorrow

72
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,380
there's a company dinner

73
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,460
but I need to bring a female date.

74
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,380
Can I have the honor?

75
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:33,780
I...

76
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,980
I don't think I can.

77
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,660
Since you're new to this,

78
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,900
meeting more people isn't a bad plan.

79
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,660
You should know

80
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,500
that in my position,

81
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,260
it's hard to trust others.

82
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,900
You're Xiaotian's girlfriend

83
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,180
so I think I can trust you.

84
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,060
I...

85
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,020
It's okay.

86
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,060
Let's see how it goes tomorrow.

87
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,140
I'll give you a lift home.

88
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:07,980
No need.

89
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,100
I can go home on my own.

90
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,020
I'll think about it

91
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,940
and let you know tomorrow.

92
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,100
Okay.

93
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,500
See you tomorrow.

94
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,340
See you tomorrow.

95
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,420
There's something

96
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,140
I want to discuss with you.

97
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,140
What is it, honey?

98
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,580
Well...

99
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,180
Your senior, Qu Weiran,

100
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,420
told me today that there's some

101
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,420
business dinner
and he needs a female date.

102
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,380
A female date?

103
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,780
I remember he mentioned it to me before.

104
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,820
I thought

105
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,860
you should decide for yourself.

106
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,780
I asked him to reach out
to you directly.

107
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:48,900
What do you think?

108
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,260
I've improved, right?

109
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,620
I learned not to make decisions for you.

110
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,740
Fine, you're the best.

111
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,020
Tang Xiaotian!

112
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,220
Tang Xiaotian!

113
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,540
What?

114
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,300
What are you doing?

115
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,340
We're waiting for you!

116
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,220
Alright!

117
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,700
You're irritating.

118
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,940
I'm talking to my wife!

119
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,060
Alright,

120
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:04,940
my classmate...

121
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,740
Alright, go and have fun.

122
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,340
Go!

123
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,180
Yawang,

124
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,700
thank you for coming.

125
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,460
Not at all, Mr. Qu.

126
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,620
This is my job.

127
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,580
Every guest will have this.

128
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:38,860
Don't be afraid.

129
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,580
Just follow me.

130
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,580
Let's go.

131
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,580
Come on.

132
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,620
Mr. Qu, cheers.

133
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,620
Let's work well together.

134
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,180
Mr. Qu.

135
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,940
Long time no see, Mr. Qu.

136
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,900
Why aren't you drinking?

137
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,300
I'm not much of a drinker.

138
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,940
Have something to eat.

139
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,060
Thank you.

140
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,420
I...

141
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,780
I'll leave first, Mr. Qu.

142
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,500
I can't help much here.

143
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,620
Stay with me a while longer.

144
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,340
How about this?

145
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,620
Take another drink

146
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,620
and say bye to everyone

147
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,780
then I'll send you home.
