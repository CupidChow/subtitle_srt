[Episode 14]

4
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,820
I'm curious

5
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,420
how far you're willing

6
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,020
to go for him.

7
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,300
We're two different people.

8
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,340
Based on your current status,

9
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,420
why would you bother
about an unknown person like him?

10
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,420
Besides, he's been punished.

11
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,020
Compared to what happened to me,

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,900
that punishment is nothing.

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,260
So what if he was jailed for four years?

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,020
Mr. Qu,

15
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,500
I'll drink this.

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,420
I apologize to you on his behalf.

17
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,260
Yawang,

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,580
as long as you're willing to
return to my side,

19
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,580
I'll let him off.

20
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,420
If I said

21
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,700
I wanted both him and freedom,

22
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,220
what would you choose?

23
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,740
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,340
I'm very greedy.

25
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,420
Hello, Dad?

26
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,420
You hired that woman?

27
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,580
Rita is working with us

28
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,580
as a designer.

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,940
I don't care about the two of you

30
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,580
but you should know

31
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,780
it's not up to you whether you can

32
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,420
take Haide from me.

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,020
Be aware of your status and position!

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,620
I know.

35
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,100
Ya,

36
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,460
long time no see.

37
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,460
How have you been?

38
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,980
Great.

39
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:55,740
I...

40
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,460
Tang Xiaotian.

41
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,820
Why did you come over
without telling me?

42
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,420
Rita.

43
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,700
They're all waiting for you
in the meeting room.

44
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,860
You should head there first.

45
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,420
It's not good to keep everyone waiting.

46
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Tang Xiaotian,

47
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,300
stop looking.

48
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,260
She's married.

49
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,580
Married?

50
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,660
Didn't she marry your best friend?

51
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,940
My best friend?

52
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,460
She's the lady boss of Haide.

53
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,380
You mean...

54
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,740
Qu Weiran?

55
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,660
He's upstairs.

56
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,260
We're having a meeting with Haide.

57
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,820
Shu Yawang is their design director.

58
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,500
Annie, you go ahead.

59
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,940
I'm going back now.

60
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,860
The hard drive containing
all the design proposals

61
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,060
was handed over yesterday.

62
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,140
What hard drive?

63
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,060
Did you receive it?

64
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,100
I'm sorry, Miss Annie.

65
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,580
When we handed it in yesterday,

66
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,660
there was an acknowledgment slip.

67
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,340
I said we didn't receive it.

68
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,700
There were also cameras around
during the handover.

69
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,180
Are there?

70
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,260
Miss Annie,

71
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,780
why don't we talk outside?

72
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
No need.

73
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,100
Anything you want to say
can be said here.

74
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,020
You just want to tell me

75
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,820
Rita is your wife

76
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
and won't do anything
that will harm this project.

77
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,860
Right?

78
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,700
Miss Annie,

79
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,300
this is my personal matter.

80
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,180
There's no need to bring it out
in public like this, right?

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,700
You want to protect her?

82
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,380
You have no evidence

83
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,100
that Rita lost the hard drive.

84
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,740
Right?

85
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,820
If it wasn't her,

86
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,700
did the hard drive just walk away?

87
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,460
Are you trying
to pull a magic trick on me?

88
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,060
Until that hard drive turns up,

89
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,860
Rita can't go on with this project.

90
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,100
Maybe after I leave,

91
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,900
the hard drive will be found.

92
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,540
You're back.

93
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,180
Why are you so early today?

94
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,060
Did someone upset you?

95
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,700
Haide and Annie's company
are collaborating.

96
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,780
Yesterday

97
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,140
we handed

98
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,660
over the hard drive to them as agreed

99
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,020
but Annie said she didn't receive them.

100
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,260
If I can't find that hard drive

101
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,020
I have to leave Haide.

102
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,500
Is it so important for you

103
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,060
to stay at Qu Weiran's company?

104
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
I need to see someone.

105
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,260
So, I need to stay at Haide.

106
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,140
Where's the hard drive?

107
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,340
What hard drive?

108
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,380
Listen,

109
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,380
I've been arrested before.

110
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,180
I'm not afraid of being arrested again.

111
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,420
So, give it to me.

112
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,340
Let go!

113
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,100
Give me the hard drive.

114
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,620
It's not with me.

115
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,940
Why are you setting her up?

116
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,140
She can play around

117
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,540
with you and Qu Weiran.

118
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,780
Leave Xiaotian out of it.

119
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,220
I'm warning you.

120
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,780
Don't mess with her.

121
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,140
Where did you get it?

122
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,420
Take a look first.

123
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,460
Don't do such risky things again!

124
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,740
Is this the one?

125
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,460
This is not what I gave them.

126
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,620
Don't worry.

127
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,220
What a rare visitor.

128
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,380
Are you going to
invite us to your wedding?

129
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,020
Return me the hard drive.

130
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,300
Xiaotian,

131
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,500
leave the room.

132
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,540
He can't leave.

133
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,060
What are you trying to do?

134
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,180
Give me the hard drive.

135
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,060
It's not with me.

136
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,860
Why are you setting her up?

137
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,660
I just don't like her!

138
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,660
She can play around

139
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,860
with you and Qu Weiran.

140
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,220
