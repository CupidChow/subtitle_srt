[Episode 8]

4
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,540
What are you looking for?

5
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,940
My portfolio.

6
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,340
Why are you looking for it?

7
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,820
Here, drink this.

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,540
For you.

9
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,100
You...

10
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,140
want to look for a job?

11
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,140
Yeah.

12
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,900
It's time for me to start over.

13
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,780
Why are you in such a rush?

14
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,180
You should rest for a while more.

15
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,820
Mom, you don't get it.

16
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,980
I have to get busy
in order to get better.

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,060
Let's not talk about work first.

18
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,620
Here.

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,540
Drink this.

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,420
I think it's a good idea.

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:40,980
Here.

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,180
Drink it.

23
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,820
Just a little.

24
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,900
It's so bitter!

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,060
Why are you still like a child?

26
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,100
You keep complaining medicine is bitter.

27
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,740
Wait,

28
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,100
when I took medicine in the past,

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,140
you always gave me a sweet.

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,140
You don't give me any now.

31
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,340
What a kid.

32
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,860
Fine, fine.

33
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,660
I'll prepare sweets for you next time.

34
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,460
I'll hold you to it!

35
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,940
You have to give me sweets next time!

36
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:10,900
Hurry.

37
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,220
Oh my.

38
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,420
Thank you.

39
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,660
Okay!

40
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,220
Xia Mu!

41
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:28,940
What are you trying to do?

42
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,020
You beast!

43
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,380
You'll pay for this!

44
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,460
Mrs. Shu,

45
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,580
it was a consensual relationship.

46
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,420
Mom!

47
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,580
Ya,

48
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,620
can I offer an incense for Mrs. Shu?

49
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,260
Mom...

50
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,340
I'm sorry.

51
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,980
I miss you.

52
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,780
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

53
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,180
Shu Yawang,

54
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:33,980
what's wrong?

55
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,820
Are you alright?

56
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,780
Shu Yawang's mother has passed away.

57
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,540
Got it.

58
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,620
Patient's name is Shu Yawang, right?

59
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,780
Yes.

60
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,580
That's me.

61
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,540
Don't you know
that you can't let your emotions

62
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,380
fluctuate too much?

63
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,580
What's wrong with me?

64
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,180
