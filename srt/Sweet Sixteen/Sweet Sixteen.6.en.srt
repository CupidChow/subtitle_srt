[Episode 6]

4
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,820
You should go.

5
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,660
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

6
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,100
Tang Xiaotian, are you crazy?

7
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,340
Xia Mu, I'm warning you.

8
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,740
Stay away from Ya.

9
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,580
You're her brother!

10
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,620
It's not what you think.

11
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,460
Do you know?

12
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,020
If it wasn't for you,

13
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,460
she would never have met Qu Weiran.

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,420
Stop it.

15
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,700
Let him go!

16
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,260
Why are you here?

17
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,540
I was worried about you

18
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,140
so I followed you secretly.

19
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,180
Let's go.

20
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,860
Come with me.

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,940
Stay out of my matters.

22
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:45,940
Tang Xiaotian!

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,020
Let's talk.

24
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,180
Okay.

25
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,220
I envy you both.

26
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,100
I support you.

27
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,460
This way I can be with Xiaotian.

28
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,500
Ya,

29
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,100
can you tell me

30
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,460
what happened that day?

31
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,340
Is it that dinner...

32
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,500
Sorry, I...

33
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,780
It's my fault. I'm sorry, Ya.

34
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,460
I...

35
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,260
Xiaotian.

36
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,340
I really want to say it's not your fault

37
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,620
but I can't.

38
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,780
These few days I've been wishing

39
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,900
that I never met him.

40
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,180
I'm tired.

41
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,940
You should go.

42
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,100
I'm not leaving, Ya.

43
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,300
I can't leave you.

44
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,780
I'm not going.

45
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,620
Let them be.

46
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,860
They can't do much anyway.

47
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,180
Qu Weiran!

48
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,140
Qu Weiran!

49
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,620
Why did you do that!

50
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,100
Tell me!

51
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,140
Tell me!

52
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,220
I treated you like a brother,

53
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,460
how could you do such a thing to Ya!

54
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,260
Are you even human?

55
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,020
Tell me!

56
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,460
Why did you do that!

57
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,500
Tell me!

58
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,460
Believe it or not, I will kill you!

59
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,540
Aren't you the one

60
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,260
who asked me
to take care of your Yawang?

61
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,500
Right?

62
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,780
It's just a woman.

63
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,740
You jerk!

64
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,220
Since you can't protect
your own girlfriend,

65
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,420
then I'll help you.

66
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,100
Qu Weiran!

67
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,500
I'm going to kill you!

68
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,700
I'm going to kill you.

69
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,180
I'm going to kill you.

70
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,300
Everything Yawang has today

71
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,260
is all thanks to you.

72
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,860
She should be very thankful toward you.

73
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,180
If I hadn't asked Qu Weiran to help

74
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,180
Ya get into Haide...

75
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,100
If I hadn't gone overseas to study

76
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,500
and stayed by Ya's side...

77
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,860
If I had stopped Ya from going

78
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,500
when we were on the phone that day...

79
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,620
My cowardice caused this.

80
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,140
I don't deserve her forgiveness.

81
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,260
Drink some milk and get some sleep.

82
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,060
Xia Mu.

83
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,460
Ask him to go.

84
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,460
Okay.

85
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,260
You should go.

86
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:20,980
If you stay here,

87
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,260
you'll just make her feel worse.

88
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,500
It's my fault.

89
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,340
I brought this upon her.

90
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,820
But I want to stay here with her.

91
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,220
She's the one who wants you to go.

92
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,980
I'm sorry, I really didn't know.

93
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:38,860
Go.

94
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,580
You're not asleep yet?

95
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,660
Mom.

96
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,140
I heard Xiaotian's back.

97
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,860
He knows about it?

98
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,500
What did he say?

99
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,220
It's fine.

100
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,140
In the future,

101
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,220
no matter if you're with Xiaotian,

102
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,620
or with anyone else in the future,

103
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,340
as long as you like him,

104
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,140
I'll support you.

105
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,580
Otherwise,

106
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,660
I'll work harder

107
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,100
and make myself stronger

108
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,380
to take care of you
for the rest of your life.

109
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,900
You still have to
take care of me next time.

110
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,340
I'll be by your side.
