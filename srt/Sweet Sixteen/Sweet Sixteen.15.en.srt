[Episode 15]

4
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,300
Ya...

5
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:55,980
Tang Xiaotian!

6
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,140
You're hitting me after all
the horrible things you've done?

7
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,300
Horrible things?

8
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,540
You want to hear
details of horrible things?

9
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,940
Four years ago,

10
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,860
a horrible person like me

11
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,580
was supposed to marry her first love

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,700
but was sexually assaulted by Qu Weiran.

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,580
As a result, my mother passed away,

14
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,540
my brother went to jail,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,180
and I even got pregnant,

16
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,100
so I was forced to marry that scum.

17
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,100
Was that story exciting?

18
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,100
I hope I can see that hard drive soon.

19
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,140
Let's go.

20
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:04,860
Honey.

21
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,860
I'm just like one of those evil women

22
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,180
they portray in dramas, right?

23
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,220
Wipe your tears.

24
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,260
I didn't really want to
get Shu Yawang in trouble.

25
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,180
I didn't know about what happened.

26
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,620
I thought she was a married woman

27
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,820
who was also messing around

28
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,420
with her brother.

29
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,180
I didn't want her getting close to you.

30
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,100
Honey,

31
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,300
we've been together for four years.

32
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,780
You're the one who

33
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,460
was with me at my darkest time.

34
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,220
I know what kind of person you are.

35
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,500
It's fine.

36
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,020
I've thought it through.

37
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,620
You should go to her.

38
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,420
Wait for me here.

39
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,740
Okay?

40
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,180
Your usual?

41
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,820
Usual?

42
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,380
Yes, my usual.

43
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,900
Thank you.

44
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,140
After so many years,

45
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,460
I'm not sure if
your tastes have changed.

46
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,300
I ordered the same thing,

47
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,860
milk pudding.

48
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,500
I haven't been here in a long time too.

49
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,540
It still looks the same
after renovation.

50
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,940
It hasn't changed much.

51
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,940
We're the ones who changed.

52
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,900
Ya,

53
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,620
this time

54
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,780
I'm really saying goodbye.

55
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,340
I've had a lot of regrets

56
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,220
about you.

57
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,380
If I had never met Qu Weiran,

58
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,540
or been so careless,

59
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,420
maybe things would be different.

60
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,220
But I know there's nothing
we can do about it.

61
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,060
Ya, do you know?

62
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,380
The period after we broke up

63
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,180
was the darkest period

64
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,740
of my life.

65
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,900
It was Annie

66
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,380
who helped me out of it.

67
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,740
I'm very thankful to her

68
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,020
but even until this day,

69
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,220
I can't voice out my guilt

70
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,300
toward you...

71
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,820
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,740
Actually,

73
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,700
after so many years,

74
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,380
I've been repeating one thing to myself.

75
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,780
Today, I want to tell you too.

76
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,620
Okay.

77
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,020
We should move on.

78
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,860
Yes.

79
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,220
Move on.

80
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,420
Don't look back.

81
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,540
You too.

82
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,580
Don't miss out on anyone

83
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,540
who truly loves you.

84
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,100
There are some things
we haven't settled.

85
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,780
I don't want to hurt him.

86
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,460
Ya,

87
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,260
don't hesitate.

88
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,940
If you like him, tell him.

89
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,220
I wish you the best.

90
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,060
I wish you the best.

91
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,660
I wish you the best.

92
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:22,900
Try it.

93
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,860
Eat.

94
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,900
I wonder if the boss' cooking
has changed.

95
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,260
Are you asleep,

96
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,260
honey?

97
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,980
Ya brought dessert home for Xia Mu.

98
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,260
Do you want to get up
and have some supper?

99
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,620
I thought you weren't coming back.

100
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,460
How could that be?

101
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,740
What are you saying?

102
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,060
We're preparing for our wedding.

103
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,500
Were you asleep?

104
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,980
I fell asleep waiting for you.

105
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,780
Here.

106
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,060
What is this?

107
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,740
Mung bean soup.

108
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,980
Is your allergy to mango hereditary?

109
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,580
I think my dad was allergic too.

110
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,660
Do you still remember them?

111
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,220
From what I remember,

112
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,380
they were good people.

113
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,260
Do you know?

114
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,420
My dad married my mom
without his family knowing.

115
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,500
I didn't spend
much time with my dad,

116
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,380
but

117
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,260
he was good to us.

118
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,260
Have you ever considered

119
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,100

of having another family?
