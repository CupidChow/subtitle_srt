00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,380
[Episode 18]

4
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,180
I haven't been so happy in so long,

5
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,020
Dad.

6
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,820
Back then, Liu Peigang

7
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,380
got someone to add mango extracts

8
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,660
into my brother's water.

9
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,900
When he was driving,

10
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,580
he had an allergic reaction

11
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,140
and got into a tragic accident.

12
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,980
I collected all the evidence
at the scene.

13
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,500
That's why you couldn't find him

14
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,060
even after so many years.

15
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,100
You must be very happy now, right?

16
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,260
But don't worry.

17
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,100
You can't be happier than me.

18
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,820
Don't worry.

19
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,100
I will make sure

20
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,340
you live a long life.

21
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,660
Thank you.

22
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,380
Have you thought about
leaving Qu Weiran?

23
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,540
Shu Yawang is at his house, right?

24
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,780
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,100
Sorry?

26
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,940
Everything that happened to Shu Yawang

27
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,020
was because of me

28
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,460
but you felt guilty for so many years.

29
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,060
What do you mean?

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,700
The elder Mr. Qu is my grandfather.

31
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,300
No wonder Qu Weiran

32
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,740
has a grudge against your parents.

33
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,460
Ya had asked

34
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,900
Annie and me to look for someone

35
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,180
that...

36
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,260
was related to

37
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,940
the car accident you were in back then.

38
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,900
This person has been found.

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,300
Maybe

40
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,620
we can use him as a witness

41
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,780
to make a deal with Qu Weiran.

42
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,140
Mr. Xia Mu,

43
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,100
I'm the elder Mr. Qu's assistant.

44
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,980
He wishes to see you.

45
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,220
If you didn't object to my parents,

46
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,180
they wouldn't have been hiding

47
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,740
overseas and gotten into that accident.

48
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,540
And...

49
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,220
maybe we would still be a family.

50
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,860
Unfortunately, we can't change the past.

51
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,180
This is my first

52
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,260
and last

53
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,220
time seeing you.

54
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,940
Yawang,

55
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,020
I'm really happy today.

56
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,180
Don't I owe you a wedding?

57
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,220
I've prepared everything today.

58
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,300
Be good.

59
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,300
Go and put the wedding dress on.

60
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,940
Mr. Qu,

61
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
the dress is torn.

62
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,060
We prepared a traditional dress.

63
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,660
Are you doing this on purpose?

64
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,540
Don't you want me to change?

65
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,620
I can do it now.

66
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,900
I need two of them to help me.

67
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,740
Go on.

68
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,300
Miss Shu,

69
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,460
how can we help you?

70
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,720
[Xia Mu: The witness is with us.
Release Shu Yawang, or face jail.]

[Liu Peigang]

72
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,540
I have one last thing for you to do.

73
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,340
You've worked so hard

74
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,220
all these years.

75
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,780
Did Qu Weiran lie to us?

76
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,540
He doesn't dare to come?

77
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,940
His life is in our hands.

78
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,900
He'll come.

79
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,820
Why is it you?

80
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,820
Are you surprised?

81
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,140
I was the one
who planned the car accident.

82
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,380
It had nothing to do with my boss.

83
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
I've turned myself in.

84
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,300
