[Episode 13]

4
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,900
I believe Mr. Qu
and your excellent partner

5
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,980
will be able to do it.

6
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,380
Otherwise, there will be no reason
for us to collaborate.

7
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,020
Okay.

8
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,180
Three days.

9
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,540
I wish you success then.

10
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,780
Excuse me,

11
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,340
Miss Annie.

12
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,020
Mr. Qu, you're here as I expected.

13
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,780
You've never changed
the way you do things.

14
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,540
I said what I needed to.

15
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,460
What else would we need to talk about?

16
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,500
I've made things clear.

17
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,660
Miss Annie, you've misunderstood.

18
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,740
Actually...

19
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,980
Did I let you sit?

20
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,540
In three days,

21
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,060
we'll give you the best proposal.

22
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,420
I heard you're about to get married.

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,860
I'm here to congratulate you.

24
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,700
Mr. Qu, have a seat.

25
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,940
You're indeed well-informed.

26
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,860
Are you planning
to prepare a big gift for me?

27
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,540
That's for sure.

28
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,740
Your fiance, Tang Xiaotian

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,420
is my best friend.

30
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,140
Really?

31
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,900
How close are you

32
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,660
that he's never mentioned you?

33
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,500
It's unavoidable that friends

34
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,820
have some misunderstandings.

35
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,620
I heard you like to drink strong liquor.

36
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,140
This bottle has
an 80 percent alcohol content.

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,380
You should try it.

38
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,060
Actually,

39
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,300
I don't have a problem
with your proposal.

40
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,940
You just don't like

41
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,180
our design director,

42
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,780
right?

43
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,900
I'll get straight to the point then.

44
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,580
If you replace her,

45
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,580
we can collaborate.

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,820
Thank you for your kind intentions.

47
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,420
However, I won't replace
our design director.

48
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,700
She's just a designer.

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,860
You don't have to

50
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,460
let her affect
such an important collaboration, right?

51
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,900
She's my wife.

52
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,300
We got married four years ago.

53
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,540
Your fallout with Xiaotian
was because of this?

54
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:47,980
Miss Annie,

55
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,620
I can assure you

56
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,900
the two of them are over.

57
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,100
You don't have

58
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,580
to worry about this at all.

59
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,260
I must give you some respect, then.

60
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,980
A gentle reminder.

61
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,060
It appears your wife
may have another suitor as well.

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,740
Thank you.

63
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,500
Do you not like this alcohol?

64
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,660
Why are you here?

65
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,780
Making sure I study?

66
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,300
It's your first day of school.

67
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,540
I have to come and reward you.

68
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,300
Let's go.

69
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
Alright, look here!

70
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,580
Eat.

71
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,300
This is your way

72
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,580
of rewarding me?

73
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,860
You want a feast?

74
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,980
Then you have to do well.

75
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,580
Step by step.

76
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,180
Our store's 18th anniversary!

77
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,260
20 percent off for couples
who take a photo.

78
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,980
Why don't you take part?

79
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,020
Sir,

80
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,540
you already know us.
Why not just give us the discount?

81
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,100
Just take the photo...

82
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,260
Alright, here!

83
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,300
Look here.

84
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,380
Three,

85
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,060
two,

86
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,700
one!

87
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,260
I'll do it.

88
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,740
You...

89
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,620
Are you alright?

90
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,420
I'm fine.

91
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,340
I...

92
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,340
I've been eating light lately,

93
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,860
so I'm

94
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,580
craving something

95
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,820
more flavorful.

96
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,500
I'm full.

97
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,020
I'm going to work.

98
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,180
I'm going to be late.

99
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,500
Wait.

100
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,900
I need to go to the bookstore.

101
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,060
Can you give me a lift?

102
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,500
Be careful.

103
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,060
Bye.

104
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,100
Mr. Qu, how can I help you?

105
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,060
Nothing much.

106
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,500
You thought of a brand new proposal
within three days,

107
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,860
so I wanted to reward you with a meal.

108
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,740
No need.

109
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,580
This is my job.

110
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,300
Let's talk about Xia Mu.

111
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,820
Mr. Qu,

112
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,780
you forgot I don't drink?

113
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,860
Yawang,

114
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,740
four years ago,

115
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,140
you were willing to marry me
because of him.

116
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,060
Today,

117
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,260
you're willing to eat with me
because of him.

118
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,060
I'm curious

119
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,780
how far you're willing

120
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,060
to go for him.
