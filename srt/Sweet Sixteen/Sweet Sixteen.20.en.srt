00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,300
Mom,

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,580
Qu Weiran has never thought about
letting Xia Mu go.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,100
I need to push my plan forward.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,460
I'll need both yours
and Dad's blessings.

[Episode 20]

8
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,700
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,100
Yawang,

10
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,340
they're here to get you.

11
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,500
You look nice like this.

12
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,780
Ya!

13
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,580
Shu Yawang!

14
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,300
Qu Weiran has gone crazy!

15
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,940
He made you wear something like this?

16
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,660
I'm fine.

17
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,900
Everything will pass.

18
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,340
Like what I mentioned over the phone,

19
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,060
this is the evidence from the accident

20
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,140
as well as

21
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,780
the evidence against him
while he was at Haide.

22
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,740
Pass this to the police.

23
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,300
Okay.

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,340
Get her out.

25
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,260
Qu Weiran is on the way back.

26
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,540
Xia Mu said Qu Weiran is on his way back

27
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,780
and we need to go now.

28
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,780
You guys go.

29
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,140
I can't leave.

30
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,060
Once this

31
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,300
monitor crosses the door,
an alarm will ring

32
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,380
and his men will swarm over.

33
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,900
Pass this to the police.

34
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,460
Don't worry about me.

35
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,700
We're leaving together.

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,540
Who does Qu Weiran think he is?

37
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,500
I'm not afraid of him.

38
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,580
I'm really fine!

39
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,300
Hurry and go.

40
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,260
Alright.

41
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,260
Right.

42
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,860
Take the two of them as well.

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:41,980
Let's go.

44
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,100
Yawang,

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,100
we need to go.

46
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,620
You've waited a long time, right?

47
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,020
I'm waiting to see you be defeated.

48
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,780
When did you find out?

49
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,260
Qu Weiran,

50
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,260
the biggest benefit to marrying you

51
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,860
was finding out all your secrets.

52
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,580
However, I didn't dare

53
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,100
to take these secrets with me.

54
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,780
So since you returned and approached me,

55
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,740
you've just wanted my secrets?

56
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,500
So, Re, Mi.

57
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,300
All the evidence
has been handed to the police.

58
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,020
You won't escape.

59
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,940
But I'm curious.

60
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,420
Five, two, three.

61
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,940
What does it mean?

62
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,140
23 May.

63
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,060
It was the day
I saw Xia Mu for the first time.

64
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,260
It was also

65
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,100
the day I started my plan.

66
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,980
At the time, I just wanted

67
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,220
to take back what belonged to me.

68
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,980
If I had a child,

69
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,860
would my plan have been perfect?

70
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,660
Impossible.

71
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,300
The moment you used me to hurt Xia Mu,

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,660
it was impossible.

73
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,580
Shu Yawang,

74
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,620
are you really that heartless?

75
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,620
Did you think I lost

76
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,980
the baby because you

77
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,580
delayed my treatment
while you kept me here?

78
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,140
Qu Weiran, why are you so naive?

79
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,780
Listen!

80
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,460
That's not it.

81
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,420
I asked the doctor

82
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,460
not to save the baby!

83
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,500
Someone like you
doesn't deserve a child.

84
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,980
In that case,

85
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,140
you can forget about leaving here alive.
