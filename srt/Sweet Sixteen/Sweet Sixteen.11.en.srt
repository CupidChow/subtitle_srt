4
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:49,940
Where's the child?

5
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,340
Gone.

6
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,500
There's nothing linking me to Qu Weiran.

7
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,140
You've changed a lot.

8
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,580
No matter what,
we will always be family.

9
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,860
Here, try this.

10
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,980
I bought new clothes for you.

11
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,700
You're blaming me?

12
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,220
That's true.

13
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,340
If it wasn't for me,

14
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,540
you would have a better life.

15
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,620
Why did you come back?

16
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,140
This is my home.

17
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,860
Why can't I come back?

18
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,180
So you plan

19
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,740
to waste time with Qu Weiran like this?

20
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,260
Do you know what prison feels like?

21
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,140
Being in that dark and gloomy cell,

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,940
surrounded by four walls?

23
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,660
Do you understand that feeling?

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,140
I owe you.

25
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:54,940
Shu Yawang,

26
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,900
I know why you came back.

27
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,020
But you left.

28
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,780
You already had

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,940
a new and better life.

30
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,500
Is it worth it to return

31
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,380
because of him?

32
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,940
This is who I am.

33
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,020
Someone like me
isn't worth it in the first place.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,620
You're different.

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,020
I want to see that Xia Mu I knew.

36
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,980
Mr. Qu.

37
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,220
Look into Shu Yawang.

38
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,300
Check if she came back

39
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,060
just for Xia Mu.

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,780
Xia Mu has been released.

41
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,980
Shouldn't we...

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,700
make our next move?

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,380
He's released?

44
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,140
If he's out, we can

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,460
have a game with him.

you have to go back to school.

49
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,260
Don't worry about the school fees.

50
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,500
Are you listening?

51
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,380
Shu Yawang,

52
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,980
do you think you owe me something?

Let bygones be bygones.

54
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,780
You have to look forward.

55
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,060
Your personality needs to change too.

56
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,140
What's wrong with my personality?

57
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,620
I don't want to fight with you.

58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,340
Fine.

59
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,660
So you want to be nice to me again?

60
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,860
What?

61
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,140
Aren't you going to work?

62
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,020
If you don't agree to go back to school,

63
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,660
I'm not going.

64
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,660
Whatever you say.

65
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,860
Study hard.

66
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:01,900
I got it.

67
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,900
Have a proper dinner tonight.

68
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,540
Don't wait for me.

What an honor, Mr. Qu.

71
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,060
What can I do for you?

72
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,380
Nothing.

73
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,540
Since Miss Rita has just

74
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,820
returned from abroad,

75
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,460
I should

76
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,020
pick you up personally.

77
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,700
I wonder if you can grant me the honor.

78
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,340
No need.

79
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,260
My driver is waiting for me.

80
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,140
How does it feel returning

81
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,860

82
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,620
What do you think, Mr. Qu?

83
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,420
Miss Rita,

84
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,700
the design proposal we submitted

85
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,940
had some critical data errors

86
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,700
so all the subsequent data was affected.

87
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,060
Do we still have time to fix it now?

88
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,900
The final deadline
for bid submission is approaching.

89
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,940
I think...

90
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,700
Give me the proposal

91
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,540
as well as the design and data.

92
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,780
Why do you think
she has returned to Haide?

93
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,860
I can't tell
what she's thinking anymore.

94
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,860
Maybe

95
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,700
it's because of you.

96
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,580
You mean she's back to take revenge?

97
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,420
We can't exclude this possibility.

98
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,220
Maybe she can't forget you.

99
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,660
Yawang,

100
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,420
what else are you planning

101
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,540
that I haven't figured out?

102
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,660
You've had a long day.

103
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,700
Rita.

104
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,060
It's my job.

105
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,180
Your performance today

106
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,700
indeed surprised me.

107
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,860
Mind if I

108
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,620
take you out for a meal

109
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,580
as a way to say thanks?

110
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,620
Mr. Qu, thank you for the offer.

111
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,140
There's no need for a meal.

112
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,380
I was wrong in the past.

113
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,780
Give me a chance to make it up to you.

114
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,700
Make it up to me?

115
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,500
With one meal?

116
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,020
What would you like me to do, then?

117
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,420
Mr. Qu may have to think harder.

118
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,980
I'm tired.

119
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,700
It's even more tiring dealing with you.

120
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:52,900
Mu,

121
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,740
you're young

122
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,940
and at your prime.

123
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,020
Don't waste your time here.

124
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,660
Why is it a waste of time

125
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,540
if I'm earning money?

126
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,860
Ya is here.

127
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,700
I'll leave you to it.

128
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,980
Didn't you agree to go back to school?

129
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,820
Why are you working here?

130
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,700
I have money.

131
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:24,860
Go back to school.

132
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,700
I'll support you.

133
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,780
Yes.

134
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,420
Things are different now,
and you're of a higher status now.

135
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,140
A penniless person like me

136
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,980
doesn't need your charity.

137
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,140
How am I of a higher status?

138
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,900
What's that supposed to mean?

139
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,420
Mr. Qu's company

140
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,780
has great benefits, right?

141
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,540
Xia Mu,

142
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,100
I can't tell you everything now

143
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,700
but you should know
what kind of person I am.

144
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,740
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,380
I don't.

146
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,380
Go.

147
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,020
I can support myself.

148
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,780
He won't leave you alone.

149
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,260
I'm not afraid.

150
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,860
At the worst, I'll die.

151
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
What are you saying?

152
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,940
You haven't grown up all these years?

153
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,260
Listen,

154
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,300
dying?

155
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,900
Don't even think about it.

156
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,060
Whether you're studying or working,

157
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,420
think about it and let me know.

158
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,300
You don't want me anymore?

159
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,860
Let's go home.

160
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,180
Are you okay?

161
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,500
What are you doing?

162
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,460
Put me down.

163
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,860
