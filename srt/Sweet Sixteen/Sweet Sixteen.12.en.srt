4
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,100
Mr. Qu.

5
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,820
Nothing happened right?

6
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,780
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,420
I'm just scaring them.

8
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,980
How could I put anyone's life in danger?

9
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,300
Miss Shu twisted her ankle.

10
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,060
Got it.

11
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,140
It was him, right?

12
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,860
Why are you still working for him?

13
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,940
I will tell you everything,

14
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,500
but not now, okay?

15
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,020
You can't get rid of me

16
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,020
with a few lines from dramas.

17
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,460
You watch those?

18
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,500
It's something I'm not good at,

19
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,820
so I have to learn.

20
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,300
You won't go to work
at the tea house anymore, right?

21
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,300
I won't.

22
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,940
The boss tells you everything.

23
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,740
How could I?

24
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,980
Good boy.

25
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,300
I'll take you to buy
your prep materials tomorrow, alright?

26
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,740
Does it hurt?

27
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,220
Let me see.

28
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,100
It's fine.

29
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,300
That's enough.

30
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,540
Do you really treat me as a child?

31
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,100
I was so tired yesterday.

32
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,300
Your Highness,

33
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,380
let's go home.

34
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,860
I'm not done yet.

35
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,660
There's nothing much to see here.

36
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,340
Yawang,

37
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,500
long time no see.

38
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,220
Long time no see.

39
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,700
Congratulations.

40
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,780
You're together too, right?

41
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,460
Yes.

42
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,860
Thanks to you.

43
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,620

Today's a good day.

46
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,900
There's a new French restaurant
up ahead.

47
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,540

we're going

51
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,420
to watch a game later.

52
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,180
We've waited

53
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,100
really long for it.

54
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,860
Let's meet next time then.

55
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,420
Thank you.

56
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,380
I heard Tang Xiaotian
is getting married.

57
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,300
Yes.

58
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,980
Let me help you.

59
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,460
Both of them

60
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,740
are a good match.

61
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,620
Right.

62
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,020
You haven't forgotten him?

63
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,340
Yeah.

64
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,420
Then you should go look for him.

65
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,820
He's about to get married.

66
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,420
Don't miss out.

67
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,260
If I go to him, what about you?

68
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,540
None of your business.

69
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,060
I'm teasing you!

70
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,020
I've moved on.

71
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,900
I have no regrets.

72
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,500
I think life right now is at its best.

73
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,780
Things will get better for us.

74
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,380
Shu Yawang,

75
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,380
you don't owe me anything

76
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,220
so you don't need to do this.

77
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,020
Red is more festive

78
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,820
but gold is elegant.

79
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,660
Which color do you think is nice?

80
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,860
It's up to you.

81
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,980
Anything is fine.

82
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,060
This is the invitation to our wedding.

83
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,140
Can you be serious about it?

84
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,740
It's once in a lifetime.

85
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,700
Gold, then.

86
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,020
Alright.

87
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,820
There are so many things
to settle for a wedding

88
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,940
and you're not even helping me.

89
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,020
You have the final say on such matters.

90
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,420
I can't help much.

91
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,260
I'll be happy as long as

92
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,180
you're by my side.

93
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:11,860
Darling,

94
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
I'll go take a shower.

95

What's wrong with you today?

96
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:17,940
What?

97
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,860
Ever since you saw Shu Yawang,

98
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,140
you've been in a daze.

99
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,140
You haven't forgotten her?

100
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,780
What are you talking about?

101
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,100

you're about to get married.

104
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,940
I suggest you stop

105
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,340

110
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,700
you have to call at night?

111
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,540
Miss Annie, I'm sorry.

112
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,460

120
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,540
This is the summary of our proposal.

121
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,900
Once everything goes well today,

122
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,140
and I take over Haide,

123
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,140
I can give you everything you want.

124
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,540
Mr. Qu, you might not

125
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,260
be able to give me what I want.

This is Miss Annie, our CEO
who has just returned from abroad.

128
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,300
This is Mr. Qu from Haide Enterprises

130
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,980
Hello, Miss Annie.

131
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,380
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Qu.

132
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,540
You're indeed a seasoned veteran,

133
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,260
using this kind of proposal to fool us.

134
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
Not at all, Miss Annie.

135
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Before you,

136
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,500
how can we be considered veterans?

137
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,220
I wonder what issues
you have with this proposal.

138
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,260
Feel free to tell us straight out.

139

Balance of the cosmos?
Harmonious nature?

140
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,540
I've seen so many
of such empty promises.

141
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,620
Do you all think this proposal is good?

142
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,740
We were indeed a little short on time.

143
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,060
Miss Annie,

144
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,860
can you give us a few more days?

145

Three days.
