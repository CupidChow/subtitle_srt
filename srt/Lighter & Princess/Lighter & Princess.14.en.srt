Yes.

Thanks for your support.

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,750
Well,

174
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,430
I hope Yun can also

175
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,720
go abroad for further study in the future.

176
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,240
What she majors in is not important.

177
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,720
What's more, she should go abroad to widen her vision, right?

178
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,870
If you have any question about going abroad,

179
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,270
you can ask us about it at any time.

180

As a freshman, I haven't thought about this yet.

182
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,830
You can ask Xiuzhu

183
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,240
whether further study abroad is good or not.

184
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,950
Xiuzhu,

185
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,190
is the moon really fuller abroad?

186
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,870

187
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,190

188
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,800

Which side is oblique?

343
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,150
This?

344
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,320
A small number of foreigners

345
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,510
[Li Xun]
are still biased against Chinese people.

346
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,510
It doesn't matter.

347
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,910
In foreign countries...

348
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,320
Is that him?

349
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,440
Did he go or not?

350
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,270
Where does he have the Spring Festival?

351
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,840
[Li Xun  Zhu Yun: Did you go? What did the boss of Blue Crown say?]
Right?

352
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,840
[Li Xun  Zhu Yun: Did you go? What did the boss of Blue Crown say?]
He doesn't reply again.

353
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,320
[Li Xun  Zhu Yun: Did you go? What did the boss of Blue Crown say?]
At present,

354
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,750
many students don't go abroad for further study

355
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,720
but for a diploma.

356
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,670
Of course.

357
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,390
Not everyone can do like Xiuzhu.

358
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:58,870
However,

359
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,390
given Yun's major,

360
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,240
I think she should go abroad

361
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,510
to broaden her international vision.

362
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,320
Am I right?

363
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,270
Don't play with your phone.

364
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,200
Talk about

365
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,790
how you think about going abroad.

366
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,200
It's good to stay in China.

367
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,670
For our major,

368
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,630
practice is very important.

369
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,670
It's also good to work early.

370
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,240
Well,

371
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
you're wrong.

372
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,630
If you major in computer abroad,

373
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,910
you may join the major companies such as Microsoft

374
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,360
and Google in the future.

375
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,270
It's better

376
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,480
than studying in China

377
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,080
and then joining a small company.

378
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,910
Right?

379
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,750
Those who have been educated abroad

380
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,360
really have a good taste.

381
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,600
Look at this plate

382
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,030
picked by Xiuzhu today.

383
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,270
Dumplings look superior in it,

384
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:42,870
right?

385
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,510
You exaggerated it.

386
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,120
He bought it casually

387
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,080
when I waited for the lighter under repair.

388
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,270
It's common.

389
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,790
Why do you have a lighter?

390
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,270
What's more,

391
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,870
a lighter needs, needs to be repaired?

392
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,550
Show it to me.

393
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,840
The Spring Festival Gala will begin soon.

394
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,070
Repair...

395
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,480
Is that him?

396
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,030
Impossible.

397
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,830
I'm going to answer a call of nature.

398
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,640
You answer a call of nature during dinner?

399
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,310
Did I mistake him?

400
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,770
[Li Xun]

401
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,720
Hello.

402
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,240
Hello.

403
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,880
Happy New Year.

404
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,270
Happy.

405
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,310
Have you and Liu Sisi got home?

406
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,790
Not yet.

407
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,920
You haven't gone home so late?

408
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,000
Who told you I went home with her?

409
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,240
Where are you?

410
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,550
It's snowing.

411
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,000
Li Xun, was that you?

412
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,880
How do you know where my house is?

413
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,640
I have been here before.

414
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,350
Then wait for me.

415
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,240
Yun,

416
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,270
where are you going?

417
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,720
The apples you want have been cut into pieces.

418
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,240
Go eat some.

419
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,160
Well, mom,

420
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,270
I'm going to fetch a parcel.

421
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,480
You stay at home.

422
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,920
I'll go. It's very cold outside.

423
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,350
-No need. -Nonsense.

424
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,240
No deliveryman is on duty on New Year's Eve.

425
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,030
I'm going to see if it's snowing heavily.

426
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,070
It's snowing heavily.

427
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,310
Don't go.

428
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
You just had dinner.

429
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,920
How about this?

430
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,270
You eat the apple first.

431
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,880
Let's go to enjoy it after playing cards.

432
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,110
Have some first.

433
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,790
How many your cards are left?

434
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,720
Two.

435
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,510
I win again.

436
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,270
So unlucky.

437
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,030
Yun,

438
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,550
you're so absent-minded that

439
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,750
you haven't won yet.

440
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,880
How can I win with you as my rival?

441
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,030
I agree.

442
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,510
You're the landlord in our family.

443
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,830
Why is he silent?

444
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,920
[Li Xun  Zhu Yun: Did you go? What did the boss of Blue Crown say?]
So you always fight against me?

445
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,200
[Li Xun  Zhu Yun: Did you go? What did the boss of Blue Crown say?]
Come on.

446
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,100
[Li Xun  Zhu Yun: Did you go? What did the boss of Blue Crown say?]
Go on. Go on.

447
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,640
[Li Xun  Zhu Yun: Did you go? What did the boss of Blue Crown say?]
Go on?

448
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,350
[Zhu Yun: Are you still online?]
-No. -Are you still online?

449
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,880
[Zhu Yun: Are you still online?]
I'm sleepy.

450
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,480
[Zhu Yun: Are you still online?]
I'm, I'm sleepy.

451
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,110
[Zhu Yun: Are you still online?]
Sleepy?

452
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,270
[Zhu Yun: Are you still online?]
I'm bored.

453
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,030
[Zhu Yun: Are you still online?]
The Spring Festival is getting more and more boring.

454
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,400
[Zhu Yun: Are you still online?]
Three people

455
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,510
[Zhu Yun: Are you still online?]
are not even enough for playing mahjong.

456
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,350
[Li Xun: I'm almost frozen to death.]
I'm almost frozen to death.

457
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,200
What's up?

458
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,510
-What's up? -Dad,

459
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,160
mom,

460
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,880
I'm taking out the trash.

461
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,350
Take care.

462
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,440
Hello, I'm out. Where are you?

463
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,750
Girl, it's snowing so heavily,

464
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
but you go out until now.

465
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,720
Are you going to dig out my body?

466
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,510
I'm sorry.

467
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,110
You went back?

468
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,590
Do you know where Lihua Hotel is?

469
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,350
The one near our house?

470
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,310
I stay in it. Come if you're free.

471
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,350
What do you mean?

472
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,790
Hello?

473
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,590
Hello?

474
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,110
Lihua Hotel. He wants me to see him?

475
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,830
Yun,

476
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,310
you've been out for dumping the trash for so long.

477
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,240
Come back now!

478
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,400
OK!

479
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,350
It's freezing.

480
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,400
How can I do this as a girl?

481
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,270
I won't.

482
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,480
Will he

483
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,720
be frightened by my look?

484
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,440
Well,

485
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,830

Open it and have a look.

561

It'll be your pay card.

562

Don't hold your abdomen in.

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,480
Are you curious about Chinese universities?

679
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,360
How about I show you around my university?

680
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,630
Our university is

681
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,480
one of the leading key universities in China,

682
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,110
and its painting major is even very famous

683
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,920
among art academies.

684
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,000
If you didn't go abroad,

685
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,280
you might not be admitted into it.

686
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,150
Don't say so.

687
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,000
I mustn't be admitted.

688
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,840
I didn't mean that.

689
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,110
It's an honor to invite such an excellent artist

690
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,030
as you to our university.

691
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,400
You're abnormal.

692
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,480
Something must happen.

693
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,670
Nothing.

694
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,960
How about this?

695
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,510
I treat you to a good meal near my university

696
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,480
with my lucky money.

697
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,630
I smell something.

698
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,000
What?

699
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,110
A plot.

700
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,000
Just,

701
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,760
just do me a favor.

702
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:12,630
OK.

703
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,320
It's rare for you

704
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,150
to treat me.

705
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,670
Well,

706
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,480
when do you want to leave?

707
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,150
I'll help you.

708
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,190
Thank you

709
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,840
for allowing Zhu Yun to go with me.

710
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,500
I'm sorry for bothering you

711
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,480
during the Spring Festival.

712
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,440
Well,

713
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,840
Chinese and foreign universities

714
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,920
are greatly different

715
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,550
in both educational concept

716
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,920
and campus atmosphere.

717
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,400
Yun can show you

718
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,920
around Nanhu University these days.

719
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,360
It's rare for me to have a vacation.

720
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,150
I planned to stay at home for some days.

721
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,320
If I go to the university,

722
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,840
I'll have no time to come back.

723
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,230
It's rare for Xiuzhu to come back.

724
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,150
You go with him

725
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,920
and then preview

726
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,360
your lessons of next semester in the university.

727
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,360
Listen.

728
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
You must be self-disciplined in university,

729
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,360
or else you may not be admitted into any foreign college due to your bad grades in the future.

730
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,800
How about Xiuzhu go by himself?

731
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,000
I disagree.

732
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,320
You can take this opportunity

733
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,150
to ask him about some affairs,

734
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,920
such as the channel of publishing articles.

735
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,710
Am I right?

736
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,760
I just want to stay with you for some days.

737
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,320
Your university is not far.

738
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,630
If I miss you, I can go to see you at any time.

739
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,920
Go.

740
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,710
I'm leaving, mom.

741
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,710
Go.

742
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,150
Aunt, see you.

743
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,800
Drive slowly.

744
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,960
Master.

745
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,590
You want to go but pretended to be loath.

746
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,110
I learn this from you.

747
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,710
After all, you're good at pretending to be well-behaved

748
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,880
in front of parents.

749
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,030
OK, I can give you a discount on tuition.

750
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,190
I really want to learn

751
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,480
how to please my mother.

752
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,960
However,

753
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
it's a gift.

754
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,230
You can't acquire it.

755
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,480
Yeah.

756
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,840
It seems that you have a gift for pleasing my mother.

757
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,110
You two are CP , right?

758
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,630
Well, navigate for me.

759
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,920
Thank you.

760
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,760
Thank you, Xiuzhu.

761
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,150
Can you find a hotel later?

762
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,840
Well,

763
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,510
you ask me to leave now?

764
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,400
If I'm free tomorrow,

765
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,670
I'll definitely show you around.

766
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,630
It's late,

767
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,110
and you must be tired after driving me here.

768
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,070
Zhu Yun,

769
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,440
are you sure you won't use me anymore?

770
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,070
Why don't we have something in the canteen?

771
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,840
You're back.

772
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,590
♫I pass by the world♫
The preliminary of Information Security Competition

773
