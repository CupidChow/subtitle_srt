00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,790
You can be the game ambassador.

174
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,310
I don't feel good recently.

175
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,910
I want to rest for a while.

176
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,070
What's wrong?

177
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,520
Nothing.

178
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I feel tired.

179
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,120
Actually, I wonder

180
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,710
what else I can do

181
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,790
besides game ambassador.

182
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,040
What is

183
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,830
Rivalry among Seven Powers you just mentioned like?

184
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,310
You want to know

185
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,400
if it's similar to Li Xun's Invincible General?

186
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,070
I can tell you.

187
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Yes. They're identical.

188
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,880
I know you want to fight with Li Xun.

189
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,710
But what's the point of making

190
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,310
an identical game?

191
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll always stop him from upswing.

192
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,910
I want him to know that

193
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,790
L&P is dominating the current game market.

194
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,670
Whatever you say,

195
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,830
I won't be the game ambassador.

196
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,400
You're tired recently.

197
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,880
Eat this egg

198
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,830
to supplement protein.

199
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,710
I have no appetite in the morning.

200
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,400
Thanks.

201
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,280
Eat it.

202
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,160
I'll take a bath.

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,670
Sit down.

204
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,070
Sit down.

205
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,480
Eat this egg.

206
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,000
You won't get fat.

207
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,910
Let me feed you.

208
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,880
Eat slowly.

209
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,950
Good girl.

210
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,160
I'm just trying to make you better.

211
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,400
Come on.

212
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,280
Are you ready?

213
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,830
Well. 1, 2, 3. Throw.

214
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,430
Well, change your expression.

215
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,070
Throw.

216
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,950
Lina, let me put on a dress for you.

217
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,040
OK. What do you think?

218
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,280
OK. Thanks.

219
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,120
Never mind.

220
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,310
Cappuccino.

221
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,120
No sugar.

222
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,160
Lina,

223
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,550
thank you for your hard work.

224
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,040
You're beautiful.

225
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,240
Gao,

226
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,430
I want to study abroad as a graduate student.

227
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,520
Why do you mention it

228
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,040
suddenly?

229
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,120
No reason.

230
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,360
You know that

231
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,280
I want to study abroad.

232
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,950
Moreover,

233
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,830
many of my friends are abroad.

234
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,400
I haven't had a chance to go abroad.

235
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,310
I want to make up for the pity.

236
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,550
I agree.

237
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,430
I really agree with you.

238
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,480
I'll go with you

239
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,430
when I retire in a few years.

240
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,830
We'll try to have a baby.

241
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,830
That'll be a long time.

242
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,240
How about going abroad when you finish Rivalry among Seven Powers?

243
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,120
You can't leave now.

244
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,180
The company needs you.

245
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,160
Director Zhang,

246
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,400
are we making a reservation today?

247
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,910
I just put the money where it matters most

248
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,360
as I often say.

249
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,550
Without my usual small savings,

250
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,190
we can't be decent today.

251
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,240
To attract more

252
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,590
users offline,

253
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,520
I spent all the money.

254
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,480
Great, Zhang Fang.

255
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,520
You're willing to spend money.

256
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,070
-Attract more users. -What's wrong?

257
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Zhang Fang, the name is wrong.

258
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,910
Yes. You got the wrong name.

259
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,400
Come on. Be more reliable.

260
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,880
No. No.

261
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,580

L&P.

263
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,240
Ours

264
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:49,830
is over there.

265
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,040
Hello, online players.

266
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,640
Welcome to Rivalry among Seven Powers.

267
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,590
I'm your host Tiantian.

268
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,790
Nice to meet you.

269
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,550
Today I'd like to

270
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,910
introduce...

271
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,790
What the hell!

272
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,150
...A war simulation game,

273
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,070
Rivalry among Seven Powers.

274
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,830
I believe that many of you here

275
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,550
are fans of the game.

276
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,310
Designed by

277
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,040
our ace planning team

278
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,760
for two years,

279
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,070
the game, with the setting of seven powers,

280
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,550
features the game experience

281
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,070
of how the players survive in the in troubled times

282
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,590
and finally conquer the other six kingdoms using their own strategies.

283
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,280
Ace planning team?

284
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,720
Two years?

285
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,520
They're so shameless.

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,680
The characters, engines, game play

287
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,200
and skins of Rivalry among Seven Powers.

288
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,440
They're identical to those of Invincible General.

289
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,870
It may be wrongly taken as our extra.

290
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,760
How shameless!

291
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,390
Obviously, they copied our game.

292
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,240
Can, can we sue them?

293
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,240
Sue? Come on.

294
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,960
Speaking of that, I remember

295
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,630
it's not the first time they've done this.

296
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,920
L&P has

297
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,590
a famous lawyer team.

298
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
I guess that's what they do.

299
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,150
No one wins the case against them.

300
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,520
They're really shameless.

301
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,200
Have you got garage kits?

302
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,790
Garage kits?

303
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,960
They're in the box.

304
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,390
It's rough.

305
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,520
They're nice to make these for us.

306
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,310
Put them up.

307
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,520
Where is Group Leader Zhu?

308
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,310
She is on her way.

309
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,070
Call and tell her

310
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,960
not to come here.

311
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,760
Why?

312
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,920
Even you want to sue them.

313
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,040
Do you think what she will do?

314
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,350
Question 1.

315
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,280
Which state conquered

316
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
the other six states?

317
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,200
Sir. Sir.

318
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,440
I want to meet your head.

319
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,960
I have nothing to talk with you.

320
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,790
Where is Zhang Fang?

321
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,790
Zhang...

322
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,240
Sorry.

323
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,070
Sorry, sir.

324
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,760
He is over there.

325
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,150
Sir.

326
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,680
Why must you drive us away?

327
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
We pay for the booth.

328
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,920
Stop, Xiaojian. Collect our stuff.

329
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,150
No.

330
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,830
He didn't mean to.

331
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,790
Stop.

332
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,680
Fang,

333
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,000
I know you didn't mean to.

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,920
You're the best.

335
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,720
This is delicate.

336
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,150
Big ones break easily.

337
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,870
Small ones are strong.

338
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,480
I agree.

339
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,550
But I wonder how long

340
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,110
it will last on the fire.

341
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,310
Have a try.

342
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,480
I thought Invincible General

343
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,240
was a masterpiece.

344
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,550
After playing it,

345
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,830
I found you set force values for generals.

346
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,960
Those with a high value fight faster

347
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,040
while those with a lower value fight slower.

348
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,720
Nobody wants to play such a boring game.

349
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,280
Cut the crap.

350
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,830
We have nearly 50 characters

351
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,280
and over 200 weapons.

352
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,440
The game play and strategy chosen matter most.

353
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,040
I just played

354
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,590
your game.

355
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,720
It's labeled as an education simulation game.

356
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,870
But I think you just

357
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,070
set more skins and props.

358
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,200
You're trying to let players spend more money.

359
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,150
You're shameless.

360
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,310
You're shameless.

361
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,550
Li Xun,

362
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,480
is it meaningful for you

363
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,520
to waste your time and work with

364
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,760
these fools?

365
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,830
In this case, why did you copy our game?

366
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,110
Even so, ours is better than yours.

367
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,200
You plagiarize the ideas of your peers,

368
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,590
and cheat users.

369
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,630
You're shameless.

370
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,870
You know what,

371
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,110
we'll continue the publication

372
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,680
and promotion

373
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,240
of our great game.

374
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,280
We'll keep monthly update.

375
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,040
Yes.

376
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,150
Then good luck.

377
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,280
I hope Invincible General is still remembered

378
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,830
when it's updated next time.

379
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,280
Look at his sheepish look.

380
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,110
Look, this cat is cute.

381
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,590
Yes.

382
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,790
Li Xun,

383
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,000
go to buy scallion.

384
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,630
I have no time.

385
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,070
It won't take you long.

386
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,000
OK.

387
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,630
Damn.

388
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,720
You're still playing the game.

389
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,280
Gao is insidious.

390
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,110
Fine.

391
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,000
It'll be interesting when they update

392
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,350
the game tomorrow.

393
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,630
Well, leave it to me.

394
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,720
They implanted the virus.

395
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,870
Now we're trying to kill them

396
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,590
and trace the source.

397
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,830
Another one.

398
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,550
It's Li Xun.

399
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,280
How do you know?

400
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,240
He hides the IPA,

401
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,390
but I know well how he attacks.

402
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,390
I'll help Dongliang.

403
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,310
Wait.

404
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,110
Just leave it.

405
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,520
You're going to...

406
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,040
How many years he will be sentenced for

407
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,440
invading computer systems illegally?

408
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,830
It'll be great if Li Xun

409
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,550
is convicted, right?

410
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,520
So you're going to...

411
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,520
I'll send him back to the prison.

412
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,630
The price is a higher. The scallion costs me 2 yuan.

413
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,390
You know what you did.

414
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,870
It's just a piece of cake.

415
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,350
Really?

416
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,240
You directly implanted viruses into the server

417
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,040
of Rivalry among Seven Powers.

418
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,390
Do you think experts of L&P

419
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,440
can't find out who you are?

420
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,590
They can try.

421
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,680
At 8:00 tomorrow morning,

422
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,920
I'll disable their server.

423
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,630
Don't try to recover it in less than ten days.

424
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,790
I told you

425
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,440
not to act

426
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
without my permission.

427
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,390
Come on. What are you afraid of?

428
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,550
Not to mention whether they can find me,

429
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,350
what if they can find me?

430
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,920
Hou Ning,

431
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,520
no one will stop you if you want to be imprisoned again.

432
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,550
Move out of here now.

433
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,440
I can't bear

434
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,830
seeing what they

435
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,680
have done to you.

436
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,630
I don't need your help.

437
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,350
Don't shout at me.

438
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,760
Come on.

439
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,110
I can't understand.

440
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,110
We're both capable.

441
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,480
Why do we have to live in this place?

442
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,760
I'm a coward.

443
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,040
I must be a coward.

444
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,280
I stay in such a place

445
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,110
with you out of my own will

446
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,350
and cook for you.

447
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,830
Everyone hates me.

448
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,720
I deserve it.

449
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,040
No one can stop you

450
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,790
from spoiling yourself.

451
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,110
I didn't.

452
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,240
Who?

453
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,920
Policemen.

454
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,960
We're from the network security team of the municipal bureau.

455
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,150
Li Xun, don't stop me.

456
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,200
I don't want to be imprisoned again.

457
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,680
Calm down.

458
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,150
Hou Ning,

459
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,480
trust me.

460
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,110
I won't let you be imprisoned again.

461
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,150
Li Xun and Hou Ning, right?

462
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,680
You were reported to have invaded

463
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,350
the server of L&P illegally.

464
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,520
Please go with us and co-operate with investigation.

465
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,150
He was released from prison not long ago.

466
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,870
Did he do something wrong?

467
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,630
He came here not long ago.

468
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,590
I feel that he is nice.

469
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,440
A leopard will never change its spots.

470
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,040
Li Xun really cleared the virus.

471
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,440
Never mind.

472
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,590
We suffer no loss,

473
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,310
but we can create loss.

474
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,240
You mean you cleared

475
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,870
the virus they implanted, right?

476
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,040
Yes.

477
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,720
Sir,

478
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,070
we've caused

479
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,110
no loss to L&P.

480
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,440
I think this is a misunderstanding.

481
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,630
No loss.

482
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,110
I don't think so.

483
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,350
Li Xun,

484
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,920
you're so cruel.

485
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,790
Though the virus are cleared,

486
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,790
you deleted the core user data

487
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,760
of Rivalry among Seven Powers,

488
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,110
which is most valuable to our company.

489
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,200
You can't compete fairly,

490
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,350
so you began to play dirty.

491
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,680
You're trying to destroy Rivalry among Seven Powers.

492
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,790
Gao Jianhong,

493
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
you're slinging mud at us.

494
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,280
I did nothing to your user data.

495
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,000
Sir,

496
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,200
this is the data called by our company's

497
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,140
security department.

498
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,150
We have sufficient evidence to prove that

499
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,000
Li Xun deleted the core data assets

500
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,240
of our company's most important game,

501
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,520
Rivalry among Seven Powers,

502
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,870
while removing the virus.

503
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,760
Lawyer Wang.

504
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,200
According to Article 285

505
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,760
of the Criminal Law of the PRC,

506
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,680
whoever, in violation of State regulations, invades a computer information system

507
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,680
other than those specified

508
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,790
in the preceding paragraph,

509
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,590
or uses other technical mean to obtain the storage,

510
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,680
processing and transmission data

511
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,150
in the computer information system,

512
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,200
or exercises illegal control over

513
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,680
the computer information system,

514
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,480
if the consequences are serious,

515
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,680
shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention;

516
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,960
if the consequences are especially serious,

517
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,350
shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than seven years

518
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,630
and imposed a fine.

519
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,040
You played these dirty tricks.

520
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,040
You can't escape from the long arm of the law.

521
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,680
You

522
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,150
will be imprisoned.

523
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,070
Is there anything else you want to say?

524
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,040
Admit it.

525
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,000
When you are released a few years later,

526
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,550
you'll still be a hero.

527
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,630
I'll be waiting for you.

528
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,280
Someone is here to help.

529
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,790
I have nothing to say,

530
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,760
but she does.

531
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,310
There is a saying in the hacker circle.

532
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,310
Everything has its trace.

533
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,790
Whoever has entered your server

534
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,960
will leave traces.

535
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,760
Zhu Yun,

536
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,680
what are you doing?

537
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,000
Someone invaded your server

538
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,310
through Port 1433.

539
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,280
Someone? You mean Li Xun, right?

540
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,350
Really?

541
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,200
Sir,

542
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Port 1433

543
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,870
is a SQL Server.

544
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,680
SQL Server's

545
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,630
TCP port

546
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,920
is for SQL Server

547
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,280
to provide external services.

548
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,870
Li Xun and Hou Ning invaded our server

549
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,480
through this port successively.

550
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,520
Right.

551
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,630
After Li Xun entered your server

552
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,520
and cleared the virus Hou Ning implanted,

553
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,960
you've disabled Port 1433

554
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,350
externally,

555
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,720
which has not been restored now.

556
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,480
Yes.

557
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,070
We found an invader,

558
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,240
so we closed Port 1433 externally.

559
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,590
But before that,

560
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,680
Li Xun had deleted

561
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
some of our important

562
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,520
core user data.

563
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,870
But according to the server log file

564
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,110
I called,

565
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,680
Port 1433 was

566
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,200
disabled at 3:17 p.m.,

567
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,630
while the core user data

568
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,310
was deleted at 4:21 p.m.

569
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,590
In this case,

570
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,000
how did Li Xun break Port 143

571
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,630
to enter the server and delete

572
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,520
the core user data?

573
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,040
Now that they can invade our server,

574
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,240
certainly they can also

575
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,390
modify our log files.

576
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,720
That doesn't mean anything.

577
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,390
Mr. Gao,

578
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,000
you have confidence in our ability.

579
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,920
It seems that we have to make Mr. Gao a coffin,

580
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,870
or he won't shed a tear

581
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,150
before he sees the coffin.

582
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,630
Sir,

583
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,150
when a port is disabled externally,

584
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,200
no one can use

585
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,870
this port to invade a computer

586
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
with an external network,

587
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,310
unless...

588
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,630
Unless?

589
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,680
Unless?

590
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,680
Unless someone enters the same port from the intranet.

591
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,240
This is the IPA.

592
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,920
Sir,

593
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,040
you'll find the user

594
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,150
of this IPA

595
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,630
in the R&D Department of L&P.

596
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,720
He is the one who invaded server of L&P

597
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,520
through the internet

598
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,790
and deleted the core user data.

599
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,110
Sir, otherwise,

600
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,280
I'll ask the technical personnel of L&P

601
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,040
to check it again now.

602
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:13,960
We...

603
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,590
No need.

604
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,480
We'll check ourselves later

605
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,870
to punish employees who violate

606
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,070
the company's regulations

607
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,550
severely and never relent.

608
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,350
Mr. Gao is really sensible.

609
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,870
By the way,

610
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,280
sir,

611
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,240
Zhu Yun

612
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,870
just entered our company's

613
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,040
internet in front of you

614
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,200
and called our server logs.

615
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,630
She was breaking the law

616
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,070
and shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years

617
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,280
or criminal detention.

618
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,830
Is there any problem with my access to

619
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,680
the intranet of Flying?

620
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,000
Your intranet?

621
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,320
This IPA is

622
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,150
on a desktop computer of Flying Network.

623
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,880
Just now I made

624
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,590
a demonstration using the intranet

625
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,590
of Flying Company.

626
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,270
What you saw is an experiment.

627
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,840
Also, I estimated

628
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,550
the log time.

629
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,520
Though Invincible General appears

630
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,040
insignificant when compared with

631
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,360
Rivalry among Seven Powers,

632
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,150
but game severs

633
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,040
work similarly.

634
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,550
Mr. Gao, you didn't see it.

635
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,750
Would you like to check again?

636
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,000
No need.

637
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,550
Well, are you alright?

638
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,710
Yes.

639
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,750
Let's go.

640
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,400
I warned you not to try to fight with him.

641
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,070
You know what,

642
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,840
if you cause losses to L&P,

643
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
you'll be imprisoned

644
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,070
for a few years again.

645
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,880
I wanted to help him.

646
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,040
You're hurting him.

647
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,400
You don't have the right to criticize me.

648
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,590
If it wasn't for you, he wouldn't have been imprisoned.

649
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,360
Enough.

650
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,000
It has nothing to do with her.

651
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,150
It does.

652
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,520
You were imprisoned because of her, right?

653
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,000
Shut up.

654
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,230
Go.

655
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:49,880
Hou Ning.

656
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,710
Come back, Hou Ning.

657
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,320
Come back.

658
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:51,960
Let go.

659
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,440
Come back.

660
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,750
Let go.

661
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,880
Are you crazy?

662
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,360
Yes.

663
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,920
I'm crazy.

664
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,670
Li Xun,

665
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,960
I'm crazy, so I live here with you.

666
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,670
Look around.

667
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,750
Look at those around you.

668
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,040
Is any of them normal?

669
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Your college classmate who lived with you

670
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,320
mange to stop you from upswing now.

671
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,960
And he

672
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,920
just slobs around all day.

673
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,840
He encourages you to be with her,

674
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,400
like a pervert.

675
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,710
What?

676
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,440
Shut up.

677
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,960
And she

678
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,550
is like the bane of your life.

679
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,550
She is dating the painter.

680
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,360
Can't you see?

681
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,320
Tell me.

682
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,070
Why don't you want to leave?

683
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,230
I don't want to leave any of you,

684
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,070
including you.

685
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,550
Nonsense.

686
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,920
Do I mean a lot to you?

687
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,040
Listen,

688
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,480
you'll turn to me.

689
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,880
You'll regret.

690
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:36,840
Hou Ning.

691
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,920
Let him go.

00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,630
Drink some hot water, or you may catch a cold.

694
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,070
Thanks.

695
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,630
You may catch a cold.

696
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,110
Drink it.

697
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,230
Thanks.

698
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,320
Change it.

699
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,670
Change your clothes,

700
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,670
or you'll catch a cold.

701
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
Don't fear. Just change it.

702
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,150
Do you have extra trousers?

703
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,400
Do my trousers fit you?

704
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,400
I don't know. I didn't try before.

705
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,040
Throw it over.

706
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,750
OK?

707
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,150
Forget it. They are too large.

708
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,480
Do you want to try sheets?

709
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,230
Do you have a hair dryer?

710
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,230
No.

711
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,800
I have nothing

712
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,190
you girls need.

713
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,920
Sleep here.

714
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,070
Where will you sleep?

715
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,880
We'll start to work in three hours.

716
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,150
Are you going home?

717
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,750
I'll sleep out there.

718
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,520
Take a coat.

719
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:34,880
Good night.

720
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,400
Good night.

721
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,400
Why have they always

722
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,480
gone against us?

723
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,440
It's because of us.

724
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,550
Li Xun,

725
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,440
did you once miss me?

726
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,150
What if I say no?

727
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,230
I don't believe it.

728
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,400
Can we be together?
