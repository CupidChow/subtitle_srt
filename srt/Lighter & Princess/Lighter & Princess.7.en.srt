I was too blind to like someone

23

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,600
From now on I solemnly declare that

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,320

26

Of course I'm going.

33

I didn't scold him before because I went easy on him.

34

If he dares scold me again,

35

We've changed the mouse to look like their logo.

54

Isn't that quite impressive?

55

If he keeps acting like that,

he'll get into trouble sooner or later.

he might not be able to come.

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,590
That's why

171
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,070
our concept

172
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,590
is to focus on novelty.

173
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,550
So our company's design concept

174
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,360
is contrary to everyone else.

175
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,640
We only pursue

176
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,640
old fashion.

177
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,190
You called Li Xun, huh?

178
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,790
He turned his cell phone off.

179
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,830
We are here to bid.

180
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,830
What is he thinking?

181
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,160
We are supposed to do the presentation today.

182
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,040
So we should design web pages

183
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,240
as sparingly as possible.

184
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,040
How about this one?

185
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,480
This is even better than the last one.

186
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,670
Their minimalist style

187
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,000
looks easy

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,830
until you work on it,

189
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,640
especially that tab.

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,310
I've seen the master write it

191
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,710
on the design exchange site before.

192
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,120
That may take us half a year to learn it.

193
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,040
For example,

194
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
one of our creative designs is to

195
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,360
change the mouse

196
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,070
to look like your company's logo,

197
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,000
so as to

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,520
impress the customers.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,280
I'm going to make one more phone call.

200
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,240
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is power off.

201
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,040
What is he doing?

202
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,790
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is power off.

203
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,520
What's wrong?

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I just accidentally deleted the wrong line of code.

205
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,280
I was going to add a dynamic plug-in

206
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,590
to the navigation bar,

207
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,120
so that it could be at least

208
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,480
more attractive at first glance.

209
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,790
It's OK.

210
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,190
Copy mine. I have a backup on my computer.

211
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,880
I changed the navigation bar

212
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,550
when I last put it together.

213
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,590
You didn't have it.

214
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,120
The design that best fits the user's habits

215
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,670
is good design.

216
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,550
That's it for my presentation.

217
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,520
Thank you all.

218
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,880
The fourth speaker is

219
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,790
Center for School-Enterprise Cooperation of Computer Science Department at Nanhu University.

220
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,160
Is Nanhu University here?

221
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,190
Let's go.

222
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,520
Center for School-Enterprise Cooperation

223
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,640
of Computer Science Department at Nanhu University.

224
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,120
Bidder is Li Xun.

225
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,400
Is Li Xun here?

226
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,910
Yes.

227
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,430
Gao.

228
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,670
Hello, everyone.

229
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,830
I am Gao Jianhong

230
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,640
from Center for School-Enterprise Cooperation of Computer Science Department

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,760
at Nanhu University.

232
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,790
Our website design concept

233
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,520
this time

234
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,590
is youthfulness

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,880
and lifestyle.

236
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,520
Youthfulness means that we want to

237
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,640
attract more young people

238
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,910
to pat-patronize

239
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,160
Blue Crown's website.

240
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,400
Lifestyle means that we want to

241
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,070
be more in line with the user's habits.

242
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,950
We also changed the mouse

243
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,910
to look like Blue Crown's logo,

244
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,670
and we...

245
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,310
Hold on.

246
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,120
What's wrong with that navigation bar?

247
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,590
Well,

248
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,240
it was originally a dynamic component.

249
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,040
There seems to be something wrong with the code.

250
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,070
Didn't you test it before coming?

251
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,000
We did.

252
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,360
We tested it many times.

253
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,240
But

254
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,430
I tried to

255
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,360
make a change just now,

256
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,240
and it seemed too late.

257
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,640
Young man,

258
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,950
you're a student,

259
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,040
so we can understand that

260
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,000
you're not as accomplished as the rest,

261
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,000
but you can't

262
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,070
just come up here with something like that.

263
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,280
We are very serious about this tender.

264
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,550
Do you have any respect

265
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,710
for us and for your competitors?

266
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,830
Your bid is well written.

267
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,240
How come your presentation is different

268
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,190
and you came up here with a work in progress?

269
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,550
Why is it different from the bid we submitted?

270
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,950
This is really a work in progress.

271
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,120
Sorry,

272
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,160
what we just showed you

273
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,760
is the first draft we made.

274
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,950
We had a lot of arguments

275
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,190
about what a navigation bar

276
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,520
would look like,

277
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,950
but then we realized that

278
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,240
consumers don't care about navigation bars at all.

279
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,430
They only care about

280
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,880
how to buy products more easily.

281
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,240
The first draft we just showed you

282
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,120
was only to

283
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,550
prove to you

284
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,400
how scary it can be

285
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,790
if you go in the wrong direction.

286
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,040
So in the second draft,

287
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,240
we completely left the website design concept behind

288
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,640
and focused more on

289
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,830
how to make it easier

290
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,950
and faster

291
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,310
for users to buy your products.

292
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,190
Blue Crown's main business

293
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,480
is snacks and health products,

294
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,480
but these are not necessities

295
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,910
for most consumers.

296
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,550
We have analyzed the consumption behaviors

297
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,670
on major shopping websites

298
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,120
and conducted a questionnaire survey.

299
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,710
It's found that

300
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,160
the purchase of such products

301
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,670
is usually completed on impulse.

302
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,310
So we need to

303
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,950
make the process from selection to payment

304
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,070
as short as possible,

305
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,400
without any hindrance

306
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,000
or hassle for the consumers.

307
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,910
♫I don't know how you've been♫
In the purchase process on a traditional shopping site,

308
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,160
♫I don't know how you've been♫
consumers need to register,

309
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,240

310
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,710
♫You don't know how I've been♫

bind the bank card

312
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,920

313
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,790

But these five steps

314
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,520
♫Nothing has changed♫
are too complicated and cumbersome

315
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,620
for buying

316
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,880
♫Have you ever changed?♫
a non-essential item.

317
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,950
♫Have you ever changed?♫
Consumers are likely to

318
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,430
stop at any step.

319
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,640
♫I don't know how you've been♫
So

320
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,800
♫I don't know how you've been♫
our suggestion is

321
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,480
not to build a new payment system

322
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,080

324
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,830

a mature payment application

325
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,070

with universal user information.

326

I dare to predict that

327

a payment application like that

328
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,430
will be a big trend.

329
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,240
Thank you.

330
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,160
He's been coding all day.

331
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,880
When did he study this?

332
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,400
Gao.

333
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,880
What's wrong with you?

334
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,710
Are you mad?

335
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,070
Li Xun was going too far.

336
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,200
I'm sure he didn't take it personally.

337
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,720
He had his own plans.

338
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,390
What plans?

339
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,790
Was he planning to molest us,

340
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,040
or was he planning to make me look like a fool on stage

341
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,630
and embarrass myself?

342
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,110
Gao.

343
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,040
I see.

344
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,790
You're a talented young man.

345
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,960
It's normal that you don't want to work for others.

346
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,110
Here is my business card.

347
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,590
If you need

348
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,630
any financial and technical support next,

349
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,590
feel free to contact me.

350
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,720
Our company would love to support

351
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,390
young people with talent and ideas.

352
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,150
Hope we can cooperate.

353
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,550
Thank you.

354
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,110
Nice to meet you.

355
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,350
Nice to meet you.

356
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,110
Are you convinced?

357
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,150
What do you mean?

358
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,110
If you thought we couldn't do it from the beginning

359
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,520
and didn't intend to use our program,

360
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,680
why didn't you make it clear?

361
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,870
You made us waste

362
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,870
so much time and energy

363
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,240
and pull so many all-nighters for nothing!

364
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,200
I made four or five versions of a 40-odd page bid.

365
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,720
You played me!

366
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,590
Didn't I make it clear?

367
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,870
If you did not go on stage today to see for yourself

368
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,960
the difference between you and others,

369
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,070
you would always be so childish

370
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,200
and so stubborn.

371
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,920
We are a team.

372
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,680
I treat you like a brother and a comrade.

373
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,390
You left me out on stage today

374
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,790
to teach me a lesson and let everyone laugh at me.

375
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
What do you take me for?

376
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,200
Li Xun,

377
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,760
you can say what you want to say.

378
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,830
We'll just change it.

379
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,720
Is the website we made really that bad?

380
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,920
What do you think?

381
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,040
If I hadn't changed the bid,

382
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,920
you wouldn't even have a chance of being shortlisted.

383
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,240
You're right.

384
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,520
We are a team,

385
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,520
so all you have to do is

386
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
listen to me

387
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,150
and follow me.

388
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,870
I will lead you to success.

389
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,150
Pass the ball. Pass the ball.

390
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,390
This way. Pass it.

391
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,310
Again. Again.

392
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,920
Yes. Yes.

393
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,680
Surround him.

394
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,350
Come again.

395
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,240
I'll keep an eye on him.

396
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,000
Keep an eye on him.

397
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,390
Stop him.

398
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,390
Fine. Fine.

399
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,590
I quit. I quit. I quit.

400
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,830
Are you all right?

401
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,680
Yes.

402
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,350
Go. Go.

403
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,240
Are you all right?

404
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,790
Yes, I'm fine.

405
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,830
I'm going. Let's play another time.

406
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,240
I'm not playing. Bye.

407
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,720
Bye.

408
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,280
You were aggressive.

409
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,000
Thanks.

410
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,960
Did Li Xun ask you to come?

411
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,630
Yeah,

412
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,440
how could he let you come?

413
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,870
He doesn't care about anyone.

414
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,350
You know

415
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,590
what kind of person he is.

416
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,680
It's not your first day knowing him.

417
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,960
But

418
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,040
if it wasn't for Li Xun,

419
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,870
we would have been even more humiliated this time.

420
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,350
Zhu Yun,

421
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,350
you changed your mind pretty soon.

422
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,550
Did you become his fan?

423
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,200
I'm just being realistic.

424
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,350
Li Xun did nothing wrong.

425
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,040
He just did it his way.

426
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,590
Out of Blue Crown no one knows who we are.

427
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,760
Let me say something.

428
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,350
We won the bid for Blue Crown's project.

429
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,440
What?

430
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,200
Did we win the project?

431
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,960
Really?

432
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,550
We won the bid.

433
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,720
It's great that

434
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,280
we can win such a big project

435
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,390
in our first year.

436
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,200
I'll treat you to milk tea

437
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,240
in the afternoon.

438
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,270
Next, our base

439
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,590
will focus on this project.

440
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,760
Most of you will follow me to code,

441
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,870
and the rest will be

442
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,040
responsible for looking up the information

443
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,240
and building the database.

444
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,520
I will assign some tasks to each of you.

445
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,070
Although most of the proceeds from this project

446
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,200
will end up going to the school,

447
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,520
you will all get paid.

448
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,350
We can even make money.

449
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,350
Sure,

450
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,520
and we get extra marks

451
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,390
when we finish the project.

452
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,350
When our class is awarded as the outstanding class,

453
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,960
we can get a 3,000 yuan bonus.

454
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,760
Great!

455
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,000
Gao,

456
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,760
you guys did a great job.

457
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,590
Gao,

458
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,590
you're promising.

459
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,630
Thanks to the three of you.

460
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,310
Gao,

461
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,870
you have to buy us dinner.

462
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,680
Yes.

463
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,200
Why don't you tell them?

464
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,790
Tell them that

465
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,040
I had nothing

466
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,790
to do with the winning bid.

467
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,350
That day you went on stage and hit me in the face,

468
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,480
but today you save my face.

469
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,480
Li Xun,

470
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,590
do you think you're quite great?

471
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,280
It's just a project.

472
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,440
Do you have to do that?

473
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,040
I came to the base

474
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,920
to do the project properly.

475
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,200
I don't want to be fooled around.

476
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,870
Gao.

477
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,390
OK.

478
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,310
Time is tight and the task is heavy.

479
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,110
Let's get to work!

480
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,070
I quit.

481
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,720
Gao.

482
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,680
Gao. Gao.

483
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,790
Wu Mengxing, Fang Shumiao,

484
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,590
you are responsible for collecting

485
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,150
some online reviews

486
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,760
about Blue Crown's food and health products.

487
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,520
I'll take both good and bad reviews.

488
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,150
What's wrong again?

489
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,720
Can't you stop hurting people with your words?

490
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,070
Li Xun.

491
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,960
When I was young,

492
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,870
I especially liked to play with fire on the gas stove,

493
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,350
and always played with it when my mom and sister

494
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,920
were not around.

495
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,870
My mom always scolded me,

496
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,480
but I just didn't listen,

497
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,520
until one time...

498
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
Then I learned my lesson

499
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,070
and never played again.

500
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,150
You can tell me fables here.

501
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,830
Why can't you say something nice to Gao?

502
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,390
I have no obligation to coax you.

503
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,720
What do you take us for?

504
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,520
Do I treat you guys badly?

505
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,680
You should persuade Gao

506
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,070
not to quit, OK?

507
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,790
Gao can distinguish between right and wrong.

508
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,870
Do not worry,

509
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,630
he is not as delicate as you.

510
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,440
Let me have a look. Let me have a look.

511
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,310
Nothing. Let me have a look.

512
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,590
Return it to me.

513
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,720
What do you want from me?

514
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,310
Gao Jianhong,

515
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,920
do you want to make something

516
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,960
that is really your own?

517
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,760
How's it going?

518
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,830
Are you having a good time without me?

519
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,520
Gao,

520
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,350
you're back.

521
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,480
We really need you so much.

522
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,440
You're not here...

523
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,350
Really?

524
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,720
Gao,

525
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,750
here you are.

526
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,350
Yeah.

527
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,830
Morning.

528
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:34,870
Morning.

529
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Did you make up?

530
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,870
None of your business.

531
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,350
That's quite a bromance.

532
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,040
What did he say to you?

533
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,070
Couldn't I have figured it out

534
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,830
and come back on my own?

535
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,390
Li Xun is right.

536
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,040
I'll be stronger

537
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,630
with him.

538
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,390
Go.

539
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,440
Gao.

540
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,390
Morning.

541
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,870
Morning.

542
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,280
Slow down. Slow down.

543
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,960
Have you checked them?

544
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,790
Yes.

545
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,310
Rest assured.

546
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,150
Cookies. Cookies.

547
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,550
Cookies. Cookies.

548
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,870
Here. Here. Here.

549
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,350
This one should be eaten after a meal.

550
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,830
This one can be chewed directly.

551
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,760
Come here.

552
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,720
Where are we going?

553
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,390
I'm done with the search bar.

554
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,870
Just give me a day off.

555
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,150
I haven't agreed yet.

556
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,480
I haven't been back since yesterday.

557
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,200
I went back three days out of seven last week,

558
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,310
and all in the latter part of the night.

559
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,960
Look, I get pimples on my chin.

560
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,760
And I'm so hungry now.

561
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,000
I have enough snacks and health products.

562
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,830
I stink.

563
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,240
I didn't smell it.

564
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,630
Why have you learned to behave like a capitalist

565
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,760
before you become a boss?

566
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,790
I don't care. I have to go back today.

567
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,280
You have half an hour

568
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,830
to shower and change

569
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,000
before getting back to work.

570
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,830
It takes me ten minutes to walk back.

571
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,310
On my bike.

572
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,150
29 minutes to go.

573
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,920
Can you slow down a little bit?

574
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,040
Aren't you in a hurry?

575
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,600
♫Slowly miss you at the long night♫

576
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,080
♫A moment of palpitation♫

577
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,740
♫As long as you're by my side♫

578
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,800
♫I forgot time unconsciously♫

579
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,880
♫Slowly understand you on the long road♫

580
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,440
♫Without you, even joy feels lonely♫

581
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,540
♫Looking at your white shirt♫

582
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,020
♫I feel full warmth and endless love♫

583
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:57,960
♫The secret I've been hiding♫

584
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,060
♫I really want to be with you♫

585
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,460
♫At a moment, in the autumn of a fairy tale♫

586
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,300
♫The knight and princess are destined to meet♫

587
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,800
♫Let me feel and guard your♫

588
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,400
♫Simple wish♫

589
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,640
♫At a moment, in reversely flying days♫

590
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,440
♫I'm no longer afraid of the big world♫

591
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,920
♫By my side, or on my pillow♫

592
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,580
♫You say every good night♫

593
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,920
♫Happiness has never changed♫

594
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,000
In the last few days

595
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,960
many students have come to me for help

596
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,040
and asked me questions.

597
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,680
I understand very well.

598
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,150
Our course has just entered the practical stage,

599
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,720
and it is normal that you will encounter... - Where is he?

600
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
...some confusion.

601
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,040
But I want to tell you.

602
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,920
Don't think of the C language

603
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,760
too complicated.

604
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,680
I'll talk to Mr. Lin.

605
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,440
OK.

606
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,480
Mr. Lin.

607
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,520
Here comes Zhang Xiaobei.

608
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,150
Where?

609
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,680
There.

610
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,070
Wait a minute.

611
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,520
OK.

612
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,720
Share these copies with your classmates later.

613
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,830
The woman who just came to Old Lin

614
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,150
is called Zhang Xiaobei.

615
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,480
She was previously engaged in automation.

616
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,040
I wonder whose coattails she's on.

617
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,310
She has now joined Xinchuang

618
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,390
as a project director.

619
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,000
Center for School-Enterprise Cooperation of Graduate School

620
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,480
cooperates with Xinchuang, right?

621
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,870
She's in charge of it.

622
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,000
What is she doing here?

623
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,920
Do you know

624
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,630
how much money we can get for our project?

625
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,110
How much?

626
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,630
600,000 yuan.

627
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,150
That much?

628
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,000
Gao,

629
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,680
I have a bad feeling about this.

630
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,480
I think Zhang Xiaobei

631
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,070
is here for our project.

632
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
No need to doubt.

633
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,550
She is here for that project.

634
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,310
I'm starving.

635
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,720
Add some pepper.

636
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,830
Don't forget to eat.

637
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,920
Gao,

638
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,350
the day we went to bid,

639
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,200
we saw a tall, thin boy.

640
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,110
Do you remember?

641
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,750
I just remembered now.

642
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,480
He's Han Jiakang from Center for University-Enterprise Cooperation

643
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,350
of Graduate School.

644
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,520
So he works for Zhang Xiaobei, doesn't he?

645
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,280
It doesn't seem like a coincidence that

646
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,790
we went to bid

647
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,790
and met our own school's competitor, does it?

648
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,960
It's weird.

649
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,630
I can't help but think it's weird.

650
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,350
Unless they've been planning to take away the project for a long time.

651
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,870
You are responsible for the green part.

652
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,760
Time must be strictly controlled.

653
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,790
Li Xun, someone wants to take away Blue Crown's project.

654
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,110
Is Gao Jianhong here?

655
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,240
Here.

656
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,590
What's going on?

657
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,310
Shall we have a meeting?

658
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,870
Just a minute.

659
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,310
You're all here!

660
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,200
Miss Zhang.

661
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,550
I'll start with a brief introduction.

662
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,440
This is Zhang Xiaobei.

663
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,280
Miss Zhang is the project manager of Xinchuang.

664
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,520
Xinchuang has set up

665
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,550
Center for School-Enterprise Cooperation

666
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,390
with Graduate School.

667
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,630
These are your seniors.

668
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,390
Han Jiakang, Zhou Jinyang,

669
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,630
Yu Feng and Lin Jiajia.

670
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,270
Today I've called both sides together

671
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,630
because I want to tell you something.

672
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,550
Didn't our base win

673
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,550
a software outsourcing project?

674
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,400
Coincidentally,

675
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,670
Center for School-Enterprise Cooperation

676
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,110
has also applied for this project.

677
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,920
You two

678
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,110
collided.

679
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,440
What should we do?

680
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,590
I think you can have

681
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,360
win-win co-operation.

682
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,750
It's a good opportunity

683
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,550
for you

684
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,230
to learn from your seniors.

685
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,440
As for the name,

686
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,590
I think we should use Xiaobei's name.

687
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,110
After all, the graduate lab sounds more professional.

688
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,960
So he is

689
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,590
your favorite student, right?

690
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,440
I've heard about him for a long time.

691
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Your student

692
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,550
is extraordinary at first glance.

693
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,270
Don't flatter me.

694
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,320
I'm afraid of what he makes.

695
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,150
If you have any problems in the future,

696
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,840
you can call Zhu Yun,

697
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:11,960
my class rep.

698
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,440
She's reliable.

699
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,000
Xiaobei,

700
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,440
I have class in the afternoon.

701
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,480
I get to go.

702
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,360
You can have more exchanges.

703
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,000
OK.

704
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,520
OK.

705
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,590
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

706
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,270
Goodbye.

707
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,150
Goodbye, sir. Bye.

708
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,040
Although you are all undergraduates,

709
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,360
Mr. Lin and Miss Zhang told me that

710
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,440
you are excellent.

711
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,630
He wants to take this opportunity

712
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,960
of real practice

713
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,630
to train all of you.

714
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,040
If you have any problems or questions,

715
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,320
please feel free to ask me.

716
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,520
Of course, you can also contact your senior.

717
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,040
OK.

718
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,110
Why don't we just leave it at that?

719
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,750
Han Jiakang,

720
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,320
I need you to stay and talk with them.

721
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:02,880
OK?

722
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,360
You guys can get back to work.

723
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,550
Zhu Yun, keep his number.

724
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,360
138...

725
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,920
Senior,

726
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,710
when did you sign up?

727
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,960
You weren't among the companies that applied before, were you?

728
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,320
Had I known that graduate students would lead the team,

729
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,840
we would not have worked so hard.

730
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,550
How hard it was for us to pull so many all-nighters.

731
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,960
Although we didn't go on stage on the day of the presentation,

732
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,070
we actually prepared the materials.

733
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,800
What Miss Zhang means is that

734
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,190
we should not consume

735
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,230
and waste resources internally.

736
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,960
Yeah,

737
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,230
that's all we got.

738
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,110
Zhu Yun,

739
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,320
this cooperation is agreed by the school.

740
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
You should cooperate.

741
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,440
But it's our stuff.

742
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,480
From start to finish,

743
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,400
we wrote all the codes.

744
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,630
But we were never asked

745
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,270
if we agreed.

746
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,880
I told you we were working for nothing.

747
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,190
The reliable class rep has finished listening to the instructions.

748
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,710
Come out for a moment.

749
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,440
Get to work.

750
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,840
And you just said yes?

751
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,110
Didn't Mr. Lin just say it?

752
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,550
Win-win cooperation.

753
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,590
So what's the next?

754
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,040
I sent you the schedule.

755
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,880
Just follow it.

756
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,710
Why don't you stop acting like you don't care?

757
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,920
Do you really want to say yes?

758
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,230
So what do you want me to do,

759
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,270
and what can you do?

760
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,190
Are you willing to do that?

761
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,550
What does it mean?

762
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,480
Mr. Lin is dedicated to academic research

763
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,630
and never thinks about dishonest practices.

764
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,960
But even if he doesn't know,

765
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
you should know

766
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,670
what Zhang Xiaobei is here for.

767
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,000
If we work in her name,

768
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,590
then we are working for nothing.

769
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,320
I grew up

770
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,070
seeing a lot of people like her

771
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,400
who relied on big companies

772
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,880
to exploit students for cheap labor.

773
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,000
We can't just say yes.

774
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,440
There must be another way.

775
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,880
Besides, even without her,

776
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,960
we can finish the website

777
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,670
based on our strength

778
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,630
Your Highness,

779
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,440
you are full of confidence!

780
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,270
Aren't you mad at all?

781
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,840
Why should I be mad?

782
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,360
You usually

783
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,840
look down on this and that.

784
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Why don't you dare to fight

785
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,880
when you meet a tougher guy?

786
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,750
Is it useful to be mad?

787
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,800
Who gave the most to this project?

788
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,440
Who stayed up late every night?

789
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,480
Who did the planning?

790
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,000
Who built the framework?

791
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,360
How can you not be mad at all

792
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,590
and make such a joke?

793
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,040
Do you feel sorry for me?

794
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,960
I'm talking to you seriously.

795
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,320
Our whole base

796
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,230
has been working on this project for so long.

797
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,190
Even if you're not mad at it for yourself,

798
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,670
you should be mad at it for us.

799
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,270
Your Highness,

800
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,630
you really are too well protected.

801
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,520
There are a lot things

802
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,670
people like you will never understand.

803
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,000
Don't say something grandiose but impractical to me

804
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,960
like you've been here before.

805
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,880
Zhu Yun,

806
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,190
have you ever seen a bad person?

807
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,230
What do you mean?

808
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,630
Zhang Xiaobei is nothing.

809
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,400
There are many people who are much worse

810
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,040
than Zhang Xiaobei.

811
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,110
There are always people in this society

812
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,230
who will push you to your limits.

813
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,000
As I said,

814
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,750
there are some things you will never understand.

815
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,480
If I had to hold a grudge

816
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,670
for every single thing I've experienced,

817
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,270
I'd only be doing revenge

818
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,480
for the rest of my life.

819
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,520
Don't you care at all?

820
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,590
I don't have time to care.

821
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,040
It will be nothing else but lose-lose situation then.

822
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,710
She's not worth ruining my career for.

823
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,320
Li Xun,

824
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,550
is anyone

825
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,400
worth it to you?

826
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,150
I thought you saw us as friends.

827
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Your Highness,

828
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,070
don't be opinionated.

829
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,480
The company Zhang Xiaobei works for

830
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,840
has a partnership with the school.

831
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,630
She has a reason for the school-enterprise cooperation,

832
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,000
so it's useless for us to fight hard.

833
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,070
Go back to work.

834
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,360
It has been delayed for a day.

835
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,520
Li Xun.

836
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,880
The base is yours.

837
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,440
Blue Crown's project is also yours.

838
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,880
You have the right to give it away,

839
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,630
I also have the right to quit.

840
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,230
♫I pass by the world♫
Who does Zhang Xiaobei think she is?

841
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,520
♫I pass by the world♫
She came here to show off her authority.

842
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,270
♫And pass through the night♫
Then why should we give up?

843
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,680
♫And pass through the night♫
Li Xun.

844
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,150
You'll find a way out, right?

845
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,900
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
Blue Crown's website is out of date.

846
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,520
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
When Zhang Xiaobei finds out that she has been fooled by me,

847
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,240
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
she will never let me go easily.

848
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,120
♫It's the intuition of the dream♫

849
