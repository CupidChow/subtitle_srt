71
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,550
You also want to leave?

72
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,110
Mr. Gao,

73
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,470
I've worked for you since graduation.

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,400
When you plagiarized ideas from and undermined those small companies,

75
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
I always told myself

76
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
it is the rule of this world,

77
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,110
and the law of jungle is correct.

78
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,720
But now I think

79
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,040
you are too extreme.

80
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,350
What a good excuse!

81
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,470
Now you think?

82
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,470
L&P is sued,

83
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,110
so you're afraid and want to leave.

84
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,870
If you're really virtuous,

85
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,840
why didn't you leave when L&P made profits?

86
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,910
You want to leave because you think a company that

87
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,230
can't go public is unprofitable, don't you?

88
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,640
Now

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,600
you're all stung by conscience?

90
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,600
Go.

91
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,720
You go.

92
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,110
You all can go.

93
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,350
I don't need you.

94
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
Li Xun can climb the mountain alone.

95
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,670
Me too!

96
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,550
I'll go on fighting against him!

97
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,760
Mr. Gao,

98
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,840
a lady wants to see you.

99
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,760
I can't stop her.

100
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,350
What would you like to drink?

101
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,350
No need.

102
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,760
Coffee, okay?

103
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,520
Just get straight to the point.

104
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,760
You can't win Gao.

105
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,280
You want to persuade us to give up?

106
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,310
No,

107
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
I want cooperation.

108
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,600
You should persuade Gao Jianhong

109
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,400
but not us.

110
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,550
I'm leaving.

111
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,310
I have new clothes here.

113
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,430
How about wearing my clothes?

114
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,080
No need.

115
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,790

116
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,910

117
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,720
and return it to me another day.

118
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,280
No need.

119
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,960
Who can prove that this video is true?

120
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,350
Do you think I would make such a stupid mistake?

121
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,200
You can authenticate it.

122
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,430
This video is not edited at all.

123
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,550
Really?

124
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,840
Send it to me.

126

you rat.

127
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,160
I learn it from Li Xun.

He always has a manoeuvre.

129

130

You can also see whether Li Xun

132
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,880
can't give up you

133
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,310
or himself.

134
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,070
I also want to see

135
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,790
whether he really cares about someone.

136
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,000
For this war,

137
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,830
you involve so many people,

138
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,040

141

Is it worth doing?

Yes.

143

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,710
Really?

172
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,040
It's now the 5th trending topic.

173
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,670
Look, thousands of comments.

174
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,760
And hundreds of netizens share it.

175
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,790
Look.

176
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,880
A netizen even shares a group photo of them.

177
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,400
So clear.

178
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,590
So,

179
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,830
Zhu Yun's words were true.

180
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,280
There was enmity among them.

181
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,790
Then Li Xun hurt someone.

182
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,160
Here. Here. Here.

183
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,640
Let me add something.

184
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,430
They three were all my schoolfellows.

185
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:32,040
At that time, the woman was the right man's girlfriend.

186
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,190
Later, the right man

187
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,430
was imprisoned for blinding someone.

188
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,880
Finally, the woman and the boss of L&P were together.

189
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,880
Exactly the same.

Li Xun.

195
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,360
You drink?

196
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,710
Why did you do so?

197
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,040
I'd promised to reconcile with them.

198
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,880
I hate being threatened.

199
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,950
Why didn't you ask me before you made a decision?

200
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,520
I don't care about the rumor.

201
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,520
Even if everyone misunderstands me, I won't be afraid.

202
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,760
I want to do so.

203
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,120
But I don't want.

204
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,790
I don't want to waste our efforts.

205

You can't give in.

206

I don't allow.

207
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,830
They're not wasted.

208
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,880
As long as you're still by my side,

209

I don't suffer a loss.

230
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,280
But Li Xun is not such a romantic man.

231
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,390
It's so informal.

232

Zhu Yun,

234
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,280
don't indulge in love.

235
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,960
Career is the priority.

236
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,870
You're just ordinary colleagues.

237
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,070
You can do it, come on.

238
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,110
You're awake.

239
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,790
I had a drink yesterday,

240
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,680
so I react slowly.

241
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,200
Zhu Yun,

242
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,200
I've never expressed my love.

243
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,760
I liked a girl,

244
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,680
but I made her active

245
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,280
in being with me.

246
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,240
I don't have so much energy now,

247
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,870
and we've known each other for a long time,

248
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,830
so I go straight to the point.

249
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,870
Let's forget the past.

250
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,350
In the future,

251
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,280
would you like to be with me again?

252
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,870
I know it may not be a good time

253
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,110
to ask you this question.

254
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,760
If you think...

255
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,200
Yes!

256
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,310
Yes!

257
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,550
Yes!

258
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,280
Yes.

259
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:45,920
Yes.

260
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,630
Yes.

261
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,200
Li Xun,

262
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,830
I want to be with you.

263
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,070
Let's make up.

264
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,960
That's all?

265
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,240
Princess,

266
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,150
can you be a little reserved?

267
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,790
So this is confession.

268
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,680
So easy.

269
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,440
But I don't suffer a loss

270
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
because we're together again.

271
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,870
Did you think

272
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,390
you acted as my ordinary colleague

273
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,790
very well?

274
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,150
Yes.

275
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,110
Do you know you had long given yourself away?

276
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,240
Really?

277
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,790
You didn't take the initiative

278
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,550
and were afraid that we couldn't even be colleagues

279
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
after I refused you,

280
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,920
right?

281
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,240
Actually, you didn't need to be afraid.

282
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,830
If you asked

283
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
or mentioned it,

284
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,390

Hello, Lawyer Fang.

290
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,870
This is the lawyer of L&P.

291
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,480
Well,

292
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,680
in the previous hasty negotiation,

293
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,280
we hadn't talked about many details.

294
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,550
So,

295
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,110
we want to talk with Mr. Li

296
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,070
about them.

297
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,240
Lawyer Fang,

298
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,110
when is he free?

299
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,280
I had told you clearly before.

300
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,920
Mr. Li didn't want to reconcile with you.

301
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,480
Lawyer Fang,

302
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,350
well,

303
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,150
we can give you 50 million yuan.

304
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,240
You must be entrusted with many cases,

305
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,390
so you should know that

306
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,200
nobody can spend so much money on reconciliation.

307
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,350
OK.

308
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,240
I'll ask him.

309
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,350
Mr. Li agrees.

310
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,630
But he

311
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,240
only wants to talk with Mr. Gao alone.

312
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,390
Let's go.

313
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,960
Do you agree to reconciliation?

314
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,350
If you agree,

315
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,110
let's discuss about the compensation.

316
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,830
No need to delay it.

317
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,630
Now L&P is at a disadvantage.

318
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,110
You can claim more compensation.

319
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,390
Once L&P is no longer reviewed,

320
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,310
no matter whether it can go public or not,

321
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,350
I won't agree to reconciliation.

322
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,040
At the worst,

323
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,000
we'll both suffer great losses,

324
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,760
and you'll get nothing.

325
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,070
Are you convinced?

326
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,200
Gao Jianhong,

327
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,830
tell me whether you're convinced.

328
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,390
Do you remember

329
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,680
our last meeting here?

330
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,150
Was it joyful to keep an eye on me these days?

331
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,390
Was it pleasant to make trouble for me?

332
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,040
You can treat me as a wind vane,

333
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,070
but the climber

334
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,150
can't forget how high the mountain is.

335
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,520
Since you knew me,

336
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,070
you've never defeated me.

337
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,920
In the campus exam, off-campus project,

338
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,280
system software

339
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,960
or even small game,

340
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,830
you've never won.

341
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,200
You didn't defeat me before.

342
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,200
In the future,

343
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,200
you won't, either.

344
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,960
I gave you a chance to make a choice,

345
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,630
but you chose to fight against me.

346
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,390
We can be reconciled,

347
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,630
but you must tell me

348
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,520
whether you regret or not.

349
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,550
Tell me whether you regret or not!

350
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,550
No!

351
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,110
OK.

352
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,200
You don't regret. I think highly of you.

353
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,280
Remember your words.

354
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,350
I can't climb the mountain alone.

355
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,550
Keep it in mind.

356
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,960
I'm not climbing the mountain alone.

357
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,280
What's wrong with you, Gao?

358
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,720
Gao!

359
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:22,960
Are you all right?

360
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,310
Is there anyone outside?

361
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,070
Somebody!

362
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,350
Is there anyone outside?

363
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,440
What's up?

364
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,870
-Mr. Gao. -Mr. Gao.

365
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,440
Mr. Gao, are you all right?

366
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,070
Mr. Gao!

367
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,830
-Call an ambulance. Hurry up. -Mr. Gao.

368
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,280
-Are you all right, Mr. Gao? -Mr. Gao.

369
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,520
I don't know.

370
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,110
Why did he suddenly get a nosebleed?

371
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,520
Don't be anxious.

372
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,680
Go back to work.

373
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,830
Go. Go. Go.

374
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,550
Hou Ning said you were not at home,

375
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,150
so I thought you're here.

376
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,680
Why doesn't he regret?

377
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,680
Tell me

378
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,390
why he doesn't regret.

379
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,200
He hates me so much that

380
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,960
he must defeat me even if he'll die?

381
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,720
He's so stupid.

382
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,350
How can he defeat me?

383
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,000
He knows.

384
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,390
He knows it clearly.

385
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,960
He knows my strength better than anyone else.

386
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
Why did he drive himself into a corner?

387
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,440
You have nothing to do with Gao Jianhong's disease.

388
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,390
Really?

389
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,200
Today, I suddenly

390
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,590
understood Gao.

391
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,150
Like me,

392
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,040
Gao must live some despairing days.

393
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,350
We three

394
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,720
were driven into a corner

395
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,920
by the same thing.

396
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,390
You were isolated by steel bars.

397
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,720
Outside,

398
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,150
one of us chose to escape,

399
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,000
while the other one chose to go on.

400
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,550
What do you mean?

401
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,870
Tell me what you're thinking.

402
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,760
Don't let me guess it as before.

403
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,830
I don't want to guess now.

404
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,200
Do you also stand by him?

405
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,350
If I hound him to death,

406
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,390
what will you view me?

407
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,590
I'm here after all.

408
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,590
You're awake.

409
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,920
Why are you here?

410
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,590
Can't I be here?

411
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,960
Eat something.

412
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,790
Have some congee.

413
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,350
Minced Pork Congee with Preserved Egg.

414
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,920
I cooked it.

415
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,870
Have a taste.

416
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,870
You...

417
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,480
I returned my air ticket.

418
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,550
I'll look after you until your surgery is finished.

419
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,760
No need.

420
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,520
But your family needs to sign.

421
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,960
Lina,

422
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,280
I don't want you

423
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,720
to stay because of sympathy.

424
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,200
You have your own life.

425
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,070
I don't sympathize with you.

426
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,040
In the marriage vow,

427
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,790
we were asked

428
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,960
whether we're willing to stay together in wealth or poorness,

429
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,760
in sickness or health.

430
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,550
I said I am.

431
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,000
I just

432
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,880
don't want to go back on my word.

433
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,150
We're divorced.

434
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,190
Not yet.

435
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,480
The surgery is arranged at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

436
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,270
This is the notice.

437
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,110
Doctor,

438
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,840
is the success rate

439
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,270
of this surgery high?

440
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,480
Mrs. Gao,

441
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,230
as Mr. Gao always delayed the surgery,

442
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,550
his condition gets worse.

443
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,440
You have to be mentally prepared.

444
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,710
At work, you always led us

445
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,400
to the broadest and best road before,

446
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,230
but now you only keep an eye on Gao Jianhong.

447
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,520
He doesn't deserve your much attention.

448
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,840
Don't you want to knock him down?

449
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,230
I also thought it's the most important,

450
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
but now I think

451
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,880
your future and development are more important.

452
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,630
That day I saw you making a report

453
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
on Oculus' VR

454
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,670
and developing a new search algorithm

455
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,880
after work,

456
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,190
but you didn't go on with them.

457
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,630
You only wanted to deal with Gao Jianhong,

458
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,150
so you had no time.

459
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,000
I hate Fang Zhijing.

460
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,190
I hate Gao Jianhong more.

461
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,040
I hate them occupying L&P.

462
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,000
I hate them betraying us.

463
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,440
I hate them very much,

464
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,710
but I'm also afraid you're stuck in the mud.

465
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,110
Good night.

466
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,920
Lina,

467
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,230
if my surgery is a success,

468
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,400
let's go on honeymoon.

469
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,110
OK.

470
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,750
How about

471
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,590
selling our house

472
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,440
and studying abroad together?

473
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,800
We can apply for the offer of IC

474
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,670
and study for a degree together

475
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,150
as you planned when you were about to graduate from the university.

476
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,550
Wasn't going to IC

477
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,070
your dream?

478
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,840
I've forgot it.

479
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,270
It turns out that

480
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,670
this is my real dream.

481
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,110
Li Xun,

482
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,670
Xu Lina was right.

483
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,150
We shouldn't spend too much in hating someone.

484
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,320
Both the world and circle are small.

485
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,070
You'll fight again sooner or later.

486
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,550
Zhu Yun,

487
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,320
why do we become like this?

488
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,230
Do you remember

489
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,880
what Li Xun said?

490
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,920
Only at the beginning

491
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,440
can everything

492
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,670
stay at the same.

493
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,880
The further we walk,

494
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,480
the more different we'll be.

495
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,400
The patient Gao Jianhong

496
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,110
will be operated by Director Liang today, right?

497
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:22,630
Yes.

498
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,920
Didn't he eat 12 hours before the surgery

499
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,150
and drink water 4 hours before the surgery?

500
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,880
No,

501
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,230
he didn't.

502
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,840
OK.

503
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,880
Wait a moment.

504
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,230
We'll bring you there later.

505
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,270
OK, thank you.

506
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,440
Lina,

507
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,480
I want to see someone.

508
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,320
Zhu Yun.

509
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,320
How is Gao?

510
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,150
He wants to see Li Xun,

511
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,590
or else he won't undergo surgery.

512
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,270
You go to persuade him.

513
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,440
He still doesn't want to see me?

514
