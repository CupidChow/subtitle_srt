22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,120
Why didn't you answer my call?

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
You can find me anyway.

24
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,350
Tell me.

25
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,670
What are you up to tonight?

26
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,720
There's nothing to tell.

27
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,720
Don't you think you should explain it?

28
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,400
While I can still accept your apology.

29
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,280
Explain what?

30
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,070
There's no way.

31
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,670
I just can't stand people like you.

32
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,320
What kind of people are we?

33
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,750
Your mom is right.

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,190
People like us

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,070
are scheming for profits

36
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,750
and anxious to achieve quick success and get instant benefits.

37
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,950
And people like you

38
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,880
are cold and heartless,

39
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,510
looking superior.

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,670
You take studying abroad as a handout

41
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,190
and always look superior to teach others a lesson.

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,600
So you deliberately stimulated them?

43
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,350
Yes.

44
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,230
In fact, I'm very happy to see them getting furious.

45
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,440
Because they let you go abroad with me

46
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,750
and you don't have to pay the tuition?

47
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,600
You make up those words to stimulate them?

48
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,600
You don't care they’re my parents?

49
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,280
This is your first official meeting.

50
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,190
You don't care how I face them in the future

51
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,630
and whether they still accept us?

52
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,560
Do you think they will?

53
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,160
Even if I listen to them.

54
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,440
Then you can at least try.

55
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,510
You also proposed meeting them today.

56
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,160
Like today, I really doubt you.

57
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,950
What do you doubt?

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,120
Tell me what you doubt?

59
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,280
I doubt your intentions.

60
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
I just said what I would say later.

61
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,870
You will face this problem sooner or later.

62
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,350
Go home.

63
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,230
What do you mean?

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
It’s what you understand.

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,350
You made my parents so angry.

66
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,350
Can I go home?

67
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,790
Otherwise?

68
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,550
You want to stay tonight?

69
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,310
Li Xun.

70
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,720
I think it’s not too much for me to ask you

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,550
apologize to me for what happened today, right?

72
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,080
You can let me go.

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,350
Then think it over.

74
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,720
After I leave today,

75
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,760
will I come back?

76
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,520
That's your choice.

77
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,310
Okay.

78
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,520
You said it.

79
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,790
So Li Xun quarreled with your mom

80
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,230
and then you quarreled with him?

81
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,840
Marvelous.

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,040
He was quite

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,760
strange today.

84
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,430
You know.

85
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,600
But I can imagine

86
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
how your mom reacted.

87
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,430
Li Xun was born to be educated for her.

88
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,640
Ms. Liu's high-toed manner

89
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,910
must force him to show his true colors.

90
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,200
Besides, Li Lan has just died.

91
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,600
He must have not let it go.

92
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,040
You're helping him find a reason.

93
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,200
You know what?

94
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,760
If he didn't explain it to me today,

95
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,960
I won’t go back.

96
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,110
Then what happened to him?

97
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,430
There must be a reason for abnormality.

98
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,870
Is he hiding something from you recently?

99
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,470
Zhu Yun.

100
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,310
Isn’t Li Xun going to

101
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,400
to meet your parents at your home today?

102
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,640
I saw him staying with Xu Lina.

103
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,870
Where are you going?

104
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,670
You broke your words too fast.

105
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,350
No, I still have to find a reason to ask him.

106
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,280
I forgot something.

107
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,550
Take it.

108
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,600
Li Xun.

109
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,760
We can talk

110
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,400
if something happened to you, right?

111
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,870
I'm in a bad mood tonight.

112
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,470
So I had a bad attitude.

113
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,200
But you are worse.

114
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,600
I won’t let this go so easily.

115
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,470
But I can forget about this now.

116
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,430
I just want to know,

117
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,600
before going to my home today,

118
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,400
why did you go?

119
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,470
Didn't you come back for the key?

120
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,600
Is this important?

121
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,160
Do you know the golden 24-hour principle?

122
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,480
If some misunderstandings are not resolved in time,

123
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,160
they will lead to greater ones.

124
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,670
I think my guessing

125
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,310
is irresponsible.

126
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,590
So can you tell me

127
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,400
what you did

128
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,190
and whom you met today?

129
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,040
Don't think I don't know.

130
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,670
Fang Shumiao told me.

131
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,520
The bathroom in your company is quite far.

132
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,400
Why is she here?

133
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,670
Why can't I be here?

134
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,790
This is not a misunderstanding.

135
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,640
♫Do you feel regret? ♫

136
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,880
♫Forget him. ♫

137
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,070

♫Wipe away tears.♫

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,310
♫And send him away. ♫

140
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:56,430
♫Like two parallel lines,
we will not be concerned about each other again.♫

141
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:11,400
♫Turn into a one-person lonely island.♫

142
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,310
You are awake.

143
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,790
What song is this?

144
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,070
A new song I'm writing.

145
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,640
I haven't determined a name yet.

146
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,480
Cheer up.

147
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,670
You’ve make up in a few days.

148
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
After I finish this song,

149
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,670
I'll give it to you as a graduation gift

150
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,710
and sing it to you on the graduation day.

151
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,520
Hello. Hello.

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,160
Hello, this is Xu Lina.

153
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,360
I'm looking for Zhu Yun.

154
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,280
Zhu Yun.

155
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,040
For you.

156
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,400
I won't answer his call.

157
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,550
It's Xu Lina.

158
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,190
Hello.

159
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,590
Zhu Yun, are you free?

160
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,760
Let's meet.

161
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,040
Zhu Yun.

162
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,590
I've never liked you very much.

163
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,590
It doesn’t matter.

164
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,910
I don't like you either.

165
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,910
We are about to graduate.

166
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,790
What's your plan?

167
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,480
It's none of your business.

168
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,430
My father set up a fund for me.

169
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,760
Recently, I've been running back and forth in several cities

170
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,040
to investigate projects.

171
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,280
I prefer those at the conceptual stage,

172
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,910
so I can participate in them

173
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,190
during incubation.

174
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
It will give me a sense of achievement

175
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,430
and the rate of return will be high.

176
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
I heard one

177
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,360
interesting business plan yesterday.

178
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,640
The slogan is

179
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,550
to increase the cure rate of cancer by 1%.

180
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
I'm quite interested in this company.

181
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,120
L&P, are you familiar with it?

182
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,640
So I asked you out today

183
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,790
because of this.

184
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,000
I think highly of this company.

185
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,830
Since your parents don't have this vision,

186
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,160
I'll invest in it.

187
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,830
But the condition is that,

188
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,790
you're out.

189
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,190
Then you can try.

190
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,590
If I don't agree,

191
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,880
can you take it away?

192
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,160
It doesn't matter.

193
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,070
Li Xun has promised me.

194
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,520
What did he agree with you?

195
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,070
Didn't he tell you?

196
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,880
It seems that you are really not important to him.

197
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,550
If you want to test me

198
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,640
with bluff and bluster,

199
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,790
that's ridiculous.

200
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,000
If you want to control Li Xun,

201
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,520
that's even more impossible.

202
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,040
He won't accept you.

203
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,360
He's not under anyone's control.

204
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,160
Then you still don't know him well enough.

205
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,520
Have you considered

206
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,710
how much time and cost must be paid

207
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,040
to achieve that goal?

208
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,670
The internet technology development

209
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,040
is much faster than you think.

210
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,430
As long as we can master the first-hand clinical data,

211
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,830
under the integration of big data,

212
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,360
we'll see its value soon.

213
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,590
Where is the data?

214
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,790
We have mastered

215
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,550
the diagnostic data of core departments of major hospitals.

216
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,830
China is too big.

217
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,640
You only made a few statistics

218
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,280
and become arrogant?

219
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,550
There's still a long way to go.

220
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,360
I’m willing to do it.

221
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,910
You’re willing?

222
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,520
Is he willing?

223
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,160
You are pathetic.

224
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,430
You don't even know if someone sold you.

225
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,520
Li Xun told me personally

226
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,400
he doesn't want to waste time

227
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,950
but to develop L&P as soon as possible.

228
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,710
By the way, here is a tip.

229
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,640
We're on our way.

230
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,790
What are you up to?

231
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,120
Meet my dad.

232
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:33,520
Let's go.

233
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,160
Okay. Let’s go.

234
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,760
Li Xun.

235
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,550
Wait for me in the car for a while.

236
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Where are you going?

237
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,480
When are you going to tell me?

238
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,430
After coming back.

239
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,060
With Xu Lina?

240
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,520
She said you promised her.

241
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,670
What did you promise her?

242
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,000
Shares.

243
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,710
It doesn't matter if it’s Xu Lina or others.

244
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,400
Now, as long as someone is willing to invest in it,

245
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,520
I can promise to

246
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,520
give up that 50% of the shares.

247
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,240
That 50% you said

248
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,000
belongs to me?

249
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,000
It used to be.

250
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,880
So before you met my parents,

251
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,550
you’ve decided it, right?

252
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,950
No.

253
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,520
Since you asked for the shares back,

254
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,480
you have decided to exclude me, right?

255
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,150
Kind of.

256
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,100
What if I don't agree?

257
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,280
Legally speaking,

258
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,240
you don't have this right now.

259
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,440
I don't have this right?

260
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,150
So you won’t say

261
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,150
one more word to me?

262
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,870
Have we reached this point?

263
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,480
Emotionalism is a burden for everyone.

264
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,150
The two of us fight alone,

265
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,790
which looks brave.

266
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,550
But if one day when we break up

267
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,960
because of the problem of funds,

268
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,070
you'll regret it.

269
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,790
What do you think of me?

270
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,680
I just don't want you to regret.

271
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,240
That is my business.

272
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,070
You must go today, don't you?

273
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,630
Think it twice.

274
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,390
What exactly do you want?

275
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,150
Go home.

276
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,110
Don't let your parents worry.

277
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,630
Li Xun.

278
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,240
If you take one more step forward today,

279
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,680
we will break up.

280
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,830
What happened exactly?

281
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,280
Are you hiding something from me?

282
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,350
What are you planning?

283
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,000
Nothing.

284
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,040
This is what I want.

285
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,500

321
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,110
My dad works up there.

322
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,480
Are you sure

323
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,280
you don't want to go up with me to meet him?

324
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,310
Thanks this time.

325
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,720
I cooperated with you to tell such a big lie.

326
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,390
You owe me a favor.

327
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,440
I will repay you.

328
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,630
What are you going to replay me?

329
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,040
How about

330
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,110
you give me a chance?

331
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,200
I know

332
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,240
you won't accept my dad's help.

333
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,870
But

334
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,870
I can work hard with you.

335
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,000
I can accompany you to start a business.

336
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,760
I've made up my mind before I came here this time.

337
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,280
I can give up

338
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,200
clothes and shoes,

339
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,960
bags and cars.

340
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,790
I can leave everything they give me behind.

341
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,520
Xu Lina.

342
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,040
I haven't finished yet.

343
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,590
I can also accompany you to have box lunch

344
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,200
and live in a small house.

345
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,590
I can do whatever

346
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,200
she can do.

347
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,200
Am I worth

348
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,310
a chance now?

349
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,720
I've made a lot of mistakes

350
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,110
and I love to flaunt my superiority.

351
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,200
I have a sharp tongue.

352
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,110
You don't need any chance I give you.

353
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,240
I don't deserve to hold myself aloof.

354
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,870
You deserve a better man.

355
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,150
That's how I refuse others.

356
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,480
I'm leaving.

357
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,830
Li Xun.

358
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,790
What on earth do you want to do

359
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,870
now that you drove Zhu Yun away

360
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,440
with such efforts this time?

361
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,240
I always feel insecure when you act like this.

362
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,720
Don't think too much.

363
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,040
I'm just annoyed by her.

364
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,240
That’s it.

365
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,390
Does Zhu Yun know this?

366
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,000
You’d better not tell her.

367
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,340
You're holding

368
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,960
her shares now.

369
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
At this moment,

370
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,790
you're still in the mood to joke?

371
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,070
In the future,

372
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,390
she'll learn it.

373
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,110
She would come and ask me.

374
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,550
What I answer her?

375
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,870
How will she think of me?

376
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,390
I’m not afraid.

377
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,590
What are you afraid of?

378
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,960
Of course you don't have to be afraid.

379
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,870
You don't have to think about this.

380
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,280
But I do.

381
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,200
You don't have to worry about her.

382
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,000
She will go abroad

383
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,630
and leave here.

384
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,830
She doesn't need to pester everything.

385
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,590
I leave this company

386
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,550
to you.

387
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,350
I’ll try my best.

388
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,040
Li Xun.

389
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,000
Thank you for trusting me.

390
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,350
Gao.

391
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,680
I have no family.

392
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,790
I don't have any friends.

393
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,310
You may have hated me.

394
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,760
But you are the person I trust most.

395
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,310
I made you cancel the competition.

396
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,870
I have been very sorry.

397
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,960
This company

398
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,760
can give you a place to stay.

399
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,150
I'm sure

400
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,520
will run it well as we said.

401
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,390
What are you going to do with Fang Zhijing?

402
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,630
I don't know.

403
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,790
I agree with you to teach him a lesson.

404
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,350
Scum like him

405
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,280
should be dealt with in an unusual means.

406
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,070
But I don’t think

407
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,040
he is worth risking our future.

408
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,040
Is it worthwhile

409
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,440
to hurt ourselves

410
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,440
in order to deal with the enemy?

411
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,200
Not at all.

412
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,200
But something

413
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,920
must be done.

414
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,480
Gao.

415
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,790
Tomorrow

416
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,200
is the last day of the information security competition.

417
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,000
Yes.

418
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,070
Tomorrow is the final award presentation.

419
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,830
How is it?

420
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,870
It’s okay.

421
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,440
You don't know

422
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,110
how hard it is for me to win the first prize this time.

423
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,960
You're mad at your mom?

424
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,000
Yun,

425
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,550
you're an adult.

426
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,960
Sometimes you have to learn to think in terms of others.

427
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,870
You have to figure out why your parents

428
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,550
do this to you.

429
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,390
And for an outsider,

430
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,000
you go against your parents like this.

431
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,240
By the way,

432
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,350
we have squeezed time.

433
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,830
Let's go to Sanya to celebrate the Spring Festival this year.

434
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,550
That bastard Fang Zhijing said that

435
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,040
Li Lan asked him

436
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,350
where there was a cheap hotel,

437
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,590
so he kindly introduced one to her.

438
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,830
I think

439
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,630
he was just afraid you'd get in his way

440
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,550
in the finals,

441
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,790
so he tricked Li Lan out of there to scare you.

442
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,040
Won’t he

443
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,000
come back for the finals?

444
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,390
-Since high school… -Dad….

445
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,200
Today is the 18th?

446
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,520
Today is the 18th?

447
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,310
Yeah.

448
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,310
What's up?

449
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,280
Stop.

450
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,520
Yun.

451
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,070
Where are you going?

452
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,960
Now I will read out the list of winners.

453
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,200
Team from Anhua University.

454
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,310
Team leader, Shao Bing.

455
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,830
Team from University of Electronic Science and Technology.

456
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,830
Team from Information Engineering University.

457
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,240
Team from Hengjiang University of Posts and Telecommunications.

458
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,440
Team leader, Zhao Zijie.

459
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,720
Congratulations.

460
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,040
Finally, I announce

461
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,920
the team that won the first place is

462
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,150
the team from Information Technology University.

463
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,200
Team leader, Fang Zhijing.

464
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,920
Let's welcome the leaders of the organizing committee to present awards to them.

465
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,680
Let’s welcome their team leader Fang Zhijing

466
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,920
to deliver an acceptance speech.

467
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,070
Respected leaders

468
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,280
and teachers,

469
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,280
dear students,

470
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,440
hello.

471
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,590
Great.

472
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,350
First of all,

473
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,240
I would like to thank in particular

474
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,760
our guiding teachers

475
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,790
judges

476
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,550
and teachers of organizing committee.

477
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,550
Thanks for your hard work.

478
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,110
Secondly,

479
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,920
I also want to thank all the students who participated in the competition.

480
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,590
Without your enthusiastic efforts,

481
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,240
we wouldn’t collide

482
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,480
such a passionate spark.

483
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,630
Thank you all.

484
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,680
Great. Great.

485
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,200
I believe that in the future,

486
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,200
the general trend of information security development

487
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,920
is a kind of great security from traditional security

488
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,350
towards the
integration and opening.

489
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,830
With the continuous development of the Internet,

490
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,520
the traditional network boundary no longer exists.

491
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,310
Traditional security technology

492
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,550
can no longer meet the needs of the new generation.

493
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,200
With the development of network security technology,

494
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,680
whether enterprises or individuals,

495
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,760
all will have changing demands

496
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,550
for information security.

497
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,440
And these changes

498
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,440
will bring a huge impact to

499
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,150
the future Internet applications and services

500
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,520
and it will also bring new challenges to information security.

501
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,670
But at the same time,

502
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,880
it will also bring us new opportunities,

503
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,150
new data,

504
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,880
new applications.

505
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,270
New, new applications,

506
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:31,070
new computing and new networks will become a new generation.

507
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,750
Li Xun!

508
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,040
Stop. Stop now.

509
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,150
Guards! Where are the guards?

510
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,000
Stop him.

511
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,710
What are you doing, Li Xun?

512
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,800
Pull him away! Pull him away.

513
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,840
Pull him away.

514
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,040
Leave now.

515
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,230
Yun.

516
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,360
You've been sleeping all day.

517
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,150
Would you like to eat something?

518
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,590
What are you looking for?

519
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,920
Dad, where's my cell phone?

520
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,070
I’ve take it away.

521
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,070
Have a good rest at home these days.

522
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,000
Don't contact the outside world.

523
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,960
Give me back my cell phone.

524
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,550
Yun.

525
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,360
You shout at me again.

526
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,520
Did I tell you earlier

527
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,800
Li Xun would cause a great trouble sooner or later?

528
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,400
Now you see it?

529
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,920
See what he did.

530
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,800
Isn't it just a fight?

531
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,800
Just a punishment record.

532
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,190
He can drop out of school.

533
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,550
He doesn't care anyway.

534
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,630
What's the big deal?

535
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,270
What’s the big deal?

536
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,190
Yes.

537
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,440
Fang Zhijing is rescued.

538
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,480
But his left eye ball is removed.

539
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,800
Hundreds of people on site

540
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
watched him

541
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,000
blinding another man.

542
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,670
That’s horrible.

543
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,920
In my opinion,

544
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,230
his sister died because of him.

545
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,670
For such people,

546
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,190
that’s eye for eye.

547
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,150
I beg your pardon?

548
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,960
I said it’s eye for eye.

549
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,840
What’s wrong?

550
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,360
Now this matter has widely spread.

551
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,550
Do you think the Fang family will spare him?

552
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,000
Their own child

553
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,710
is blinded by him.

554
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,000
You can see how they deal with him.

555
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,840
Then I'll find him.

556
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,550
No need. He has been detained.

557
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,110
You can't go anywhere.

558
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm going to meet him.

559
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
You go abroad now.

560
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,110
I won’t go.

561
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,180
Mom, look at him.

562
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,520
Are you going to make it more troublesome, huh?

563
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,270
Zhu Yun!

564
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,750
You're an adult now.

565
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,480
Why can’t you tell right from wrong?

566
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,270
Is this a small matter?

567
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,840
Their child is blinded.

568
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,630
The rest of his life is over.

569
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,550
You're still backing that bastard?

570
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,360
What about Li Xun?

571
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,550
Why don’t you

572
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,880
think about Li Xun's future?

573
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,520
What future does he have

574
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,710
after he did such a thing?

575
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,710
Whether Fang Zhijing is blind or dead

576
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,320
has nothing to do with me.

577
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,840
Don't hit her.

578
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,920
How can you say that?

579
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,190
Yun.

580
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,360
You are now

581
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,360
quite strange for us.

582
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,320
No matter what Li Xun did today,

583
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,840
I will definitely go to meet him.

584
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,670
Let me out.

585
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,320
Defendant Li Xun,

586
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,000
at about 1:30 p.m.

587
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,070
in the afternoon of January 18, 2016,

588
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,920
in the No.1 Lecture Hall of Nanhu University,

589
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,230
beat the victim,

590
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:54,750
causing serious injury to the victim's face and eye.

591
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,040
According forensic identification,

592
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:01,190
the victim’s bilateral nasal bones and nasal septum have fracture injury

593
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,710
and left eyeball was removed,

594
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
constituting serious injury.

595
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,440
According to the public prosecution authority,

596
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,190
the defendant intentionally injured others

597
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,320
and caused serious consequences of serious injury to others.

598
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,110
Thus behavior has violated

599
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,230
the regulation of Article 234

600
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,270
of “Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China.”

601
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,440
Yun, eat something.

602
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,400
The defendant should take criminal responsibility

603
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,880
and we recommend a sentence of more than three years

604
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,360
and up to 10 years in prison.

605
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,590
Defendant,

606
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,880
do you have anything to say to the victim?

607
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,800
No.

608
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:48,880
Doctor.

609
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,270
How is she?

610
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,320
She is suffering from qi deficiency

611
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,590
and urgent congestion.

612
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,400
She has signs of depression.

613
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,960
Nine out of

614
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,520
ten people suffering from depression

615
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,360
have tendency of committing suicide.

616
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,670
You need to watch her this time.

617
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,110
Thank you.

618
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,840
Have you prepared everything for going abroad?

619
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,920
Yes.

620
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,150
She must leave this year.

621
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,270
She must leave.

622
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,270
Yun,

623
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,070
you've been calm for so long.

624
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,360
Listen to me.

625
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,480
I've arranged everything

626
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,270
for you to study abroad.

627
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,040
As long as you nod your head,

628
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,110
we can leave anytime.

629
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,480
Listen to me.

630
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,070
Go out and relax.

631
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,520
Change an environment.

632
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,630
Maybe you will be fine.

633
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,190
Yun.

634
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,320
You don't eat or drink all day.

635
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,400
You torture yourself like this.

636
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,520
If you’re determined to destroy yourself

637
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,750
for that boy

638
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,880
and make your parents suffer for a lifetime,

639
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,270
we'll let you go.

640
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,400
It's up to you.

641
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,110
Dad.

642
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,400
Mom.

643
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,630
Can you promise me one thing?

644
