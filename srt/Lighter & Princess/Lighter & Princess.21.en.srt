[Episode 21]

00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,990
It costs more than 500 yuan staying here one night.

22
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,440
I stay here just because

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,680
it's near the venue.

24
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,160
Young man,

25
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,600
can I cancel the reservation?

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,470
Of course.

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,520
I'm also looking for a cheaper hotel.

28
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,470
Do you know

29
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,630
where there is a cheaper one?

30
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,720
I know one,

31
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,120
but it's out of the way.

32
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,840
That's a long way to go.

33
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,320
Sure,

34
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
a cheap hotel

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,840
is usually far away.

36
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,560
Indeed.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,720
Renxin is really a big hospital.

38
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,040
Dean Han does have a steady hand.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Did you see that?

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,350
Their equipment is so much more advanced

41
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,000
that we can even see the details.

42
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,400
Director,

43
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,000
that is not their equipment.

44
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,510
It is a new medical software,

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,510
and can broadcast

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,470
live surgery in full HD in multiple stands,

47
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,670
and record, store and play surgery

48
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,880
for a long time.

49
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,400
It'd be so much easier for us to play it for the students.

50
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,230
The clarity is also high.

Director Chen,

54
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,070
the video of the surgery has been uploaded.

55
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,070
It can be accessed at any time in the future.

56
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,000
I just watched the whole thing.

57
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,470
There were dozens of other hospitals watching it too.

58
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,280
You guys did a really good job.

59
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,160
Thank you.

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,960
Now the fourth generation of mobile communication technology network

61
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,640
has just emerged.

62
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,430
Only the most basic live surgery and remote consultation

63
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,230
have been achieved so far.

64
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,720
When the fifth generation of mobile technology arrives,

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,310
remote surgery will be possible.

66
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,350
Technology is moving so fast.

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,910
It's up to you young people.

68
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,230
Checked out?

69
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,670
Who told her to check out?

70
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,790
We can't stop a guest

71
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,840
from checking out herself.

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
OK. Thank you.

73
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,720

I could buy three of them out there.

94
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,200
moved to a cheaper hotel.

Where are you?

106
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,720

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,310
Zhu Yun,

110
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,080
we are talking to you.

111
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,350
Why do you turn a deaf ear to it?

112
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,720
Where are you going?

113
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,110
Get out of your stupor and go after him.

114
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,880
No idea where she's going in the middle of the night.

115
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,590
Come on.

Yun.

117
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,590
Zhu Yun, Li Lan was in a car accident.

118
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,160
That bastard Fang Zhijing said that

119
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,480
Li Lan asked him where there was

120
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,910
a cheap hotel,

121
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,400
so he kindly introduced one to her.

122
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,280
I think,

123
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,280
I think he was just afraid you'd get in his way

124
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,240
in the finals,

125
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,400
so he tricked Li Lan out of there to scare you.

126
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,910
He took off early in the morning after his confession.

127
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,590
We know he did it, but we can't do anything about it.

128
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,120
That's annoying.

129
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,400
Won't he

130
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,550
come back for the finals?

131
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,910
Gao, stop it.

132
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,360
Dagang,

133
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,830
that was an accident.

134
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,670
Your wife can't be brought back to life.

135
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,040
You still have a long way to go.

136
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,830
Dagang.

137
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,480
She was fine.

138
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,000
You insisted on her having the surgery.

139
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,310
Why did you ask her to have surgery?

140
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,880
Dagang. Dagang, calm down.

141
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,300
- Calm down. 
- Let go of me.

142
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,710
- Let go of me. 
- Get over here.

143
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,240
Get over here.

144
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,480
- Calm down. 
- Let go of me.

145
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,910
What are you doing?

146
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,760
Let go of me.

147
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,590
Calm down.

148
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,520

172
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,640
Me?

173
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,550
I go to bed.

174
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,300
♫Luckily, I had seen you throughout four seasons♫

175
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,900
♫I think they're getting old♫

176
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,260
♫Where are they♫

177
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,760
That's just the way he is.

178
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,790
He keeps everything in mind,

179
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,360
but he pretends not to.

180
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,670
He cares,

181
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,520
but he acts like he doesn't.

182
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,100
♫Lalala, I miss them♫

183
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,620
♫Lalalala, lalalala♫

184
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,260
♫Are they blooming♫

185
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,550
Li Xun,

186
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,310
the police investigated it.

187
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,000
The driver of the truck also pleaded guilty.

188
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,480
Fang Zhijing deserves to die,

189
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,590
but the law doesn't hold him accountable.

190
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,000
With my dad gone,

191
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,520
I had to take care of my mom and my sister,

192
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,120
but I couldn't make it.

193
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,950
It is

194
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,950
our destiny after all.

195
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,160
We have to accept it.

196
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,460
♫And scattered in the horizon♫

197
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,700
♫I think they're getting old♫

198
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,360
You can't just give up because of an accident.

199
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,120
You still have me.

200
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,940
♫Our separate ways♫

201
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It snows.

202
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,760
Look.

203
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,960
It melts.

204
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,590
This is unscientific.

205
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,350
I am cold-blooded.

206
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,240
Because you're taller than me.

207
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,000
Your Highness,

208
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,870
do you have a dream?

209
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,070
My dream is

210
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,110
to marry my first love.

211
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,680
Then I don't have to ask who it is.

212
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,720
Is my dream easy to come true?

213
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,520
What are you going to do with me

214
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,310
if I ever go wrong?

215
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,630
Death by a thousand cuts

216
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,920
and you'll go to hell.

217
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,630
Forget about it.

218
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,720
Li Xun.

219
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,310
Well, remember,

220
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,550
you said it yourself.

221
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,310
Betrayers shall go to hell.

222
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,720
I never expected that the weight of a casual sentence

223
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,480
has become so heavy.

224
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,760
Maybe

225
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,680
I didn't get what Li Xun meant.

226
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,720
I thought

227
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,200
that moment was the beginning of our happiness,

228
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,280
but I didn't expect

229
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,920
it was the end of everything.

230
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,920
Yeah,

231
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,760
we can ensure that the system error rate

232
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,000
is less than one percent.

233
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,630
Yeah, Jiahe Hospital

234
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,070
is using our system now.

235
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,040
Okay, so let me show you.

236
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,960
See you later.

237
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,110
Li Xun,

238
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,630
I have to go.

239
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,280
Go ahead.

240
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,920
Zhu Yun,

241
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,110
I have something to tell you.

242
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,040
I'd like to transfer your shares to me first.

243
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,280
OK.

244
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,390
Don't you ask why?

245
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,240
Do I need to ask?

246
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,630
Go.

247
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,440
I'm leaving.

248
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,590
I went back to the office and didn't find you.

249
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,040
What are you doing here?

250
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,720
Why do you suddenly want to fix it?

251
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,390
Didn't you say that if the chair didn't rattle,

252
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,110
you wouldn't be able to type code in rhythm?

253
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,310
Did your mom call you again?

254
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,550
She called many times.

255
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,280
Take me to your parents.

256
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,830
It's just a matter of time.

257
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,240
I can't keep avoiding.

258
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,480
Don't you believe me?

259
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,480
Of course not.

260
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,200
It's just that my mom…

261
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,110
I know.

262
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,240
Your parents have a problem with me.

263
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,550
There's a good chance

264
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,440
they'll embarrass me when I meet them.

265
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,550
It's okay.

266
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,440
I have to handle them.

267
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,720
I don't want you to be caught in the middle anymore.

268
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,790
Forget it.

269
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,590
Take your time.

270
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,480
It's been a really special time.

271
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,200
I'm sure they're worried about

272
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,280
your future plans.

273
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,440
No matter what we're going to do,

274
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,150
I have to say something, right?

275
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,110
Otherwise,

276
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,000
we don't look serious.

277
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Li Lan is gone.

278
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,760
You're all I got.

279
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,870
Gao.

280
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,720
What brought you here?

281
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,960
Can't I come to see you?

282
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,390
This is the legendary base.

283
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,040
What's going on?

284
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,110
Are you moving?

285
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,550
We are about to graduate.

286
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,240
The base is dissolved.

287
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,310
Are you really here for me,

288
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,240
or are you just here

289
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,200
for another information contest?

290
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,240
I'm here for Li Xun.

291
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,480
He said you guys were starting a business.

292
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,240
That's Zhu Yun and Li Xun's company.

293
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,040
I'll find a way out

294
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,520
on my own.

295
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,830
So where are you going?

296
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,680
Don't bother yourself with me.

297
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,790
What do you want with Li Xun?

298
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,870
He invited me here.

299
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,150
Did he?

300
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,000
Yes, I did.

301
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,310
Gao.

302
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,680
Give me a second.

303
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,310
I need to talk to you later.

304
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,310
Go.

305
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,550
Let's talk outside.

306
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,520
Stir-fry some broccoli.

307
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,720
What's going on?

308
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,150
Don't be late today.

309
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,760
Hello. Are you here?

310
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,680
I'll come out to pick you up.

311
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,240
Zhu Yun.

312
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,150
Isn't Li Xun going to meet your parents

313
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,200
in your home today?

314
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,000
Shumiao.

315
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,070
Yeah, I got an appointment with him.

316
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,390
Did he go?

317
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,790
What happened?

318
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,150
I saw him with Xu Lina.

319
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,790
I don't even have to pick you up. You know the way.

320
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,070
After all, you've been here.

321
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,240
Don't change your shoes. Go straight in.

322
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,350
Li Xun.

323
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
Li is coming.

324
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,830
Hello, uncle.

325
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
I got something for you.

326
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,280
Thank you.

327
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,350
Give it to me. Come on.

328
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,110
It will take a while for the meal to be ready.

329
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,790
Well,

330
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,520
follow me to the study.

331
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,110
Let's have tea and chat.

332
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,720
Here.

333
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,870
I heard about you

334
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,830
from Yun's mom.

335
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
No big deal.

336
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,720
It's normal for young people to make mistakes.

337
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,790
I don't mind as long as you're not

338
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,150
intrinsically bad.

339
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,390
Li,

340
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,550
you're a wise man,

341
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,280
so I'm going to

342
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,790
give it to you straight,

343
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,870
okay?

344
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,590
I was okay with that

345
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,590
if we were

346
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,110
partners, friends,

347
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,440
and even relatives,

348
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,040
but Yun is our only daughter.

349
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,920
If you two are together

350
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,920
without her mom's approval,

351
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,590
you won't be happy,

352
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,590
and our family won't be happy.

353
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,070
Do you get me?

354
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,630
Yes.

355
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,350
Yun,

356
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,590
come and clear the table.

357
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,550
I've been writing apps all morning and I'm starving.

358
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,720
Haven't you figured out what you're supposed to do

359
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,920
and what you're not supposed to do?

360
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,110
I have already registered you

361
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,110
for the post-graduate entrance examination.

362
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,520
Work hard.

363
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,830
You don't get a second chance.

364
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,110
I told you I don't want to go abroad.

365
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,150
In addition to being Li Xun's girlfriend,

366
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,870
I am also a partner in the new company.

367
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,000
Now the company is just in the right direction,

368
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,200
I can't just leave.

369
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,680
Like it or not,

370
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,960
I've made my decision,

371
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,350
and it's not going to change.

372
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,110
You are young.

373
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,000
Don't say anything absolute

374
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,440
easily.

375
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,200
In a few years you will know

376
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,240
how naive you are today.

377
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,480
We always want to

378
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,960
send Yun abroad,

379
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,440
but she is now determined to stay in China

380
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,280
to start a business with you.

381
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,000
And with what happened to your family,

382
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,870
she can't leave you alone.

383
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,150
This really puts me in a bind.

384
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,040
Li,

385
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,150
I do have a suggestion for you.

386
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,390
If you two really want to be together,

387
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,870
why don't you

388
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,110
go abroad together

389
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,550
and change your environment?

390
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:00,720
Of course,

391
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,070
I'll cover all the expenses.

392
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,040
So you can accept me?

393
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,550
We still need time.

394
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,110
But the most important thing is that

395
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,710
you two need time, too.

396
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,440
Whether you can get married

397
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,150
really needs the test of time.

398
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,070
I know this sounds

399
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,710
abrupt

400
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,440
and selfish.

401
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,960
You're just starting out after all.

402
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,670
I checked it out.

403
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,920
Your company is quite promising.

404
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,520
But I'm telling you

405
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,000
there's no room for trial and error

406
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,960
in current society.

407
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,630
One wrong step leads to another.

408
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,960
Yun is my only daughter.

409
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,110
There's no way I'm going to let her try it out.

410
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,190
Did I make myself clear?

411
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,110
So if you

412
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,800
really care about Yun

413
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,880
and really want to be with her,

414
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,230
you should consider it.

415
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,750
My wife knew you're coming,

416
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,550
so she cooked herself.

417
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,840
Here. Take a seat.

418
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,360
Let me sit inside.

419
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,550
Come on. Enjoy yourself.

420
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,110
Let's talk while eating.

421
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,190
Enjoy yourself.

422
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,150
Yeah, enjoy it.

423
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,880
You cook better than I do.

424
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,630
What exactly

425
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,040
does your company do?

426
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,590
Mom.

427
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,190
Didn't you say you wanted me to know more?

428
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,440
We're building a medical system.

429
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,040
Can you

430
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,270
do it?

431
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,190
The shrimp is fresh.

432
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,750
Eat while it is hot.

433
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,520
Uncle Zhu,

434
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,960
Aunt Liu,

435
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,360
thank you for inviting me to your home.

436
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
I propose a toast to you.

437
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,590
Uncle told me a lot just now.

438
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,190
I know what you're trying to do.

439
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,800
But I also want to say that

440
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,750
Zhu Yun and I will be happy together.

441
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,440
So by choosing to start a business,

442
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,520
she also chose to believe in our future.

443
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,880
Please rest assured,

444
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,270
and please believe Zhu Yun's own choice.

445
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,190
Why are you

446
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
so stubborn?

447
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,800
I'm stubborn

448
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,800
just because I don't want to go abroad?

449
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,520
Li Xun.

450
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,750
Li,

451
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,960
it's improper for you to say that.

452
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,750
What did I tell you in the study?

453
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,670
It's hard for young people to start a business these days.

454
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,040
You can't just do

455
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,480
whatever you want.

456
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,750
We agreed to let you

457
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,520
go abroad together

458
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,320
after careful consideration.

459
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,070
That's our bottom line.

460
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,840
We've been very considerate of your feeling.

461
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,960
At the end of the day

462
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,000
we just want to protect Yun.

463
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,190
If you insist…

464
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,150
If you insist,

465
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,750
you are embarrassing Zhu Yun

466
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,590
and putting her in the dilemma.

467
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,040
Then I'm going to question

468
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,630
what are you up to.

469
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,400
You're talking about going abroad, huh?

470
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,360
Dad,

471
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,150
mom,

472
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,960
I really don't want to go abroad.

473
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,670
Our company has recently closed a deal with many investors.

474
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,880
It's incredible to do that

475
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,230
from a start.

476
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,440
We're serious.

477
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:25,960
Aunt,

478
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,750
I know you have a problem with me.

479
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,800
It doesn't matter.

480
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,960
Since you know me,

481
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,750
you should know what I can do.

482
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,630
If you are willing to

483
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,880
help me…

484
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,520
Help?

485
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,520
OK.

486
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,550
So what kind of help

487
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,230
do you need?

488
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,480
Zhu Yun and I just started our business.

489
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,360
Doing business requires connections.

490
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,000
Isn't your company

491
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,070
specializing in medical equipment for rehabilitation?

492
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,960
With my skills,

493
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,320
and your strength

494
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,320
and connections,

495
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,150
we can work together

496
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,070
for win-win results.

497
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,670
You help me expand my business nationwide.

498
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,550
When the company goes public,

499
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,070
as we're a family,

500
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,960
we can all benefit from it.

501
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,590
What are you talking about, Li Xun?

502
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,070
What's your opinion?

503
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,670
Great, young man.

504
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,920
You know all about our family.

505
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,750
Let me ask you,

506
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,070
are you here today

507
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,840
to solicit sponsorship?

508
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,750
Li Xun,

509
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,520
do you always know that

510
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,150
Zhu Yun is my daughter?

511
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,320
I see you're really holding it against me.

512
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,880
Zhu Yun,

513
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,550
do you remember what I told you?

514
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,750
He pursued you on purpose.

515
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,590
You just didn't believe it before.

516
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,920
You saw that today.

517
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,840
If he hadn't been after our family,

518
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,710
he wouldn't have been haunting you.

519
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,520
That's not true, mom.

520
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,070
All right,

521
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,960
there's no room for discussion.

522
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,960
We're not going to

523
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,550
agree to your relationship.

524
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,070
Zhu Yun will live a better life with me.

525
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,920
You'll find out later.

526
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,590
No need,

527
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,230
Yun is doing very well now.

528
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,270
Honestly,

529
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,920
you're dragging her down.

530
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,320
Dad.

531
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,270
Yun, you see it now.

532
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
See?

533
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,320
I told you

534
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,270
it's hard to change who someone is.

535
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,190
Don't think that you're great just because you got a good score

536
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,230
in the college entrance examination.

537
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,670
The first place in the college entrance examination

538
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,920
can't change his greedy, selfish

539
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,230
and meticulous nature.

540
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,270
Mom, would you please stop talking about it?

541
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,040
Yun, enough.

542
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,550
Who is he to you now?

543
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,630
You're so protective of him.

544
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,320
Li Xun,

545
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,150
go.

546
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,400
You're not welcome here.

547
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,270
Dad.

548
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,550
I thought you would

549
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,000
take a longer view.

550
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,750
How shortsighted.

551
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,800
Li Xun.

552
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,800
See, Zhu Yun?

553
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,670
How can we possibly

554
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,590
allow you to be with someone like him?

555
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,750
I'm telling you

556
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,630
something's going to happen to him sooner or later.

557
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,550
Yun.

558
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,360
What are you doing?

559
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,520
What are you doing?

560
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:55,750
Get back.

561
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,440
Zhu Yun.

562
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,040
Why is she here?

563
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,590
Why can't I be here?

564
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,710
There's no mistaking.

565
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,440
Li Xun,

566
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,070
if you take one more step today,

567
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,480
it'll be over between us.

568
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,840
Gao.

569
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,150
I have no family,

570
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,270
no friends.

571
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,630
But there are things

572
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,150
I have to do.

573
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,630
Li Xun.

574
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,510
♫That breaks through the boundary♫

575
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,870
♫The first sight♫

576
