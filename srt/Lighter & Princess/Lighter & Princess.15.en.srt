♫Everything is different when we watch the sky from the sea bottom♫

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,820
♫The person I used to be is gone♫

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,980
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,380
♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,260
♫We would bloom in the darkness♫

♫Like the white sails in night navigation are protecting the ocean♫

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,940
♫I see a clear direction♫

[Episode 15]

21
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,560
Are you sure you won't use me anymore?

22
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,070
Why don't we have something in the canteen?

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,950
You're back.

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,030
Hello.

25
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,910
Hello.

26
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,190
Is he the ordinary student you mentioned?

27
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,590
This is Li Xun, my classmate.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,310
This is Tian Xiuzhu.

29
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,030
I won't have the meal with you in your canteen.

30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,560
Invite me to dinner next time.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,520
No problem. I'll go first.

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,470
Li Xun, wait for me.

33
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,190
Well.

34
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,680
What?

35
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,030
What's the project you just received about?

36
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,400
The integration system of the godown entries and outbound delivery orders

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,960
of an automobile parts company.

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,030
Is it difficult?

39
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,960
Forget it.

40
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,590
Why did you come back so early?

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,910
I had nothing to do at home,

42
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,360
so I came back to work.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,710
You just paid me,

44
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,190
so I should work harder.

45
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,840
Who was that man I saw?

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
My driver.

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,630
Driver?

48
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,150
Princess, do you need any help?

49
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,750
No, thanks.

50
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,910
My luggage is not heavy, and it's near my...

51
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,520
Don't dawdle.

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
After putting down your suitcase, come to the base.

53
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,910
I should have kept Xiuzhu,

54
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,430
so that he could help me.

55
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,120
I said I didn't need your help,

56
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,270
but you actually ignored me.

57
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,480
Hello.

58
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,600
What are you doing in the dormitory? Come to work now.

59
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,120
Am I mad?

60
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,600
Why did I come back voluntarily to suffer his maltreatment?

61
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,160
Come here

62
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,070
to copy the documents and codes.

63
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,630
You look exhausted after coming back from putting your suitcase in the dormitory.

64
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,830
How delicate you are.

65
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,920
You are the boss.

66
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,870
As long as you pay me, I dare not argue back.

67
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,630
Then come to work now.

68
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,920
I finally have a helper.

69
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,630
But we should

70
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,360
observe the base rules.

71
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,390
It's not time to start school yet.

72
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,870
You have no reason to ask me to work for you.

73
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,190
This is malicious overtime.

74
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,430
Really?

75
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,430
I can work overtime,

76
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,560
but you should have a good attitude.

77
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,830
I don't think you want to go on working here.

78
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,070
I'll satisfy you

79
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,390
and give you a day off tomorrow.

80
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,560
Why?

81
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,270
You need to meet your driver.

82
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,430
Copy the documents and codes for me.

83
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,430
Do you have time?

84
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,240
He's not my driver.

85
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,070
He is the son of my mother's classmate.

86
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,830
Anything else?

87
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,510
I've known him since childhood.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,720
When we were young, we competed to have chicken wings.

89
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,360
And then?

90
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,360
Then, then we vomited

91
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,430
as we ate so much.

92
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,430
And then?

93
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,720
Then he went abroad.

94
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,040
You know what happened then.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,310
Is he that sunshine man

96
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,680
who can paint?

97
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,680
Why do you remember him so clearly?

98
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,240
Are you satisfied?

99
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Can you copy the documents and codes to me?

100
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,600
Zhu Yun,

101
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,190
if you dare to lie again,

102
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,680
you'll have to bear the consequences yourself.

103
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,630
Come to copy documents and codes.

104
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,680
What about the sunshine man?

105
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,680
If he has nothing to do, you may ask him to go back soon.

106
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,310
Copy now.

107
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,360
What's up?

108
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,360
Order dishes.

109
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,750
It's my treat today,

110
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,360
so don't miss this chance.

111
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,240
You finally thought of me.

112
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,190
What do you mean?

113
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,430
Let me tell you.

114
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,160
Look,

115
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,560
I can make money now,

116
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,120
so surely I should treat you to dinner.

117
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,750
How do you feel

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,800
when spending the money you earned?

119
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,240
Do you have a strong sense of achievement?

120
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,390
My heart aches.

121
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,870
Tell me

122
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,870
what I can do for you.

123
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,910
I don't treat you to dinner for something.

124
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,870
You treat me to dinner in such a good restaurant,

125
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,320
but you don't want me to do anything for you.

126
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,960
Do you believe it?

127
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,200
I'm sincerely inviting you to dinner.

128
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,790
Only we're here today.

129
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,750
Order the dishes you like.

130
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,960
Okay.

131
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,600
I want this,

132
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,200
Heart-Broken Watermelon.

133
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,150
What's that?

134
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,360
Watermelon juice.

135
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,480
It has a strange name.

136
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,270
Seeing its high price,

137
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,630
I know why it's called so.

138
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,960
Xiuzhu,

139
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,390
go back and have a good rest

140
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,670
after dinner.

141
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,390
I made a strategy for you.

142
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,960
You can visit Lishan Mountain tomorrow.

143
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,270
I won't go with you.

144
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,270
Well, this is your purpose.

145
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,030
No, our university has an urgent task,

146
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,600
or I wouldn't have come back so early.

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,870
Is the urgent task related to your ordinary classmate?

148
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,550
Surely not.

149
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,270
I saw your ordinary classmate

150
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,440
in the art museum last time.

151
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,080
Then why didn't you say hello to us?

152
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,840
You usually look gentle and quiet,

153
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,840
but you're actually a rather rebellious girl.

154
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,720
No.

155
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,120
Do you girls

156
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,840
only like handsome men?

157
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,720
Unexpectedly,

158
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,510
you're also a conformist.

159
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,670
So you also think he is handsome.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,790
You're good at making a deliberate misinterpretation.

161
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,510
Don't keep giggling like this,

162
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,720
or you may have stiff plump cheeks.

163
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,440
I don't think he's reliable.

164
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,670
What do you mean by that?

165
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,600
I'll talk to you directly and openly.

166
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,550
He,

167
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,030
a domineering man,

168
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,670
lacks self-discipline.

169
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,550
You just met him several times.

170
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,670
I don't want to warn you

171
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,910
in the tone of your mom.

172
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,670
But I don't think

173
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,030
he's suitable for you.

174
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,150
You can't change him.

175
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,390
Why should I change him?

176
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,720
Because you'll get hurt?

177
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
Are you sure about it?

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,030
You don't know him.

179
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,390
I don't know him,

180
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,840
but I know you.

181
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,240
Xiuzhu,

182
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,320
you really speak

183
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,630
in the same way as my mom.

184
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,510
You think you know me well.

185
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,200
You don't like those people different from you.

186
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
You can't accept others' past

187
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,670
no matter whether their past

188
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,320
is under their own control or not.

189
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,030
You just blame others from a commanding position

190
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,870
according to the rules in your own minds.

191
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,030
To tell you the truth,

192
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,360
your behaviors are so unreasonable.

193
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,960
I hope I'm wrong.

194
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,790
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,200
It's I who should say sorry.

196
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,670
Thank you, Xiuzhu.

197
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,960
Have a good time tomorrow.

198
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,320
I'm sorry for what I just said.

199
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,360
Never mind.

200
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,790
Go back quickly.

201
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,320
You should not rush to pay the bill.

202
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,670
I said it was my treat.

203
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,790
It's mainly because this dinner is not big enough.

204
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,630
When you really make a lot of money,

205
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,120
you must treat me to a big dinner.

206
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,320
That's a deal.

207
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,480
I'll leave.

208
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
If my mom calls you,

209
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,030
hide something for me.

210
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,480
I see.

211
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,910
Then I'll go back.

212
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,840
Have fun tomorrow.

213
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,000
Bye-bye.

214
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,510
I'll leave.

215
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,000
Fang Shumiao.

216
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,030
I was looking for you.

217
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,000
Let me tell you.

218
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,550
I met Mr. Lin.

219
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,840
He asked you to go to his office.

220
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,790
Why did he meet me?

221
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,790
There should be some good news.

222
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,960
He looked happy.

223
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,240
Why are you back at this time?

224
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,550
The Steering Committee of the Education Commission will come to listen to the class tomorrow.

225
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,630
I haven't hung the banner yet.

226
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,440
I'll leave first.

227
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,840
By the way,

228
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,630
I'm running for the head of the propaganda department of the student union.

229
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,960
Remember to vote for me.

230
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,870
Will you be promoted?

231
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,630
Yes.

232
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,840
I've talked so much to you.

233
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,360
You're so thoughtless.

234
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,910
Does he look happy?

235
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,320
What's up?

236
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,840
Come here.

237
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,080
Let her take part in it.

238
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,240
What?

239
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,080
Let her go.

240
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,390
Wait.

241
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,080
What's the matter, Mr. Lin?

242
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,120
Next month,

243
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,960
the preliminary

244
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,440
of the Nanhu University Students' Information Security Competition

245
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,720
will be held in the Information Technology University.

246
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,390
Do you know?

247
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,790
It has attracted much attention.

248
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,960
Surely.

249
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,080
Though this is

250
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,510
the first competition,

251
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,240
it's a competitive event

252
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
held among universities

253
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,750
in the whole information security industry.

254
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,480
Normally,

255
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,510
you freshmen are not qualified

256
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,270
to participate.

257
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,240
The apps you designed

258
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,080
have been well recognized by them.

259
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,630
And they agreed

260
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,360
and gave you a participation chance

261
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,750
for the sake of me.

262
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,080
Many people sought but failed to get the chance.

263
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,270
I asked him to participate,

264
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,360
but he declines with all sorts of excuses.

265
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,670
As the class rep, say something.

266
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,080
He should participate. He must participate.

267
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,870
If I participate in it,

268
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,790
who can design the integration system of the godown entries and outbound delivery orders?

269
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,360
Don't place the unimportant before the important.

270
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,390
It won't take you much time

271
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,270
to participate in it.

272
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,910
Gao Jianhong entered his name.

273
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,720
He has the ability to handle it.

274
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,000
He can't go alone.

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,480
All of you should participate.

276
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,360
Including me?

277
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Sure.

278
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,390
Participating in the competition

279
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,870
can not only broaden your horizons

280
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,120
but also enable you

281
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,840
to communicate more

282
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,870
with the top industrial and academic experts

283
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,150
and discover your weaknesses.

284
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,120
I don't need it.

285
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,670
Oh?

286
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,840
What did you say?

287
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,960
I don't need it.

288
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,240
You don't need it?

289
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,150
Mr. Lin.

290
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,600
Well,

291
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,240
you actually said so.

292
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,440
Do you think you don't have any weaknesses?

293
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,030
Yes.

294
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,030
Mr. Lin,

295
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,320
if you want us to win prizes for the university

296
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,360
and make a show,

297
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,840
I really don't think it's necessary.

298
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,000
Li Xun,

299
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,480
how arrogant you are.

300
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,320
You're so opinionated.

301
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,200
He left. How can I handle this?

302
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,150
Listen.

303
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,600
You...

304
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,030
Mr. Lin, calm down. Take a seat.

305
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,390
Take a seat. Take a seat.

306
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,790
I've seen many naughty students,

307
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,000
and he's

308
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:43,750
the unruliest one.

309
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,720
Yes. He's to blame.

310
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,910
It's such a good chance.

311
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,200
The contestants

312
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,150
are all top students in the country.

313
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,630
Even the sponsors

314
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,440
are the most powerful enterprises

315
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,600
in the industry.

316
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,390
After the award-winning works are announced,

317
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,270
they'll directly cooperate with those winners and have their works put into use.

318
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,550
After a long time of research on the base projects,

319
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,640
you've improved your professional ability.

320
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,510
It's time for you

321
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,030
to show your real strength.

322
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,960
I know you are close to each other.

323
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,270
Is our relationship exposed?

324
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,270
You must persuade him

325
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,160
to participate.

326
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,830
I'll try my best.

327
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,310
No, you must make it,

328
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,030
or I'll take the blame on you.

329
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,750
I must make it.

330
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,550
He'll suffer a great deal

331
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,030
because of his arrogance.

332
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,350
Zhu Yun,

333
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,880
you are the class rep

334
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,030
and the person he trusts.

335
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,270
You must control him for me.

336
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,590
Okay.

337
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,400
Li Xun.

338
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,590
Don't waste your time.

339
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,240
I know you, Talent Li,

340
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,960
think it's meaningless to participate in the competition.

341
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,440
Others participate in the competition for learning,

342
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,680
This way, please.

515
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,070
Please have a seat.

516
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,790
Thank you.

517
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,030
Please.

518
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,440
Okay.

519
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,310
Sit down, please.

520
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,830
It's such a formal occasion.

521
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,200
I should have worn

522
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,750
my only suit.

523
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,880
Although my classmates all think...

524
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,440
Please drink some water.

525
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,030
Thanks.

526
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,350
Although they all think

527
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,400
I'm quite like a real estate agent

528
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,550
in that suit.

529
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,030
Really?

530
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,310
I also want to see you wear it.

531
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,880
Actually, it's not that formal here.

532
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,200
People are dressed differently.

533
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,240
If you're dressed formally,

534
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,400
I may think you're here to take photos and share them on your Moments.

535
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:50,830
Look at the two girls

536
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,830
over there.

537
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,270
Do you want me to take some photos for you?

538
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,550
All right.

539
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,110
Good.

540
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,920
Good.

541
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,200
Good.

542
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,160
Let me see.

543
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,750
They look terrible. I'm deformed in the photo.

544
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,350
It seems I'm only 1.2 meters high in this one.

545
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,200
Look at this one.

546
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,070
I feel as if the Oriental Pearl Tower grew on my head.

547
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,960
I see.

548
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,790
I look sort of sentimental in this one.

549
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,310
No matter how beautiful the scenery is, it's just the background.

550
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,720
I'll take some more for you.

551
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,510
Make me look taller.

552
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,720
One more.

553
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,590
Let me see.

554
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,000
These look much better.

555
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,000
Let's take a selfie.

556
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,480
Stand closer to me.

557
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,110
Three, two, one.

558
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,510
The last two ones look good.

559
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,480
Quite good.

560
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,110
Hello.

561
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,200
Here are our menus.

562
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,070
Thank you.

563
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,880
This one also looks good.

564
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,070
Don't look.

565
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,880
The one you take is a lady's menu,

566
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,240
with no price on it.

567
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,070
How does it taste?

568
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,720
Delicious.

569
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,880
Cheers!

570
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,030
If we can write codes

571
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,200
in such a beautiful place later,

572
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,550
we'll work efficiently.

573
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,160
Good idea.

574
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,480
Good idea.

575
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Then we will become

576
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,440
the centre of attention on the Bund.

577
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,400
Why haven't I seen

578
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,680
your great member Li Xun?

579
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,240
Are you looking for him?

580
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,070
It's said he is the leader

581
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,000
in the design of the Blue Crown app.

582
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,880
He established our practice base.

583
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,270
Blue Crown is our project.

584
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,960
I downloaded

585
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,000
and browsed your app.

586
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,790
Besides good practicability,

587
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,830
I also like your idea

588
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,310
"Click to Check the Illness Reasons and Treatment".

589
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,000
It's a particularly interesting design.

590
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,920
"Click to Check the Illness Reasons and Treatment".

591
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,350
Good name.

592
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,400
To tell you the truth,

593
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,200
I'm actually bad at programming.

594
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,400
Stop kidding me.

595
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,070
The Computer Science Department of your university

596
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,200
ranks the top among the peers.

597
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,110
But I was enrolled as a special student with folk dance talent.

598
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,720
I applied for this programme

599
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,960
with a sudden impulse.

600
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,550
I'm not good at math.

601
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,270
I can hardly understand

602
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,920
my courses.

603
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,070
Can you understand me?

604
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,440
You're so modest.

605
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,920
You're also a contestant.

606
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
My classmates all look down on me.

607
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,640
They all think I'm an art student,

608
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,160
so they don't want to complete the group homework with me.

609
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,070
I just want to take a place

610
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,790
in this competition

611
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,640
and show my real strength to them.

612
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
How did you think out

613
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,510
the idea of that app?

614
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,830
Can you tell me about it?

615
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,000
Are you curious about it?

616
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,510
First, shopping websites have just emerged in recent years.

617
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,600
There're diversified shopping websites,

618
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,880
but in fact, it won't take so long

619
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,510
before most of the resources are slowly gathered

620
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,070
to several large platforms.

621
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,400
Second,

622
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,990
smart phones have become popular.

623
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,880
The reason why we give up designing large websites

624
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,880
and choose to design the apps is that

625
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,120
large websites

626
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,070
are wide in usage,

627
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,990
while apps stress fine functions.

628
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,270
We aim to design deep and fine app functions

629
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,470
to meet the needs

630
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,400
and usage habits of users.

631
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,270
In the future,

632
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,360
apps must have a lower usage threshold

633
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,990
than websites.

634
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,470
Why?

635
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,200
Because all of us carrying mobile phones

636
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,120
can use apps at any time,

637
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
but we can't use computers so conveniently.

638
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,400
Therefore,

639
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,070
first we add the illness search system

640
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,750
based on different user portraits.

641
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,920
Users don't need to know their illness names.

642
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,360
They can obtain the corresponding information and treatment as soon as they enter their symptoms.

643
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,270
Second,

644
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,880
we add the Mocap system.

645
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,600
Mocap?

646
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,360
Yes, it's the Mocap system.

647
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,710
It's widely used

648
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,200
in many Hollywood blockbusters.

649
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:20,880
Our model is

650
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,680
also based on this technology,

651
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,160
which is more intuitive than the entered symptoms, right?

652
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,310
What do you think of it?

653
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,470
Very good, Gao.

654
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,120
It really sounds great.

655
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,680
It still has many shortcomings.

656
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,990
It's already quite perfect.

657
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,360
You're so modest.

658
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,030
I've talked so much today.

659
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,680
No, tell me more about it.

660
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,310
You want to hear more?

661
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,200
Although smart phones haven't been

662
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,230
fully popularized yet

663
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,400
and the mobile Internet speed can't meet the current requirements...

664
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,310
Here we are.

665
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,440
Gao,

666
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,200
you're sure to win

667
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,270
this information security competition.

668
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,120
Thank you.

669
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,160
Well, I'll go first.

670
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,310
Go back and have a rest early.

671
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,990
Good night.

672
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,920
Bye-bye.

673
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:51,920
Good night.

674
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,310
You're back.

675
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,670
Did you have a smooth talk with Xinda Biotechnology?

676
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,470
Yes.

677
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,890
[Lina: Here are our photos.]
Here are our photos.

678
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,590
[Xu Lina  Gao Jianhong: Don't play with your phone while driving. Tell me when you get home.]
Don't play with your phone while driving. Tell me when you get home.

679
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,330
[Xu Lina  Gao Jianhong: Don't play with your phone while driving. Tell me when you get home.]

680
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,360
Who?

681
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,030
Gao, it's me.

682
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,960
I'm coming.

683
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,840
Gao, what are you doing?

684
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,440

Morning.

May I come in?

688

Yes.

Only you?

Yes.

Did you have breakfast?

692
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,070
I have no habit of eating breakfast.

Gao,

694
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,360
can you check

695
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,470
my project?

696
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,800
Sure.

697
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,920
As long as you don't mind.

698
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,030
I'll treat you

699
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,800
to have

700
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,760
sweet-scented osmanthus cakes

701
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,990
It tastes good.

702
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,670
Yes.

703
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,110
It's the specialty of Lübolang Restaurant.

704
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,190
Surely it's delicious.

[Software piracy self-discovery system]
This is

707
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,990
[Software piracy self-discovery system]
our software piracy self-discovery system,

708
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,960
and this is the feature extractor.

709

Look.

710

What do you think of it?

711
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,670
Very good.

712
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,470
The topic anti-piracy is good.

713
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,440
I didn't expect it.

714
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,720
Really?

715
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,920
Yours is much better than ours.

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,280
What's your topic?

717
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,400
Our topic is...

718
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,800
Let me introduce to you.

719
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,400
This is Li Xun.

720
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,630
Hello, Li Xun.

721
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,720
I'm Xu Lina.

722
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,280
I've long heard your name.

723
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,670
Sorry to disturb you.

724
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,110
Li Xun,

725
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,960
could you check the project of our group

726
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,150
and see if there's something

727
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,670
that needs to be improved?

728
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,030
Look,

729
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,510
this is our software piracy self-discovery system

730
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,670
and its principle...

731
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,240
This isn't your work.

732
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:24,960
Li Xun.

733
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,070
How do you know it?

734
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,630
There're only two principles

735
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,720
for software companies to detect piracy.

736
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,960
First,

737
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,240
to use the embedded digital watermarking.

738
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,070
Second,

739
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,990
to capture information

740
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,150
when software is updated and connected to the Internet.

741
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,550
You adopt the second principle,

742
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,030
but both of them are of no use.

743
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,670
The information can be captured

744
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,990
on the premise that

745
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,400
your software can directly access the internal data of files

746
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,280
related to the C disk operating system

747
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,840
across Windows operating system permissions.

748
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,840
But the personal security and firewall functions

749
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,360
of Windows operating system are strong.

750
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,550
At present, many Chinese companies

751
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,070
use PPPoE Internet.

752
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,920
The IP address of the external network

753
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,110
changes on a regular basis.

754
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:11,960
However,

755
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,320
MAC can only be displayed

756
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,630
only after the SNMP service is enabled

757
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,070
and it's uploaded.

758
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,110
The rest interact

759
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,400
by port number.

760
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,800
Don't make a fool of yourself.

761
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,590
Li Xun, it's enough.

762
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,670
Li Xun, can our project be improved?

763
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,920
Others may see it easily.

764
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,670
Find good programmers to redo it.

765
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,960
Let them change the idea

766
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,150
and do according to the first principle,

767
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,110
which is easier than improvement of your current project.

768
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,670
Wait.

769
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,190
Can you repeat the first idea

770
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,630
you just told me?

771
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,760
Sorry, I'm very busy.

772
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,990
Can I come to consult you next time?

773
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,070
After I redo it,

774
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,920
can you give me some advice?

775
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,400
No.

776
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,470
This isn't my duty.

777
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,840
My name is Xu Lina.

778
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,190
I'm from Class 132 of Software Engineering Major of Information Technology University.

779
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,110
He just speaks in this way.

780
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,840
Don't take it to heart.

781
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,960
He's really a top programmer.

00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,760
He must be busy with something.

858
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,510
He's so busy.

859
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,590
No wonder he hasn't agreed

860
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,240
to my application of WeChat account addition.

861
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,880
How did you get his WeChat account?

862
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,630
Don't forget. I'm a volunteer.

863
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,070
Gao,

864
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,840
can you tell him

865
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,280
and let him agree to my application?

866
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,070
Okay.

867
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,070
I'll invite you to have dinner tonight.

868
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,670
I'll invite some of the finalists

869
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,880
to celebrate together.

870
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:03,990
Good.

871
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,280
Be sure to let Li Xun join us.

872
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,960
He helped me a lot

873
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,880
this time.

874
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,990
I should thank him sincerely.

875
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,030
I'll try my best.

876
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:15,630
Okay.

877
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:31,670
Fang Zhijing.

878
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,190
♫I pass by the world♫
It's you who plagued Xiaoyan.

879
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,550
♫I pass by the world♫
You caused her to be slandered by others

880
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,920
for a recommendation certificate.

881
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,440
♫And pass through the night♫
She killed herself because of you.

882
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,510
♫And pass through the night♫
-It's you who killed her. -Zhu Yun.

883
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,400
It's because she had psychological problems.

884
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,080
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫

885
