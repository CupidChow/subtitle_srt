Did so many people join the base?

22
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,830
I joined it.

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,390
You even copied Zhu Yun's homework.

24
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,520
Why did you join it?

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,440
In order to copy Li Xun's homework.

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,270
So the base is not so good.

27
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,440
Li Xun set up the base

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,840
to start up business.

29
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,510
He undertakes  projects outside school.

30
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,320
He also raised funds by himself.

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,880
After making money, our school can get a share.

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,040
He even starts to make money by taking on projects?

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,880
Is he so capable?

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,790
So what?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,320
We go to university to learn.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,950
We can make money at any time.

37
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,280
He will regret it if he can't get a job or

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,880
be recommended for postgraduate education

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,160
as he doesn't get enough credits.

40
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,120
The practice points he gets by one project

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,040
are more than those you get by serving as the monitor.

42

Fang Shumiao, what do we eat later?

43

54

We're not sharing it.

Anyway, I forced you to join it at the beginning.

81
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,910
That base

82
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,720
is indeed more useful than the interest group.

84
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,550

No special reasons.

86
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,280
I just want to learn more things.

87
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,470
Then why do you dismiss it?

88
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,790
Members of the base do their things,

89
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,840
and we do our own things there.

90
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,430
Most members of the interest group have joined the base.

91

we'll stay,

Coin tossing

is not to let the coin make the decision for you.

When you toss,

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,590
and the other is marble black.

171
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,710
If you want a confident smile,

172
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,550
you need to take care of your teeth like you take care of your skin.

173
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,400
This electric toothbrush of  marble colors...

174
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,550
When did this pimple grow?

175
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,240
You can share it with the one you like.

176
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,520
So annoying.

177
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,480
You're back.

178
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,480
This is the electric toothbrush you bought.

179
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,520
Open it.

180
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:09,830
Yun,

181
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:10,950
look.

182
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,360
Isn't this a nice toothbrush?

183
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,760
It indeed looks nice.

184
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,640
Yun, you have no idea.

185
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,640
Our classroom is really noisy.

186
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,760
Those girls are really pretentious.

187
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,160
I saw in person that

188
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,880
when Li Xun sniffed,

189
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,880
a girl immediately bought an electric heater on Taobao for him.

190
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
The classroom is so noisy.

191
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,040
How can we focus on our project?

192
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,590
Obviously, those girls have other motives.

193
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
But Li Xun just let them do so.

194
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,120
So annoying.

195
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,360
Then you can choose not to go there.

196
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,190
Yun,

197
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,670
you have no idea

198
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,760
how unreasonable our school's student union is.

199
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,190
Each member can get 20 points in one semester

200
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,310
for all efforts they have made.

201
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,520
I just want to appear frequently

202
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,480
before leaders

203
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,360
so that I can get postgraduate recommendation easily.

204
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,550
Otherwise, I won't go there.

205
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,430
So you're enduring present hardships to revive.

206
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,830
I feel hungry suddenly.

207
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,190
How about we go to have barbecue?

208
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,070
How about Da Dong Bei?

209
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,830
I don't want to go. I have excessive internal heat.

210
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,240
Those girls in the base have fair skin.

211
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,480
I have a pimple on my face.

212
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,480
You need some real skills

213
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,240
to be a beauty.

214
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,550
It makes sense.

215
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,550
I'll have some papaya.

216
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,240
Did you ever learn biology?

217
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,910
The well-fed don't know how the starving suffer.

218
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,160
If I am sincere enough,

219
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,950
I believe I can succeed.

220
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,280
Ren Di is also here.

221
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,040
Hello.

222
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,430
I have something to show you.

223
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,360
Get a chair.

224
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,760
Is this seat taken?

225
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,400
Yes.

226
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,240
Gao has taken this seat.

227
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,160
Just get it.

228
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,400
Li Xun.

229
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,550
Isn't this too much?

230
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,590
You are nobody.

231
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,760
Don't look down on us.

232
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,310
It's just a base.

233
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,950
Forget it, Gao.

234
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,880
Sit down!

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,160
You'd better dismiss your interest group.

236
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,400
What did you say?

237
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,310
If you think you can learn programming

238
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,910
by reading a book about C language,

239
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,310
you'd better give up.

240
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,040
You just did well in the college entrance examination.

241
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
I'm not worse than you.

242
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,070
I was only five places behind you.

243
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,910
You're not qualified to look down on me.

244
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,950
Do you only have

245
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,070
No. 6 in the province

246
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,400
to show off?

247
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,120
The college entrance examination is a watershed.

248
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,790
When it ends,

249
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,430
we can complete fewer and fewer things

250
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,190
by studying hard only.

251
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,590
If you are really smart,

252
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,910
throw away the textbook and join my base.

253
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,790
I will teach you in the future.

254
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,360
Do you dare make a bet?

255
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,240
The midterm exam will take place in the week after next.

256
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,520
We'll compete.

257
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,830
If Gao and I get better C language scores

258
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,830
than you,

259
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
your practice base

260
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,790
must be incorporated into our interest group,

261
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,190
and you listen to us.

262
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,790
What if you lose?

263
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,430
We will dismiss the interest group,

264
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,520
and we will leave the classroom to you.

265
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,310
Zhu Yun.

266
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,240
Are you playing house?

267
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,520
You're too childish.

268
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,710
Make a bet on scores?

269
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,790
Okay.

270
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,280
I accept it.

271
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,310
Okay.

272
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,000
So let's have a thorough competition.

273
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,640
It's boring to compete in C language.

274
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,910
Let's compete in the comprehensive ranking.

275
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,070
Introduction to the Basic Principles of Marxism, Advanced Mathematics and Software Engineering.

276
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,590
Gao,

277
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,950
Li Xun is top scorer in the college entrance examination.

278
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,430
Like he said,

279
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,160
the college entrance examination is a watershed.

280
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,190
And PE course.

281
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,190
Okay.

282
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,880
I'll play this game with you.

283
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,520
Junior,

284
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,120
in this case,

285
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,110
we'll take Li Xun's side.

286
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,640
Fang Shumiao,

287
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,670
I...

288
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,520
Shumiao,

289
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,040
I heard that Zhu Yun had a fight with Li Xun.

290
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,070
Are they really going to compete?

291
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,640
You're so gossipy.

292
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,280
We're going to take exams.

293
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,910
You should focus on your study.

294
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,670
She is really brave

295
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,280
to challenge the top scorer.

296
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,670
Does love really beget hate?

297
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,550
She did so just because she was disappointed in love.

298
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,670
It's normal that they fall out and become enemies.

299
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,160
So many people have metaphrenia or psychological distortion.

300
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,240
Zhu Yun,

301
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,710
hello.

302
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,710
Hi.

303
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,790
Have you finished talking?

304
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,520
Yes. Yes.

305
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,360
You don't need to ask Fang Shumiao next time.

306
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,640
You can ask me directly.

307
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,480
As far as I know, there are

308
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,280
seven to eight types of metaphrenia.

309
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,720
Few people turn love into hate,

310
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,480
but many people are paranoid and have delusions.

311
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,790
You talk. I'm going.

312
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,480
Bye-bye.

313
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,310
Do you know what Li Xun signed up for PE?

314
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,200
It seems to be dancesport.

315
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,680
What is that?

316
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,280
Ballroom dance.

317
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,390
The sports dance team of our school

318
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,520
participated in the national youth competition last year.

319
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,680
They're quite good.

320
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,550
I think Li Xun

321
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,630
chose this course randomly to get credits.

322
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,240
Probably he doesn't know dance.

323
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,760
Even if he's the stop scorer, a genius,

324
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,550
I don't believe he can dance.

325
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,280
Can you imagine

326
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,550
how he looks when he dances

327
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,000
wearing hip-hugging tights?

328
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,790
I can't imagine that.

329
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,870
I believe I can defeat him in PE course.

330
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,480
Boys and girls, come over.

331
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,440
Before the class, I'd like to tell you

332
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,280
the midterm exam will take place next class.

333
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,110
Your grades in the midterm exam

334
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,550
account for 30% of the final exam.

335
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,680
You have to attach importance to it.

336
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
30?

337
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,440
Enough, enough. Stop complaining.

338
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,040
You need to take the exam anyway.

339
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,790
I have sent the video to your monitor.

340
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,000
Go back and practice more.

341
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,280
Otherwise I will fail you.

342
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,920
Don't complain before me if you fail.

343
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,760
I will counterattack.

344
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,960
It's time for the library to close.

345
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,550
Please take your things

346
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,960
and go back to the dormitory in order.

347
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,440
Let's go.

348
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,630
You go first.

349
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,550
We need to go back early,

350
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,920
or we can't have hot water after going back.

351
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,390
Girls,

352
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
it's time for the library to close.

353
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,630
Please pack up.

354
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,790
You go back first.

355
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,630
What do you want to do?

356
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,920
You can go on after going back to the dormitory.

357
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,960
If the dormitory is cut off Internet access,

358
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,280
I won't be able to check the codes.

359
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,280
You can leave it to tomorrow.

360
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,480
No.

361
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,280
Gao and I have been stuck for days.

362
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,550
I'm going to the interest group later.

363
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,960
I have to finish it tonight.

364
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,110
Mobile classrooms will be used as examination rooms tomorrow.

365
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,240
They won't be opened tonight.

366
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,150
If the teacher does room inspection later,

367
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,280
please cover me.

368
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,350
Where are you going?

369
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,440
You put the lock on this door?

370
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,480
Do you take it as a free study room?

371
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,040
You come here

372
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,480
without informing me.

373
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,630
It's a special circumstance today.

374
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,480
The exams will be held tomorrow,

375
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,680
so many classrooms aren't opened.

376
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,480
I just use this place for this night.

377
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,550
And,

378
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,310
the roof doesn't belong to you.

379
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,350
Mr. Lin approved the base.

380
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,000
Is this place approved too?

381
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,870
Close the door.

382
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,870
You didn't drive me away. I'll take that as a welcome.

383
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,070
Before you officially lose,

384
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,310
you can study in the base.

385
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,240
I have asked Liu Sisi and others to leave the base.

386
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,630
Are you stung by conscience?

387
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,520
Don't you use those dirty tricks?

388
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,680
The competition has not started yet.

389
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,630
You have found an excuse for yourself?

390
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,920
You need to know that

391
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,280
you will lose

392
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,350
only because you are worse than me.

393
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,350
We don't know who will lose in the end.

394
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,240
And, competition is only a form.

395
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,000
We get what we learn.

396
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,720
You think I am hypocritical again.

397
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,750
Are you doing psychological construction for yourself?

398
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,520
I am giving you advice.

399
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,480
I'm afraid that you will take it too hard

400
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,440
after you lose to me

401
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,830
as a famous top scorer.

402
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,110
What's the model of your computer?

403
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,200
It starts up quite fast.

404
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,000
Master,

405
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,440
how to find a bug?

406
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,280
Be specific.

407
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,150
You can talk about it in a broad sense.

408
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,870
Did you do black-box testing?

409
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,550
I did boundary value testing.

410
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,520
Try all testing methods one by one

411
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,680
and you can find it.

412
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,760
In that case, I need to stay up several nights.

413
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,550
Logic.

414
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,000
What logic?

415
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,720
You like writing short codes.

416
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,200
Sometimes, the logic will be affected

417
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,790
as you pursue concise codes too much.

418
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,960
Check it again.

419
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,960
I find it!

420
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,110
How do you know I like writing short codes?

421
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Because you're boring.

422
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,830
You good students are mindless.

423
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,790
You take textbooks as golden rules.

424
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,200
Nanhu University at 5:00 a.m.

425
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,920
Hello.

426
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,150
So melodramatic.

427
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,720
Can't you talk nicely?

428
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,830
I don't care.

429
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,200
I think it's a happy thing to

430
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
work hard for a goal.

431
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,200
I'm going.

432
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,150
Are you going?

433
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,150
Lock the door.

434
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,440
What's this?

435
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,680
So I can come here freely in the future.

436
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,960
Does he escape?

437
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,240
You can see the questions for filling in blanks on your computer.

438
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,200
You can just make your choices on it

439
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,480
I will write the last programming question

440
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,350
on the blackboard.

441
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,550
Have a look.

442
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,110
Draw a love heart with programming.

443
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,390
It's so easy.

444
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,760
I didn't need to stay up for several nights actually.

445
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,280
You can start.

446
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,590
Why is his code so long?

447
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,180
[Are you sure you want to submit your test?
Attention: After submitting the test, candidates cannot log in again
Yes   No]

448
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,220
[Submitted successfully]

449
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,630
We've got the results.

450
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,440
Circulate it, class rep.

451
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,000
What's your score?

452
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,960
100 points.

453
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,350
100 points.

454
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,280
Give it back to me.

455
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,150
Good. Your reading has paid off.

456
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,480
Do you regret competing with me?

457
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,150
I have something to say.

458
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,390
This class is a Q&A class.

459
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,760
This is your first programming.

460
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,630
You can communicate

461
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,390
to listen to how others think.

462
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,520
You can ask me if you meet with any problem.

463
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,240
But I have to remind you that you should keep your voices down.

464
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,310
Though you can communicate,

465
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,550
you can't be too noisy in class.

466
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,590
Master,

467
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,790
look at mine, please.

468
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,110
This is my thinking.

469
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,760
Did you fail in advanced mathematics?

470
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,480
No.

471
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,390
It looks like you never learned it.

472
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,000
Show me yours.

473
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,870
You may not be able to understand it.

474
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
You can look at the class rep's.

475
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,440
That's concise.

476
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,790
I used two For cycles.

477
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,110
Function can be used.

478
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,830
I didn't think of this.

479
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,720
Thank you.

480
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,590
It's normal. I sometimes did so as well.

481
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,920
You'll know after you get familiar with it.

482
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,920
You think I am hypocritical again.

483
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,040
You have good ears.

484
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,110
Show me yours.

485
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,680
Don't force yourself if you don't understand,

486
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,150
or you will be depressed.

487
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,720
You did a great job.

488
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,310
Okay. Class is over.

489
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,350
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

490
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,870
Bye.

491
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,790
Me?

492
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,720
I didn't get 100 points.

493
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,350
Have you decoded it?

494
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,720
It's like this.

495
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,720
Oh...

496
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,100
I seem to get a dimensional collapse strike.

497
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,760
In fact, I didn't tell you something

498
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,200
as I was afraid of it would shake your confidence.

499
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,280
Though Li Xun stays in the base every day,

500
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,070
he never reviews.

501
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,040
What he wrote is outsourced work.

502
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,550
Comparisons are odious.

503
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,720
A curve wrecker gets 100 points

504
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,920
because the full score is 100 points only.

505
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,720
This is the gap between you

506
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,520
and the curve wrecker, no, the academic prodigy.

507
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,000
Zhu Yun,

508
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,390
let's dismiss the interest group.

509
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,870
But...

510
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,070
In fact, it's Li Xun who decoded the virus.

511
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,630
Wu Mengxing went to ask me

512
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,070
about the writing of the worm virus one day.

513
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,760
That's why I knew where to start with.

514
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,720
It must be Li Xun who let Wu Mengxing

515
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,680
go to ask me on purpose.

516
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,960
Otherwise, I couldn't be able to

517
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,630
do it.

518
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,240
Li Xun must know we couldn't decode it,

519
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,070
so he asked Wu Mengxing to give us a clue indirectly.

520
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,830
It's really a dimensional collapse strike.

521
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,350
He gives alms to you when he wants

522
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,590
and destroys you when he wants.

523
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,960
And you can do nothing about it.

524
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,630
It sounds that this cold master

525
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,070
has compassion for girls.

526
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,240
Don't pull a long face.

527
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,040
We didn't lose in this competition.

528
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,240
This is...

529
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,200
This is not acquisition, but merger.

530
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,280
Well, let's drink

531
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,280
to celebrate our interest group's official dismissal.

532
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,310
It is never too late to mend.

533
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,870
Dignity is nothing important

534
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,760
compared to future.

535
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,390
Drink.

536
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,310
It makes sense.

537
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,070
I don't drink.

538
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,590
Zhu Yun,

539
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,480
when can you

540
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,440
have some drink for adults?

541
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,200
Fang Shumiao, you're a traitor.

542
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,390
You're not qualified to say that.

543
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,920
You've joined the base.

544
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,000
You seem righteous at ordinary times,

545
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,550
but you're the first one who betrayed us.

546
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,070
Yeah.

547
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,480
We'll be in the same organization in the future.

548
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,400
Can you both join the base?

549
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,550
To become better,

550
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,710
we should stay with persons who are better than us.

551
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,400
I'm in.

552
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,400
I haven't made up my mind.

553
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,800
What do you want to do?

554
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,070
In fact, I envy you guys.

555
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,000
You know what you want.

556
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,150
Shumiao wants to be recommended for postgraduate education.

557
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,920
Gao wants to study aboard.

558
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,070
But,

559
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,190
my mom made every decision for me,

560
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,960
including the decisions to choose this major

561
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,230
and to be the class rep.

562
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,360
I even considered switching major.

563
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,840
You were full of fight

564
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,270
when you made a bet with Li Xun.

565
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,590
There's endless joy in fighting with others.

566
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,840
But I still don't know

567
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,360
if I like programming or not.

568
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,070
You are just slow.

569
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,590
Some time ago,

570
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,520
you acted like a bulldog eager to fight.

571
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,590
It was quite good.

572
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,070
Don't think too much.

576
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,550
Do you want to turn the tables?

577

You're trying to save your dignity forcibly.

I want to do it just in case.

582

He's so good.

583
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,960
What if he hacks into the school's system

584
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
to change the grades?

585
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,360
It sounds good.

586
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,590
He can do that.

587
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,230
Why didn't I think of this?

588
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,590
Can I ask him to change mine?

589
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,590

You never had a class. Do you want to take the test?

Okay. You all can go back.

Where did you get the certificate for sick leave?

You cheated the teacher with it.
