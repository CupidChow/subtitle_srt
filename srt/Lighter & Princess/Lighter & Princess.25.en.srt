What an awesome overseas returnee.

173
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,720
So talkative.

174
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,830
Mr. Dong.

175
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,510
I told you many times.

176
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,120
Here is not your house.

177
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,390
How dare you wear slippers at work!

178
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,070
Can you follow the rules?

179
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,630
I see.

180
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
Edematous. My feet are edematous.

181
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,870
Go on working!

182
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Here is another bag.

183
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,790
I'm helping you lose weight.

184
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
You... No need.

185
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,790
Mr. Dong,

186
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,720
you haven't come for long.

187
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,600
Let me report our work to you.

188
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,000
Look.

189
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,790
Do they look like a tyrant and a eunuch?

190
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,790
What's Mr. Dong's background?

191
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,150
Why don't you tell me?

192
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,790
He is a gang leader?

193
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,630
There are no gangs in China.

194
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,750
In other words,

195
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,670
during my absence,

196
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,600
the only project

197
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,910
of our company...

198
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,120
"Invincible General".

199
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,120
Yes.

200
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,150
..."Invincible General"

201
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,240
is still being designed.

202
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,150
Don't tell me that

203
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,150
you didn't even make any progress.

204
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,080
To be specific...

205
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,150
Shut up!

206
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,750
Meeting!

207
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,510
Meeting!

208
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,600
Well, I can't understand.

209
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,480
Why couldn't you complete

210
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,750
such a simple game

211
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,270
in a few months?

212
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,320
Do you know how much I invested in it?

213
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,840
But now

214
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,510
I can't even see a demo.

215
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,200
You're incompetent,

216
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,720
aren’t you?

217
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,550
Yes, I am.

218
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,480
And you.

219
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,720
Good-for-nothing.

220
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,630
I admit that I should be blamed for it.

221
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,750
I admit.

222
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,440
Well,

223
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,750
do you think our game is funny?

224
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,360
I think it's...

225
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,240
...not funny.

226
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,240
You don't even think it's funny.

227
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,750
How can it attract players?

228
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,670
When you introduced this project to me,

229
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,360
you used a special

230
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,080
term...

231
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,790
Hot.

232
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,030
Hot!

233
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,550
Tell me

234
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,240
why you can't go on

235
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,320
with this hot game.

236
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,600
Why?

237
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,790
Did you make analysis?

238
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,360
What's the game?

239
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,550
Don't break in.

240
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,600
How could you recruit

241
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,550
such an ill-behaved employee?

242
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,840
What are we doing?

243
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,670
We're having a strategic meeting.

244
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,430
If you're all ill-behaved,

245
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,750
will we win?

246
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,840
Well,

247
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,240
facing you good-for-nothings,

248
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,870
I don't want to go on scolding.

249
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,440
Now I just want one of you

250
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,150
can stand up and tell me that

251
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:50,960
he can

252
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,670
complete this project alone!

253
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,240
See?

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,910
Stop!

255
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,080
Did I dismiss the meeting?

256
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,000
Can you get a result from this meeting?

257
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,120
If not, don't waste time.

258
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,030
Say again.

259
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,120
Say again!

260
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,360
Say again!

261
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,120
I can!

262
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,600
I can complete this project alone.

263
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,670
Gosh.

264
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,550
You...

265
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,720
...can?

266
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,120
I can.

267
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,240
Zhu Yun.

268
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,080
Zhu Yun.

269
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,510
The doctor returned from overseas.

270
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,630
You may know a little

271
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,440
about our corporate culture.

272
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,840
This company has corporate culture?

273
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,120
When the boss speaks,

274
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,240
don't break in.

275
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,360
If you promise the boss, it means that you ensure you'll complete it.

276
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,750
So

277
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,120
you

278
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,390
still can?

279
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,440
I can.

280
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,840
I like such employees as you who always rush forward.

281
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,120
Do you know why?

282
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Such employees

283
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,270
are prone to yield in trouble.

284
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,600
Especially when such a proud

285
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,790
and arrogant

286
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,600
doctor returned

287
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,000
from overseas

288
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,910
and able woman

289
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,870
apologizes to me,

290
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,030
it's much funnier.

291
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,960
Then I entrust the project...

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,870
"Invincible General".

293
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:49,870
...to you.

294
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,720
You were in charge of this project before?

295
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,030
You help her with it.

296
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,670
And that thorn...

297
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,200
Li Xun!

298
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,670
You also join her group!

299
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,790
Well, Iron Lady.

300
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,750
Iron Lady!

301
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,550
Iron Lady.

302
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,600
You're the group leader.

303
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,510
You three is a project group.

304
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,120
If you complete it, you'll have a bonus and get a rise,

305
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,320
or else you'll be fired together!

306
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,750
Understand?

307
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,550
Hello,

308
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,360
Dong's special car will serve you.

309
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,240
What's the game you just talked about?

310
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,750
Group Leader,

311
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,630
you may be capable.

312
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,750
However,

313
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,840
didn't you act recklessly

314
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,270
before knowing

315
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,080
about this game?

316
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,670
I just wanted to help you solve the problem.

317
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,630
You help us solve the problem?

318
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,000
You just worried that

319
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,270
Mr. Dong would fight with your friend.

320
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,670
Don't forget the fan.

321
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,910
Then the group of "Invincible General"

322
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,200
is officially established today.

323
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,720
I assign today's tasks.

324
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,670
Zhao Teng,

325
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,670
you summarize the previous information

326
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,790
for the following project meeting.

327
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,600
OK.

328
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,030
You,

329
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,670
give us technical support temporarily.

330
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,200
Specifically,

331
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,630
assemble the computer for me first.

332
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,630
Any problem?

333
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,870
No problem, Group Leader.

334
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,840
Let's begin.

335
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,240
OK.

336
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,480
Let me give you an introduction

337
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,270
to the current project first.

338
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,510
Li Xun,

339
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,200
every dog has its day.

340
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,200
Morning.

341
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,270
Good morning.

342
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,030
Morning.

343
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,790
Morning, Group Leader.

344
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,480
Morning.

345
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,030
Zhao Teng,

346
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,960
Li Xun,

347
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,080
go in for a meeting.

348
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,510
OK.

349
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,200
Enjoy yourself.

350
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,750
Li Xun, meeting!

351
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,790
Group Leader,

352
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,910
your friend doesn't come.

353
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,790
Don't worry. He'll come in.

354
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,440
Let's begin.

355
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,030
"Invincible General" is

356
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,240
a war simulation game.

357
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,440
It's simple

358
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,590
and focuses on

359
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,070
fierceness, excitement

360
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,550
and righteous ardor.

361
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,510
Li Xun, have you finished watching it?

362
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,350
What do you think of it?

363
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,400
Fierceness, excitement and righteous ardor?

364
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,000
Are you kidding?

365
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,030
What's wrong?

366
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,160
You can't even be aware of such obvious errors?

367
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,400
Have you forgotten the history you learned?

368
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,880
That is Lü Bu, isn't that?

369
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,270
The Warring States Period

370
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:52,960
is the age background of this game,

371
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,310
but Lü Bu was born in the Three Kingdoms Period.

372
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,310
Really? Yeah.

373
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,510
Xiaojian should be blamed for it.

374
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,110
He must imitate it from other games.

375
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,880
Anything else?

376
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,310
Take a closer look.

377
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,480
No problem.

378
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,240
The Three Kingdoms Period is

379
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,000
the age background of more than 90% of the war simulation games on the market,

380
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,400
but the background of this game is the Warring States Period.

381
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,030
Qin Shi Huang eliminated and unified the six states.

382
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,590
If players can be attracted by this story,

383
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,720
it'll be a major breakthrough.

384
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
I didn't mean this.

385
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,480
There were only saddles but no stirrups

386
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,790
during the Warring States Period.

387
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,960
Stirrup was invented in the Han Dynasty.

388
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,790
Really?

389
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,270
Fire was the totem of Zhou people.

390
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,920
Qin Shi Huang believed in the Five-element Theory.

391
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,640
He thought the Qin Dynasty

392
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,480
would extinguish the fire Zhou as water.

393
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,590
Black stands for water,

394
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,070
so the Qin people liked black.

395
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,440
Qin Shi Huang

396
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,030
went on an expedition in conspicuous

397
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,640
lemon yellow?

398
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,750
Is he SpongeBob SquarePants?

399
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,270
The current games are too low.

400
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,920
Even the street fighting isn't so low.

401
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,070
Set it aside.

402
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,440
What's more,

403
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,920
everything in this game is related to the Three Kingdoms Period,

404
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,790
which is inconsistent with the history.

405
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,750
You know much about history.

406
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,680
However, is it so important?

407
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,550
Users are always much smarter and more sensitive

408
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,640
than who they are in your imagination.

409
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,830
Your current perfunctoriness

410
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,440
will be finally reflected as the game achievement.

411
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,640
Your criticism

412
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,640
makes sense.

413
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,920
Can you give

414
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,720
some substantive suggestions for modification?

415
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,680
Design a new one.

416
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,880
Well,

417
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,640
the players of this game

418
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,110
are less-educated.

419
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,000
They won't care about

420
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,400
and know these.

421
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,160
Do you agree, Group Leader?

422
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,920
Design a new one.

423
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,790
What?

424
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,060
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

425
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,440
Zhao Teng,

426
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,000
I heard from Guo Shijie that

427
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,270
you'd designed many games,

428
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,750
but none of them were popular.

429
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,550
You can't go on like this.

430
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,550
Don't you want to design a game that

431
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,200
can show your strength?

432
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,070
I also wanted to design a popular one,

433
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,830
but I couldn't.

434
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,110
No one cooperated with me, but I still...

435
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,790
Go on.

436
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,590
Just do this first.

437
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,310
Well, it is too bad.

438
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,920
It'll take much time to modify this game.

439
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,680
You must do so.

440
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,000
Don't be afraid of troubles and think much.

441
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,270
Just do your best.

442
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,880
Now I'm the project leader.

443
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,070
If something really goes wrong,

444
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,070
you won't be blamed.

445
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,830
I don't worry about this.

446
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,480
A friend told me

447
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,680
not to always do easy things,

448
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,270
that is,

449
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,200
we should look for trouble actively.

450
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,110
It's useless to escape.

451
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,590
Come on.

452
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,030
Do you think she is a masochist?

453
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,440
OK.

454
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,750
I won't escape.

455
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,920
Otherwise I'm a coward!

456
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:31,920
Hello.

457
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,830
Is this your take-out?

458
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,030
Yes. Thank you.

459
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,590
I treat you to breakfast.

460
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,960
-So good? -Thanks, Group Leader.

461
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,030
Thanks, Group Leader.

462
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,750
You're welcome.

463
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,960
Well, this is for you.

464
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,400
This is for me.

465
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,750
Try your best to read this book.

466
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,270
If you have any questions,

467
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,110
you can ask me.

468
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,790
Li Xun.

469
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,880
Li Xun,

470
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,480
do you still like me?

471
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,430
When can you

472
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,070
be no longer self-sentimental?

473
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,030
That's good.

474
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,550
Then we can cooperate.

475
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,200
Group Leader Zhu,

476
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,880
when did I promise to cooperate with you?

477
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,200
If you don't want to cooperate, you can resign.

478
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,790
Now I'm the project leader.

479
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,030
As long as you don't quit Flying,

480
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,350
we must cooperate.

481
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,400
Don't try to drive me away

482
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,110
by playing tricks on me.

483
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,400
Before getting L&P back,

484
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
I won't leave.

485
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,640
I'll treat you as my colleague.

486
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,830
I hope you can do the same.

487
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,110
Ms. Xu.

488
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,310
Ms. Xu.

489
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,640
Ms. Xu.

490
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,550
Put these printed materials

491
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,480
in the meeting room later.

492
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,200
OK.

493
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,830
Ms. Xu.

494
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,790
There should be no something wrong.

495
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,200
Send the summary sheet to me later.

496
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:32,720
OK.

497
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,680
Li Xun really went to that Flying Network?

498
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,240
Not only Li Xun,

499
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,640
Zhu Yun also went there.

500
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,240
Tell me about Flying Network.

501
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,960
This company

502
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
was founded less than one year ago,

503
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,920
only had four members,

504
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,640
with registered capital of 1 million yuan.

505
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,030
The information you're browsing

506
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,030
is about their boss

507
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,110
Dong Siyang.

508
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,750
He used to be a wrestler

509
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,750
but didn't make any achievement.

510
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,160
He quit when he was ineligible for wrestling

511
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,000
and now is a taxi driver.

512
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,060
Later I heard that

513
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,680
he was imprisoned

514
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,200
for hurting someone to revenge his friend.

515
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,550
What's their capital source?

516
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,480
It comes from Dong Siyang.

517
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
The start-up capital

518
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,240
comes from

519
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,550
the compensation for demolition of Dong Siyang's old home.

520
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,640
He is an upstart.

521
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,350
He knows little

522
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,510
about the Internet,

523
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,030
let alone game development.

524
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,480
And his three employees

525
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,000
are all

526
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,000
good-for-nothings.

527
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,750
Show their games to me.

528
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,160
None.

529
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,960
Their company has only registered a game

530
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,720
called

531
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,110
"Invincible General".

532
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,440
It doesn't conform to the current market trend at all.

533
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,240
It's been a year since the registration,

534
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,270
but it hasn't been put into service yet.

535
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,350
Don't worry.

536
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,110
Their company

537
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,790
has zero performance now.

538
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,720
It won't last long.

539
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,510
Li Xun and Zhu Yun join

540
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,920
such a terrible company.

541
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,960
Two madmen.

542
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,590
Do you think Li Xun is a madman or a fool?

543
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,160
Keep an eye on him.

544
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,920
I see.

545
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,030
OK.

546
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,200
I'm leaving.

547
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,030
Gao,

548
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,310
why don't you allow me to be

549
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,270
the ambassador for the "Pink Memory"?

550
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,720
Your image is not suitable.

551
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,070
"Pink Memory"

552
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,830
is an education simulation game about first love,

553
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,960
so its image ambassador should match its style.

554
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,720
It means that my temperament is bad.

555
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,070
Lina,

556
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,070
don't be mischievous.

557
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,400
This is the company's business,

558
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,550
and many shareholders voted for this decision.

559
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,640
Don't lie to me.

560
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,030
I heard that

561
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,200
only you voted against this decision in the meeting.

562
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,400
My company has so many games.

563
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,070
You can choose another one.

564
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,030
I just want this.

565
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,400
I like it.

566
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,550
Honey, don't be mischievous.

567
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,960
Now everyone knows you're my wife.

568
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,110
If I didn't vote against it,

569
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,750
no one dared do so.

570
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:52,920
Then

571
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,640
others won't give opinions,

572
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,960
and only I have the say.

573
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,110
You're indeed the only one to have the say.

574
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,550
Well,

575
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,240
give me a reason.

576
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,830
Now that you voted against it,

577
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,030
tell me why I'm ineligible.

578
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm not young enough

579
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,830
or don't look like

580
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,400
the first lover?

581
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,070
The sage even didn't avoid his relatives when recommending talents.

582
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,750
I'm your wife,

583
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,310
so you forced me out?

584
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,880
OK.

585
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,550
I promise.

586
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,400
I'll notify the Publicity Department of it.

587
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,000
Come on.

588
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,160
Sit down.

589
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,160
Let me make coffee for you.

590
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,960
You know

591
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,270
My Heart Flying?

592
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,590
No.

593
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,480
Li Xun joins it.

594
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,160
I don't know what he'll do.

595
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,960
He'd been imprisoned for three years.

596
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,400
What can he do?

597
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,270
The computer industry is always changing.

598
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,070
He can't catch up.

599
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,960
You're so non-confident in him?

600
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,160
Don't talk nonsense.

601
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,510
I'm confident in you.

602
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,960
What's more,

603
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,400
it's just a terrible company.

604
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,880
You don't need to keep an eye on it.

605
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,920
Who said I'll keep an eye on him?

606
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,070
Bye-bye.

607
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,110
Bye-bye.

608
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,480
I'm leaving.

609
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,270
Bye-bye.

610
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,240
See you tomorrow.

611
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,750
There must be something wrong with the one who works overtime.

612
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,680
Colleague.

613
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,350
You don't leave?

614
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,200
You had thrown it into the trash can.

615
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,070
But now you still eat it?

616
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,240
Did I throw it away?

617
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,200
OK.

618
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,070
There's a microwave oven. You can heat it.

619
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,960
I'm leaving.

620
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,510
It doesn't taste bad.

621
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,960
OK, just be colleagues.

622
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,680
You're also shirking here?

623
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,550
Are you avoiding Group Leader?

624
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,030
I happened to buy two bottles.

625
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,440
I don't avoid her.

626
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,880
-It's not easy... -Zhao Teng,

627
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
do you go through the modification plan

628
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,880
I gave you?

629
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,720
Group Leader,

630
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,510
I've just rested for a minute.

631
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,350
Really?

632
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,110
This morning, you

633
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,830
bought cigarettes,

634
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,270
coffee and finally water.

635
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,510
You've come out at least five times.

636
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,880
What is this?

637
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,830
If we want to lay a solid foundation for the "Invincible General",

638
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,030
[Invincible General Project Schedule]
we need to do a lot of work.

639
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,960
It's intricate,

640
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,920
so we must have

641
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,110
a detailed work schedule.

642
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,790
This is a project schedule.

643
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,590
Work by the hour?

644
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,920
Don't be so detailed.

645
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,310
We must be make a plan for every week,

646
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,000
every day

647
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,480
or even every hour,

648
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,680
and spare enough flexible time.

649
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,750
Only by performing efficiently

650
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,510
can we achieve the goals and spend less time in more work.

651
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,480
Well,

652
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,200
another question.

653
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,790
Zhao Teng. Zhao Teng. Zhao Teng.

654
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,160
Zhu Yun. Zhu Yun. Zhu Yun.

655
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,030
Only we two will work?

656
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,000
What about him?

657
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,070
He's still studying.

658
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,960
Given my previous experience,

659
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,480
plans are

660
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,110
always upset.

661
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,000
You can have a try.

662
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
I will.

663
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,590
Just ne fair.

664
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,550
Let's vote for it.

665
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,790
OK, it's democratic.

666
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,550
I agree.

667
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,200
I object.

668
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,750
I agree.

669
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,240
The schedule is passed by two votes to one.

670
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,310
It will be implemented this afternoon.

671
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,880
It's democratic. Anyway, I don't need to work.

672
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,350
Well, you don't need to work, so you certainly voted for it.

673
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,200
OK, don't need to discuss with me.

674
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,160
Just suit yourself.

675
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,020
I can't go on.

676
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,640
Isn't this much better?

677
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,200
You haven't left?

678
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,720
You suffered because of Group Leader Zhu.

679
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,110
I'm indeed a little tired.

680
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,270
However,

681
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,550
amazingly,

682
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,070
such great modification

683
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,030
is not very tiring.

684
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,880
Why?

685
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,550
Because you didn't do more work at all.

686
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,830
I didn't do more work? It's impossible.

687
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,240
Actually, Zhu Yun didn't specially

688
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,440
assign less work to you.

689
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,790
All your tasks had been assigned,

690
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,160
but you still could finish them easily.

691
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,000
Do you know why?

692
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:46,960
Why?

693
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,680
Because she knows what you need to do every week, every day

694
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,590
or even every hour.

695
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,000
After making a rough plan,

696
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,480
you won't deviate from the main direction.

697
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,590
Then you just need to add details.

698
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,830
How long have you known Zhu Yun?

699
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,680
Is she always so awesome?

700
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,800
Maybe.

701
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,150
Just follow Zhu Yun.

702
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,710
She'll surprise you.

703
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm curious about something.

704
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,760
What's your relationship

705
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,710
with Group Leader Zhu?

706
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,150
We don't have any relationship.

707
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,110
You don't have any relationship?

708
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,280
If you don't have any relationship,

709
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,760
she required us to recruit you

710
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,320
before joining us?

711
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,400
If you don't have any relationship,

712
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,550
she took this task for you?

713
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,710
If you don't have any relationship,

714
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,670
she paid you?

715
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,190
We're not fools.

716
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,360
Tell me.

717
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,360
I won't tell others.

718
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,320
Because I'm handsome.

719
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,550
OK?

720
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,710
OK.

721
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,440
Xiaoxiao,

722
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:14,960
let's go.

723
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,280
Watch out.

724
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
The ground is slippery.

725
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,800
Why doesn't it work? It has limited up by a little more than 3%.

726
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,630
Let me show you.

727
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,230
Only a little more than 3%?

728
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,110
Didn't you say it would limit up on at least two consecutive days?

729
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,550
It's lucky enough that it still can limit up now.

730
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,030
See you tomorrow.

731
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,590
I'm leaving.

732
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,710
This, this one will definitely limit up.

733
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,190
Lend it to me.

734
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,840
Well, Li, Li Xun!

735
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,070
You've had an umbrella, don't you?

736
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,760
Li Xun,

737
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,400
where are you going?

738
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,110
It's none of your business.

739
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,230
Lend me your umbrella.

740
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,280
I'm going to the library

741
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,230
for the work.

742
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,280
Where are you going? I can send you there.

743
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:16,840
No need.

744
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,630
Anyway, I'm a girl.

745
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,960
How could you refuse me?

746
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,480
Would you feel wronged under my umbrella?

747
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,190
Anyway, I'm also the group leader.

748
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,880
You should hold up the umbrella for your leader.

749
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,760
He has gone to bed at 23:00 o'clock?

750
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,670
Is it very late?

751
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,800
No.

752
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,110
Actually, it's common that

753
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,000
the group leader calls his subordinate at night.

754
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,280
Well, you're bold.

755
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,760
You dared reject my call.

756
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,840
Thanks for lending me umbrella yesterday.

757
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,710
Place it in the company.

758
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,320
Why did you reject my call?

759
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,110
I called you at 23:00 o'clock last night,

760
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,840
but you rejected it.

761
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,070
Why did you reject my call?

762
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,360
Why did you call me?

763
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,800
For something.

764
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,920
Work!

765
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,400
Group Leader Zhu,

766
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,840
our company has stipulated our working time, right?

767
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,710
But you didn't have such a sense of time when you were a boss.

768
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,230
Listen up.

769
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,670
Our project is now at a critical moment,

770
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,920
so you need to be on call anytime.

771
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,800
I'm sorry.

772
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,110
I didn't know that was your call.

773
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,110
You didn't have my phone number?

774
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:41,760
Your phone.

775
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,920
If you don't answer my call again, I will deduct your attendance.

776
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,300
[Group Leader Zhu]

777
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,510
Thank you.

778
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,840
You catch a cold?

779
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,920
I was caught in the rain yesterday.

780
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,360
Zhang Fang,

781
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,480
the tissues are used up again. Can you be generous?

782
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,190
Here you are.

783
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,320
Thank you.

784
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,480
Isn't that my umbrella?

785
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,630
Why did you bring it here?

786
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,280
Isn't this Li Xun's umbrella?

787
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,440
He cub

788
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,110
had held an umbrella after work yesterday

789
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,400
but still took mine away.

790
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,320
So I have a cold.

791
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,480
He doesn't work

792
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,760
but still gets me in trouble.

793
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,400
Group Leader,

794
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,360
I have a cold.

795
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,440
Can I take a day off?

796
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,360
I wrote a sentence on the wall as a high school junior.

797
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,190
Guess what I wrote.

798
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,840
What?

799
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,150
As long as I'm still alive, go on learning.

800
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,960
It's also for you.

801
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,760
Well, you're more horrible than Mr. Dong.

802
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,440
Are you Exploiter Zhu?

803
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,030
That's because you've never seen

804
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,000
Exploiter Li.

805
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,960
I'll directly return the umbrella to Zhao Teng later.

806
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,510
Zhao Teng has finished building the framework,

807
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,880
and I'm writing the storyline.

808
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,030
I'll send you the chronology of events of the Qin State.

809
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,400
You add some details for me.

810
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,030
I'm busy.

811
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,280
I ask for leave in the afternoon.

812
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,710
Where are you going?

813
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,150
This is my individual privacy.

814
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,550
You've left before I permit your leave.

815
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,670
Why does it crash again?

816
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,670
It's just a matter of getting used to it.

817
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:27,840
Hello.

818
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,840
Hello.

819
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,440
This model is good.

820
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,320
Titan

821
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,960
is absolutely the top one.

822
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,320
How much is it?

823
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,070
How many do you want?

824
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,400
Two.

825
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,550
Flying Network!

826
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,920
Excuse me, is Miss Zhu in?

827
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,760
Yes.

828
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,110
Your parcel.

829
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,190
OK.

830
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,670
Titan.

831
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,150
CPU.

832
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,800
Memory bank.

833
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,440
Power supply.

834
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,150
Mainboard.

835
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,800
Come on.

836
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,880
You're assembling the host?

837
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,920
The positive and negative electrodes are connected reversely.

838
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,630
I help you.

839
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,110
No need.

840
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,480
Why are you here?

841
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,670
Come to fetch some materials.

842
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,440
You disassemble all the parts?

843
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,030
I assembled them for more than an hour.

844
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,150
Did I also assemble other parts wrong?

845
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,590
No.

846
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,110
I'm rearranging the wires.

847
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,000
What if you don't rearrange the wires?

848
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,550
It's ugly.

849
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:42,840
How is it?

850
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,960
This is your privilege.

851
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,630
Work hard.

852
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,550
I'm going wash my hands.

853
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,110
Titan.

854
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:26,400
You bought this?

855
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,670
A box of instant noodles.

856
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,070
What would you like for dinner?

857
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,760
You bought me the new equipment,

858
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:44,960
so I treat you to dinner in return.

859
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,360
You treat me to dinner?

860
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,920
If you're not free, forget it.

861
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,710
Where are we going?

862
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,670
Who?

863
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,360
Who?

864
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,320
Nobody.

865
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,230
I can move on.

866
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,230
Then why bother coming here?

867
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,630
I think

868
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,440
you are jealous.

869
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,000
Have you ever thought that

870
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,320
if we were together,

871
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,280
everything would be different now?

872
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,070
Can we make it up now?

873
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,020
♫That breaks through the boundary♫

874
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,380
♫The first sight♫

875
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:46,980
♫Spreads and later it wins the world for me♫
