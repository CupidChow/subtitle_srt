♫Everything is different when we watch the sky from the sea bottom♫

2
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,820
♫The person I used to be is gone♫

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,980
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,380
♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,260
♫We would bloom in the darkness♫

00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,220
♫The knight and the king♫

♫Like the white sails in night navigation are protecting the ocean♫

9

♫I see a clear direction♫

[Episode 33]

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,960
Lina,

22
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,600
I have something to talk with you.

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,560
What is it?

24
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,350
Only you can help me.

25
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,350
What's wrong?

26
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,470
What happened?

27
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,880
The turnover of Li Xun's Blind Box of Love

28
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,720
has exceed ten million.

29
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,040
Several major investment organizations

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
have started to contact them.

31
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,560
And it's just the beginning.

32
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Exceeding ten million

33
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,040
doesn't sound a big deal.

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not a big deal now,

35
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,320
but the market trend is very dangerous.

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,790
Once they have money,

37
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,600
we won't have products to fight with them.

38
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,840
As you know,

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,230
I can't hack into their company's network.

40
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,400
So what do you want me to do?

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,560
Get the game source code

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,910
of Blind Box of Love.

43
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,160
How?

44
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,880
You still have chances

45
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,950
to get close to Li Xun, right?

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,440
Everything you did today

47
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,910
is to let me take the code?

48
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,230
Lina,

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,750
we're on the same boat.

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,350
I'm not doing this for myself.

51
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,190
I can't watch him rise without doing anything.

52
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,070
You know how cruel Li Xun is.

53
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,190
He will seize every chance to bring down L&P,

54
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,510
and he won't let me go.

55
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,790
As long as he doesn't let me go,

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,630
we will lose everything.

57
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,840
Lina.

58
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,190
You make me sick.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,190
You also hate him, don't you?

60
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,630
You also want to see him lose

61
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,720
and beg me for mercy, right?

62
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,600
It hurts. Let go.

63
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,720
Or are you reluctant to do it?

64
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,350
No, I'm not.

65
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,880
You...

66
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,230
You have been thinking about Li Xun, haven't you?

67
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,790
It's such a good chance.

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,280
I'll send you to his side.

69
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,750
I'll send you to his side.

70
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,400
Are you insane?

71
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,000
Do you know what you are saying?

72
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,120
Stop acting.

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,880
You just can't wait to do that.

74
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,950
You can't wait to start a relationship with him.

75
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,950
You can't wait to have an affair with him.

76
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,910
You've thought about it a million times.

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,720
I...

78
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,760
Why would I marry you?

79
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,720
You regret it?

80
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,430
Of course you regret it.

81
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,470
You never love me.

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
You only love my money.

83
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,310
Hadn't I

84
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,760
cleaned up the mess for your father,

85
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,870
you, you wouldn't have married me.

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,080
I married you

87
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,960
because I thought you were

88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,600
still who you were six years ago.

89
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,350
I thought you were still the boy whose

90
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,910
eyes twinkled

91
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,870
when he talked about Blue Crown APP.

92
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,870
I'm telling you.

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,670
I've never seen a woman who

94
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,840
loses money most.

95
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,280
I won't do this

96
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,870
for you.

97
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,160
Don't force me.

98
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,040
I force you?

99
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,280
Li Xun forces me! You all force me!

100
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,080
Let's get a divorce, okay?

101
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,640
What did you say?

102
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,470
Divorce.

103
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,960
Gao Jianhong,

104
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,640
you have lost.

105
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,200
Lina...

106
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,280
I agree to divorce.

107
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Do as I said

108
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,080
and you have freedom.

109
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,990
Why do you ask me to come here?

110
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,910
Come in.

111
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:20,990
Have a seat.

112
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,720
What would you like to drink?

113
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,670
No need.

114
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,200
Coffee, okay?

115
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,070
Just get straight to the point.

116
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,280
L&P will be listed soon.

117
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,710
Do you know?

118
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,590
So?

119
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,310
So,

120
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,240
you can't win Gao.

121
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,670
You want to persuade us to give up?

122
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,830
No,

123
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,910
I want cooperation.

124
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,040
Hello?

125
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,480
Who let you go to meet Xu Lina?

126
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,790
It's strange.

127
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,160
Xu Lina asked me to meet her this morning,

128
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,830
and she persuaded us to give up confrontation

129
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,950
and work with Gao Jianhong to develop Blind Box of Love.

130
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,590
How?

131
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,120
Gao Jianhong will never work with us.

132
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,880
There must be some tricks behind this.

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,360
I also think it's abnormal,

134
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,310
but I don't know what exactly is abnormal.

135
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,280
Well, leave her alone.

136
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,280
Go back to the company.

137
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,430
We've got good news.

138
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,480
What good news?

139
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,190
You'll know after you come back.

140
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,910
Congratulations to you for winning the Network Industry Development Government Award

141
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,120
with your online game Invincible General.

142
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,520
You are invited to

143
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,830
Network Industry Development Award Ceremony.

144
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,640
The signature is

145
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,640
Network Industry Development Association of Information Industry Department.

146
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,670
So it's a government award.

147
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,190
There isn't such a government association.

148
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,830
I think it's like

149
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,880
cheating us out of the membership fee.

150
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,710
It doesn't say we need to pay any fee.

151
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,400
Wait. Look.

152
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,000
There is really such an award.

153
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,910
Network Industry Development Association

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,760
is subordinate to the Information Industry Department.

155
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,760
Network Industry Development Government Award

156
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,070
is a new award established in 2019

157
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,310
to encourage innovation in Internet technology.

158
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,310
This is its official website.

159
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,190
Is big data credible?

160
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,240
It's true.

161
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,360
It's the first session for this award.

162
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,120
There are three places for the game awards,

163
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,550
and we won one of them.

164
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,280
And our game is the only mobile game.

165
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,310
Good.

166
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,430
I still can't believe it.

167
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,240
Professor Zhao Guowei recommended it.

168
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,640
Well.

169
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,550
I don't mean this.

170
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,120
I mean,

171
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,710
this year,

172
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,040
you developed one game each.

173
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,550
We made a fortune with the game you developed.

174
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,950
And we won an award for this game.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,360
So we've gained both fame and fortune.

176
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,240
Does it mean that I can count on you

177
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,790
to have everything I want in the future?

178
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,550
You can think that way.

179
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,240
We'll make money.

180
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,590
Don't be complacent.

181
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,160
Have you found the person I asked you to recruit?

182
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,760
Yes, I have.

183
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,710
I'm printing it for you.

184
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,950
Look.

185
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,360
Many companies are invited to the ceremony.

186
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,550
My Heart Flying Network Company,

187
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,790
Shuxingyu,

188
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,190
Games of Tomorrow,

189
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,910
L&P

190
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,880
and Dandelion.

191
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,120
Quite many companies.

192
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,550
Are we going?

193
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,360
Yes.

194
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,520
We have to go,

195
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,430
and we need to be gorgeously dressed.

196
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,000
Where are they?

197
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,760
They have set out to attend the ceremony.

198
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,790
Oh, God. It's one o'clock.

199
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,240
Why didn't you remind me?

200
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,760
Go.

201
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,480
Are you going to the ceremony wearing this?

202
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,760
What's the problem?

203
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,950
As the only female employee,

204
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,550
you should keep up our company's appearance.

205
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,190
I've been updating Invincible General the whole day.

206
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,710
And there's a heavy traffic jam now.

207
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,430
I don't have enough time.

208
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,400
What's this?

209
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,950
Bad taste.

210
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,540
[2019 Network Industry Development Awards Ceremony
Lead the Future]

211
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:14,640
Hello.

212
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,310
Hello. This way, please.

213
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,120
Please. Please.

214
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,310
Be careful.

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,910
Get closer.

216
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,070
Look here. Good.

217
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,760
Smile.

218
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,670
You have never attended a ceremony?

219
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,240
Well, I'm a bit nervous.

220
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,120
I... I... I...

221
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,710
Where are my glasses?

222
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,310
Is this the upper class?

223
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,070
Why doesn't anyone take photo for us?

224
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,480
I'll take photos for you. Give me your phone.

225
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,400
I... Come on. Come on.

226
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,120
Come on. Take a group photo.

227
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,950
Come on. Take a group photo.

228
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,240
Fang... Fang... Fang...

229
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,910
Please squat.

230
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,590
My legs will look longer in that case.

231
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,880
Who's this?

232
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,400
Oh, my God.

233
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,310
Is this Political Commissar Zhu?

234
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,950
I don't think she is.

235
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,880
Go. Go. Let's go inside. Let's go inside.

236
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:05,880
Go. Go, go.

237
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,240
I'm still a bit nervous.

238
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,430
Hello. Please look at the camera.

239
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,480
After Group Leader Zhu and Group Leader Li come,

240
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,480
what do we look like?

241
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,790
Bodyguards.

242
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,360
Good. Pretty good.

243
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,000
Good. Smile.

244
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,310
Go. Go, go.

245
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm nervous.

246
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,790
Don't be nervous.

247
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,910
Leaders are coming.

248
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:15,880
Okay.

249
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,240
Now let's invite leaders and guests on the stage

250
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,710
to take a group photo.

251
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,830
Act decently. Take a group photo.

252
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,070
Okay. Thank you.

253
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,190
Three leaders, please go back to your seats.

254
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,830
Leaders go back to their seats.

255
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,430
Leaders go back to their seats.

256
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,360
Come on. Take it.

257
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,520
Yeah. Go. Go. Go.

258
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,000
Congratulations.

259
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,880
This award...

260
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,590
Thank the organizing committee for giving us this award.

261
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,830
This honor

262
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,830
belongs to every employee of My Heart Flying Network Company.

263
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,310
Good.

264
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,280
It belongs to every entrepreneur.

265
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:02,880
Good.

266
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,040
I believe

267
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,910
this is only the beginning of the brilliance

268
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,360
My Heart Flying Network Company.

269
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:10,910
Good!

270
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,190
Mr. Li Xun,

271
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
is there anyone in particular you would like to thank?

272
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,880
I do especially want to

273
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,710
thank someone.

274
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,280
That's Gao Jianhong, the CEO of L&P.

275
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,310
Mr. Gao.

276
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,190
I decided to join

277
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,310
My Heart Flying Network Company

278
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,830
here at the site of the  Internet conference

279
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,760
because of Mr. Gao.

280
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,360
Unexpectedly, I can accept an award here today.

281
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,360
What a surprise.

282
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,480
Invincible General wins an award.

283
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,360
Today, I would like to

284
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,910
ask Mr. Gao.

285
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,390
How is your Rivalry among Seven Powers?

286
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,350
As we know, something copied can't survive for long.

287
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,310
Chinese companies in the Internet industry have made so much money.

288
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
But if we analyze the internal structure carefully,

289
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,040
we will find that such companies

290
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,870
have few cutting-edge technologies.

291
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,070
We don't hope that

292
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,830
Chinese Internet companies

293
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,150
still rely on entertainment,

294
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,280
services and sales of cheap products

295
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,520
to make money

296
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,920
10 or 20

297
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,040
years later.

298
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,280
Mr. Li Xun,

299
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,520
Internet startups have met with

300
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,000
a chilly winter of financing since last year.

301
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,830
Recently, My Heart Flying Network Company

302
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,310
became the target that investors are chasing.

303
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,870
But I heard that you turned them down.

304
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,760
Why?

305
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,070
They all want to invest in games.

306
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,200
But your company is a game company.

307
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,280
It is now,

308
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,870
but it won't be a game company only.

309
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,590
So, what's the development direction

310
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,630
of your company?

311
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,040
Online medical care.

312
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,310
I hope that

313
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,390
the survival rate of cancer will be increased by 1%.

314
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,800
♫Do you feel regret?♫

315
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,740
♫Forget him♫

316
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,440
♫Wipe away tears and send him away♫

317
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
The path we choose to take is not easy.

318
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,260
♫Like two parallel lines we will not be concerned about each other again♫
I'm afraid many small investors can't afford to lose.

319
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,040
So our standard for choosing investor is

320
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,220
♫The ruins of time♫
to put quality before quantity.

321
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,800
♫Turn into a one-person lonely island♫
Those who trust you

322
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,580
♫Commemorate those years of struggle♫
will always trust you.

323
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,500
♫And the road he had lighted but had no time to walk on♫

324
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,700
♫Light red farewell♫

325
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,040
♫Regretfully is left in the season when leaves fall♫

326
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,150
I believe

327
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,640
♫The boundary is invisible in the light red sky♫
in this industry,

328
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,150
♫Memory is light red light red♫
some are responsible for providing convenience,

329
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,360
♫You are incredibly special♫
some provide entertainment consumption,

330
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,350
♫You are incredibly special♫
but some need to

331
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,380
♫And it makes me more obsessed with you♫
be responsible for changing the era.

332
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,460
♫At dusk in light red, don't ask who was here♫

333
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,860
♫Everything is light red, light red♫

334
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,460
♫Light red us♫

335
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,830
This game succeeds

336
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,630
because I have some capable helpers.

337
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,070
Who are they?

338
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:34,920
I don't know them.

339
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,440
They seem to have been hungry for years.

340
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,590
Drink more.

341
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,830
Would you like to drink some?

342
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,040
Where's Li Xun?

343
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,920
I don't see him.

344
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,040
What is he doing?

345
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,960
I don't know.

346
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,350
I'm taking you somewhere.

347
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,200
Go. Go, go.

348
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,960
I played your game Blind Box of Love.

349
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,040
It's good.

350
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,110
Did you?

351
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,200
This game's users

352
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,000
are usually lonesome nerds.

353
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,200
You have a special taste.

354
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,480
Did you ask him away

355
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,150
because you want to say something to me?

356
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,520
You have something to say to me.

357
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,350
In fact, I knew the cooperation

358
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,790
between Gao and Fang Zhijing later.

359
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,590
Gao never let me get involved in L&P's business.

360
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,480
But honestly,

361
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,680
when you were in prison,

362
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,920
Gao did operate L&P

363
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,240
very well.

364
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,200
He has always wanted to

365
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,040
prove himself to you.

366
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,550
But I think

367
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,590
L&P

368
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,760
will eventually belong to you.

369
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,440
Why?

370
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,200
Because he only wants to make money,

371
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,520
and only wants to prove himself to you.

372
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,350
He doesn't have any lofty ideal.

373
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,000
So these years,

374
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,790
he has got more and more anxious,

375
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,110
more and more paranoid.

376
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,280
I remember that

377
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,870
when I first knew him,

378
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,000
he was not like this.

379
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,630
All of our lives

380
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,440
have changed because of you,

381
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,310
but only have never changed.

382
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,830
When you stood on the stage just now, I was a bit confused.

383
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,790
I thought

384
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,440
we were still in college.

385
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,830
Are you jealous?

386
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,110
You deserve it.

387
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,280
I'm telling you.

388
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,070
Later, more and more women

389
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,440
will show up around Li Xun.

390
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,550
You'll regret it.

391
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,040
Don't mess up our plan.

392
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,920
What plan?

393
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,070
What plan?

394
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,520
No plan.

395
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,520
Tell me.

396
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,870
Li Xun is going to give him the source code.

397
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,000
But he can't give it to him directly.

398
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,830
So we need a plan.

399
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,240
What were you chatting about?

400
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,790
About the past.

401
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,520
You can't forget your old love?

402
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,960
It's good that you haven't forgot him.

403
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,440
Remember to get the source code back.

404
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,960
Rest assured.

405
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,280
I won't forget it.

406
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,870
Don't tell Li Xun

407
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,630
I took you here to eavesdrop.

408
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,000
Why?

409
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,390
Only Li Xun, Dong Siyang

410
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,200
and I know this.

411
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,790
Why didn't you tell me?

412
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,000
Well, do you really not know

413
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,830
or do you pretend not to know?

414
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,590
I don't understand.

415
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,760
You and Li Xun

416
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,630
are not together.

417
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,110
Why does he consider your mood

418
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,310
whatever he does?

419
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,240
But you know nothing about it.

420
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,680
He is overcautious because of you.

421
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,240
You must tell me

422
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,040
if Li Xun meets Xu Lina in the future.

423
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,350
Are you afraid?

424
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,350
What am I afraid of?

425
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,760
Do you want to be pushed down again?

426
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,960
I said nothing.

427
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,000
Mr. Gao, I haven't seen you for long.

428
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,920
It's been a long time.

429
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,110
Mr. Gao, congratulations.

430
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,760
Miss Luna, you're so beautiful.

431
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,790
Come on.

432
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,280
You know Gao Jianhong

433
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,390
let Xu Lina do it?

434
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,150
Yes.

435
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,200
Do you also know she came to steal the source code?

436
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,480
I told you,

437
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,310
I will force him to copy.

438
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,390
Xu Lina came to talk to me

439
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,520
because he has no other ways.

440
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,200
Group Leader Zhu, you are still working.

441
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,790
Why are you here?

442
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,630
Why don't you keep an eye on L&P in the computer room?

443
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,150
Well...

444
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,680
Why do I come here?

445
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,550
Where's Li Xun?

446
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
He has gone home.

447
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,200
Why do you come here?

448
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,790
Why do I come here?

449
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,350
I'm going home.

450
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,680
Why are you taking a pillow with you?

451
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,520
Well...

452
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,140
Do you want to sleep in the storage room

453
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,550
to make room for Li Xun?

454
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,070
Is he with Xu Lina?

455
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,520
When you accepted the award

456
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,720
on the stage that day,

457
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,870
I thought we were

458
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,830
at the information security contest for a moment.

459
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,830
I remember that the judge asked you

460
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,440
about the reason,

461
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,550
and you said...

462
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,350
Because of love.

463
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,830
It's the past.

464
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,440
Yeah.

465
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,390
It has all been the past.

466
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,830
I'll send you home.

467
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,200
No,

468
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,790
I don't want to go home.

469
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,390
Waiter.

470
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,440
Let's play a game.

471
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,390
What game?

472
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,680
Let's play

473
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,960
game of lies.

474
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,070
We'll ask each other questions,

475
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,870
but when we answer,

476
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,350
we have to tell lies.

477
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,590
What do you think?

478
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,550
You ask me first.

479
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,040
I don't have any question.

480
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,480
Then I'll ask myself questions.

481
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,040
The first question.

482
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,790
Why did I marry Gao Jianhong?

483
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,110
Of course it is

484
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,870
because of love.

485
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
The second question.

486
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,790
Were happy these years?

487
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,440
Of course I were happy.

488
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,590
I have a lot of bags,

489
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,790
and several hundred beautiful shoes.

490
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,590
Gao also gave me

491
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,870
a necklace with very large diamonds.

492
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,960
My locker room is bigger than your room,

493
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,280
no, bigger than your house.

494
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,000
Of course I have been living a happy life.

495
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,680
The third question.

496
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,440
If the person I loved back then

497
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,520
appears again,

498
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,310
what will I do?

499
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,720
I will tell him

500
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,630
I am doing good

501
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,630
and living a happy life.

502
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,150
I will tell him

503
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,200
his appearance

504
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,790
does not affect me at all,

505
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,280
and I still can

506
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,350
live a good life with peace.

507
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,870
I'm sorry. I was drunk.

508
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,350
I'm going.

509
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,760
Do you know that if you give it to Gao Jianhong,

510
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,000
you will also be held accountable?

511
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,440
You knew what I came for, right?

512
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,150
Of course you know.

513
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,150
Since you knew what I came for,

514
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,870
the source code inside

515
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,480
is a trap you set for Gao Jianhong.

516
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:19,680
Right?

517
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,150
I'd better give it to Gao Jianhong.

518
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
You may choose not to do it.

519
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,920
You don't need to help me.

520
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,760
I'm not helping you,

521
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,200
but helping myself.

522
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,720
When you planned all this,

523
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,040
did you ever consider me?

524
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,630
Xu Lina,

525
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,000
I have owned you an apology.

526
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,390
I'm sorry.

527
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,390
I can't owe you another apology.

528
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,830
You don't owe me anything.

529
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,480
Everything I did is aboveboard.

530
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,790
I quite envy you and Zhu Yun.

531
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,960
You haven't changed.

532
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,870
These years,

533
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,720
many things have changed.

534
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,480
I also want to keep something unchanged for myself.

535
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,110
I'm going.

536
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,590
Bye-bye.

537
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,550
Bye.

538
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,590
Where are you?

539
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,960
I'm at home.

540
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,800
Hello?

541
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,670
Where are you?

542
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,750
I'm at home.

543
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,750
Hello?

544
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,750
Hello?

545
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,550
Aren't you at home?

546
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,670
Are you here for an inspection, Political Commissar Zhu?

547
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,840
Did you give her the source code?

548
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,840
Yes.

549
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,750
What did you do?

550
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
We just did something

551
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,800
we could do.

552
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,070
Rest assured.

553
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,520
I advised her not to take such a risk

554
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,880
that might harm herself.

555
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,550
But she has her own consideration.

556
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,110
What should we do next?

557
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,670
Get ready

558
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,190
for a lawsuit.

559
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,150
I've done what you asked me to do.

560
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,750
When will you do the thing

561
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,590
you promised me?

562
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,520
This is the divorce agreement.

563
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,670
I have signed on it.

564
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,230
Don't you watch the content in the flash drive?

565
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,070
I trust you.

566
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,320
You said it's the source code, and it is.

567
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,550
But you

568
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,400
don't trust me.

569
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Is that so simple?

570
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,270
It's just so simple.

571
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,590
Money of our family has been in your account.

572
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,360
Just take it as my compensation for you.

573
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,880
You can sell your shares in the company

574
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,150
to me after the company is listed.

575
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
Then you will have money

576
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,920
to pay off your father's debts.

577
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,710
So you won't be dragged by him

578
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,440
and do thing you don't want to do.

579
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,360
And this house

580
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,920
and the apartment in Jiangbei

581
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,750
are under your name.

582
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,150
I will move out as soon as possible.

583
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,150
You don't need to do this.

584
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,590
These things belong to you.

585
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,000
I never want you to give them to me.

586
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,040
You never ask me for anything.

587
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,800
And you didn't steal the source code.

588
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,710
Li Xun gave it to you,

589
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,550
and I stole it from your bag.

590
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,270
If Li Xun gets you involved,

591
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,070
you will say I forced you

592
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,270
and threatened you to do it.

593
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,150
But in order to ensure your safety,

594
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,710
I will send you abroad as soon as possible.

595
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,840
I will move out.

596
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,630
But what about you?

597
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,480
If it is found out,

598
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,320
will you be put in jail?

599
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,750
It has nothing to do with you.

600
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,040
Thank you.

601
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,840
I should have given you freedom long ago,

602
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,670
but I just didn't want to let go.

603
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,150
It's ironic.

604
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,230
When Li Xun was in prison,

605
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,320
we married.

606
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,110
After Li Xun was released from prison,

607
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,270
we divorced.

608
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,320
Lina,

609
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,750
I thought I could bring you happiness.

610
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,520
I'm sorry.

611
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,040
It seems it has worsened a lot these a few months.

612
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,670
At level 1, brain glioma

613
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,590
can be fully cut through operation.

614
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,230
And it will have a good prognosis effect.

615
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,960
When it has infiltrative growth at level or above,

616
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,000
it's difficult to have an operation.

617
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,040
And the effect of chemoradiotherapy is limited.

618
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,000
It grows at this position in your brain,

619
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,800
and it has been pressing against your blood vessels.

620
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,320
Did you have symptoms of hand shaking and numbness

621
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,230
besides headache recently?

622
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,190
Yes.

623
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,270
So it can't be delayed.

624
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,880
You have to make up your mind to have an operation.

625
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,110
It takes a very long time

626
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,150
to be hospitalized,

627
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,520
have examinations

628
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,480
and recover after the operation.

629
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,920
In addition,

630
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,880
operation is risky.

631
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,590
Mr. Gao,

632
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,800
you know that

633
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,440
risks exist in all operations.

634
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,800
We talked about it before.

635
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,230
Of two evils choose the less.

636
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,800
If you don't have an operation,

637
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,400
you will die.

638
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,070
I don't want any risk.

639
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,230
-Mr. Gao. -I'm not treating it.

640
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,440
As I said,

641
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,960
I have more important things to do.

642
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,280
[Nanhu University]

643
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,110
Can I join the base?

644
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,920
it's quite difficult to find

645
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,590
someone who is capable in the base.

646
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,590
I have listened to you

647
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,070
since the very beginning of the project.

648
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,400
It is because you suffered a loss when you didn't listen to me.

649
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,400
You didn't design the app alone.

650
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,320
I also spent much effort on it.

651
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,400
I just want some respect from you.

652
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,520
Is it hard for you?

653
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,150
If I tell you,

654
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,960
I won't give up

655
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,710
Li Xun

656
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,670
as you do now,

657
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,670
will you still wait for me?

658
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,590
I used to give up everything.

659
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,150
I just wanted to stay far away from you.

660
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,190
But you didn't even give me the chance.

661
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,920
But I don't owe him.

662
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,100
But you owe me.

663
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,000
Gao Jianhong!

664
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,520
Li Xun.

665
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,880
Do you really think no one can defeat you?

666
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,110
He asked you to come

667
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,960
because he has swayed,

668
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,750
but I don't need it.

669
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,360
Since I dared do this,

670
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,880
I have my own way to deal with him.

671
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,270
Do you understand?

672
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,270
