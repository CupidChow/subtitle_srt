Where am I?

23
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,910
My studio.

Your Studio?

25
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,230
When you were sleeping last night,

26
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,120
you almost strangled me too tightly

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
to death.

Where is Li Xun?

You don't remember where you are

Last night...

32
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,320
Oh, my God.

33
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,350
Where is he?

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,440
He left early in the morning.

35
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,230
He went back to the base?

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,000
He doesn't have to report this to me.

37
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,190

38
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,230
It's running out. Charge it now.

39
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,160
No, thanks. I have to go.

You wake up?

42
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,280
You drank quite a lot last night, too.

43
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,230
Why can you still sit down here and write program?

44
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,160
I have different genes

45

We didn't finish the conversation last night.

Don't be entangled with it, OK?

48
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,910
Do make it clear.

49
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,750
What should I say?

50
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,320
No, you have to say something.

51
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,320
Come out with me.

52
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,630
Why didn't you say it early?

53
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,160
We have been working on this website for so long.

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,280
But it is worthless.

55
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,440
Have we been

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,950
working hard for this in vain?

57
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,790
In vain?

58
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,320
After you finish the project,

59
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,470
do you think you gain nothing at all?

60
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,670
No, I don't think so.

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,160
If I told you

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,520
this website earned no money,

63
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,670
and would also be replaced by others later on,

64
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,670
would you still work so hard on it?

65
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,310
But...

66
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,200
Shut up.

Whether it's profitable

70
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,470
depends on a lot of factors.

71
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,040
Then you could tell us the truth.

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,760
We just made the best one together

You always mention money every day.

78
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,550
In my opinion, you and Zhang Xiaobei...

79

only the computers in this classroom run fast?

171
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
So we decided

172
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,710
to advance secretly by an unknown path,

173
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,590
make an application by ourselves,

174
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,670
and sell it directly to Blue Crown.

175
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,760
Why didn't you guys tell me about this?

176
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,550
Zhang Xiaobei keeps an eye on us in the base every day.

177
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,830
There are many people in the base.

178
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,520
The less people know it, the better.

179
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,040
But why do you tell me now?

180
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,640
Of course

181
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,360
we want to ask you to join us.

182
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,950
How sincere you are.

183
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,400
Invite me?

184
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,590
What if I don't accept it?

185
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,550
Consider it.

186
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Actually you lost nothing.

187
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,160
You just climbed the mountain in vain.

188
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,790
Tell me

189
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,160
what exactly you are doing.

190
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,360
This is just a website, right?

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Strictly speaking,

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,430
it is not even a website.

193
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,830
These are development and extension

194
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,360
of a certain function of the Blue Crown's website

195
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,120
we worked on before.

196
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,160
Some of the functions are quite simple.

197
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,160
Blue Crown doesn't want to use any other platforms

198
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,040
but want to create their own website.

199
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,160
Their consideration is good.

200
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,400
But they don't know the current Internet trends.

201
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,590
What trends?

202
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,950
Shopping websites have just emerged in recent years.

203
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,910
Although they seem to be in full bloom.

204
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,360
There are many sites

205
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,880
but they didn't actually last long.

206
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,310
Most of the resources

207
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,480
would get together on several large platforms.

208
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,790
It's pretty hard to build

209
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
this kind of platforms.

210
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,120
Can't we do it by ourselves?

211
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,590
Yes, we can.

212
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,310
But it'll take you ten years to make it.

213
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Your Royal Highness.

214
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,550
Don't call me like this.

215
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
So how should I call you?

216
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,160
Forget it.

217
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,240
How many products does Blue Crown have?

218
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,040
Do you remember that?

219
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,880
More than 500.

220
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,040
For hundreds of products,

221
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,430
you can complete the search function alone.

222
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,790
But what if they have hundreds of millions of products,

223
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,950
billions of products,

224
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,190
or even tens of billions of products?

225
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,550
Like the Milky Way,

226
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,640
any database can't

227
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,710
store all these by then.

228
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,950
Then you need to start your research

229
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,120
on distributed data storage.

230
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,880
Then

231
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,310
you need to start your research

232
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,550
on how to arrange these data

233
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,120
and recommend these data.

234
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,830
To add and delete

235
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,710
each item,

236
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,790
we need a strong algorithm to support them.

237
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,280
It doesn't cause the system crashing in this way.

238
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,950
If you are given a month,

239
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
do you think you can make it?

240
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,040
It's just a function.

241
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,310
For the website like this,

242
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,360
whether in early or late stages,

243
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,360
it takes a lot of manpower and material resources.

244
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,710
We don't have enough manpower.

245
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,950
Blue Crown does not have much money.

246
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,520
So, if we want to rely on our overall strength

247
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,910
to compete with these large websites,

248
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,160
it's very unrealistic.

249
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,520
The second trend is

250
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,310
smart phone popularization.

251
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,590
So we give up making

252
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,120
all-in-one large website

253
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
but go directly to make an app.

254
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,830
Even if the app is still new stuff,

255
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,590
it's simple enough,

256
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,000
so it's developing and changing rapidly.

257
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,830
To make it stand-out,

258
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,830
we still have to try some other ways.

259
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,830
Large platforms are characterized by a wide range of products.

260
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
The app should be targeted.

261
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,310
So we need to make a function

262
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,120
both deep and targeted.

263
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,120
The advantage of Blue Crown is its nourishment products.

264
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,430
♫I don't know how you've been♫
Its products have health care functions.

265
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,480
♫I don't know how you've been♫
They are the vast majority.

266
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,950
♫You don't know how I've been♫
And they are very special in style

267
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,550
♫You don't know how I've been♫
and unique in the market.

268
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,950
♫Nothing has changed♫
This may be associated with the Blue Crown boss's mother.

269
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,950
She's engaged in traditional Chinese medicine.

270
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,400
♫Have you ever changed?♫
You even know that their boss's mother is engaged in

271
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,160
♫Have you ever changed?♫
traditional Chinese medicine.

272
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,160
♫I don't know how you've been♫
Yes.

273
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,310
♫You don't know how I've been♫
Look here.

274
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,860
♫You don't know how I've been♫
This function is mainly aimed at health care.

275
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,590
♫It's been so long ago♫
Generally people

276
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,670
♫It's been so long ago♫
know little about nourishment and health products.

277
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,520
♫I've been walking so long♫
They are too lazy to read instruction.

278
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,760
♫I've been walking so long♫
They don't read over them one by one.

279
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,430
So it's better to apply medicine according to indications.

280
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,910
Enter the symptoms here,

281
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,430
like dizziness,

282
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,430
nausea.

283
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,310
The system then recommends products directly

284
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,590
and the Blue Crown's products

285
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,790
are arranged by series.

286
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,280
It's very easy to promote them in this way.

287
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,710
Should we add another function to explain the pathology,

288
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,430
simply describe the cause of physical condition,

289
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,190
and then introduce the product formula that can solve the problem.

290
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,710
It'll be more convincing

291
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,760
so that people are more eager to buy, right?

292
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,880
Yes, good idea.

293
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,280
Today, Zhu Yun is joining tour team.

294
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,040
I declare that

295
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,710
our Blue Crown app group

296
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,160
is officially established.

297
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,400
I think we should take a picture

298
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,190
to commemorate this moment.

299
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,120
Good.

300
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
One, two, three.

301
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,040
You are wandering? What are you watching?

302
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,950
You.

303
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,710
Can't I?

304
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,120
You are watching me with your eyes but not your brain.

305
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,840
♫Everything is different when we watch the sky from the sea bottom♫

306
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,760
♫The person I used to be is gone♫

307
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,600
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

308

♫Until when you broke into my world♫

309

♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

310
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,200
♫We would bloom in the darkness♫

311

♫The knight and the king♫

312
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,720
♫Like the white sails in night navigation are protecting the ocean♫

313
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,560
♫I see a clear direction♫

314
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,240
♫In which a touch of golden color flickers at the end of the wheat field♫
On that peaceful afternoon,

315
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,160
♫In which a touch of golden color flickers at the end of the wheat field♫
in the days when 4G was not yet popular,

316
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,680
♫Even if I am the king♫
smart phones were just emerging.

317
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,480
♫With supreme glory everything is meaningless without you♫
The three of us gathered

318
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,400
♫With supreme glory everything is meaningless without you♫
at the top of Lishan Mountain,

319
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,190
♫All what I did is to make you remember♫
and Li Xun shared his thoughts,

320
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,590
♫All what I did is to make you remember♫
his ideas,

321
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,320
♫All what I did is to make you remember♫
and his ambition.

322
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,040
♫The way everything was when it started♫
I didn't know whether this app

323
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,440
♫The way everything was when it started♫
could be sold to Blue Crown successfully.

♫If I am the king♫
The only thing I am sure is

325
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,190
♫If I am the king♫
this memory

326
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,710
♫Who is proud and arrogant like wild and wind weeds♫
will be permanently stored in my brain.

327
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,710
♫Who is proud and arrogant like wild and wind weeds♫
At that moment,

328
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,710
♫I only want you to be at my side whatever it takes♫
I really believe that

329
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,200
♫I only want you to be at my side whatever it takes♫

Boss, I want to print it,

332
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,360
What is it?

333
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,670
A picture. And make it sealed.

334
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,670
Do you bring a USB drive here?

335
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,910
Let me print it by myself.

Remember to eat well when you go back.

358
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,920
You, too.

359
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,830
Dine out if you don't like food in canteens.

360
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,960
Zhu Yun.

361
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,680
What?

362
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,150
Come here.

363
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,200
Let me introduce him to you.

364
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,630
This is my senior Zhang Zhicheng.

365
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,550
Hi!

366
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,150
Hello.

367
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,440
I am leaving.

368
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,720
See you at tomorrow's party class.

369
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,760
Don't be late.

370
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,590
Fang Shumiao.

371
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,350
When did you start to date him secretly and hide it from me?

372
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,870
The day is so clear.

373
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,480
Secretly?

374
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,440
When did you have a boyfriend?

375
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,110
You didn't tell me.

376
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,520
Is he the senior who distributed textbooks before?

377
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Well.

378
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,310
I told me when the school started,

379
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,960
we had to protect ourselves from fire, theft and seniors.

380
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,920
In fact you keep him for yourself.

381
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,150
Don't talk nonsense.

382
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,720
I'm not in love.

383
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,520
No?

384
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,480
What did I see just now?

385
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,070
You behaved like a hoodlum?

386
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,150
I met him in a party class.

387
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,920
He has dated me for about several times.

388
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,720
Generally speaking,

389
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,550
he should be my boyfriend.

390
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,680
But I want to see if

391
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,830
I can try to take to him.

392
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,520
Try to take to him?

393
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:01,920
Zhu Yun.

394
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,240
Have you never been in love before?

395
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,870
What does it really feel if you like a boy?

396
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
If I was absent-minded in a kiss,

397
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,960
I shouldn't be in love.

398
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,480
I think when you like a boy,

399
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,150
you will think that he's very good at everything.

400
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,200
You have no room for anyone else in your heart.

401
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,830
You just want to protect him.

402
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,550
She is so rude.

403
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,000
That's Zhang Xiaobei's car.

404
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,960
Why is she coming here?

405
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,480
You gave these papers to Blue Crown.

406
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
What is wrong with the app?

407
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,790
The app,

408
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
generally speaking,

409
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
is just the mobile terminal applet.

410
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,630
The main role

411
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,630
is to improve the function of the original system

412
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,790
and personalized.

413
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,200
You.

414
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,720
Li Xun.

415
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,390
And for this,

416
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
are you playing a trick?

417
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,790
You seem to work on the website

418
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,590
but actually on the app secretly and sell it to Party A.

419
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,520
You have a lot of nerves.

420
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,630
I am flattered.

421
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Blue Crown has just informed me

422
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,760
to terminate the website project.

423
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,240
Do you know what it means?

424
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,000
I have invested one year's budget

425
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,520
in this project this year.

426
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,440
Once the project is terminated,

427
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,720
it means that students of the entire graduate college

428
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
like Han Jiakang

429
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,790
have to lose their jobs.

430
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,550
What do you want to do?

431
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,200
It's not true, Miss Zhang.

432
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,110
For your company,

433
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,070
The profit from this project

434
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,000
is just your peanut at best.

435
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,830
But for seniors like Han Jiakang

436
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,480
he has been working for you for free for almost a year.

437
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,150
Zhang Xiaobei.

438
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,440
I want to do nothing.

439
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,000
If you can give me a little value

440
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
now

441
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,550
I don't bother to talk with you.

442
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,390
Give you a chance to make up for it.

443
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,310
Sell this app to me.

444
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,310
How to sell?

445
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,110
It is negotiable.

446
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,760
This is easy to say

447
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,720
Give all the project fees you deduct

448
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
back to us.

449
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,960
Close the graduate school-enterprise cooperation center

450
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,590
and merge it to my base.

451
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,150
It will not be at your disposal.

452
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,870
That's all the conditions.

453
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,280
I ask you to offer just for saving your face.

454
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,550
Don't be arrogant.

455
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,280
Li Xun.

456
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,960
You're a smart man.

457
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,870
You know it's bad to do anything against me.

458
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,590
Conduct oneself well.

459
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,630
Miss Zhang.

460
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,150
If you have nothing else to say,

461
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,480
I'm leaving.

462
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,680
Is your family difficult?

463
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,000
I checked it

464
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,040
and found that your information was changed,

465
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,870
including your family's phone and address.

466
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,830
All of them were changed.

467
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,480
The school cannot even contact

468
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,550
any of your relatives.

469
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,110
But luckily

470
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,630
I found your original archives from your high school days.

471
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,240
Li Xun.

472
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,920
You were expelled from Linyang No.8 Middle School.

473
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,350
There is a punishment record in your archives.

474
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,110
You even attended the school for a more year.

475
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,590
Is that right?

476
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,310
The school is proud of you right now

477
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,440
for your best performance as the top scorer.

478
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,760
It's why they approved the base for you.

479
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,040
Archives fraud is a big deal.

480
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,790
The top scorer once cheated in exams.

481
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,920
This is a good feed for news.

482
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,790
You should know what happens if it is released.

483
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,920
I did not cheat.

484
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,960
If you could check it,

485
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,280
the school can check it, too.

486
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,630
That's right.

487
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,390
Don't have to explain that to me.

488
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,350
I don't care.

489
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,200
I say these just for telling you

490
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,200
I understand your difficulties.

491
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,000
So I don't blame you for the matter of Blue Crown.

492
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,440
But you always have to learn from it

493
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,070
and be responsible for the mistakes you have made

494
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,280
For whatever you owes me,

495
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,630
you have to give it back to me, too.

496
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,830
If you apologize to me now,

497
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,720
it's not late.

498
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,310
There is no point in fighting against me.

499
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,760
Which choice is better?

500
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,870
Consider it yourself.

501
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,040
See it?

502
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,480
How is it? You can see it.

503
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,200
Good. Good.

504
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,760
And here.

505
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:16,920
They are the same.

506
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,070
Move again. Move again.

507
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,350
How is it?

508
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,480
Is it good?

509
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,350
Fantastic.

510
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,480
After all, it is new.

511
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,790
We don't have any in our school.

512
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,550
Of course.

513
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,760
This thing is not only expensive,

514
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,040
but also should be updated often.

515
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,830
Not to mention your art school,

516
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,240
among colleges and universities across the country,

517
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,520
there are very few schools owning

518
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,270
this set of equipment.

519
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,590
Gao is so great.

520
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,590
Did you spend all the money here as you keep money?

521
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,440
Come on, guy.

522
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,920
I also spent a lot of my own money.

523
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,830
But with this set of equipment,

524
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,680
we can achieve a lot of new functions

525
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,350
Right.

526
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,550
Awesome.

527
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,040
You have seen the equipment.

528
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,790
Let's talk about the price.

529
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,440
Go.

530
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,680
That's awesome.

531
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,550
This is the head of our project.

532
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,720
Hello.

533
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,350
I agree with your offer.

534
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,150
No need, no need.

535
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,100
This is equivalent to

536
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,550
giving us a free training.

537
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,070
After we learn this system,

538
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,440
it will be very helpful for us

539
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,760
to look for jobs later on.

540
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,310
Right.

541
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,200
That's good.

542
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,310
The base is available for 24 hours a day.

543
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,200
You can use it anytime.

544
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,070
Perfect.

545
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,960
Thank you. Thank you.

546
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,350
Then you can debug it again.

547
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,760
Zhu Yun.

548
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,720
Take a look at our motion capture system.

549
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,480
Make way for us.

550
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,200
You see,

551
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,240
all the functions we said before can be realized.

552
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,110
This can capture

553
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,070
the ankle and knee joints.

554
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:38,720
See?

555
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,310
Move the head.

556
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,440
Fine.

557
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,630
How is it?

558
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,720
The temples can also be captured

559
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,390
It's so clear with no delay.

560
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,200
Why are you watching me?

561
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Are you sunflower?

562
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,680
Look there.

563
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,790
It's clear.

564
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,520
Good. Go a little further from behind.

565
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,440
Look at it. Can it capture?

566
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes. Yes. Yes.

567
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,760
Move again as you did just now.

568
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,000
More clearly.

569
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,590
Fine.

570
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,960
Why are you coming here?

571
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,630
Just in time. Let me introduce them to you.

572
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,550
These six guys who you have seen before.

573
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,520
This is the keyboardist, Ling.

574
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,110
This is our bassist, Xin.

575
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,630
You're so cute, too.

576
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,280
Take your time. I'm here just for listening to a song.

577
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,920
OK.

578
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,110
Then let's do it once again.

579
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,830
OK?

580
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,480
For this chord just now,

581
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,150
I think it's OK.

582
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,830
That's it.

583
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,480
Practice it again.

584
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,680
What is up? In a bad mood?

585
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,590
Do you have any wine?

586
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,920
You wanted to drink wine.

587
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,590
If you drink too much,

588
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,680
I won't take care of you at all.

589
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,110
Bye. Bye.

590
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,000
Bye.

591
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,720
Be careful on the way.

592
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,480
You have drunk so much

593
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,430
for nothing important.

594
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,310
Your face looks so bad.

595
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,240
Tell me.

596
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,310
Who treats you badly?

597
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,240
Zhang Xiaobei.

598
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,200
Who?

599
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,280
Is she the teacher of our school?

600
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,110
No.

601
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,480
What's it for?

602
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,240
Fight with her.

603
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,070
As long as it doesn't affect your diploma,

604
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,960
run after scolding her.

605
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,040
What can she do with you?

606
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,680
What if she can decide

607
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,280
the fate of our base?

608
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,920
Then tolerate her.

609
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,590
You are so timid.

610
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,830
No, this is called wisdom.

611
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,550
Survival wisdom.

612
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,040
A man is able to bow and rise at will.

613
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,680
It's a long way to go.

614
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,110
It doesn't matter to bow down right now.

615
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
I can bow down but he can't.

616
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,630
Who is he?

617
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,790
I don't allow it.

618
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,590
Why do you come to me?

619
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,110
For the development of the Blue Crown app,

620
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,480
I have been involved the whole way.

621
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,590
Li Jiao has only finished more than half of it until now.

622
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,760
But I know all about the basic architecture.

623
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,680
Then you come to show your sincerity on behalf of the base, right?

624
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,440
No, purely on behalf of myself.

625
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,790
It's also pretty good at the base.

626
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,870
But you know,

627
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,280
Li Xun

628
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,480
is very stubborn.

629
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,760
And no matter whatever we do at the base,

630
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,070
they're all trivial.

631
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,870
But Miss Zhang, you

632
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,390
owns so many platform resources and contacts.

633
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,680
Please help me.

634
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,040
You young people like to

635
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,870
refuse an easy way

636
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,200
but choose a hard way.

637
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,720
I'm an old hand.

638
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,440
About which projects are good

639
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,550
and will be helpful to your future,

640
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,440
I know so well.

641
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,480
Well, Zhu Yun.

642
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,520
Come to work for me.

643
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,870
I give you a month for probation.

644
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,000
Go back and persuade Li Xun

645
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,110
to hand over the app.

646
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,550
OK, I will certainly not let you down.

647
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:55,830
Senior.

648
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,040
Senior.

649
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,200
You all act like this?

650
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,280
What do you mean?

651
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,830
You seldom speak.

652
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,590
There are special circumstances here.

653
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,150
We are required to

654
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,870
stay in machine room all day long

655
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,150
from 8 a.m. to six p.m.

656
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,870
Zhang Xiaobei said

657
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,480
we must try best to work on that app

658
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,630
and make a better one

659
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,760
before Li Xun finishes it.

660
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,280
Give you a week. Enough?

661
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,590
Almost.

662
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,240
Work hard.

663
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,110
She was too mad to accept that the Blue Crown project was terminated.

664
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,280
She just expected to feel avenged with your app.

665
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,000
I have so much pressure.

666
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,280
Li Xun.

667
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,390
Miss Zhang.

668
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,870
What's up?

669
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,870
You didn't come out so late.

670
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,680
It seems that it has been going very well recently.

671
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,920
Thanks for your concern.

672
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,870
I want to ask you again.

673
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,150
Hand the app out.

674
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,040
We can work together.

675
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,310
Would you like to do so?

676
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,960
I'm sorry.

677
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,310
That's all right.

678
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,590
Never mind.

679
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,920
Good-bye.

680
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,000
By the way,

681
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,680
I almost forgot to tell you that

682
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,960
Zhu Yun is working for me right now

683
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,240
on developing an app

684
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:35,960
for Blue Crown.

685
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,760
They should compare it to yours back then.

686
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,150
After all,

687
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,550
it's normal to shop around.

688
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,810
[Li Xun]

689
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,800
Why does Li Xun call me?

690
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,630
Answer him, I'm out.

691
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,670
Hello.

692
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,670
Ask Zhu Yun to go downstairs.

693
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,070
He asked you to go down right now.

694
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,520
Didn't I ask you to say I'm away?

695
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,520
You even did hear it yourself.

696
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,480
Did he ask me?

697
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,190
Zhu Yun, don't pretend to be dead.

698
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,960
I just didn't hear it.

699
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,520
Come out.

700
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,880
Now it's late, about ten o'clock.

701
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,150
I'm at the door of your dormitory.

702
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,110
Give you one minute.

703
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,800
One minute?

704
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I am wearing pajamas.

705
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,150
I can't jump down.

706
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,180
Change your clothes and jump down.

707
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,920
Hello.

708
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,440
Do you really go down?

709
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,150
I don't even know why he is angry with me.

710
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,710
You just go down in this?

711
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,840
What else?

712
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,320
Do I have to see him in another suit?

713
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,550
Are you out of your head?

714
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,710
Be polite.

715
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,710
Do you think Zhang Xiaobei really believes that you have betrayed us?

716
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,000
Go there and talk.

717
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,150
Tell me what you are thinking.

718
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,840
You dare to laugh?

719
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,480
Refuse her.

720
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,440
I have promised to help Zhang Xiaobei.

721
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,400
I am asking you to refuse her.

722
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,150
Why?

723
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,800
You really want to help Zhang Xiaobei make this app?

724
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,270
Yes.

725
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,750
And you copy the same architecture from me.

726
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,750
Copy?

727
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,710
Have you registered the patent for it

728
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,960
or released it in public?

729
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,360
Why do you say I copy yours?

730
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,670
Do you know what exactly she is going to do?

731
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,040
Your conflict with her is none of my business.

732
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,110
I'll say it again for the last time.

733
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,110
Refuse her.

734
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,190
Li Xun.

735
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,520
I think you misunderstood something.

736
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,840
Get to the point.

737
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,320
What is the relationship between us?

738
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,750
I am not your subordinate

739
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,400
but just ordinary and equal classmate.

740
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,360
Although I respect

741
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,960
your leadership in the base

742
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,040
and quite recognize your leadership skills,

743
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,440
first, we have no verbal agreement;

744
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,920
second, we have no service contract.

745
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,070
I don't think you have any

746
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,750
good reason for me to listen to you.

747
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,360
We are just ordinary and equal classmates.

748
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,630
What else?

749
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,440
Zhu Yun.

750
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,840
We have no equal relationship?

751
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,230
What kind of illusion did I give you

752
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,630
so that you think you can abuse me?

753
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,440
Let's go.

754
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:00,960
Zhu Yun.

755
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,520
Don't go back to the base if you don't refuse her.

756
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,270
I forget to tell you that

757
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,550
I have moved to Han Jiakang's computer room.

758
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,400
Good-bye.

759
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,550
No problem, no problem.

760
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,960
I can definitely finish the progress

761
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,800
as I promised you.

762
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,590
Don't worry.

763
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,710
Good.

764
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,550
Good, goodbye.

765
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,800
What's it going on?

766
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:42,960
I am combing it.

767
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,070
It should be fine tomorrow.

768
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,440
Run it and show me.

769
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,190
I'm still debugging it.

770
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,190
Finish it a little faster.

771
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,630
Repair all the errors and the alarm quickly.

772
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,630
Run the codes first.

773
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,670
Alright.

774
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,360
I got it.

775
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,110
I can't wait for it tomorrow.

776
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,550
Work overtime and finish it tonight.

777
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,000
I have replaced the bucket of water fountain.

778
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,480
Leave it to me later on.

779
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,440
I just lift a finger.

780
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,400
I am leaving.

781
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,400
Bye-bye.

782
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,110
Bye-bye.

783
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,520
What do you mean?

784
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,150
I don't like him.

785
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,590
Really?

786
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,000
I like a boy that I can look up to

787
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,150
and follow after,

788
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,710
rather than this one,

789
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,400
cleaning and cooking.

790
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,520
You two complement each other.

791
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,320
He can take care of you.

792
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,710
How good it is!

793
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,270
No.

794
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,270
He treats me so well

795
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,750
that I feel sick actually.

796
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,590
I am not touched at all.

797
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,440
I will not fall in love with him.

798
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,190
If you like a boy,

799
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,590
it should feel very passionate

800
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,800
and romantic.

801
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,550
It comes at the right time, no earlier,

802
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,840
nor late.

803
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,840
What do you laugh at?

804
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,920
It's so awkward to hear these words from you.

805
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,480
This is my creation.

806
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,550
You came here for an hour today.

807
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,360
But you did not open the computer to write the code.

808
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,270
What is wrong?

809
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,270
Has Zhu Yun been here these two days?

810
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,840
She's hiding from you?

811
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,630
She?

812
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,960
The night before yesterday,

813
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,070
she wrote the code all night here.

814
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,190
Did you bully her?

815
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,270
No, I didn't.

816
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,520
Who bullied her?

817
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,630
Did someone bully you?

818
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,960
Zhu Yun came here last Friday night.

819
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,840
She drank too much and shouted something.

820
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,400
I can bow down

821
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,520
but he can't.

822
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,840
I definitely don't allow it.

823
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,630
I didn't understand her anyway.

824
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,320
Did she mention you?

825
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,880
Why are you here?

826
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,360
How are you doing?

827
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,360
What do you mean?

828
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,840
Are you abused by Zhang Xiaobei?

829
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,750
Well.

830
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,190
Compared to Boss Li,

831
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,590
she appears insignificant.

832
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,440
We who can survive at the base

833
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,070
have top match of immune system.

834
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,230
What the hell do you think?

835
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,960
What if it is found by Zhang Xiaobei?

836
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,590
What does she find?

837
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,360
You really think you can fool her over it?

838
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,400
I don't intend to fool her.

839
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,070
Did you hear what she said to me?

840
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,320
Do you think I work for Zhang Xiaobei

841
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,800
for your sake?

842
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,800
Don't overestimate yourself.

843
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,800
This guy is out of control, too.

844
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,400
Senior.

845
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,550
What's wrong with you?

846
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,110
You're finished.

847
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,670
Zhang Xiaobei was scolded by Blue Crown.

848
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:37,920
She came over early in the morning and got angry.

849
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,750
She is looking for you.

850
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:39,920
Me?

851
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:42,960
Zhu Yun.

852
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,480
She asked me

853
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,150
about your app.

854
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,320
I...

855
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,400
It doesn't matter.

856
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,920
I can't hide it.

857
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,360
Students now are quite arrogant.

858
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,070
You made trouble at such a young age!

859
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,550
Zhu Yun,

860
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,270
you think you are quite great?

861
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,440
I'm asking you.

862
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,670
I don't understand what you mean.

863
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,750
♫I pass by the world♫
Apologize to Zhu Yun.

864
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,360
♫And pass through the night♫
I would save much effort if I knew

865
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,820
♫And pass through the night♫
I could control you through her.

866
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,110
But you may not

867
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,380
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
know him very well.

868
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,270
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
Zhu Yun.

869
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,380
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
Mom.

870
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,260
♫It's the intuition of the dream♫

871
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,980
♫That breaks through the boundary♫

872
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,340
♫The first sight♫

873
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:59,940
♫Spreads and later it wins the world for me♫

874
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,860
♫The clock keeps ticking♫

875
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,540
♫I am leaning on your shoulder♫

876
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:17,580
♫We won't break up♫

877
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,700
♫Stay with me from the hustle and bustle♫

878
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,140
♫It's the fulcrum of your palm♫

879
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,180
♫That gives me the courage to move forward♫

880
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:37,140
♫Just like the flame in the night♫

881
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,820
♫Cause I believe I love you♫

882
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,380
♫True love will take it's course♫

883
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,380
♫I am at your side♫

884
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,260
♫Spending such a long time with you♫

885
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,620

894

♫As long as I am brave enough♫

896
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,060
♫Every dream I have♫

897
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:13,620
