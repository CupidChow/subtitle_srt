♫The person I used to be is gone♫

[Episode 32]

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
I can understand your fear.

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,750
I was watching

23
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,750
and my legs were shaking that day.

24
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,120
But you were really pushed down.

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,430
They've gone too far.

26
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,800
Even if you really ruin our game,

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,150
it's just a game.

28
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,840
But that's a game developed you.

29
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,680
Not only me.

30
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,960
It's a result of everyone's work in this company.

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,870
You didn't expect

32
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,150
it would cause such a serious consequence, right?

33
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,150
You thought

34
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,030
it would not be a big deal even if you were caught

35
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,030
hacking such a small company.

36
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,710
But even a small company

37
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,680
contains efforts of others.

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
Don't underestimate others.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,590
Li Xun told me about you.

40
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,310
Would you like to go somewhere with me?

41
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,030
Where is this place?

42
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,400
Go in and have a look.

43
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,800
Have a look.

44
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
This room,

45
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,800
and all your stuff

46
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,750
are kept for you.

47
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,830
You've been dawdling for so long.

48
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,920
You don't even leave the downtown,

let along going abroad.

50
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,190
You're just waiting for him to come back to you.

51
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,430
Only he thinks of me as a person.

52
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,800
Li Xun won't leave.

53
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,920
You know him.

54
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,190
We still have something to do.

55
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,510
If you really care about him,

56
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,310
just come to live here by yourself.

58
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,430
How is it?

59
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,120
Done.

60
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,000
You're a great political commissar.

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,120
You did a good job in persuading people.

62
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,920
What should we do next?

63
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,510
What should we do?

64
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,190
What should we do?

65
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
You two always have many ideals.

66
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Don't ask me.

67
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,360
Well, we want to

68
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,270
bind him with a stone to sink him into the sea.

69
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

70
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,800
So I asked you what to do.

71
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,600
Let him stay in the company.

72
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,000
Do you accept it?

73
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,720
Well, if you don't keep him by your side,

74
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,240
what if he does something bad again?

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,870
And if he escapes from the city,

76
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,000
can you catch him?

77
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,920
It's better to keep him aside.

78
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,830
Didn't you also say that he is strong?

79
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,920
Our company is short of labor.

80
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,390
It's the best if he can help us.

81
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,750
I love that.

82
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,270
You give priority to the company's interests.

83
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,600
But he is a little ugly

84
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,830
and will lower the overall look of our company.

85
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,120
I'm leaving. I'm on vacation.

86
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,950
I'm the boss. Did she ask for leave?

87
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,360
She's always like this?

88
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,480
She is much lovelier when being a little more timid.

89
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,000
She is lovely whatever she does

90
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,120
because she is good looking.

91
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,270
Hou Ning.

92
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,510
The same words.

93
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,000
If you are to leave,

94
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,800
I won't keep you.

95
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,000
But as long as you follow me,

96
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,160
I will let you be an upright person.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,720
I know.

98
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,070
How is Zhu Yun's cooking?

99
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,830
Horrible.

100
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,240
She finally has a disadvantage.

101
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,840
Political Commissar Zhu,

102
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,750
why didn't you get a red background?

103
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,670
This one doesn't look good.

104
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,790
Get down. Be careful.

105
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,510
What are you doing?

106
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,630
You even climb up with an adder.

[You can make money without doing evil]
Look over here.

111
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
I can't understand wherever I look at it.

112
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Let me explain.

113
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
New slogan.

114
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,390
Look.

115
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,320
This is written by our Political Commissar Zhu

116
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,270
YOU means you.

117
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,510
MONEY is money.

118
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,030
You know this as you play games.

119
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,670
Devil.

120
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,670
If you have money, you can be a devil.

Illiteracy.

122

You can make money without doing evil.

123
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,360
Well said.

124

You can make money without doing evil.

125
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,790
Why do you point at me?

126
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,670
Hi.

127
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,150
Hi. Morning.

128
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,390
All is here.

129
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,030
Let me introduce.

130
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,390
This is my friend Hou Ning.

131
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,270
Zhang Fang, Zhao Teng, Guo Shijie.

132
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:37,720
Welcome.

133
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,360
Hou Ning.

134
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,790
I'll clear up a place for you later.

135
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,270
Zhao Teng, help him install the computer.

136
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,670
I have all the materials ready.

137
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,550
Take a look first.

138
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,960
You can ask

139
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,750
Li Xun if you have any question in work.

140
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,670
I'll get a host for you.

141
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,360
No need.

142
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,270
I've ordered one online.

143
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,120
It will be delivered here in the afternoon.

144
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,440
All right.

145
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,120
Our company's junk

146
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,240
should have been eliminated.

147
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,360
I have a question.

148
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,910
If he gets a good computer,

149
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,200
will he hack into others' computers faster?

150
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,670
Talkative.

151
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,910
You hang it up for me?

152
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,200
You're quite self-aware.

153
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,870
Half the people in our company were once in prison.

154
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
And considering Hou Ning's conducting behaviors

155
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,720
and Mr. Dong's amazing way

156
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,790
of solving problems,

157
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,750
I have to remind you guys at any time.

158
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,550
From this day onwards,

159
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,440
I am the president

160
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
of the Supervisory Committee of Flying.

161
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,510
I will keep an eye on you for Mr. Lin.

162
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,360
Think twice before you act.

163
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,150
Political Commissar Zhu,

164
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,720
you love being an official.

165
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,600
Not convinced?

166
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,600
Zhang Fang dislikes Hou Ning.

167
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,000
But it may be a good thing for Hou Ning.

168
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
If he wants to live

169
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,870
in this society honestly,

170
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,320
he must try to change people's views on him.

171
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,320
He can't escape like before.

172
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,270
But don't worry,

173
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,120
Zhang Fang is warm-hearted albeit his sharp tongue.

174
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,910
He won't really bully Hou Ning.

175
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,670
You'd better worry about Zhang Fang.

176
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,150
What you're looking at?

177
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,270
By rights,

178
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,670
I should stare at you in the company.

179
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,910
I warn you.

180
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,200
If you're not serious

181
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,270
and become a drag on the company.

182
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,000
Besides Mr. Dong

183
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,670
and Li Xun,

184
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,550
I can also teach you a lesson.

185
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,390
Zhang Fang.

186
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,600
The top casino is online.

187
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,910
I, I didn't touch anything.

188
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,550
What's that?

189
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,270
It's not mine.

190
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:11,720
Fang.

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,120
I stored them in the online disk.

192
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,670
I haven't watched it in the company.

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,150
Bullshit.

194
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,480
What are you watching?

195
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,440
Take a look. Take a look.

196
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,270
What a shame.

197
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,870
Take a look.

198
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,960
What?

199
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,910
Why are you so mean?

200
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,550
Get to work.

201
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,320
New comer.

202
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,720
You did it?

203
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,870
What do you mean?

204
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,840
Show off your skills here?

205
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,240
I confess

206
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,960
I've watched it.

207
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,790
But I paid for it myself.

208
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,270
I didn't hurt anyone.

209
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,910
How do you explain it?

210
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,360
Zhang Fang. Zhang Fang.

211
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,360
I asked him to do this.

212
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,240
We won't make such a joke any more.

213
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,080
He is a new comer.

214
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,150
Please take care of him.

215
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,630
For your sake.

216
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,960
You know what?

217
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,120
He is just like when you first came here.

218
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,030
What are you doing here?

219
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,150
It's quite noisy.

220
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,910
Are you fighting?

221
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,120
Come here after cleaning up.

222
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,390
I was thinking

223
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,870
our Flying Shelter

224
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,750
has more and more complete staff.

225
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,240
What do you mean?

226
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,000
Are you satirizing me?

227
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,670
No. No.

228
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,840
I dare not.

229
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,910
I dare not. I dare not.

230
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,480
Next week,

231
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,600
the Blind Box of Love, right?

232
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,510
It will have an internal test, right?

233
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,200
If it's delayed by you,

234
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,440
I won't spare you, you know?

235
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,790
Hello.

236
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,870
Dong's Delivery will serve you.

237
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
What's your good?

238
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,440
Okay, okay.

239
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,510
I can't take three people.

240
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,240
Wait for me.

241
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,320
-Wait for me! -Go! Go.

242
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,720
Don't delay your business.

243
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,360
How come the number of users has not increased these days?

244
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,750
You know it?

245
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,240
Zhang Fang, let me ask you.

246
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,390
Did you promote it?

247
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,630
Where did the money go?

248
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,120
I say in all honesty.

249
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,510
I typed every promotion articles

250
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,030
word by word.

251
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,440
So you spent no money.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Well, do you know

253
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,390
even good wine is afraid of being sold deep in the alley?

254
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,030
Others invest in promotion

255
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,790
as much as

256
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,270
their development cost.

257
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,080
Ren Di, do me a favor.

258
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,510
The Blind Box of Box has been internally tested for three days.

259
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,200
But the data is not optimistic.

260
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,480
What a shame.

261
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,550
Isn't this project mainly undertaken by Li Xun?

262
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,240
It is said that

263
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,550
he paid for it himself.

264
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,270
This time,

265
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,630
he bets all he has on it.

266
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,870
You can arrange people

267
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,120
to copy this game.

268
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,870
Let's make one by ourselves.

269
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,320
It's worthwhile?

270
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,960
How much will it cost us to make one ourselves?

271
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,670
Don't be too short-sighted.

272
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,600
You just want to leave after earning by making our company listed?

273
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,750
Although L&P has abundant funds,

274
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,320
we don't have enough backbone projects.

275
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,550
The data of many games will decline significantly

276
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,150
three to six months after they are online.

277
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,080
It is not easy to pass the examination and approval of the CSRC.

278
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,840
We also need a masterpiece.

279
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,440
Masterpiece?

280
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,510
You call this a masterpiece?

281
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,150
This game looks simple and straightforward.

282
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,960
But it is easier to be accepted by the market.

283
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,270
It has a large potential user base.

284
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,360
Once it's played,

285
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
it will be quite hot.

286
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,360
The disadvantage of Flying is publicity and promotion.

287
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,150
But this is our strong point.

288
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,550
Are we fool if we don't

289
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,510
launch it earlier and squeeze Flying out?

290
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,720
So sure?

291
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,320
Yeah.

292
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,910
I want to ask a question I shouldn't ask.

293
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,550
Is it out of your professional judgment

294
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,440
or personal reason?

295
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,270
Intuition.

296
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,750
This game will be hot.

297
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,510
This market is too big.

298
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,030
There are too many games that will be hot.

299
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,600
Leave it alone.

300
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,750
We make our money.

301
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,790
Why are you staring at this?

302
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,550
You don't want to see Li Xun stand up,

303
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,200
right?

304
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,320
I knew

305
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,510
as long as Li Xun farts,

306
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,150
you would come up and smell it.

307
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,390
I disagree.

308
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,720
L&P can't be led by

309
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,120
your personal gratitude and resentment.

310
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,120
Fang Zhijing.

311
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,720
Did I blind your eye?

312
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,270
Have you forgotten that pain?

313
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Anyway, here is my tip.

314
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,510
Even if we develop one now, it's too late.

315
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,440
And even if you make it now,

316
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,790
we'll be more passive

317
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,000
if Li Xun aims at us.

318
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,550
Leave this alone.

319
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,880
I have my own arrangements.

320
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,680
Gather people first.

321
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,510
Ask Dongliang to gather the backbone of the Development Department.

322
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,440
The Blind Box of Love will go online soon.

323
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,880
There's no time.

324
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,070
Hurry up.

325
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,280
[Harmonic Studio]

326
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,720
Sorry for having kept you waiting so long.

327
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,920
It's okay.

328
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,920
Here you are.

329
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,550
How long has it been since he came to record?

330
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,240
He will come to record today.

331
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,750
He is delayed by a business dinner.

332
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,240
I think he can leave the band

333
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,680
to specialize in having business dinners with others.

334
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,920
Wait a moment.

335
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,830
Liu will be back soon.

336
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,350
Don't tell him I once came.

337
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,000
You can't wait for a while?

338
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,480
Zhu Yun and Li Xun have a project to ask you for help.

339
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,830
You can contact them

340
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,310
for specific content.

341
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,070
I have no friendship with them.

342
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,400
If you want me to help,

343
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,920
sit down and talk.

344
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,550
Their company has launched a new game.

345
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,310
Go on.

346
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,680
Here is the thing.

347
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,240
They want...

348
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,350
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

349
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,640
I must have a taste of your good wine.

350
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,030
OK, OK, OK.

351
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,400
Okay, I'll be there right away.

352
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,160
Are you not recording songs today?

353
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,510
Are you kidding? Mr. Zhao is waiting.

354
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,720
Ren Di.

355
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,640
Don't you want to know who Mr. Zhao is?

356
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,240
Fill up. Fill up.

357
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,640
Mr. Zhao.

358
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,160
Last time we were wrong.

359
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,920
I hope that you will let go of us such nobodies.

360
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,310
Come on. Cheers.

361
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,350
Mr. Zhao is the actual controller of Dongting International.

362
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,350
He strongly advocated signing five albums.

363
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,790
Then you quit Light Red.

364
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,750
He was angry.

365
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,720
How much to compensate?

366
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,310
I'll pay.

367
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,920
Mr. Zhao is not short of money.

368
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,880
He joined up with many record companies,

369
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
intending to block you.

370
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,550
Whatever.

371
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,160
After leaving Light Red,

372
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,750
I won't play music anymore.

373
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,440
I know you don't care.

374
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,000
But Liu does.

375
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,720
He always thought you are the soul of Light Red.

376
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,000
Light Red can't develop without you.

377
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,480
Come on. Come on.

378
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,790
Let's drink to our hearts' content.

379
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,350
One more. One more.

380
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,160
-Cheers. -Drink to our hearts' content...

381
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,550
He's been drinking with and socializing

382
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,640
people from record companies these days,

383
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,350
begging them not to block you.

384
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,940
♫You dominate our relationship♫

385
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,080
♫You said it's good to be alone♫

386
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,500
♫With no burden or worry♫

387
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,020
♫You rely on me as if I were your family♫

388
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,550
♫You want me to do this♫

389
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,030
You.

390
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,200
♫You always talk to me after drinking♫
Ren Di.

391
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,000
♫Saying that I'm very important  to you♫
Come back.

392
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,270
♫Saying that I'm very important  to you♫
Let go.

393
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,000
Come back.

394
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,800
♫And you laugh while talking♫
Ren Di, don't leave me, okay?

395
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:06,100
♫You said you can't pay back my kindness♫

396
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:12,700
♫In fact, I don't ask you to pay back♫

397
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,100
♫As long as I can stay with you♫

398
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,460
♫Nothing else matters♫

399
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:25,180
♫But tears of sadness♫

400
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,300
♫Are still falling down♫

401
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,680
Just take a picture that doesn't show his face.

402
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,030
Is it necessary to be so grand?

403
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,550
Now you know

404
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,030
how those so-called life photos

405
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,270
were taken.

406
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,160
Every angle is carefully designed.

407
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,790
Every exposed thing

408
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,030
has its intention.

409
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,480
But the band needs exposure.

410
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,440
You don't want to show up.

411
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,400
So he helps.

412
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,480
You do your duties and cooperate tacitly.

413
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
It's good.

414
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
When it comes to this, I feel angry.

415
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,720
We have to live like a dummy.

416
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,310
But Li Xun reminds that

417
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,920
you needn't mention this game when you pose

418
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,000
microblog with text.

419
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,200
Don't act like advertising.

420
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,720
It's natural for someone to dig for details.

421
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,960
You couple really amaze me.

422
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,680
That's his idea.

423
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,750
It has nothing to do with me.

424
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,160
You both

425
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,880
aim at me.

426
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,350
But think carefully.

427
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,400
When did you leave me alone?

428
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,680
Last time, you came to ask for money.

429
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,350
And this time, he called me

430
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,590
and told me to meet him.

431
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,720
Aren't you busy with activities every day?

432
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,790
He doesn't care about this.

433
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,000
I just left my work and went to meet him.

434
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,350
I don't think he's changed at all.

435
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,960
He is just like when he was a freshman.

436
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,350
We despised each other,

437
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,790
but somewhat,

438
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,920
what's that phrase?

439
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,790
Like knows like.

440
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,590
Yes, exactly.

441
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,110
You know what?

442
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,070
I remember a sentence he said to me before.

443
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,400
He said that affection is diamond cutting diamond

444
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,480
but love is letting go of ourselves.

445
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,070
He said that?

446
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,310
Actually, I really envy you.

447
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,640
You haven't changed for so many years,

448
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,790
Both of you have clear goals

449
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,400
and can let go of yourselves for each other.

450
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,030
When he was just released from the jail,

451
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,270
seeing him looking like a jerk,

452
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,790
I really thought he deserved it.

453
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,400
I hope he would live a miserable life.

454
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,960
But now

455
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,640
I still hope he can succeed.

456
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,790
L&P will be listed soon.

457
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,400
This is the last chance.

458
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,240
Are you still short of money?

459
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,920
Li Xun didn't go out to get investment,

460
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,960
which means he thinks we can survive.

461
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,920
If you earn money easily, you will feel it's boring.

462
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,510
I'm an example.

463
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,880
In the past, when I was poor,

464
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,750
I strived for every opportunity to perform.

465
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,510
But now...

466
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,720
Okay.

467
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
The next group will be here soon.

468
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,440
Get ready.

469
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,830
This way, everyone.

470
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,960
Hello, sir I need to make up for you.

471
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,830
I'll finish soon.

472
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,750
Where do I stand?

473
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,830
Pick a place yourself.

474
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,200
I'm standing here.

475
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,550
Pick a place ourselves, and I'm sitting here?

476
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,440
You two stand here.

477
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:44,960
Come on.

478
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,310
Let's change the position.

479
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,240
He is short.

480
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,350
Wait.

481
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,960
What's wrong, Mr. Dong?

482
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,400
What's wrong?

483
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,310
-I thought you would dole out money. -Stylish.

484
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,200
Let's take a serious picture first.

485
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,920
-Cool picture. -Okay.

486
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,550
I haven't taken pictures for several years.

487
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,750
I think

488
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,030
the two group leaders should take a group picture alone.

489
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,510
One, two, three.

490
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,640
Come on.

491
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,160
One, two, three.

492
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,400
It's not natural to wear it.

493
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,350
This one is good for everyone.

494
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,510
What's good? I show half a face.

495
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just this one.

496
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,240
Why? I show half a face only.

497
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,270
Just take this one.

498
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,160
Just this one.

499
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,000
When you wear this suit,

500
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,550
you look like one of the top 50

501
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,960
on the Forbes list.

502
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,200
Enough. Enough.

503
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,920
This, this, this.

504
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,680
It's like a fool.

505
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,020
It's really good. Why do you belittle yourself?

506
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,790
Yeah. You are not like Guo Xiaojian.

507
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,070
That dress belongs to your father, right?

508
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,240
Why do you dress like a manager in the lobby?

509
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,030
Stop it.

510
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,030
I dress like a private car driver.

511
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,200
Who are you satirizing?

512
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,070
Don't insult the private car driver

513
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,400
What's wrong? I've improved their level...

514
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,720
That's it. That's it.

515
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,880
Look.

516
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,480
Why is this so like that...

517
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,480
Let's just say the wedding photo.

518
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,880
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

519
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,880
A good match.

520
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,590
Change the background color to red later.

521
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,830
One, ten, hundred, comma, thousand, ten thousand...

522
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,030
Ten thousand

523
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,070
Three million. I counted correctly?

524
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,000
Is it real?

525
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,070
Our Blind Box of Love has been on line for less than half a month,

526
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,510
and the current income is three million yuan.

527
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,590
[Cumulative Gain 3,000,000]
What does this mean?

528
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,000
It means that in one year and five months, it will be over 100 million yuan.

529
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,960
Yes!

530
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,640
Why are you so vulgar?

531
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,750
You just focus on money.

532
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,680
You know what?

533
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
This means,

534
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,720
our business has been successful.

535
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,830
We succeed.

536
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,720
You know what?

537
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,440
Our marketing is well done.

538
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,790
Once it became a keyword,

539
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,070
its search number increased quickly.

540
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,030
But at this moment,

541
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,830
I shrunk its registration number

542
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,480
and released four thousand accounts a day.

543
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,480
I don't care who would play it.

544
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,030
This is called hunger marketing.

545
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,790
I must let them know, being able to play this game

546
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,880
is a special thing to show off.

547
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,000
That's it.

548
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,240
Of course it is

549
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,720
mainly because of Mr. Dong's great leadership

550
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,550
and Li Xun's good plan.

551
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,070
So you have to keep up with the later publicity.

552
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,480
Rest assured.

553
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,790
I'll listen to whatever you say later.

554
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,350
You and Li Xun are the two gods of our company.

555
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,400
Where's Li Xun?

556
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,920
Last night, he updated the patch and stayed up all night.

557
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,550
Now he is sleeping inside.

558
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,310
He works so hard.

559
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,960
If you turn off the light now, he'll wake up.

560
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,400
He doesn't like the dark.

561
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,160
Why?

562
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,750
Because the prison's lights

563
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,030
are on for 24 hours a day.

564
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,880
How is the current income?

565
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,160
You still care about this?

566
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,480
If you keep going like this,

567
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,510
you will collapse.

568
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,350
Hurry home and go to bed.

569
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,660
[Tactical Meeting Room]
Our Development Department has studied the Blind Box of Love.

570
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,270
To make a similar game,

571
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,750
at least half a year is needed.

572
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,400
Does this small game

573
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,030
take so long?

574
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,400
Their game is very strange.

575
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,240
It has many game settings we haven't seen before.

576
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,790
If there is no template,

577
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,480
it's difficult to achieve.

578
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,790
If we make one ourselves,

579
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,480
how long will it take?

580
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,110
At least

581
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,960
four months.

582
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,480
Hou Ning is good at taking care of people.

583
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,680
You can't always stay up.

584
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
The company won't go bankrupt without you.

585
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,720
What are you thinking about?

586
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,200
I was thinking.

587
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,440
If I'm not guessing wrong,

588
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,960
Gao Jianhong is already trying to find a way

589
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,680
to copy the codes of the Blind Box of Love.

590
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,640
I see.

591
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,440
Were it before,

592
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,920
you wouldn't pay much efforts on

593
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,240
such games as Blind Box of Love.

594
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,960
You focus on it

595
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,000
because L&P is going to be listed soon

596
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,400
and you need to hurry up

597
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
and try your best to push it to the top.

598
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,240
You want to attract Gao Jianhong to plagiarize,

599
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,830
and then sue them for infringement.

600
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,200
Are my things so easy to imitate?

601
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,000
If I don't give him the source code,

602
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,830
it will take them at least half a year

603
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,240
to copy a little of this game.

604
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,790
No wonder when I read

605
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,590
the code of the Blind Box of Love,

606
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
I found many strange places.

607
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,830
You used to write code that was very readable.

608
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,160
But this time, you used a lot of complicated structures.

609
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,270
The more unique the code,

610
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,440
the more traps there would be.

611
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,200
But even if they fall into a trap,

612
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,310
are we really going to give them half a year

613
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,400
to make counterfeit goods?

614
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,350
So,

615
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,920
I will give them the source code directly.

616
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,640
I've checked

617
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,200
cases of game infringement in China.

618
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,680
If it's just a simple imitation,

619
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,920
it's hard to win.

620
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,000
Not to mention whether we can afford the lawyer's fees,

621
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,920
the backlog of game copyright lawsuits in China

622
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,440
wouldn't be completed in ten years.

623
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
If we really fight a war of attrition with L&P,

624
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,350
we'll go bankrupt first.

625
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,000
Don't worry.

626
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,110
Gao Jianhong is more worried than us.

627
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,590
Who else knows about this plan?

628
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,160
Hou Ning and Dong Siyang.

629
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,680
And you.

630
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
How about Zhao Teng and others?

631
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,200
They don't know it.

632
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,310
Remember.

633
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,480
The fewer people know it, the better.

634
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,110
How do you let them get the source code?

635
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,440
Will Gao Jianhong copy it directly?

636
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,590
Don't worry about that.

637
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,790
They are used to taking evil ways.

638
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,350
They wouldn't take what I give them directly.

639
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,590
Gao Jianhong has been copying successful projects.

640
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,550
The reason why they can grow up

641
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,510
is because the game market is too chaotic.

642
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,400
China has a large number of users.

643
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,310
They are highly tolerant

644
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,920
of those fresh games.

645
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,720
But what is empty is empty after all.

646
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,400
People can't be stupid forever.

647
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,110
When users grow up,

648
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,590
these companies without independent R&D capability

649
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
will go bankrupt.

650
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,310
But how can users grow up

651
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,790
within just a few months?

652
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,240
L&P will be listed soon.

653
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,920
Will they take this risk?

654
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,640
I'll force him to copy.

655
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,510
Such a small company

656
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,920
is like a clown for us.

657
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,590
Remarketing won't help them.

658
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,110
Its annual income must be less than

659
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,030
our company's monthly income.

660
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,400
Gao.

661
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,960
You must not be led by Li Xun.

662
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,550
My review materials will be submitted soon.

663
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,480
Now is the most critical time.

664
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,790
For the company,

665
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,830
you must bear it.

666
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,750
Mr. Gao.

667
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,070
Mr. Gao.

668
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,830
What's your next goal?

669
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,960
To be No. 1 in the industry.

670
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,110
It's really ambitious.

671
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,030
But considering the industrial giants, like

672
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,030
L&P as your competitors,

673
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,790
their strength...

674
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,920
Strength?

675
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,000
What kind of strength do you think L&P has?

676
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,550
Copy and paste?

677
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,310
Companies like that

678
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,830
are not worthy to be our competitor.

679
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,560
[Exclusive Interview with Li Xun
My Heart Flying Network Company]

680
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,510
Gao.

681
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,640
Even if Li Xun develops eight games like the Blind Box of Love,

682
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,400
he won't be a threat to us.

683
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,550
He's intending to irritate you.

684
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,360
I'll tell you one last time.

685
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,190
Take care of what you should take care of.

686
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,070
Don't tell me what to do.

687
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,070
If you don't want to work,

688
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,190
you can leave.

689
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,400
But I must do this.

690
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,150
Got it.

691
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
These people are stubborn.

692
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,670
At first glance, it's from Southeast Asia.

693
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,110
Ancestral.

694
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,110
Implantation of RDBMS,

695
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,320
nothing new.

696
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,230
How about we show weakness

697
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,510
and let Gao Jianhong take the source code away?

698
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,320
We've fought with them once.

699
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
With our strength,

700
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,070
if we allow him to take the code away,

701
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,880
would they dare to copy it directly?

702
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,400
Then I'll do my best.

703
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,880
You are not allowed to enter here casually.

704
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,670
What are you doing?

705
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,880
I almost forgot

706
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,840
you can understand it.

707
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,360
What do you think?

708
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,960
What's the hottest thing recently?

709
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,550
This is the background data of the Blind Box of Love?

710
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
What are you up to?

711
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,920
If there is anything to learn from?

712
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,230
You want to steal the source code?

713
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,150
In the past, you copy others.

714
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,760
Now you dare to steal the source code?

715
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,630
You're breaking the law, you know?

716
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,320
These hackers are in Malaysia.

717
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,000
They can't find us.

718
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,670
Isn't the company going public?

719
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,000
You really pick the right time.

720
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,710
It's none of my business.

721
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,070
I've said all that I should say and persuade.

722
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,360
You can have a talk.

723
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,630
Why are you like Fang Zhijing?

724
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,550
Do you care about money only?

725
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,480
You deal with Li Xun

726
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,070
in such a dirty way.

727
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,270
That's what you want?

728
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,150
If you want to go to jail, leave me alone.

729
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,360
Let's get divorced.

730
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,960
You want to say

731
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,880
this for a long time, right?

732
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,920
That's what you really want to say.

733
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,480
You don't need so much bedding.

734
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,670
If you want a divorce, just tell me.

735
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,710
Count your losses first.

736
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,230
Don't be a loss leader.

737
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,230
Incurable.

738
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:17,760
I'm entering it.

739
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,510
This firewall looks like paper.

740
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,840
Let's draw the snake out of the hole.

741
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,400
Then go straight to the nest.

742
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,560
[Loser]

743
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,880
Okay, that's it.

744
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,070
Luna.

745
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,440
This one is just delivered to our store.

746
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,550
Mr. Gao said you would like it.

747
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,030
It suits you.

748
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,670
This diamond is twelve point thirteen carats.

749
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,800
It's just your birthday's number.

750
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,710
Mr. Gao specially made it for you.

751
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,630
Do you like it?

752
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,360
My birthday hasn't arrived yet.

753
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,760
I just wanted to give you a gift.

754
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,670
It doesn't matter what day it is.

755
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,230
Do you still remember?

756
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
The first time we ate together

757
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,880
in a restaurant like this.

758
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,840
You and me at that time...

759
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,000
Of course I do.

760
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,880
Lina.

761
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,110
I'm sorry.

762
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,320
When I proposed to you,

763
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,110
I promised

764
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,320
I would never be angry with you.

765
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,840
But I failed.

766
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,230
I was also impulsive that day.

767
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,070
But have you considered

768
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,670
what I said?

769
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,230
Divorce.

770
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,710
We won't talk about this today.

771
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,030
Don't you want to stay in Paris for a while?

772
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,800
I'll go with you.

773
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,590
We can buy a house together.

774
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,400
You apply for another school

775
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,590
to get a master's degree.

776
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,100
Gao.

777
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,760
Actually, you don't have to give me anything.

778
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,280
I just think we haven't

779
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,800
had a meal like this

780
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,190
and talked like this for a long time.

781
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,000
I thought

782
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,190
as long as I succeeded in career,

783
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,840
my family would naturally be better.

784
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,710
But I overlooked the most important thing.

785
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,760
Your feelings.

786
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,510
All relationships

787
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,710
need to be cared.

788
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,550
Lina.

789
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,440
I'm sorry

790
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,510
for ignoring your feelings.

791
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,190
Would you like to give me another chance?

792
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,800
I do especially want

793
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,150
to thank someone.

794
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,710
That's Gao Jianhong, the CEO of L&P.

795
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,760
Mr. Gao.

796
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,590
Are you jealous?

797
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,230
Later, more and more women

798
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,550
will show up around Li Xun.

799
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,670
You'll regret it.

800
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,630
Li Xun.

801
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,150
Do you really think no one can defeat you?
