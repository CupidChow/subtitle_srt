[Episode 19]

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,560
Later, he always did my homework for me to earn money.

22
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,350
He seemed to always be

23
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,430
short of money in high school.

24
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,070
Later I learned that

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,560
his mother was terminally ill.

26
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,430
Stop. Stop. Stop.

27
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,150
How did you get hurt?

28
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,080
In PE class,

29
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,120
he hit the basketball stand

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,280
with a nail.

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,190
Doctor,

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,710
will I suffer from tetanus?

33
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,910
Can I still dance?

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
I don't want to amputate it.

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,080
Don't worry.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,910
You just need to get a tetanus shot.

37
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,870
Have a seat and wait for me here.

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,840
I'm going to pay for it.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,840
OK.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,520
Li Xun.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,470
Li Xun.

42
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,800
You also got hurt?

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,910
Let me see.

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,910
Li Xun!

45
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,080
Li Xun, my leg is injured!

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,520
The doctor asked me to take a month off.

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,910
I entrust you with my homework!

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,030
I wanted to lend him money,

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
but I knew he would refuse.

50
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,590
He had been superior

51
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,430
for no reason

52
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,280
from childhood,

53
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,590
so he

54
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,400
suffered a lot.

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,360
But he never changed.

56
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,710
After that, he lived by hacking,

57
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,030
but he never hacked others' computers.

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,680
He just took back

59
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,680
the stolen information for others.

60
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,840
He was principled.

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,710
He said,

62
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,150
Liu Xiang runs fast

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
not for theft.

64
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,560
He was so arrogant when he was young.

65
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,240
At 17,

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,030
my dancing partner, who always cooperated with me left.

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,590
Even my teacher asked me

68
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,800
to give up dancing.

69
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,120
At that time, I felt my world

70
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,590
was collapsing,

71
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,360
so I indulged myself.

72
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,910
But Li Xun found me

73
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,030
and said some words.

74
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,560
"Idiot,"

75
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,000
he said.

76
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,150
Saying this word costs your so much time?

77
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,360
"Idiot," he said.

78
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,240
Idiot,

79
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,000
it's a long way to victory or failure.

80
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,600
But we just set out.

81
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,830
He scolded me many times,

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,310
but I felt his sincerity

83
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,680
only at that time.

84
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,190
Since then,

85
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,270
I had imagined that

86
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,600
we're biological brothers.

87
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
So I started to

88
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,630
call him his given name

89
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,560
and imagined that we had the same family name.

90
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,870
What do you think about it?

91
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,040
It's reasonable.

92
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,190
Do me a favor.

93
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,830
Receive it.

94
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,950
You're really very similar.

95
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,560
It has nothing to do with my father.

96
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
This is my own money.

97
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,310
I know he's capable

98
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,750
and can make money in many ways,

99
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,750
but everything costs money,

100
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,600
right?

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,720
He is a man who will do great things

102
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,830
but shouldn't be troubled by trifles.

103
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,560
I know he won't

104
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,950
accept my father's money,

105
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,000
but

106
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,630
he's really short of startup capital.

107
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,240
Given his temper,

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,070
he won't ask anyone for help.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,600
Do you agree?

110
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,630
Anyway, I can

111
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,600
hardly live

112
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,720
by dancing.

113
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,040
Just receive this as my investment.

114
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,830
I won't interfere in anything.

115
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,950
If you don't believe my words,

116
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,480
we can draft a contract now.

117
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,630
Zhu Yun,

118
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,240
I'll never hurt Li Xun.

119
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,390
Believe me.

120
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,870
I want to help you.

121
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,160
You know him well.

122
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,560
He is still superior for no reason.

123
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,480
He doesn't want to be controlled by anyone.

124
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,040
Only when making money by himself

125
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,270
and having the final say

126
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,600
can he be relieved.

127
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,360
Don't worry.

128
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,750
I'll always accompany him.

129
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,160
All his dreams will come true.

130
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,920
OK.

131
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm leaving.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,510
OK.

133
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,000
Zhu Yun,

134
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,630
Li Xun is very capable,

135
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,000
but he also has weaknesses.

136
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,310
It may be related to his experience.

137
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,390
Sometimes he indeed goes to extremes,

138
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,040
as if he is walking on a tightrope.

139
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,920
I know it.

140
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,360
He always refused

141
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,510
others' help,

142
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,560
but now you appear.

143
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,360
Right?

144
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,240
University is the real beginning

145
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,510
of his life.

146
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,720
He regards it as a new starting point.

147
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,630
I'll accompany him.

148
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,950
It's also my new starting point.

149
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:07,750
OK.

150
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,560
Bye-bye.

151
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,720
Bye-bye.

152
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,920
Is the list of recommend students

153
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,950
of your university publicized?

154
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,750
No.

155
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,720
It seems that our university is always late for this.

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,000
It's bad for students to make other choices.

157
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,040
If you're not recommended,

158
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,270
and it's late for you

159
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,950
to choose a good foreign university,

160
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,830
you'll get nothing.

161
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,830
Yeah.

162
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,310
I'll call Miss Zhang

163
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,070
to ask about it tomorrow.

164
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,390
It's useless to ask my class teacher about it,

165
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,270
because our school is in charge of this matter.

166
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,430
Your inquiry will be in vain.

167
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,800
Fang Shumiao had asked about it yesterday.

168
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,270
It's so unreliable.

169
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,390
Your school doesn't consider students at all.

170
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,310
Yeah.

171
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
If only everyone

172
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,360
behaves like you.

173
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,600
You're right.

174
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,600
Listen up, Yun,

175
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,120
pay more attention to this.

176
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,270
Tell me as soon as you get the news.

177
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,360
Then we make a decision together.

178
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,560
I see.

179
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,680
Shumiao is back. Bye.

180
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,680
You're back.

181
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,630
Will you receive the postgraduate recommendation?

182
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,040
I haven't decided yet.

183
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,870
You're considering it, while others are even ineligible.

184
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,190
It's a waste of a place.

185
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,750
Shumiao,

186
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,600
are you qualified in the comprehensive exam for postgraduate recommendation?

187
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,670
Don't be so straightforward.

188
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,630
It's embarrassing.

189
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,550
Actually,

190
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,000
it's important to your future.

191
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,750
Facing graduation,

192
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,000
we feel confused in everything,

193
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,240
as if we're standing at a misty intersection.

194
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,720
Don't be sentimental.

195
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,390
I am

196
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,120
a living example.

197
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm not sentimental.

198
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,510
This is the first time I really make a decision for myself.

199
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,670
Hello.

200
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,750
Hello, Lina,

201
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,200
I just finished the IELTS.

202
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,910
Are you free tonight?

203
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,510
I'm leaving.

204
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,670
What did you say, Gao?

205
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,550
I asked you

206
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,270
whether you're free tonight.

207
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,000
I want to invite you to dinner.

208
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,630
OK. I'm free.

209
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,870
What would you like to go?

210
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,550
The restaurant you took me to before.

211
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,150
8 o'clock tonight.

212
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,600
I'll wait for you.

213
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,870
Miss Xu.

214
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,550
For me?

215
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes.

216
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,200
Mr. Gao is waiting for you inside.

217
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,600
Please.

218
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,720
Thank you.

219
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,080
Lina,

220
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
today is the 900th day we've known each other.

221
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,550
I want to tell you something.

222
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,720
When I met you at the Information Technology University for the first time,

223
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,550
I felt

224
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,390
you were such a pretty girl

225
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,510
I'd never seen.

226
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,390
When you looked at and talked to me,

227
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,480
I even felt too embarrassed

228
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,550
to look up at you.

229
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,600
Gao.

230
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,790
That night

231
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,720
was the first time you brought me to this restaurant.

232
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,320
I knew nothing.

233
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,150
I couldn't even read the menu,

234
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,480
but you didn't laugh at me.

235
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,870
That night,

236
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,270
we talked about 5G

237
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,750
and app,

238
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,440
but I didn't care about

239
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,360
how fast the science and technology would develop back then.

240
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,630
I just hoped that

241
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,270
I could accompany you

242
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,840
in the future.

243
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,480
You're pretty, cute

244
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,240
gentle and kind.

245
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,120
You're the best girl in the world.

246
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,030
Any adjective

247
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,670
can't be your embodiment.

248
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,440
I know

249
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,270
I'm not worthy of you,

250
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,550
but I'd like to work hard

251
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,720
and try my best

252
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,960
to approach you.

253
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,600
Lina,

254
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,200
will you give me a chance

255
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,910
of standing beside you?

256
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,630
Gao,

257
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,960
thank you very much.

258
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,320
I've heard a lot of confessions,

259
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,480
but no one was

260
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
as sincere

261
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
and passionate as you.

262
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,390
Just now

263
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,510
I was almost touched by you

264
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,550
at a moment.

265
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,670
Actually, like you,

266
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,600
I'm also used to chasing

267
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,120
those I can't get,

268
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,270
just like I chose programming

269
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,080
when I just entered the university.

270
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,960
I don't even

271
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,320
understand it now,

272
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,240
but I'll graduate soon.

273
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,750
I always think,

274
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,630
if I gave up programming

275
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,600
and focused on folk dance,

276
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,360
maybe

277
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I've stood

278
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,390
on the stage of the National Centre for the Performing Arts.

279
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,120
But I had to do so,

280
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,840
because I liked it,

281
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,390
just like I couldn't control myself

282
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,480
and took to a man

283
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,550
who doesn't like me.

284
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,150
It's really tiring.

285
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,480
You must understand me.

286
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,080
Lina,

287
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,600
I don't expect that you can promise me now,

288
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,600
but I hope

289
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,080
I can accompany you.

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,320
But I don't want to fool you.

291
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,870
I can't ignore

292
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,720
your sincerity.

293
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,630
I can wait.

294
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,750
I can wait for you.

295
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,840
Why do you wait?

296
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,200
If I tell you,

297
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,720
I won't give up Li Xun

298
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,440
as you do now,

299
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,550
will you still wait for me?

300
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,630
But Li Xun and Zhu Yun

301
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,320
have been together for three years.

302
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,600
Yeah.

303
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,960
I also hope I can be big-hearted.

304
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,600
Gao,

305
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,480
thank you very much

306
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,720
for preparing these for me tonight.

307
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,720
This is the best gift

308
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,870
I've ever received.

309
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,080
I believe

310
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,480
you'll definitely have a girl

311
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,320
who likes and admires you.

312
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,720
Li Xun,

313
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,590
stop writing programs.

314
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
New Year's Eve will end soon.

315
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,880
Let's do something else.

316
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,400
OK.

317
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,030
Let's

318
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,680
take exercise together.

319
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,550
I really itch.

320
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,070
We're really exercising.

321
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,110
Or else?

322
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,440
What else do you want?

323
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,110
Anyway, I don't want to

324
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,550
do such a tiring and boring thing.

325
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,110
Is it boring to have a walk with me?

326
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,200
No.

327
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,160
Is it boring?

328
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,590
Sir,

329
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,960
buy a rose.

330
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,750
Would you like it?

331
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,830
No.

332
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,070
But she has had a tiring night.

333
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,590
We have to support her business.

334
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,720
50 yuan.

335
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,880
So expensive?

336
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,440
I buy all these.

337
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,790
May you be happy.

338
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:46,790
Thank you.

339
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,880
Thanks, man.

340
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,270
They're a little expensive.

341
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,110
Don't do so again.

342
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,160
At the start-up stage, you should

343
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,400
value the ROI.

344
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,790
You also know that

345
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,920
we won't get any return from these?

346
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,550
Well,

347
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,200
flower is different.

348
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,030
It can't be measured by money.

349
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,960
This is the first time I receive roses.

350
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,790
Really?

351
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,640
You fool.

352
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,000
These are Chinese roses.

353
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,550
I don't care.

354
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,160
I think they're roses.

355
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,880
Annoying.

356
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,030
You're annoying.

357
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,310
Who is the most annoying?

358
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,880
You.

359
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,480
Li Xun, look.

360
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,780

Zhu Yun,

378
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,480
a name you're familiar with will be shown

379
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,640
on a building here.

380
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,680
What's the name?

381
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,160
L&P.

382
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,060
♫The first sight♫

383
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:39,540
♫Spreads and later it wins the world for me♫

384
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,070
Li Xun,

385
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,960
you're not alone now.

386
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,920
With me,

387
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,960
you no longer need to fight

388
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,030
against the world with body covered with thorns

389
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,070
like these flowers.

390
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,440
I see.

391
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,550
I've given up postgraduate recommendation.

392
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,880
As I said before,

393
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,880
you can do whatever you want.

394
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,750
I support you.

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,030
Gao,

399
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,750
come out to help us.

400
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,880
Coming. Coming.

401
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,510
We bring the fish.

402
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:52,960
Coming.

403
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,640
Han, long time no see.

404
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,880
Have a drink later.

405
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,270
OK, let's have a drink later.

406
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,200
Have a drink heartily.

407
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,400
Let's have a drink heartily.

408
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,400
Coming.

409
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,750
Shrimps.

410
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,350
How are they?

411
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,350
They look very fresh.

412
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,240
How did you deep fry them?

413
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,160
Let me serve the fish.

414
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,720
They were all caught this morning.

415
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,030
These are all meat dishes.

416
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,030
Liu cooked them in different cooking ways.

417
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,790
He is awesome.

418
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,270
Thanks, Mr. Han.

419
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,590
No, I'm a farmer.

420
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,070
But farmer is also good.

421
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,270
I won't be controlled.

422
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,750
Right?

423
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,920
At work,

424
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,270
I feel at ease.

425
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,070
Is the fish cooked?

426
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,270
Almost!

427
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,400
Don't wait for him.

428
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,440
Let's enjoy. Let's enjoy.

429
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,790
Have a drink.

430
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,400
Yes.

431
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,000
Have a drink.

432
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,310
Congratulations, Mr. Han.

433
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,240
Business is booming.

434
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,480
Unexpectedly,

435
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,110
Mr. Han is the first successful entrepreneur

436
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,110
among us.

437
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,880
Cheers. Congratulations!

438
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,640
Congratulations. Congratulations. Cheers.

439
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,440
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

440
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,960
Congratulations.

441
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,000
Congratulations.

442
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,750
How is your cooperation in logistics?

443
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,830
The contract is being drafted these days.

444
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:01,880
Li Xun,

445
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,590
thank you

446
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,510
for establishing the website for me.

447
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,000
Since the website was put into use,

448
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,750
my fish has been sold very well,

449
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,240
and many fish farmers in our village

450
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,550
want to join us.

451
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,790
Congratulations.

452
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,110
Enjoy. Eat more.

453
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,750
Why didn't I know

454
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,640
when you established the website?

455
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,830
You don't know many things.

456
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,480
Really?

457
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,240
Coming! Zanthoxylum Armatum Boiled fish.

458
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,640
Why didn't you ask me for help?

459
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,110
What if you were scalded?

460
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,720
Don't worry.

461
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,920
Why are you looking at me?

462
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,920
Enjoy food.

463
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,920
Enjoy this. It's delicious.

464
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,400
What would you like? Let me pick it up for you.

465
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,200
I want that one. You picked a wrong one.

466
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,240
Take it.

467
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,350
No.

468
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,000
That one.

469
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
This meal for closing the base

470
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,000
seems to become a farewell dinner for graduation.

471
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,030
Maybe only a few of us

472
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,590
can gather that day.

473
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,310
I heard that

474
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,200
you've given up postgraduate recommendation.

475
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,680
Are you sure?

476
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,750
You've decided

477
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,510
to be with Li Xun all your life?

478
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,720
Don't doubt me.

479
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,000
Don't forget something.

480
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,270
I'm Li Xun's girlfriend,

481
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,350
but I'm also the  one with the highest GPA in our class.

482
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,880
I choose to follow him

483
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,640
not just for love.

484
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,200
OK.

485
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,200
To be honest,

486
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,440
he's very capable,

487
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,720
but he is also prone to act on impulse.

488
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,270
He is arrogant

489
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,270
due to his talent.

490
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,680
In cooperation,

491
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,640
we can tolerate him.

492
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
However, the larger the team is,

493
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,830
the more problems there will be.

494
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,200
Therefore,

495
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,640
you must hold him back.

496
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,350
Li Xun can leave anyone

497
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,240
except you.

498
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,960
I'll be always by his side.

499
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,790
Gao.

500
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:08,880
Thanks.

501
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,680
So,

502
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,880
Mr. Li,

503
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,790
Miss Zhu,

504
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,750
what are you going to do?

505
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,110
I haven't thought about this deeply,

506
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,960
but I have a rough idea.

507
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,680
I want to be engaged in medical industry.

508
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,680
Many people are interested in the Internet medical care

509
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
because they want to combine

510
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
the Internet with medical care

511
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,440
to enable patients

512
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,590
to see a doctor at home.

513
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,440
But I think this is a wrong direction.

514
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,160
They just want to serve patients.

515
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,750
But medical industry

516
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,480
is a typical market dominated by the supplier.

517
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,640
In this world, there are many patients

518
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,510
but few high-quality medical resources.

519
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,480
What are you going to do?

520
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,110
My mother died of cancer.

521
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,830
The hospital where she stayed in

522
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,000
was very low.

523
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,480
There were few resources available to doctors,

524
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,550
and different doctors

525
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,030
gave totally different diagnosis.

526
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,720
Finally, they made a definite diagnosis

527
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,200
several months later,

528
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,000
but she died soon.

529
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,110
The main reason for the difficulty of seeing a doctor

530
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,750
is not few doctors

531
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,590
but is few experienced doctors.

532
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,110
So I think

533
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,070
we need to give priority to

534
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,480
how to maximize

535
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,640
the utilization of doctors' experience.

536
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,440
Now, more than 90% of data

537
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,030
of the medical institutions

538
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,550
are forgotten in their backstage database.

539
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,550
If we can integrate scientifically

540
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,160
these wasted clinical data

541
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,480
and then feed them back

542
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,640
to assist those inexperienced doctors

543
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,960
in making a diagnosis

544
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,510
in a certain way...

545
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,160
How to get these data?

546
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,790
Can they be shared among hospitals?

547
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,270
But their data formats should be different.

548
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Will we integrate these resources

549
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,310
digitally or in other ways?

550
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,350
Gao should be good at this.

551
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,270
Calm down.

552
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,070
It's just an idea.

553
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:26,880
Yeah.

554
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,310
It's just a starting point,

555
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,750
and medical industry is biased towards public welfare,

556
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,680
so it's hard

557
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,110
to make profits.

558
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,750
But I think it's worth doing.

559
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,400
This idea

560
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,880
makes people have such a desire.

561
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,620
♫I don't know how you've been♫

562
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,510
I hope

563
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,750
the survival rate of cancer will be increased by 1%.

564
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,620
♫I've been walking so long♫

565
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,830
Mr. Li is so confident.

566
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,720
Gao,

567
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,070
will you join us?

568
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,240
You can ask me for all you want.

569
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,310
I know

570
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,720
this is

571
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,110
quite a meaningful thing,

572
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,830
and I never dare imagine it,

573
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,880
but I've decided to go abroad

574
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,640
and am applying for an offer.

575
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,350
That's also good.

576
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,720
Aren't you curious about it

577
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,400
and don't you want to ask me why?

578
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,000
Why?

579
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,830
The day before New Year's Day,

580
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,510
I went to Xu Lina.

581
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,640
I confessed to her,

582
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,270
but she refused me.

583
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,030
She said

584
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,110
she likes a man who is admired

585
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,070
and even respected by her.

586
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,270
Therefore,

587
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,200
she likes you.

588
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,310
I know

589
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,790
I'll achieve success very easily

590
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,270
if I work with you to start a business.

591
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,830
It's much easier

592
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,960
than going abroad for me,

593
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,030
but if I do so,

594
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,030
my name

595
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,750
will never be heard.

596
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,310
Gao,

597
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,720
I can't say any good words.

598
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,240
But, good luck.

599
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,440
I hope your dream can come true.

600
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,110
I'm sincere.

601
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,480
Our L&P

602
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,160
will always wait for you to become our partner.

603
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,310
Our L&P

604
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,790
will always expect your joining.

605
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,400
Eternal trio!

606
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,110
Thanks.

607
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,310
Li Xun!

608
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Stop drinking.

609
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,200
Where's Li Xun?

610
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,590
Li Xun!

611
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,790
Drink less.

612
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,880
Where's Li Xun?

613
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,070
What's up?

614
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,790
Li Xun!

615
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,510
You come at the right time.

616
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,830
Li Xun, listen up.

617
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,400
Today I must

618
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,510
tell you something.

619
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,440
Otherwise, I'll be regretful for the rest of my life.

620
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,070
Li Xun,

621
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,750
I like you.

622
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,000
OK. You like him. Give me your beer.

623
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,310
I'd taken to you since I entered the university,

624
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,030
but you scolded me in public

625
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,960
in the base.

626
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,480
You wretch, I dislike you!

627
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Zhu Yun is good.

628
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,270
She is gentle and cute.

629
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,830
She is much better you crosspatch.

630
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,480
Curmudgeon.

631
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,110
Don't take advantage of me.

632
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,750
What's wrong?

633
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,750
Don't vomit here!

634
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,640
Monitor,

635
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,640
are you all right?

636
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,480
I'm, I'm all right.

637
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,790
Here you are.

638
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,790
Warm water.

639
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,350
Thank you.

640
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,720
Mo-monitor,

641
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,880
I always,

642
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,720
I always want to tell you something.

643
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,510
Go ahead.

644
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,000
I...

645
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,160
I...

646
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,880
I...

647
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,400
I can play the Suona.

648
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,000
What?

649
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,510
I can play the Suona.

650
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,550
But we no longer have any freshmen's joint performance.

651
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,510
I learnt it for you.

652
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,320
I like you.

653
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,880
I know it.

654
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,550
You, you know it?

655
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,840
I'm not a fool,

656
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,480
but you are.

657
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,440
Haven't you realized it these three years?

658
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,960
I don't like you.

659
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,960
Don't think too much about it.

660
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,280
I don't dislike you.

661
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:50,030
I'm a selfish woman.

662
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,510
I only like myself.

663
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,480
The man I like

664
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,510
is just

665
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:59,000
the embodiment of my imagination.

666
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,760
Once I find something wrong with him,

667
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,480
I don't like him anymore.

668
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,110
I don't treat him as my lover

669
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,280
but admire him as a star instead.

670
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,280
Meng,

671
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,110
we shouldn't be together.

672
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
However, if I have a chance,

673
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,000
I'll go to watch you playing the Suona.

674
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,960
Suona is good.

675
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,760
It's a traditional musical instrument.

676
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:31,760
As the saying goes, no one can't be touched by Erhu,

677
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,440
and no soul can't be consoled

678
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,590
by Suona.

679
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,190
I just

680
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,190
want to tell you that

681
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,000
a man likes you.

682
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,630
If this thing

683
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,550
can slightly warm your heart

684
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,440
when you're unhappy

685
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,800
in the future,

686
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,840
it's enough.

687
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,030
I'm contented.

688
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,550
Thank you for being so good.

689
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,670
Because of you,

690
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,360
I know the feelings of liking someone.

691
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,280
Why did they drink so much?

692
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,590
We won't graduate immediately

693
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,150
and be always separated.

694
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,760
Why are you looking at me?

695
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,800
Am I prettier?

696
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,070
You just acted like a spoiled girl.

697
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,000
Why didn't you ask me

698
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,320
to help you with this?

699
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,320
What if you were scalded?

700
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,230
Shut up. I acted like a spoiled girl?

701
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,150
Yeah.

702
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,400
Oh! He and I?

703
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,510
Don't deny it.

704
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,230
You take to him after long-term cooperation.

705
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,710
Gosh.

706
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,030
You're sharing your experience with me?

707
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,800
You aren't even more experienced than me.

708
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,840
You're more experienced?

709
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,800
When did you gain the experience?

710
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:34,710
Shut up.

711
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,550
You're the dominator in our relationship.

712
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,400
You want to be always single,

713
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,840
without burdens and worries.

714
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,000
You want me to lend you shoulders

715
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:04,710
as your lover.

716
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,480
After drinking, you always talk to me

717
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:13,000
and say I'm important to you.

718
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:18,110
Then you laugh while talking.

719
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,320
You say you can't repay

720
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,360
my kindness.

721
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:32,320
But you're use to it and don't want to give it up.

722
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,960
As long as I can lie by your side,

723
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,280
nothing else matters.

724
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,550
I'm just heart-broken

725
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,760
and shedding tears.

726
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,550
I had a good time today.

727
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,230
Cheers.

728
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
I'm leaving.

729
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,510
Hurry up. Hurry up.

730
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,070
I'm leaving.

731
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,360
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

732
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,320
See you next time.

733
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,030
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

734
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:05,840
OK.

735
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,670
Drinkers can't drive.

736
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,550
I came here by taxi.

737
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,070
Take a taxi. Take a taxi.

738
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,150
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

739
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,320
OK. OK. Bye.

740
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,110
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

741
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,880
Take care!

742
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,400
Where are you going?

743
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,030
Take care on the way!

744
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,920
-It's out of fuel! -Bye!

745
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,110
-Take care. -OK. OK.

746
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,590
Bye-bye.

747
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,510
Does he take an inverse way?

748
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,510
We're leaving, too.

749
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,670
You get along with each other.

750
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,230
Get along with each other.

751
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,800
We're going home, too.

752
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,110
Liu.

753
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,320
Bye-bye.

754
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,840
Take care.

755
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,360
You sang well.

756
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,400
You've come back from Beijing.

757
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,440
Why did you still sing the old song?

758
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,230
I have many new songs,

759
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,550
but I just like this one.

760
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,320
How time flies! It's been three years.

761
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,070
Nanhu University, I love you!

762
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,630
I hate you!

763
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,960
I love but also hate you!

764
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,840
Fang Shumiao,

765
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,230
you're ill-behaved after drinking.

766
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,030
After drinking, you made a fuss, vomited and shouted.

767
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,360
Look at me.

768
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,280
If you go on like this, I'll vomit on you.

769
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,070
What will our life be

770
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
three years later?

771
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,400
Three years later, Ren Di must be popular.

772
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,630
By then, songs of Light Red will be spread everywhere,

773
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,230
and I'll earn money by selling her autographed photos.

774
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,840
Li Xun, Zhu Yun,

775
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,150
your company

776
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,550
may not surpass Google

777
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:52,960
but at least

778
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,440
will match the BAT three years later.

779
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,920
BAT.

780
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,550
Gao,

781
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:58,710
what about you?

782
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,480
Three years later, I'll graduate as a postgraduate.

783
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,590
I'll be nothing.

784
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,550
Then I hope you can join Google

785
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,710
and fight against Li Xun.

786
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,360
One of you will become Bill Gates,

787
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,150
and the other Zuckerberg.

788
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,230
I choose Bill Gates.

789
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,510
Both of them have nothing to do with Google.

790
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,920
Don't talk nonsense.

791
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,070
Yes.

792
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,880
As for Wu Mengxing,

793
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,760
I hope you can

794
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,480
have a happy marriage.

795
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,760
And go on playing the Suona.

796
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,800
Show it to me.

797
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,710
Why don't you ask me what I want to do?

798
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,960
What do you want to do?

799
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,800
I want to make a fortune!

800
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,190
OK.

801
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,000
And then?

802
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,030
Well, I,

803
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,840
I must see your name

804
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,800
on the Forbes China Celebrity List by then.

805
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,550
OK?

806
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,760
OK, just wait and see.

807
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,230
After I make a fortune,

808
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,880
each of the listeners here

809
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,400
will be given a big villa.

810
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,710
OK, it's a deal.

811
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,000
Girl, we should have a dream.

812
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,880
I hope

813
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,440
our efforts will be paid,

814
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,510
and our dreams will come true!

815
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,440
We'll all become who we want to be!

816
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,070
Who we want to be!

817
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,480
Come true!

818
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,400
Come on.

Beautiful scenery is enjoyable.

838
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,320
The young are always proud and arrogant.

839
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,000
They look ahead but don't look down

840
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,400
at the vicissitudes of life in the dirty corner.

841
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,000
If we held ourselves back,

842
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,670
were more tolerant

843
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,550
and modest,

844
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,670
would everything be different?

845
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,670
But we didn't do so.

846
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,320
We spent our youth

847
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,590
arrogantly and waywardly.

what Li Xun and I are doing?

852
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,510
When will you tell us the truth?

853
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,320
Where are you going?

854
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,920
Is he more important than us?

What if I say yes?

856
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,880
He'll keep an eye on you

as he said.

858

When she leaves,

859
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,150
