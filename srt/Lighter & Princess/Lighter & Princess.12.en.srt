♫Everything is different when we watch the sky from the sea bottom♫

♫The person I used to be is gone♫

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,980
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,380
♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,260
♫We would bloom in the darkness♫

♫The knight and the king♫

♫like the white sails in night navigation are protecting the ocean♫

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,940
♫I see a clear direction♫

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,540
♫In which a touch of golden color flickers at the end of the wheat field♫

♫Even if I am the king♫

♫With supreme glory everything is meaningless without you♫

♫Who is proud and arrogant like wild and wind weeds♫

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,580
♫I only want you to be at my side whatever it takes♫

[Episode 12]

21
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,230
Cut to the chase.

22
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,120
You don't have to worry.

23
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,750
Jiang Xingchi is…

24
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,120
Simple-minded with well-developed limbs.

25
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,400
Don't worry.

26
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,070
I have so many things to do.

27
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,230
I have no time for him.

28
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,000
I shouldn't have chosen volleyball course for you.

29
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,910
I didn't come to class to win him.

30
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,560
You didn't sign me up for this class

31
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,880
because of the choppy network, right?

32
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,910
I know.

33
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,790
You want me to move.

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,720
Your back

35
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,120
is quite stiff

36
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,280
like a rusty door.

37
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,350
You write codes at the base every day.

38
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,000
I just want to find a chance to let you move more.

39
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,720
I accept

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,630
your kindness.

♫Slowly miss you at the long night♫

42
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,260
♫A moment of palpitation♫

43
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,660
♫As long as you're by my side♫

44
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,220
♫I forgot time unconsciously♫

♫Slowly understand you on the long road♫

♫Without you  even joy feels lonely♫

♫Looking at your white shirt♫

48
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,380
♫I feel full warmth and endless love♫

49

♫The secret I've been hiding♫

50
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,620
♫I really want to be with you♫

51
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
♫At a moment  in the autumn of a fairy tale♫

52
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,620
♫The knight and princess are destined to meet♫

53
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,780
♫Let me feel and guard♫

54
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,740
♫Your simple wish♫

55

♫At a moment  in reversely flying days♫

56
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,740
♫I'm no longer afraid of the big world♫

57
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,980
♫By my side  or on my pillow♫

58
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,860
♫You say every good night♫

59
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,180
♫Happiness has never changed♫

60
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,200
Attention, everyone.

61
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,790
We'll finish our course today.

62
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,110
I'll test your ability of catching balls.

63
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,200
There are twenty balls for each person.

64
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
If you catch eight ball, you will pass the exam.

65
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,790
Twelve is excellent.

66
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,200
Sixteen is the full mark.

67
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,640
Any questions?

68
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,960
No. No.

69
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,760
All right, let's start the exam right away.

70
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,640
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

71
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,760
I'll help you later.

72
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,960
Thank you.

73
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,840
Zhu Yun.

74
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,350
Here.

75
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,910
One.

76
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,870
Two.

77
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,960
Three.

78
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,080
Four.

79
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,670
Five.

80
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,790
Thirteen.

81
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,400
Fifteen.

82
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,040
Seventeen.

83
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,470
Eighteen.

84
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,720
Jiang Xingchi.

85
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,600
Don't go too far.

86
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
I can't give her two hundred points.

87
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,470
Coach.

88
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,400
Thank you, coach.

89
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,960
Next one.

90
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,200
Happy now?

91
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,550
It's not bad.

92
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,470
He's a little better than you.

93
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,280
Nothing more.

94
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,400
Next.

95
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,870
Li Xun.

96
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,670
Come on.

97
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,720
One.

98
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,910
Two.

99
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,790
Three.

100
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,480
Four.

101
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,790
Eight.

102
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,040
Are you going to go on?

103
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,310
No need.

104
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,160
The number eight is lucky.

105
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,360
You are great.

106
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,590
I was thinking if you failed,

107
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,190
you would lose face.

108
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,160
What's wrong?

109
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,040
Li Xun.

110
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,120
Are you okay?

111
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,240
Li Xun.

112
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,120
Are you okay?

113
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,710
Li Xun.

114
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,240
Li Xun.

115
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,310
This is his old disease.

116
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,640
He didn't deal with it in stages I and II.

117
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,710
So now it's getting worse and worse.

118
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,480
If he doesn't take treatment,

119
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,640
he can't even walk.

120
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,190
Well, tomorrow morning at nine o'clock,

121
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,400
you can go to find Director Wang.

122
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,070
Show him this film

123
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,310
to see if he needs surgery.

124
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,910
It's so serious?

125
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,710
If the surgery is scheduled now,

126
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,950
it may be half a year later.

127
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,360
He can take physical therapy

128
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
while waiting.

129
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,160
If it's effective,

130
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,880
he won't need to have surgery.

131
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,670
Okay.

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,430
Then I'll handle this first.

133
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,360
OK.

134
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,710
Doctor.

135
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,400
Do you know where my brother is?

136
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,190
What's your brother's name?

137
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,590
Li Xun.

138
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,480
Li Xun?

139
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,520
Don't you know her?

140
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,950
Who is family member?

141
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,240
I'm his classmate.

142
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,430
Who are you?

143
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,120
I'm his elder sister.

144
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,400
Well,

145
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,480
sister,

146
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,240
Li Xun is still in the emergency observation room.

147
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,160
I can lead you there.

148
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,190
Okay, thanks.

149
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,280
Thank you, doctor.

150
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,760
Never mind.

151
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,590
This way.

152
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,240
Li Xun has an elder sister?

153
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,830
Never heard of this from him.

154
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,910
Don't worry.

155
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,550
He is fine now.

156
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,400
Thank you.

157
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
I live in the suburbs.

158
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,240
I came as soon as I got the call from the school teacher.

159
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,520
It's a long way.

160
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,240
Fortunately, you took care of him.

161
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,710
Never mind.

162
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,520
He fainted in the PE class.

163
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,760
I was right there.

164
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,590
Don't worry.

165
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,590
The doctor just gave him some painkiller.

166
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,590
He'll wake up later.

167
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,950
Have you eaten yet?

168
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,280
Why don't we go downstairs and buy some food?

169
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:33,830
Okay.

170
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,120
Thank you.

171
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,760
There is some more.

172
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,280
Girl…

173
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,830
It should be my treat.

174
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,950
Let me pay it.

175
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,120
No need. I can pay it.

176
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,760
It's my treat.

177
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know what you like.

178
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,040
Are you coming here from Linyang?

179
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm married here.

180
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,910
My family was poor.

181
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,310
My mother was sick.

182
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,520
I just wanted to work,

183
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,120
but I didn't make any money.

184
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,910
My brother,

185
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,400
wanted to earn money to support family early.

186
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,710
His wait suffered

187
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,160
from this before.

188
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,480
The doctor said Li Xun's spine was injured.

189
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,910
What's going on?

190
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,000
Blame me.

191
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's my fault.

192
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,590
He's so young.

193
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,120
What should he do in the future?

194
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,480
Don't worry, sister.

195
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,070
We force him to take surgery this time.

196
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,430
It's useless.

197
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,190
He won't listen to us.

198
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,000
He never listens to us.

199
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,000
He's lying in the hospital.

200
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,190
He is like the meat on the chopping board.

201
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,520
How can he have a say?

202
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,950
You are his family and you have the right to sign.

203
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,240
It really works?

204
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,280
Give him an anesthetic injection at worst

205
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,400
and then push him to the operating room.

206
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
He wouldn't decline it.

207
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,790
The doctor

208
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,710
asked me to take

209
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,480
his CT film

210
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,710
to the orthopedics department tomorrow.

211
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,280
How about I'll come to you tomorrow morning?

212
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,240
Let's go together.

213
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,910
Okay.

214
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,190
Girl.

215
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,040
What's your name?

216
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,550
My name is Zhu Yun.

217
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,120
Thank you, Zhu Yun.

218
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,790
Thank you very much.

219
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,830
Never mind.

220
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,280
Sister, eat more.

221
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,000
It is estimated that Li Xun will wake up soon.

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,240
We can still go and see him.

223
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,670
If he wakes up,

224
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,880
I won't go up.

225
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,160
I'll leave later

226
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,950
Please take care

227
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,070
of Li Xun for me.

228
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,910
Thank you.

229
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,400
You've come here but refuse to see him.

230
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,480
Is there anything difficult?

231
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,360
He probably doesn't want to see us.

232
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,710
It's right for him

233
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,760
to do this.

234
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,790
Why?

235
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,070
You really want to know

236
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,880
what happened to Li Xun before?

237
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,520
When he was in high school,

238
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,950
my mom was sick.

239
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,880
To cure my mom,

240
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,880
Li Xun began to find ways to earn money.

241
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,670
You don't believe it?

242
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,590
Of course I don't believe it,

243
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,440
My general order is useful.

244
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,920
How much is your account?

245
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,310
This full-class divine costume

246
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,870
costs a hundred thousand yuan.

247
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
It's say it's one hundred thousand.

248
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,040
Let's bet one percent of it.

249
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,760
1,000 yuan.

250
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,480
Okay.

251
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,760
I don't believe it.

252
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,310
If you can steal my account

253
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,280
in front of me,

254
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,110
from now on,

255
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,150
you are my dad.

256
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,150
I don't a wastrel son like you.

257
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,480
Look here.

258
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,310
Is it your account?

259
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,040
Awesome.

260
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,480
How did you do it?

261
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,150
The person who just sold you equipment on QQ

262
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,760
is me.

263
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,110
It's a hidden plan?

264
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,110
Haven't you heard that we shouldn't click the strange website linkage?

265
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,440
The website was just a Trojan.

266
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,350
As long as you input your information,

267
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,440
it will be shown immediately on my side.

268
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,760
Be careful in the future.

269
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,960
Can you help me?

270
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,280
That equipment… -I can't.

271
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,000
I'll pay you.

272
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,280
3,000 or 5,000?

273
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,200
Say a number.

274
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,830
Okay, 1,000.

275
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,440
Count it.

276
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,520
I keep my words.

277
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,830
You are so skilled, why not come to help me?

278
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,240
You are here.

279
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,070
Yeah.

280
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,440
How's mom?

281
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,550
Doctor just gave her morphine.

282
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,520
She is asleep.

283
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,870
She took morphine once a day before.

284
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,040
But now,

285
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,390
she takes one every four hours.

286
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,280
This money…

287
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,070
Don't worry.

288
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,480
Labor gains.

289
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,680
Don't worry.

290
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,390
Can you stop dancing?

291
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,000
Li Xun.

292
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,240
Just let me dance

293
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,350
one last dance.

294
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm afraid

295
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,110
I can't dance any more.

296
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,760
You got a terminal disease?

297
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,480
I'm sure I can't pass the unified exams.

298
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,310
My dad won't let me dance anymore.

299
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,720
He is right.

300
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,270
You're like a pole.

301
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,550
Can you dance well?

302
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,240
Don't let me hear music again.

303
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,440
You know

304
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,720
I'm good at Latin dance only.

305
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,870
My academic performance is really poor.

306
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,110
As soon as this exam was over,

307
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,480
I checked the answers

308
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,590
and found I just can't pass.

309
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,310
My dad said

310
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,680
he wouldn't prevent me from dancing

311
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,070
unless I pass the exam

312
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,310
and get the high school graduation certificate.

313
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,280
Otherwise,

314
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,240
he would send me to study business in the UK.

315
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,720
My favorite Latin dance.

316
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,920
Have you finished?

317
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,790
I heard

318
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,920
our scores are stored

319
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,760
in the computer of the Academic Affairs Office.

320
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:29,760
How about we…

321
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,590
Don't ever think about it.

322
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,870
I would never do anything that

323
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,960
violates the school rules.

324
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,520
Let's have a talk.

325
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,520
In ancient times, someone cut his flesh to save his mother.

326
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,720
As for you,

327
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,590
your mother needs money to stay in hospital.

328
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,760
As long as I pass the exam,

329
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,240
my dad would definitely give me pocket money.

330
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Don't mention my mom.

331
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,000
Okay, fine.

332
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,720
I know.

333
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,630
Liu Xiang didn't run fast to be a thief.

334
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,310
You don't want to earn this money.

335
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,200
Mom.

336
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,630
With the sun,

337
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
it's so great.

338
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,000
Let's go.

339
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,110
One course of treatment costs at least140,000 yuan?

340
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,720
What do you want?

341
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,720
Rob me?

342
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,240
Don't say this useless.

343
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,000
Listen.

344
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,110
I have no money.

345
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:44,680
Sister.

346
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,240
Why are you back again?

347
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,720
Dr. Zhao said

348
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,480
now Japan has developed a new targeted drug

349
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,280
to especially treat

350
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,760
patients with advanced liver cancer like mom.

351
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,480
It's called,

352
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,350
it's called what ni?

353
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,350
Lenvartini.

354
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,350
Yeah.

355
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,590
This is the medicine.

356
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,070
Dr. Zhao said

357
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,240
this medicine may help to treat our mother's illness

358
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,280
and it can

359
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,390
prolong her life span of three months.

360
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,630
Never mind.

361
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,240
Don't worry.

362
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,870
I'll try to get money.

363
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,480
We've entered it.

364
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,760
Correct the mark yourself.

365
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,440
Great.

366
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,830
One hundred and forty thousand,

367
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,830
four thousand and three hundred.

368
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,920
The sooner, the better.

369
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,920
No problem.

370
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,960
Once the result is announced,

371
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,590
my dad can afford

372
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,350
one million yuan at least, let alone 140,000.

373
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,960
Is it cool, mom?

374
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,920
The sun is warm.

375
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,350
It's just right.

376
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,040
Li Xun.

377
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,280
Li Xun.

378
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,630
Why are you here?

379
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,720
Auntie looks really good today.

380
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,040
Mom.

381
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Will you stay here?

382
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,040
Go back.

383
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,390
Okay.

384
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,550
Come here.

385
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,310
What's up?

386
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,110
The school knows about the mark change.

387
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,550
The Education Bureau has also sent a director surnamed Liu

388
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,550
to especially investigate this.

389
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,630
They will find

390
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,440
us out soon.

391
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,310
How much have you changed?

392
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,960
95.

393
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,920
95 points for each subject?

394
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,280
There are also 90.

395
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,590
Are you mad?

396
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,440
You usually get 60 points.

397
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,550
But you changed it to 95!

398
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,590
I,

399
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,000
I thought if my score was higher,

400
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,790
my dad would give me more pocket money.

401
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,390
Is she the person from the Education Bureau?

402
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,630
Liu Ailin?

403
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's her.

404
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,870
I saw her entering the headmaster's office.

405
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,960
Due to serious violation of school rules,

406
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,280
Li Xun and Fu Yizhuo from Class2, Grade 3

407
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,350
were expelled from school.

408
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,830
Don't worry.

409
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,520
I'm going to find Director Liu.

410
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,110
I said I did it alone.

411
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,550
The Education Bureau is not that blind.

412
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,150
Do you know

413
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,200
the twenty-one ports of the computer?

414
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,310
What port?

415
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,960
Mom.

416
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,150
Mom.

417
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,480
Mom.

418
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,480
Mom.

419
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,200
Mom.

420
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,000
Mom, I'm sorry.

421
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,680
I'm sorry.

422
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,680
Li Xun was expelled.

423
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,830
But he didn't get the money

424
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,790
to cure our mom.

425
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,440
He didn't even see mom for the last time.

426
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,390
Please sign here.

427
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:39,660
[Farewell Room]

428
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Let me tell you something.

429
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,310
When you pick up the urn later,

430
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,960
don't listen to those people fooling around

431
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,790
and buy one costing thousands of yuan.

432
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Those businessmen

433
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,350
are greedy.

434
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,790
Just buy one costing a few hundred yuan

435
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,480
as long as it's good.

436
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,440
Dagang.

437
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,830
My mom is gone.

438
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,440
Your mom's disease is incurable.

439
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,520
It's good that she died earlier.

440
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
Or hundreds of thousands of yuan

441
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,040
will be wasted, leaving…

442
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,760
Stop.

443
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,590
Stop.

444
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,200
Dagang, what are you doing?

445
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,070
Stop. Zhang Dagang. Stop!

446
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,790
Li Xun.

447
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,720
Li Xun.

448
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,110
Are you OK?

449
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,520
Maybe it hurts the spine.

450
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,830
Do a computed tomography first

451
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,870
to check the situation.

452
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,110
He may need

453
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,440
surgery at worst.

454
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,070
How much is that?

455
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,000
Twenty or thirty thousand for surgery.

456
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,760
Be careful. Be careful.

457
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,440
Go.

458
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,760
Let's take the computed tomography.

459
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,960
Go.

460
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,110
I won't go.

461
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,110
What if it hurts your spine?

462
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,960
You gave up mom,

463
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,310
let alone me.

464
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,310
Li Xun's waist

465
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,520
was beaten by my husband

466
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,760
the day my mother died.

467
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,830
He's been keeping his anger

468
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,310
and learned for one more year and retook the college entrance .examination.

469
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,680
Then he didn't go home much.

470
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,720
How long have you not seen Li Xun?

471
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,000
It's been quite a long time.

472
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,040
When did you come back?

473
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,150
Who allowed you to leave the hospital?

474
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,920
What's your hurry?

475
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,310
I've written switched virtual circuit.

476
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,590
for you last night.

477
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,390
I saw it.

478
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,760
Nice job.

479
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,110
Li Xun.

480
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,520
You have a bad spine.

481
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,790
Why didn't you tell me?

482
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,870
With your physical condition,

483
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,350
you can't play volleyball at all.

484
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,110
You can't program while sitting long like this.

485
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,310
Your position

486
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,040
is the worst posture for the spine now.

487
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,830
Anyway, it's already like this.

488
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,150
The doctor said it slipped badly.

489
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,070
You'd better have surgery.

490
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:21,870
Nope.

491
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,150
Why not?

492
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,150
I'm busy.

493
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,520
How come?

494
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,040
What are you busy with?

495
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,390
Why are you so nosy?

496
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,280
Does it have anything to do with you?

497
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,760
I checked it yesterday.

498
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,440
There's little risk of surgery now.

499
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,150
Even if there is a ten thousandth chance,

500
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:42,870
I won't have it.

501
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,550
I would rather die than paralyze.

502
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,960
I'll take these two back and have a look.

503
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,320
I'll return them to you later.

504
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,750
Okay.

505
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,400
Central Gym...

506
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,040
Class rep, have you had a meal yet?

507
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,440
Who placed this here?

508
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,590
I don't know.

509
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,070
Hurry up and deliver it.

510
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,480
Don't be late.

511
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,670
He knew that Li Lan went to the hospital yesterday.

512
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,360
These sister and brother.

513
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,880
Thank you, Zhu Yun.

514
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,440
It doesn't matter. I like Pu Shu, too.

515
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,440
My brother and I used to

516
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,670
listen to Pu Shu's songs together.

517
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,270
At that time, he said

518
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,320
he would invite me to

519
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,270
attend Pu Shu's concert after he earned money.

520
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,180
Thank you

521
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,110
for fulfilling our dreams.

522
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,400
It's about to begin. Let's go inside.

523
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,190
Okay.

524
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:14,750
Go.

525
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,190
Bag check.

526
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:20,960
Open the bag. Thank you.

527
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,480
Okay.

528
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,070
You can go.

529
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,230
Get in, please.

530
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:38,440
Pu Shu. Pu Shu. Pu Shu.

531
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,100
♫Everything you have is expired♫

532
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,940

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,980
♫It makes us feel frustrated♫

♫Just so young and proud♫

540

543
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,300
♫we would laugh heartlessly♫

544
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,700
♫Just so young, I waved to you♫
Li Xun told me

545
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,340
♫Let you see me being bad till I get old♫
there was only one thing on his mind.

546
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,040
♫Stay with you till the end of my life♫
He just wanted mom to

547
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,710
♫Stay with you till the end of my life♫
see the sun again,

548
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,780
♫As long as you to drop the cup♫
even if it's only one more day,

549
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,320

550
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,500
♫I will just fight with him♫

551
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,540
♫Just so young♫
All in all,

552
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,070
this is our destiny.

553
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,270
We have to admit it.

554
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,780
♫Just so crazy♫

555
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,360
I won't admit it.

556
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,020
Have you made up your mind?

557
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,670
♫Time passed♫
If this is dyed,

558
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,920
♫Time passed♫
it won't be washed off.

559
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,360
♫It's no longer our world♫
If you can't get into school,

560
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,710
♫It's no longer our world♫
don't blame me.

561
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,230
♫It has changed♫
Even if everyone in the world admits the fact,

562
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,820
♫It has changed♫
I want to be different from them.

563
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,820
♫It makes us feel frustrated♫

564
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,020
♫Sometimes you're afraid♫

565

♫You don't know where the future is♫

566
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,900
Nothing can beat me down.

567
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,260
♫The world is getting crazy♫

568
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,800
I don't give in.

569
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,300
♫It will bury us all sooner or later♫
I only depend on myself.

570
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,780
♫I will just fight with him♫

571
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,180
♫Just so young♫

572
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,260

♫Just so crazy♫

575
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,520
That's nice.

576
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,230
Let's wait for a taxi over there.

577
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,840
Go.

578
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,360
Although Li Xun

579
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,190
never says it,

580
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,190
I thank you for him.

581
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,400
That's how he is.

582
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,440
He keeps everything in his heart

583
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,000
but he always pretends to be indifferent.

584
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,320
Clearly he cares about something,

585
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,230
but he pretends not to care about it.

586
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,230
That's true.

587
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,630
But I can see

588
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,190
he treats you differently.

589
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,000
He asked you to come with me.

590
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,440
He trusts you.

591
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,110
Is that so?

592
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,180
But

593
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,670
you should be careful.

594
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,480
Don't be manipulated by him.

595
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,150
I understand

596
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,710
him deeply.

597
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,110
Sometimes,

598
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,040
you have to make him worried.

599
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,590
In a relationship,

600
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,710
you can't always pay alone.

601
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,270
Got it.

602
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,750
The taxi comes.

603
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,320
Then I'm leaving.

604
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,000
Bye-bye.

605
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,270
Thank you.

606
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,590
See you next time.

607
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,150
When did you come?

608
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,320
Li Lan has just left.

609
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,960
I saw it.

610
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,840
Why didn't you see her off?

611
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,480
She is right

612
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,000
You just care,

613
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,360
but you pretend that you don't care.

614
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,840
You did it on purpose.

615
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,480
You're just afraid of being too sentimental.

616
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,630
So much nonsense.

617
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,110
Li Lan is very happy.

618
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,440
She said thank you.

619
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,000
What else?

620
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,670
And…

621
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,000
You should be careful.

622
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,920
Don't be manipulated by him.

623
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,230
Am I manipulated by you?

624
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,000
Am I so easily manipulated?

625
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,750
She said to make you worried.

626
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,110
I know.

627
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,920
It may not be good if it is delayed.

628
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,070
But I really don't want to have surgery.

629
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,320
I can't afford to take this risk.

630
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,710
Yeah.

631
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,270
The thought of Li Xun sitting in a wheelchair

632
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,630
is strange.

633
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,920
Stop that.

634
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,400
In the future, you have to move every half an hour

635
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,750
and take physical therapy every day.

636
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,270
The school hospital can do it.

637
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,840
I'll register you tomorrow.

638
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:48,880
Whatever.

639
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,670
♫I pass by the world♫
I finally figure it out.

Li Xun

641
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,070

I know this is your project.

645
