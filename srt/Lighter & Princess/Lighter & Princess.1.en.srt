00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,120
I can't see the light.

170
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,280
Get up and take a bath now.

171
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,910
Hurry up.

172
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,160
My mom gave me

173
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,430
3 days to stay here.

174
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,670
You have one day.

175
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,310
I'll wait for you out there.

176
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,430
OK.

177
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,760
Of course. Some said that

178
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,670
giants can monopolize popularity,

179
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,190
but not creativity.

180
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,480
I quite agree with that.

181
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,710
We never exclude competition with new companies.

182
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,910
Of course, to some extent...

183
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,190
Did you see L&P Building on your way here?

184
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,430
It's impressive.

185
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,710
Now L&P is leading the domestic game market.

186
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,240
It monopolizes the industry.

187
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,590
But it has produced several games

188
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,120
by copying foreign games.

189
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,830
It copies everything

190
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,070
that others release.

191
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,190
And its games have higher sales.

192
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,760
You know nothing about these?

193
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,910
I paid no attention to it after going abroad.

194
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,000
Zhu Yun,

195
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,590
L&P means a lot to you.

196
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,360
Forget that man.

197
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,590
But can you forget the company?

198
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,240
It has nothing to do with me.

199
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,360
I want to drink.

200
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,040
OK.

201
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,760
Choose as you like.

202
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,070
When were you released?

203
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,670
You were offer a commutation?

204
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,950
What are your plans for the future?

205
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,480
Now that you're free, lead a good life.

206
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,670
Don't make mistakes again.

207
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,040
The company is doing well,

208
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,160
Mr. Gao.

209
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,190
Come to business.

210
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,360
I have something to do later,

211
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,590
so I won't talk nonsense with you.

212
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,040
You didn't come to me today

213
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
to talk about the past, right?

214
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,310
Cut the euphemisms.

215
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,520
Tell me what you want.

216
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,480
If Li Xun hadn't been imprisoned,

217
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,310
L&P wouldn't have reduced to a copycat.

218
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,550
Reduce?

219
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,430
It's doing well, right?

220
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,710
I remember what you two said back then.

221
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,000
It's the vision of L&P

222
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,350
to improve the cure rate of cancer by 1%.

223
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,630
Listen to it.

224
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,440
What a great ideal!

225
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,960
However, if you're shameless enough,

226
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,240
you can earn both fame and wealth.

227
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,760
As soon as Li Xun is released,

228
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,520
he'll get what he wants.

229
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,790
Perhaps as he said,

230
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,480
that is who he is.

231
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,390
Perhaps he had no choices.

232
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,870
Think about it.

233
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,200
As he was imprisoned,

234
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,440
he could only leave the company to Gao Jianhong.

235
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,040
You three were best friends

236
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,680
in college.

237
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Besides you,

238
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,520
he trusted Jianhong most, right?

239
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,390
You'd better take this chance.

240
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,790
After all, we won't meet

241
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,870
each other often.

242
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,150
I'll ask you one last time.

243
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,390
What do you want to do?

244
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,440
What you will do is your own business.

245
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,110
We've been friends for so many years.

246
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,960
I'll offer buyouts today

247
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,680
to ensure you a decent life.

248
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,200
Tell me how much you want.

249
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,520
I won't bargain.

250
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,240
Gao Jianhong,

251
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,310
listen.

252
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Betrayers

253
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,550
have to pay a price.

254
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,960
How are things now?

255
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,760
OK.

256
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,630
Let's dine first.

257
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,550
Actually, even if you don't tell me,

258
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,110
I can guess it.

259
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,720
Don't blame him for this.

260
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,480
This happens all over the world.

261
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,150
You know what, when I was just released,

262
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,520
even my parents turned a cold shoulder to me.

263
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,200
You're just his former classmate.

264
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,350
So-called friends are bullshit.

265
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,870
The closer he is you, the more likely to betray you.

266
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,960
Why don't you come with me?

267
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,310
After all, we were in the same cell.

268
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,680
I've been waiting for you for a month

269
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,630
since I was released.

270
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,240
I can help you whatever you want.

271
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,520
I trust you, so I'm willing to work with you.

272
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,760
Now we're free.

273
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,680
With our skills,

274
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,310
we can make a fortune easily

275
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,310
using computer and internet.

276
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,280
That isn't what I want.

277
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,760
What do you want?

278
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,350
Come on.

279
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,040
It's not worth sharing his end.

280
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,550
Share his end?

281
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,790
Does her deserve it?

282
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,110
I don't understand.

283
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,240
Even if we go abroad,

284
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,150
you can still revenge, right?

285
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,830
The point is,

286
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,550
you were out of the industry for a long time.

287
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,830
How hard do you want

288
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,720
to try to overthrow such a big company

289
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,110
by proper means?

290
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,590
There is a simpler way.

291
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,920
Why don't you try?

292
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,200
Stop eating. Say something.

293
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,590
I don't need to avoid them.

294
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,310
I'm not used to a simpler way.

295
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,680
I don't care whether it's hard or not.

296
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,680
What matters is to show them

297
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,520
what they have to pay.

298
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,380
♫Do you feel regret?♫

299
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,130
♫Forget him♫

300
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:25,980
♫Wipe away tears and send him away♫

301
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:37,500
♫Like two parallel lines we will not be concerned about each other again♫

302
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,790
♫The ruins of time♫
Li Xun

303
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,960
I'm serious.

304
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,680
♫Turn into a one-person lonely island♫
No matter what you want to do

305
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,720
and what your goal is in the future,

306
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,520
you can count me in.

307
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,280
I'm not joking.

308
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,960
I mean it.

309
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,440
I see.

310
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,870
What's wrong?

311
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,680
Did you leave anything behind?

312
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,240
When were you released?

313
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,150
Yesterday.

314
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,790
Glad that you were released.

315
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,590
It's seems that you did well.

316
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,110
I developed a management system for the jail.

317
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,830
You developed a system to imprison yourself.

318
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,760
Great. Classic you!

319
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,390
Are you used to it now?

320
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,310
Does Zhu Yun know...

321
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,390
She just left.

322
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,440
She may not know.

323
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,240
Aren't you going to meet her?

324
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,920
No.

325
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,590
Today I came to you for something else.

326
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,520
What is it?

327
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,680
Do you remember

328
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,920
what we said at the bar?

329
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,870
Thanks.

330
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,200
Thank you.

331
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,790
We're Light Red.

332
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,440
Will you?

333
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,680
You'll be our boss

334
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,110
if you invest in us.

335
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,590
You'll be a shareholder of our band.

336
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,350
You'll be paid at the agreed rate

337
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,000
when the band has profits.

338
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,390
You came for money?

339
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,720
You came to me for money?

340
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,240
Yes.

341
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,590
Li Xun,

342
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,720
your company with Gao Jianhong

343
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,110
will go public soon.

344
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
You'll appear on the fortune list soon.

345
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,350
You even ask me for a penny.

346
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,760
Everyone wants money.

347
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,390
OK.

348
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,590
I'll give it to you.

349
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,390
I'll double it to make it a round figure.

350
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,390
Is that enough?

351
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,870
I didn't expect that

352
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,350
money is the only connection between us.

353
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,310
Zhu Yun is actually right.

354
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,040
That's what you are.

355
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,040
But it's fine to hide it from her.

356
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,310
Don't disturb her happy life.

357
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Do you remember Tian Xiuzhu?

358
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,440
He came back with Zhu Yun this time.

359
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,200
You don't believe it?

360
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,150
I think they came back

361
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,280
to get married this time.

362
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,920
That's all?

363
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,200
I don't have cash here.

364
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,310
Tell me the figure.

365
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,630
I'll ask someone to transfer it to you tomorrow.

366
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,790
See you.

367
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,350
["Rocky", a work by Tian Xiuzhu]
As a local excellent artist,

368
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,390
["Rocky", a work by Tian Xiuzhu]
Mr. Tian Xiuzhu

369
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,280
gave "Rocky", his most representative works,

370
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,350
to our gallery.

371
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,920
It'll enrich our collection

372
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,000
and reflect to a greater extent

373
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,110
our concern about and deep participation

374
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,760
in various contemporary

375
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,040
art phenomenon in China.

376
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,590
Congratulations.

377
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,350
Thanks. Thanks.

378
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,200
You're young and promising.

379
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,550
Congratulations.

380
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,870
I remember when I returned for

381
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,280
the exhibition six years ago,

382
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,350
you were also attracted by this painting.

383
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,790
I was wondering

384
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,240
what it meant

385
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,390
as you watched

386
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,040
my painting for a long time instead of

387
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
giving a glance to

388
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,960
"The Tempest" of Giorgione.

389
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,070
What does it mean?

390
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,150
You have no interest in art.

391
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,960
That's true.

392
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,040
Rocky.

393
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,110
Rocky.

394
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,720
Come on. You like looking at it, right?

395
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,200
Come on. Have a look.

396
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,870
-Look at it. -No.

397
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,590
Go on.

398
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,000
Go there. Go.

399
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,110
Go on. Go on.

400
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,960
Get closer to it. Come on.

401
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,310
Have you finished?

402
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,110
I can handle it abroad in the future,

403
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,000
so I don't have to return.

404
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,070
Your phone kept ringing in your bag just now.

405
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,520
It's rare.

406
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,870
You got up so early today.

407
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,870
Zhu Yun,

408
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,590
after going abroad this time,

409
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,000
will you come back later?

410
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,310
I won't come back in a short time.

411
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,630
Are you busy today?

412
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,310
No. What's wrong?

413
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,440
Come to help me

414
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,520
with Mr. Tian.

415
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,350
I asked a design company

416
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,760
to design an album cover for me.

417
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,040
I'd like Mr. Tian to check it for me.

418
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,150
If there is no problem, pay them for me.

419
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,480
It's important.

420
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,790
Do it yourself.

421
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,150
As a star,

422
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,480
I won't go to a public place

423
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,070
for such things.

424
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,070
Don't talk nonsense.

425
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,680
I'll write a check and express it to you later.

426
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,480
Can't you transfer it

427
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,830
to him directly?

428
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,830
No.

429
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,550
I need to ask Xiuzhu.

430
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,070
I don't care.

431
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,920
Anyway, you have to help me today.

432
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,040
Then may you give me a favor?

433
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,590
Zhu Yun,

434
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,520
dress nicely.

435
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Don't bring shame on our band.

436
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,630
I see.

Li Xun,

441
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,070

442
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,660
♫It's the intuition of the dream♫
can be called a princess?

It seems a lot.

463
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,350
Why don't you change to do this?

464
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,070
I think it's a good idea.

465
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,280
I'll think about it.

466
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,040
This is for you.

467

Who are you? Where is he?

485
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,440
You're his friend in the band.

486
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,550
Thank you. I came here for money.

487
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,150
This is for Li Xun?

488
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,110
Little boy, tell me.

489
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,440
What's your relation with Li Xun?

490
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,920
I'm not a little boy.

491
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,440
If you don't want to pay, just tell me.

492
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,760
I found those around Li Xun

493
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
are hypocrites.

494
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,590
Where is he?

495
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,390
