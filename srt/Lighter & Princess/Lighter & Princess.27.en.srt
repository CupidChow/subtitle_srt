♫The person I used to be is gone♫

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,980
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,260

[Episode 27]

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,350
Who?

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,390
Nobody.

23
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,350
May I have yellowish brown?

24
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,350
Here you are.

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,040
I think the main pictures can...

26
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,230
Xiuzhu, I think the bottom color

27
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,120
is a bit...

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,160
I'll leave it to you.

29
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,440
Good morning.

30
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,840
Good morning.

31
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:34,670
Here you are.

32
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,190
Thanks.

33
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,440
Where is the painting?

34
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,560
I've saved it.

35
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,320
Thank you.

36
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,160
This is the first draft.

37
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,840
Check if

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,190
you like the idea.

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,070
There are many details to be done.

40
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,190
OK.

41
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:02,750
Thanks.

42
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,440
This is a new toothbrush and towel.

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,510
Go wash up.

44
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,950
I'll make breakfast.

45
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,880
Let me see you out to work

46
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,880
after breakfast.

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,750
No need. I'll go by myself.

48
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,160
Good morning.

49
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,640
Good morning.

50
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,230
Good morning.

51
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,400
Group leader,

52
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,160
I can't make it.

53
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,110
Forget it.

54
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,960
I asked someone else for help.

55
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,200
Who?

56
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,760
Let's have a meeting.

57
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,670
This is the painting.

58
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,600
This is your portrait.

59
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,670
I got it wrong.

60
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,790
This one.

61
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,520
It's amazing.

62
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,910
It,

63
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,350
it creates a kind

64
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,960
of visual effect.

65
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,520
It isn't the common first person perspective.

66
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,640
Group leader,

67
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,670
who is the painter?

68
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,270
Can you introduce him to me?

69
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,110
I want to learn from him.

70
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,670
Wait.

71
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,430
Tell me

72
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,550
how much you pay for it.

73
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,720
It costs nothing.

74
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,550
Ask him to join us now.

75
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,200
Act quickly.

76
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,080
Yes. Ask him to join us.

77
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,230
He can replace me

78
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,200
as art director.

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,640
You're dreaming.

80
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,670
Mr. Tian Xiuzhu drew it.

81
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,470
Mr. Tian.

82
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:53,910
Well,

83
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,040
the auction price of his paintings

84
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,230
is higher than the investment of our project.

85
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,520
How did you get the painting?

86
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,990
Oh, group leader,

87
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,600
I think our company owes you a lot.

88
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,080
Li, Li Xun.

89
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,870
That's great.

90
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,990
Where is Li Xun?

91
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,670
What do you think about

92
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,110
Mr. Tian's painting?

93
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,400
It's awesome.

94
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,910
This is the best painting I've seen.

95
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
What's wrong with him?

96
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,990
He is angry?

97
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:21,990
I don't know.

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,640
Don't pretend.

99
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,230
You're jealous.

100
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,400
Is this poster satisfying?

101
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,840
Our publication has achieved initial success.

102
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,310
Certainly, we're short of promotion fee.

103
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,640
Who told you we're short of money?

104
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,160
It's impossible that my company is short of money.

105
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,230
Zhang Fang, come in.

106
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,760
I'm here.

107
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,910
We have no enough promotion fees?

108
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,670
It's impossible that our big company has no money.

109
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,670
Mr. Dong.

110
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,430
I've promised to put the money

111
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,430
where it matters most.

112
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,200
Look. The amount available

113
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,280
in our account now

114
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,470
is 76,501.82 yuan.

115
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,200
I'll put them all in promotion.

116
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,870
It's more than sufficient.

117
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,550
Did you hear

118
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,350
what he said?

119
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:13,870
Hello.

120
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,870
Hello.

121
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,520
Dong's special car will serve you.

122
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,670
Mr. Dong is right.

123
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,790
How to get more promotion fees?

124
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,230
Come back.

125
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,960
We must make this clear.

126
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,600
OK.

127
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,230
Mr. Dong.

128
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm asking promotion fees for you.

129
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,110
Why are you stopping me?

130
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,110
Mr. Dong is a decent man.

131
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,640
Can you save his face in public?

132
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,430
As the CFO,

133
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,160
I know more about

134
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,080
the company than you do.

135
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,990
The company has been losing money since its establishment.

136
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,790
Now we don't have the amount you need.

137
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,310
You can use my wages.

138
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,990
No kidding.

139
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,790
I'm serious.

140
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,720
Me, too.

141
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,280
First, your wages are much less than the amount we need.

142
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,200
Second,

143
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,600
even if you want to pay with your wages,

144
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,790
Mr. Dong won't agree.

145
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,080
Why?

146
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,080
He said

147
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,550
if a company can only

148
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,160
survive by reducing its employees' wages,

149
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,080
the company shouldn’t exist.

150
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,670
Dong Siyang said that?

151
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,350
That's probably what it means.

152
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,160
Of course, I polished it a little.

153
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:20,990
But the problem is

154
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,640
with a little promotion fee,

155
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,670
how should we do promotion?

156
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,430
This is what I think.

157
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,280
Let's put the money where it matters most.

158
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,640
On the day the game is launched,

159
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
put all money to increase its flow.

160
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,360
Increase its flow?

161
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,790
Yes. To push it to the first place.

162
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,950
It won't help

163
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,590
unless you can do that in batches

164
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,830
and combine other following promotion.

165
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,190
We have no Party A.

166
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,590
I tried my best to find a way,

167
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,640
but he rejected it.

168
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,880
He dampened my spirit.

169
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,360
Come up with a solution.

170
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,310
Hello, Xiuzhu.

171
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,480
I'm coming.

172
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,400
He is great.

173
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,710
He comes to help when needed.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,790
Xiuzhu.

175
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,830
Your charger.

176
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,640
I'm too busy. I just looked for it.

177
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,760
Yes.

178
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,000
It's hard to work with me.

179
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,190
You couldn't sleep well.

180
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,280
By the way,

181
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,040
when did you draw my portrait?

182
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,480
Last night.

183
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,280
I drew it randomly.

184
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,120
You didn't tell me.

185
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,830
I thought you drew just a poster

186
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,000
and showed the portrait accidentally.

187
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
I hope it caused no trouble.

188
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,520
Yes.

189
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,430
Seeing you sleeping last night,

190
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,910
I found suddenly

191
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,040
I didn't draw a portrait for you

192
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,910
as we've known each other for a long time.

193
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,670
But

194
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,880
remember to take

195
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,430
a rest even if you're busy.

196
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,950
Thanks.

197
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,760
What for?

198
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,550
He gave me the idea

199
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,880
of the poster.

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,520
Someone put a poster

201
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,950
on my windshield.

202
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,430
I was inspired,

203
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,480
or I couldn't have finished it quickly.

204
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,000
I wondered why Xiuzhu

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
can understand the soul of the project quickly.

206
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,240
It turned out that someone helped him.

207
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,240
Thank you.

208
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,160
But how do you know where I live

209
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,240
and his plate number?

210
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,760
Did you ring the doorbell yesterday?

211
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,430
Have you finished?

212
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,950
Do you have any ideas about the promotion?

213
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,120
But we're really short of money.

214
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,710
Turn to the painter.

215
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,190
He likes you.

216
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,240
He will do anything for you.

217
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,910
Don't feel embarrassing.

218
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,880
You like all kinds of men.

219
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,240
What do you mean?

220
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,160
It seems that you don't know

221
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,280
how to choose a man.

222
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,430
Li Xun, you'd better shut up.

223
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,400
Who took the initiative?

224
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,240
I'm telling you to shut up.

225
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,790
Are you jealous?

226
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,790
You're still so narcissistic.

227
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,280
He told you he liked you?

228
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,950
Are you imagining that he likes you?

229
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,590
Must you insult me

230
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,550
so cynically?

231
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,590
What if I'm

232
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,400
dating him?

233
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,240
Do I owe you?

234
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,430
I liked you. So what?

235
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,880
Go to ask anyone out there

236
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
if he remembers the one who he liked at 18.

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,760
You loved me as a freshman.

238
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,950
But I didn't like you at all.

239
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,670
You can continue to pretend that you don't care.

240
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,400
I just remember a girl liked sitting next to me,

241
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,190
staring at me for the whole class.

242
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,400
She kept the flow chart I drew in class

243
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,640
randomly like a treasure.

244
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,590
Tell me who she is.

245
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,950
I remember

246
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,950
she ate my food secretly

247
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,400
to get to know me.

248
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,710
She was the last one to leave to look at

249
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,950
my hand-on operation of program classes.

250
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,670
Fearing that I might leave with others,

251
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,120
she spent several hundred yuan

252
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,000
to make hairstyle and confessed to me.

253
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,710
The most ridiculous thing was

254
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
she liked saying something naive.

255
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
Choose me.

256
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,880
I'll never betray you.

257
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,480
You shouldn't say that.

258
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,480
You're going too far.

259
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,480
Do not rake up the past as a man.

260
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,430
Well, you're really harsh today.

261
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,480
She is nice.

262
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,160
Think about it.

263
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,400
Without her help,

264
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,000
you can't find a job

265
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,520
with a criminal record,

266
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,160
let alone reading here.

267
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,070
She did all the work.

268
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,070
Besides,

269
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,120
the GPU she bought

270
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,760
costs a month of wages.

271
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,040
Yes.

272
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,910
I'll hang to whoever

273
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,120
gives me a Titan.

274
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,280
Don't talk nonsense.

275
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,520
Shut up. Go to work.

276
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,710
If you piss her off,

277
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,120
we're toast.

278
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,040
I know she trust me.

279
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,910
She trust me so much that

280
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,400
I can hurt her by multiple times

281
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,280
with just one word

282
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,190
and one action.

283
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,550
So you did it on purpose?

284
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,120
I know well how to hurt her.

285
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,710
Why?

286
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,430
I think she's going back little by little.

287
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,520
I can't give her more hope.

288
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,790
Don't you want to give her

289
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,360
or yourself hope?

290
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,160
You insult the past.

291
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,280
Are you comfortable?

292
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,760
You still can't control yourself.

293
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,950
Just tell me

294
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,590
if you still like her.

295
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,160
No.

What you did make me speechless.

303

Hello.

346
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,000
Li Xun,

347
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,040
Zhu Yun has an accident.

348
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,040
Where are you now?

349
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,240
Excuse me.

350
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,440
Where is Ward 316?

351
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,280
Turn right to the second room.

352
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,110
This way?

353
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,280
This is what you prescribed for her.

354
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,790
You should ask

355
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,350
how long she's been taking these pills.

356
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,070
Last night, Zhu Yun drank a lot

357
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,630
and took more pills,

358
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,870
causing hypotension and syncope.

359
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Luckily, she doesn't need to have her stomach pumped.

These drugs

but she has been taking them for three years.

363
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,200
You probably don't know

364
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,760
how she lived abroad.

365
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,040
When she was abroad,

366
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,790
she kept herself busy.

367
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,830
She wanted to take a rest,

368
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,040
but she didn't dare to.

369
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,830
Once

370
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,550
when she went to me for something,

371
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,200
I took her out for a walk.

372
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,280
She stood on the beach.

373
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,680
I went to buy her pancakes.

374

When I coming back,

375
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,040
she stood there rigidly.

376
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,960
Do you know

377
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,280
what I saw

378
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,150
in her eyes at that moment?

379
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,870
Relief.

380
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,070
I won't let you hurt her again.

381

382

thank you for taking care of her.

383
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,070
Thank me?

384
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,790
How would you like to thank me?

By comparison, Invincible General is for a niche market.

439
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,310
It has popularity, but no profit.

440
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,720
They developed content diligently.

441
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,680
Especially the plot is ingeniously designed,

442
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,280
which add to the immersion.

443
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,830
Obviously, they make a careful study of the plot.

444
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,790
But it's also a double-edged sword.

445
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,680
The plot is like an invisible threshold,

446
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,920
blocking casual players who spend

447
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,110
little time on games.

448
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,110
So

449
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,200
their game is a little hard to play.

450
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,070
Yes. Clearly ours is more playable

451
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,680
with more delicate pictures,

452
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,720
so it'll be known outside fixed circle.

453
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,000
When will it be launched?

454
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,240
The first day of next month at the earliest.

455
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,480
That's too late.

456
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,830
Players will be attracted by Invincible General.

457
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,150
We've tried our best.

458
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,550
Look around.

459
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,070
Everyone is working overtime to catch up.

460
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,040
After all, we started from scratch.

461
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,200
I don't care.

462
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,870
I'll transfer Group 6 and 7 to you.

463
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,480
They can put their work aside.

464
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,200
The game must be launched

465
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,760
on the 20th of this month.

466
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,390
Gao,

467
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,790
Group 6 and 7 will

468
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,040
finish their project soon.

469
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,390
That game

470
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,520
is more promising than Rivalry among Seven Powers.

471
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,350
You shouldn't delay the company's normal business

472
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
and disrupt all the company's plans

473
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,520
to fight with Li Xun.

474
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,150
Think about it.

475
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,630
Is it worth keeping

476
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,350
an eye on Li Xun?

477
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,070
Is it worth spending so much money

478
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,310
and manpower on him?

479
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,920
Do I need your permission

480
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,310
to do anything now?

481
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,240
No.

482
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,590
I didn’t mean that, Gao.

483
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,830
Listen.

484
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,240
What is the biggest goal of our company now?

485
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,480
Get the company listed, right?

486
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,830
When we achieve the goal,

487
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,150
we won't be afraid of Li Xun.

488
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,110
He'll never catch up.

489
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,310
So I think

490
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,110
now we just need

491
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,310
to contain him.

492
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,630
I can call the game website immediately

493
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,720
to take all the games of their company

494
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
off the shelves.

495
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,390
Don't forget...

496
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,040
Invincible General will be launched on the 18th.

497
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,830
Do as I say.

498
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,790
No. Gao...

499
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,870
You can get off work.

500
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,630
Let's go.

501
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,240
Tell me what you want to eat later.

502
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,790
I like light meals.

503
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,390
Well,

504
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,110
I'll make steamed perch first.

505
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,200
OK.

506
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,150
Then

507
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
stir-fried cabbage.

508
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,200
Stir-fried cabbage.

509
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,590
Hello.

510
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,480
Mr. Lin.

511
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,000
It's me.

512
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,620
[Nanhu University]

513
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,280
How long have you been waiting?

514
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,110
Half a day.

515
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,440
Just 10 minutes.

516
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,390
Can't we just have

517
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,760
an ordinary talk?

518
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,280
Go.

519
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,760
You even thought of Ms. Zhao.

520
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,590
I haven't contacted Mr. Lin since graduation,

521
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,480
so I didn't know that she has been

522
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,630
a popular history joker on Weibo.

523
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,760
She is a professor of the Department of History.

524
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,150
Few people know that

525
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,440
she and Mr. Lin are a couple.

526
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,480
She is popular on Weibo.

527
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,960
She often gives live lectures.

528
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,390
Her fans are

529
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,000
young people interested in history.

530
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,390
In fact, they're the target users of Invincible General.

531
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,920
It can make our life easier

532
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,870
with her help.

533
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,150
I just wonder

534
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,480
if Mr. Lin was involved

535
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,630
in such a big fuss we made back then.

536
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,590
Don't worry.

537
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,150
At least he still would like to see us.

538
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,200
He liked you best, right?

539
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,760
You worked so hard

540
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,110
as the class rep back then.

541
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,350
Everyone knew that he liked you best.

542
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,200
Mr. Lin.

543
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,520
Long time no see.

544
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,150
Come in.

545
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,070
Well.

546
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,440
Come on.

547
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,830
Hurry up.

548
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,750
Hurry up.

549
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,750
No need to change shoes.

550
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,320
Just take a seat.

551
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,630
You're all maturer.

552
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,590
Mister,

553
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,920
you look extraordinarily unchanged.

554
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,230
I'm getting older.

555
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,190
Come here. Let's have breakfast.

556
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,270
Come on.

557
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,110
-Thanks, Mrs. Zhao. -Well, sit down.

558
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,070
-Thank you. -Never mind.

559
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,750
Sit down.

560
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,440
Since you called us

561
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,000
that day,

562
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,480
Mr. Lin has been so happy.

563
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,520
If you don't come.

564
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,150
I have to send him to hospital.

565
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,150
Take a seat.

566
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,070
Do you like the porridge?

567
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,400
Yes.

568
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,480
It tastes better than

569
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,590
that in prison.

570
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,000
You're thinner than before.

571
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,880
Yes.

572
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,840
Food in the prison was good actually.

573
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,840
There was porridge in the morning and evening.

574
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,590
Two dishes and one soup at noon. Both meat and vegetable.

575
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,920
At first, I thought it was good.

576
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,400
But I couldn't get used to it

577
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,880
after a long time,

578
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,670
just like dinning in the canteen of our school.

579
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,110
In fact, I found

580
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,800
no difference between school and prison.

581
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,110
You, you compare Nanhu University

582
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,360
to a prison.

583
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,320
What are we as teachers?

584
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,360
Are we prison guards?

585
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,270
You're my cellmate.

586
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,800
Cellmate.

587
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,320
Enjoy it.

588
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,880
Why don't you eat porridge?

589
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,040
I...

590
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,110
What's wrong?

591
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:11,880
Well.

592
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,670
I need your help.

593
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,360
Go ahead.

594
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,150
Recently we developed

595
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,360
a history game.

596
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,920
We'd like Mrs. Lin to give some advice.

597
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,360
No problem.

598
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,550
Dear,

599
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,750
can you?

600
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:28,750
No.

601
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,400
No problem.

602
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,440
Have a talk with Li Xun.

603
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,710
Let’s talk inside, Zhu Yun.

604
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,230
OK.

605
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,960
Mr. Lin,

606
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
where did you hide your private money?

607
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,960
You little brat.

608
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,550
But

609
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,670
your company is small.

610
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,670
That'll be more interesting.

611
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,800
You're as creative

612
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,270
as ever.

613
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,880
But your career is a big deal.

614
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,590
Well,

615
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,480
I know some big companies,

616
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,110
research institutes

617
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,920
and institutions.

618
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,960
Don't bother.

619
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,400
It's nice to work in this company.

620
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,230
Then tell me

621
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,360
if you colleagues

622
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,270
are nice to you.

623
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,400
They are true men.

624
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,400
I like them very much.

625
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,520
Happy to hear that.

626
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,750
Li Xun,

627
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,670
it'll be hard for you.

628
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,070
I'll go step by step.

629
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,960
You're stubborn.

630
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,710
But keep my words

631
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,150
in mind.

632
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,480
No matter what difficulties you may encounter in the future,

633
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,400
follow the right path.

634
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,670
Don't be capricious.

635
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,040
Don't spoil yourself again.

636
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,190
OK.

637
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,550
Don't worry.

638
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,880
Zhu Yun,

639
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,230
this game is set in the Warring States Period.

640
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,800
Yes.

641
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,400
Give me more details.

642
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,670
The opening chapter is set in 239 BC.

643
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,230
The King of Qin started officially to reign that year?

644
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,070
Yes.

645
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,190
Why did you choose that year?

646
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,000
The first important battle we set in the game

647
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,750
is the king's fight against Lao Ai's rebels.

648
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,840
After the battle,

649
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,150
the king completely

650
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,550
exiled his eyesore, Lü Buwei

651
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,550
and began to annex the Six Kingdoms.

652
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,710
We think this is a good start.

653
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,710
Mrs. Lin is really a master.

654
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,960
What she said goes straight to the heart of the matter.

655
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,230
How I wish that we can often meet her!

656
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,960
She'll be the consultant of our project.

657
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,000
If you have any questions, just ask her.

658
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,480
When did you talk

659
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,110
about the further cooperation with her?

660
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
She'll prepare advertorial

661
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,040
for the game these two days.

662
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,440
We can just send it out

663
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
according to the update of game.

664
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,710
Just label the game

665
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,360
as the most serious

666
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,440
history game.

667
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,360
But working as our game consultant

668
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,750
won't damage her scholar image?

669
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,360
I don't know.

670
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,040
You don't worry at all?

671
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,550
Now that you're worried about her fame,

672
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,550
why did you come here?

673
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,270
Don't worry. She wants

674
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,960
to help us and work with us.

675
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,880
Get on the car.

676
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:31,800
No need.

677
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,270
I'll go by myself.

678
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,710
Be careful.

679
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,360
Zhu Yun,

680
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,110
I'm sorry.

681
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,590
I'm not seriously ill.

682
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,230
No need to say that.

683
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,190
I was born like that.

684
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,750
I tend to compete with myself.

685
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,800
Drugs can relieve my anxiety.

686
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Don't take it to your heart.

687
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,840
I should say sorry

688
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,670
for what happened before.

689
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,400
You said you were

690
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,150
happy abroad last time,

691
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,550
and I believed it.

692
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,520
I didn't think about

693
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,000
how you spent your time these years.

694
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,360
You even feel guilty.

695
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,150
You're much braver than me.

696
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,550
I thought a lot

697
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,590
when I was in hospital.

698
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,320
I wondered why I stayed here.

699
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,270
I dared not think about this before.

700
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,150
I also resisted reminding myself

701
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,320
how important you were to me.

702
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,150
You don't regret working

703
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,230
in such a small company with me?

704
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,320
No.

705
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Don't crow over it.

706
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,150
I don't work here for you.

707
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,150
Actually, I like Flying.

708
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,800
For example, Xiaojian

709
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,110
isn't good at drawing,

710
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,000
but he is losing his hair

711
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,750
for drawing the concept poster.

712
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,880
And Zhao Teng.

713
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,270
When I first

714
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,840
showed him my game plan,

715
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,590
he stared at me fiercely.

716
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,800
Later when we got the beginning battle done,

717
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,070
his eyes looked excited in an instant.

718
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,590
Flying is a small company,

719
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,840
but each of us has power.

720
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,190
What is insignificant

721
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,880
can surprise us

722
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,750
with daily progress.

723
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,000
Li Xun,

724
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,000
Gao Jianhong is right.

725
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,070
You can't climb a mountain alone.

726
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,670
Don't lower your head.

727
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,630
I won't allow it.

728
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,800
But you also need us.

729
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,960
I noticed that

730
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,480
you've read just about

731
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,000
one sixth of the books I gave you.

732
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,400
You're much slower

733
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,070
than before.

734
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,320
Finally, you got the chance to lead me.

735
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,190
Yes.

736
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,590
I've been expecting this day for many years.

737
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,040
A common colleague.

738
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,520
A common colleague.

739
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,520
See you.

740
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,150
I envy him.

741
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,040
He never looks back.

742
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,440
He has everything I once lacked,

743
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,960
confidence,

744
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,400
courage,

745
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,550
strength

746
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,800
and freedom.

747
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,230
He always has a firm direction.

748
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,520
He'll never doubt himself.

749
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,320
Perhaps

750
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
he is special to me.

751
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,590
Maybe there is such a person

752
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,110
in our life.

753
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,320
He's scarred,

754
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,110
but we admire him.

755
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,630
He repents,

756
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,400
but it's still worth pursuing him.

757
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,960
I'll always stop him from upswing.

758
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,440
I want him to know that L&P is dominating the current game market.

759
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,840
Li Xun, don't stop me.

760
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,960
I don't want to be imprisoned again.

761
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,480
Calm down.

762
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,840
How many years he will be sentenced for

763
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,110
invading computer systems illegally?

764
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,190
Li Xun,

765
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,070
look at those around you.

766
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,000
Why don't you want to leave?

767
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,220
♫That breaks through the boundary♫
