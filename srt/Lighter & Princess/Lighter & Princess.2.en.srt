♫Everything is different when we watch the sky from the sea bottom♫

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,820
♫The person I used to be is gone♫

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,980
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

5

♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,260

♫I see a clear direction♫

[Episode 2]

21
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,520
Where is Li Xun?

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Who are you?

23
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,830
Let go.

24
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,230
I'll wait for you there.

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,790
Be careful.

26
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,720
She's strong.

27
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,560
When did you get out?

28
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,280
What's your next plan?

29
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,190
It has nothing to do with you.

30
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,320
Where do you live?

31
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,350
Did you come back to get married?

32
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,040
You two are a perfect match.

33
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,190
Do you know what you are saying?

34
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,190
Zhu Yun,

35
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
what I have gone through

36
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,120
has nothing to do with you.

37
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,350
And you don't need to feel sorry.

38
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,120
I made it clear three years ago.

39
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,310
Who you're gonna be with

40
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,110
has nothing to do with me.

41
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,040
Do you understand?

42
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,520
Li Xun,

43
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,280
what did I do?

44
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,470
Why are you treating me like this?

45
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,640
I just thought you were heartless before.

46
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,600
Now I finally realize that

47
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,080
you are really a jerk.

48
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,870
You think too much.

49
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,110
Time is precious for everyone.

50
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,760
I'm going.

51
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,280
Li Xun,

52
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,760
you haven't changed at all.

53
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,790
I'm sorry, big man.

54
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,670
Bye.

55
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,400
Li Xun,

56
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,470
is the girl

57
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,470
the one you mentioned

58
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,400
in jail?

59
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,470
She's beautiful but too fierce.

60
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,910
Did she ever practice taekwondo?

61
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,080
Why don't you talk?

62
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,790
Are you afraid... Shut up.

63
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,870
Okay.

64
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,080
Women are unreliable.

65
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,960
Zhu Yun,

66
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,870
where do you want to go in a hurry?

67
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,760
Aren't we going back to the hotel?

68
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,870
But I have to tell you that it's about 10 km away.

69
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,470
How about this?

70
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,790
It's hard to walk with your heels on.

71
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,640
Let's call a taxi to go back to the hotel.

72
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,350
If you really want to take a walk,

73
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,790
change your shoes and I'll go with you.

74
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,670
Okay.

75
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,350
That female star is generous.

76
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,760
Dollar.

77
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,200
A surprise.

78
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,470
I'm sorry, big man.

79
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,720
You should change your bad habit,

80
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,200
or you'll be looked down upon.

81
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,960
Return the purse.

82
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,640
Okay.

83
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,520
What's this?

84
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,550
How strange. She even puts her keys in her purse.

85
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,550
Zhu Yun,

86
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,070
I saw how you reacted when you saw him yesterday.

87
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,480
I can't pretend that

88
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,550
I don't know anything.

89
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,480
He's still in your heart.

90
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,430
No.

91
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,710
I don't want to compare with him.

92
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,280
You two are too different.

93
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,670
You are better than him.

94
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,910
In fact,

95
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,910
he was a jerk for most of the time.

96
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,000
It has been three years.

97
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,240
When I went abroad,

98
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,710
I couldn't even hear his name.

99
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,240
I felt sad at the thought of him.

100
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,880
So I studied as hard as I could,

101
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,880
trying to do all kinds of things so that I couldn't stop.

102
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,000
I thought when I used up my energy,

103
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,640
I wouldn't feel sad.

104
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,710
But gradually,

105
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,910
I found that I was no longer constantly crying

106
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,000
or was unable to fall asleep the whole night.

107
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,520
In fact, I didn't do

108
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,670
anything special.

109
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,480
I was just living an ordinary life.

110
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,160
Do you still hate him?

111
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,480
This house is newly decorated.

112
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,670
It has good lighting, right?

113
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay. We'll rent this house.

114
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,950
Really?

115
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,310
Let's sign a contract.

116
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,310
Let's make it a three-month lease.

117
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,070
What do you do?

118
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,520
It has nothing to do with you.

119
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,400
I need to know

120
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,160
who rent my house.

121
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,710
Our job is related to computer.

122
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,590
We're programmers.

123
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,710
Programmer?

124
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,280
You don't look like a programmer.

125
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,280
What do you think we do?

126
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,520
I just can't rent my house

127
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,430
to someone with unclear identity.

128
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,040
Let's go.

129
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,790
We have a clear identity.

130
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,310
What...

131
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,120
How strange they are.

132
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,790
What do you want to do?

133
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,310
Aren't you curious what we do?

134
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,400
He's a murderer,

135
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,830
and I split the body for him.

136
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,880
We were just released from prison.

137
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,710
What else do you want to know?

138
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,360
Do you know what kind of person you introduced to me?

139
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,640
They're strange persons.

140
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,790
I'm telling you,

141
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,710
do not introduce such persons to me again.

142
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,590
It's the 7th one.

143
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,910
Like I said,

144
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,070
they are the same.

145
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,670
When I was just released from prison,

146
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,430
I also wanted to live a normal life.

147
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,880
But, as you saw,

148
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
we're abandoned by the society

149
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,480
as we were put in jail.

150
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,710
No one sees us as a normal person.

151
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,590
How about this?

152
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,670
You go abroad with me.

153
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,710
The weather is good abroad,

154
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,830
and no one knows us.

155
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,520
And we won't be treated unfairly there.

156
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,760
You're not over your ex-girlfriend, are you?

157
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,640
Hou Ning,

158
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,550
you can leave.

159
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,360
But as long as you work with me,

160
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,710
I can let you be a dignified person.

161
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,160
Make a choice.

162
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,880
Don't change the subject.

163
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,520
Stop.

164
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,360
All kinds of people are living in the neighborhood.

165
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,520
Mind your own business and don't make trouble.

166
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,400
Pay the rent on the 20th day every month.

167
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,790
You have the card number.

168
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,670
Remember to pay the rent on time.

169
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,640
Here is the key.

170
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,830
I'm going.

171

340
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,280
He is so...

341
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,520
Arrogant.

342
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,280
To be honest,

343
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,200
I don't know whether it's our good luck or bad luck

344
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,920
to have such a strange classmate.

345
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,680
You're just an acting monitor.

346
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,960
Don't worry so much.

347
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,150
After the class leadership election tomorrow,

348
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,830
I will become the formal monitor.

349
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,550
I guess no one is interested in being the monitor

350
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,390
besides you.

351
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,680
It's not an interest.

352
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,200
It's the glorious mission

353
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,960
to serve the whole class devotedly.

354
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,720
I learned it.

355
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,870
What?

356
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,310
Only you can describe empleomania

357
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,110
as a great honor.

358
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,940
[Dormitory No. 3]

359
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,070
Is Ren Di doing music again?

360
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,390
I guess so.

361
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,590
She

362
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,000
didn't go to take her textbooks,

363
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,830
and we have to take them back for her.

364
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,960
We're roommates.

365
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,040
It's okay.

366
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,870
I feel so tired with my arms and legs.

367
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,150
I love air conditioning.

368
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,870
Ren Di,

369
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,760
here are your textbooks.

370
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,000
Thank you.

371
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,630
What do we eat for dinner?

372
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,720
Everything is fine.

373
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,520
Be specific.

374
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,200
Everything is the most difficult.

375
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,000
Do you need to turn to the admission handbook for this?

376
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,760
Take a rest, curve wrecker.

377
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,550
The fun of college lies in exploration.

378
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,680
How about we start from the snack street at the back gate?

379
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,280
We'd better eat in the canteen.

380
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,760
The handbook says

381
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,920
canteen is important experience of college life.

382
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,960
Broccoli, tenderloin and drumstick.

383
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:49,720
Here you are.

384
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,070
Where's your food?

385
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,310
I ordered a portion of malatang.

386
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,070
More than 20 persons are waiting in line before me.

387
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,110
I can't get my food for the moment.

388
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,480
Where do we sit?

389
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,870
There are seats over there.

390
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,960
Go, go, go. Quick, quick, quick.

391
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,960
I swear that

392
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,790
I only played games

393
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,200
with my good friends yesterday.

394
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,280
What?

395
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,830
Wait.

396
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,760
You played games for a whole night?

397
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,630
Don't go.

398
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,520
Don't you believe me?

399
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,760
I can call them all here.

400
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,790
I don't believe you.

401
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,240
I...

402
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,000
Wait.

403
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,870
Come on. Sit here. Sit here.

404
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,520
How did you know they were leaving?

405
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,310
When I came in the canteen,

406
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,920
I noticed that they were quarreling.

407
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,070
So, we need to learn to

408
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,520
observe life.

409
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,870
You are right.

410
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,590
Would you like some soup? I'm going to get a bowl of it.

411
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,590
I have soup with malatang.

412
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,630
Hello, Miss Zhang.

413
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,920
I'm not busy. What's the matter?

414
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,350
Okay. Okay, okay.

415
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:20,920
Okay.

416
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,440
Hey,

417
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,520
this seat is taken.

418
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,350
This seat is taken by Fang Shumiao.

419
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,070
Fang Shumiao,

420
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,920
the acting monitor of our class. Do you know?

421
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,310
How does it taste?

422
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,870
Not bad.

423
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,680
If you want to sit here,

424
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,000
I can take the seat for you.

425
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,590
Go on.

426
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,920
Well, you can sit there.

427
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,760
Li Xun?

428
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,110
Zhu Yun,

429
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,790
whose meal is this?

430
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,110
Mine.

431
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,520
Thinking it's too cold here,

432
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,550
I put your meal over there.

433
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,440
I'm sorry.

434
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,280
We picked the same dishes.

435
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,760
How about you have mine?

436
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,760
Or do you want to have something else? My treat.

437
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,590
I just went out to answer a phone call.

438
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,960
I didn't expect you would make such a mistake.

439
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,870
Stop laughing.

440
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,110
I'm not laughing.

441
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,590
I mean what I say. The water is for you.

442
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,390
Be slow. Don't get choked.

443
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,520
He's really unreasonable.

444
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,920
We're classmates, and it's normal that

445
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,150
we treat each other to a meal.

446
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,720
Or I can give the meal expense back to him.

447
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,630
Fang Shumiao!

448
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,150
Li Xun. Li Xun.

449
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,550
It's me, Gao Jianhong.

450
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,520
They call me Gao.

451
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,000
I am also in Applied Technology Class 1.

452
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,440
You and I live next door.

453
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,630
I'm living in Room 205.

454
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,680
Li Xun,

455
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,350
student numbers of our school

456
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,070
are based on our admission scores.

457
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,830
I'm No. 2, and you're No. 1.

458
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,520
I was ranked sixth in the province.

459
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,720
What about you?

460
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,240
Li Xun?

461
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,520
Let's chat.

462
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,720
Li Xun?

463
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,520
Well, you go on showering.

464
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,550
I'll wait for you to go back together.

465
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,590
I'll wait for you.

466
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,040
Take a shower.

467
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,110
It took you so long.

468
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,280
I see that you like programming. I like it too.

469
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,870
I liked playing computer when I was in junior high school.

470
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,680
I joined the school's coding society when I was in high school.

471
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,390
We can communicate in the future.

472
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,920
You don't seem to talk much.

473
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,390
Programming develops so fast now.

474
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,150
JAVA,

475
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:58,920
PHP

476
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,520
are complicated.

477
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,150
In my opinion, no matter how good a person is,

478
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,680
it's hard for him to master so many languages.

479
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,390
So I decide to

480
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,000
set up a programming interest group

481
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,720
for mutual learning and exchange

482
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,310
to learn from other's strong points to make up our deficiencies and make progress together.

483
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,790
Are you interested in it?

484
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,790
No.

485
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,760
Li Xun,

486
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,390
please give us a chance

487
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,760
to learn from you.

488
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,960
To learn from other's strong points to make up our deficiencies is the most efficient way to learn.

489
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,720
Do I

490
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,550
have deficiencies?

491
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,680
Hello?

492
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,440
In hospital?

493
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,480
So serious?

494
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,920
Wait. I'll be right there.

495
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,760
Li Xun,

496
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,550
my friend's parents come here.

497
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,200
He asked me to book a room

498
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,240
in the hotel at the south gate of our school.

499
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,200
Room 312.

500
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,150
I'll ask him to take the room card from you later.

501
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,680
My good friend suffers acute gastroenteritis.

502
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,110
I need to see him in the hospital.

503
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,960
I'm giving the room card to you.

504
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,550
Remember to give it to him.

505
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,280
Gao Jianhong.

506
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,520
Li Xun.

507
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,070
It's for you. Money.

508
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,310
It's you?

509
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,830
Room 312 at the south gate.

510
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,440
What's this?

511
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,110
Look at it.

512
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,480
Did he give you the room card?

513
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,920
Is Li Xun so active?

514
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,310
You're good, Zhu Yun.

515
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,040
What a strange attitude you have!

516
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,240
Yes, you need to show your attitude.

517
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,440
He dated you directly.

518
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,550
That's indecent.

519
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,310
Come on. We're adults.

520
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,000
It's acceptable.

521
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,480
What else did he say to you?

522
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,110
He only said Room 312.

523
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,830
Do you think the New Student Handbook will tell you

524
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,520
everything about your life?

525
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,920
I'm checking the map.

526
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:12,000
What to do when asked out by a boy at the start of school?

527
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,280
There is indeed a hotel outside our school.

528
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,200
You are exposed.

529
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,870
You want to go, right?

530
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,070
Take it, take it, take it.

531
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:20,830
Take it away.

532
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,720
It doesn't matter.

533
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,280
It's your trophy.

534
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,200
Yeah.

535
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,000
In our grade...

536
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,630
No,

537
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,440
among all freshmen,

538
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,550
you're the first one.

539
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,630
Show me your hand.

540
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,590
What?

541
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,070
Right hand.

542
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,550
I need to see your love line.

543
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,070
I'm going to tattoo one.

544
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,760
You are so dirty.

545
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,630
Wu Mengxing.

546
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,400
You know my name.

547
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,110
From Jiangxi.

548
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,360
Yes.

549
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,590
My hometown is Baihugou Village, Yanglin Town,

550
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,230
Taihe County, Ji'an City.

551
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,360
And I have a sister.

552
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,190
Okay. I know you.

553
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,270
I don't like to be disturbed

554
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
when I'm writing codes.

555
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,110
Sorry.

556
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,190
Well...

557
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,880
Anything else?

558
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,920
Zhu Yun in our class asked me to give this to you.

559
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,360
And she has a message.

560
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,920
Please be self-dignified.

561
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,750
Why didn't you urge me?

562
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,360
Come on.

563
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,920
You are too picky

564
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,230
about your dress.

565
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,630
Are you going to take part in the class leadership election

566
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,360
or to have a blind date?

567
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,920
We're almost 10 minutes late.

568
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,840
If I can't be elected as the monitor because I'm late,

569
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,190
all my previous efforts will be in vain.

570
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,320
You will become the monitor.

571
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,590
Fang Shumiao,

572
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,190
you are even late for the class leadership election.

573
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,880
Don't you want to be the monitor?

574
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
I'm sorry, Miss Zhang.

575
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,440
She overslept from her nap.

576
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,320
Take a seat.

577
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,920
Sit here.

578
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,590
Move.

579
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,440
What?

580
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,880
Move.

581
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,630
Sit down.

582
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,710
Sit down.

583
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,070
Miss Zhang is angry.

584
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,590
Now the meeting begins.

585
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,920
The main purpose of the meeting today

586
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,320
is the class leadership election.

587
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,550
But before the election,

588
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,400
I'd like to introduce a student to you.

589
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,880
He didn't attend the military training because he was ill.

590
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,110
Li Xun,

591
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,230
introduce yourself.

592
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,920
Li Xun?

593
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,670
My name is Li Xun.

594
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,040
I'm the first place in this year's college entrance examination.

595
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,320
You may not know.

596
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,440
Li Xun is the top scorer of science

597
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,840
of our province.

598
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,880
It's him.

599
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,070
All examinees in the province

600
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,440
♫I don't know how you've been♫
lost to this eccentric guy.

601
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,630
♫I don't know how you've been♫
He chooses this major

602
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,440
and it fully shows that

603
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,440
♫You don't know how I've been♫
this major

604
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,590
♫Nothing has changed♫
has great industry prospects.

605
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,800
♫Nothing has changed♫

606
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,880
♫Have you ever changed?♫
can cherish this opportunity

607
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,440
♫Have you ever changed?♫
and study hard

608
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,360
to become

609
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,920
people who are useful to society.

610
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,110
Okay.

611
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,400
Next, let's start the class leadership election.

612
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,670
Fang Shumiao. Fang Shumiao.

613
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,920
Wang Ting.

614
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,150
Fang Shumiao,

615
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,190
Congratulations to Fang Shumiao.

616
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,320
She has officially become

617
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,670
the monitor of Applied Technology Class 1.

618
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,670
Trust me, Miss Zhang

619
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,270
and my dear classmates.

620
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,040
I will work harder

621
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,230
to complete the tasks from the department

622
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,270
and provide good services for you all.

623
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,230
Okay. Okay, okay.

624
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,110
Fang Shumiao,

625
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,070
change the blackboard.

626
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,550
Okay.

627
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,360
Next,

628
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,840
we'll select the commissary in charge of studies.

629
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,110
If cadre group of a class is compared to

630
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,400
the four characters in the Journey to the West,

631
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,070
the monitor is Tang Sanzang

632
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,710
the commissary in charge of studies is Sun Wukong,

633
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,880
and student in charge of general affairs is Monk Sha.

634
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,320
Which class cadre is Zhu Bajie?

635
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,440
Miss Zhang asked you to introduce yourself.

636
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,190
Introduce yourself.

637
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,360
Zhu Bajie...

638
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,150
Zhu Yun. My name is Zhu Yun.

639
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,670
I graduated from Linyang No. 1 High School.

640
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,230
Zhu Yun,

641
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,960
are you recommending yourself?

642
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,670
Yes.

643
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,190
You can't be late tomorrow.

644
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,550
So strict.

645
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,320
Of course.

646
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,550
Or my credits will be deducted.

647
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,440
The top scorer in our class

648
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,440
is unique even in the whole country.

649
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,630
Anyway, I've never heard that

650
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,360
a top scorer who has golden hair.

651
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,800
And he seems to be hard to get along.

652
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,880
It's not a big deal.

653
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,400
Zhu Bajie is surnamed Zhu.

654
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,590
Your surname is Zhu as well.

655
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,040
Stop looking.

656
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,440
If you keep looking at him, he'll go into your dream.

657
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,440
If so, that will be a nightmare.

658
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:24,840
Go.

659
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,590
Morning. Morning.

660
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,920
Two persons are absent.

661
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,670
Ren Di didn't come back last night.

662
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,630
The school just began.

663
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,070
She really doesn't obey rules.

664
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,880
Where's Li Xun?

665
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,440
Why doesn't he come?

666
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,360
He left right after he got up this morning.

667
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,920
I thought he was going to the class.

668
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,360
It's five minutes to seven.

669
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,750
Why haven't they come?

670
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,110
By my understanding,

671
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,150
Li Xun won't

672
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,920
attend the morning self-study.

673
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
He must attend it.

674
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,630
Members from the student union will come to call the roll later.

675
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,070
Our class points will be deducted for absence from morning self-study.

676
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,920
I need to call him.

677
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
No answer.

678
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,440
He doesn't reply to me on WeChat .

679
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,670
It's normal.

680
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,880
I sent him a lot of messages,

681
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,070
and he never replied.

682
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,400
He didn't reply to me either.

683
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,190
I need to make every possible effort.

684
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,920
He replied!

685
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,440
What did he say?

686
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,020
[Li Xun
Fang Shumiao: It's almost seven o'clock. Li Xun, where are you?
Li Xun: It's none of your business.]
It's none of your business.

687
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,190
How can he be so rude?

688
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,150
It's good enough.

689
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,320
He sent a reply to you.

690
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,190
Are you going to send another message?

691
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,070
[Li Xun
Fang Shumiao: It's almost seven o'clock. Li Xun, where are you?
Li Xun: It's none of your business.]
I think he needs to be saved.

692
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,360
Our class points will be deducted for absence from morning self-study.

693
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,070
Come to the class.

694
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,670
It's none of my business.

695
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,440
It's none of my business.

696
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,920
It's none of your business. It's none of my business.

697
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,750
Li Xun sounds like a philosopher

698
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,270
when he says these two words.

699
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,940
[Fang Shumiao: Li Xun, hope you have a sense of collective honor.
You have been blacklisted!]
He even black...

700
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,110
No way. Someone!

701
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:23,920
Give me your phone.

702
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,840
He doesn't add me on WeChat.

703
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,590
Gao.

704
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,920
Li Xun doesn't reply to Gao either.

705
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,270
He doesn't reply to anyone of us.

706
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,880
He's not a normal person.

707
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,230
Is he coming to the class for morning self-study or not?

708
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,440
I think it's a bit too late.

709
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,440
Hello, seniors.

710
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,920
Is everyone here?

711
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
I'm going to start the roll call.

712
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,840
Hope you freshmen will observe the school rules

713
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,270
and protect the class collective honor.

714
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,590
Li Xun.

715
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,520
Li Xun is No. 1, and Ren Di is No. 2.

716
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,440
What are you doing?

717
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,590
Choose one.

718
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,880
These two persons don't attend morning self-study.

719
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,040
You and I will each be responsible for

720
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,840
one of them.

721
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,960
Why should I make a choice? I'm not the monitor.

722
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,000
I don't need to be responsible.

723
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,520
It's an urgent task.

724
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,590
I'll treat you to Adao Barbecue.

725
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,750
Or Chun Wei Zhai,

726
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,070
though it's expensive.

727
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,190
No.

728
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,230
Do you want to have Tang Gong?

729
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,440
Since you don't make a choice, I'll do it.

730
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,360
I choose the left one.

731
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,630
It's Ren Di.

732
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,590
I'll be responsible for urging Ren Di to attend morning self-study.

733
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,710
You'll be responsible for urging Li Xun to attend morning self-study.

734
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,520
Seniors said that

735
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,230
double points will be deducted for absence in the future.

736
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,270
Four points a day.

737
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,480
It's none of my business.

738
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,840
Don't you want to contact Li Xun more

739
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,000
to erase the misunderstanding between you?

740
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,800
It's none of your business.

741
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,590
Can you bear to watch me losing the national prize,

742
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,360
the scholarship

743
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,880
and the place for postgraduate recommendation?

744
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,110
No way.

745
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,550
I'll never speak to him again.
