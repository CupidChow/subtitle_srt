[Episode 11]

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,270
I changed the scores of unified exams.

22
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,630
It has nothing to do with others.

23
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,320
You can expel me from school.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,800
Cheating in the exams

25
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,160
is a serious offense.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,080
Neither of you can escape the punishment.

27
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,160
This isn't negotiable.

28
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,600
Director Liu.

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,670
It was him.

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,880
But it was the past.

31
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,000
There must have been something behind his cheating.

32
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,670
He couldn't cheat in the college entrance examination.

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,320
He's really an excellent student.

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,230
Mr. Lin said he's a genius in programming.

35
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,880
I don't care about his reason.

36
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,630
It was wrong for him to cheat.

37
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,560
Listen.

38
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,040
It's even terrible

39
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,600
if one misuses

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,750
his talent.

41
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,040
How can we describe such people?

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,400
They're villains, with ability but no principles.

43
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,280
This has been true since ancient times.

44
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,910
I heard from Miss Zhang that

45
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,190
you take part in the practice base

46
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,070
to win the credits of the second class.

47
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,160
You're a freshman.

48
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,560
Take your time.

49
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,630
I think now you should first learn the basic knowledge well

50
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,350
and then carry out practice later.

51
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,600
Or your university study will

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,560
become a castle in the air and a rootless tree.

53
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,840
Don't go to

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
the practice base now.

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,120
I'll spend less time on it.

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,120
Mr. Lin said

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
practice is the most important element in programming learning.

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,470
If I don't disable several keyboards,

59
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,910
I won't become a good programmer.

60
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,790
Mom, get in, please.

61
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,910
Then, then you can go on

62
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,440
taking part in that practice base.

63
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,910
Thank you, mom.

64
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,070
But remember to

65
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,880
keep away from the boy named Li Xun.

66
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,640
He's not suitable for you.

67
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,430
Try to keep away from him.

68
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,110
I'll leave first.

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,910
Li Xun,

70
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,640
guess what I just ate.

71
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,910
Pitaya with Lao Gan Ma sauce.

72
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,310
My mother was shocked.

73
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,910
You ate all my bread.

74
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,230
Remember to buy it for me tomorrow.

75
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,840
Li Xun,

76
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,640
are you from Linyang?

77
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,160
Did you graduate from Linyang No. 8 Middle School?

78
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,080
In my junior year, I cheated in the unified exams.

79
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,400
It's your mom who punished me personally.

80
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
You really cheated in the unified exams?

81
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,230
Why?

82
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,470
Is it important?

83
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,350
Sure.

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,040
You must have had a reason.

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,670
Well,

86
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,790
are you going to fix the wrong for me

87
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,350
and restore my exam results?

88
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,720
There's something you will never understand.

89
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,840
Tell me.

90
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,720
How can I know if you don't tell me?

91
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,720
Princess,

92
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,400
do you think we're the same as you?

93
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,670
Why are we different?

94
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,600
How did you get back the app

95
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,550
from Zhang Xiaobei?

96
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,520
Swallowing humiliation

97

in Zhang Xiaobei's company for years,

98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,640
Han Jiakang got nothing.

99
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,310
But you could let Zhang Xiaobei apologize to you.

100
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,430
Why?

101
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,080
Your mom told you to stay away from me,

102
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,040
right?

103
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:13,990
Yes.

104
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,520
Then why don't you ask me about my answer?

105
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,960
She's right.

106
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,110
We're completely different.

You made a mistake,

Cheating in the exams

Even if we really disband,

I'll return you every penny you invest.

156
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,640
I don't mean it.

157
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,480
It's good.

158
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,120
Since it's impossible for you to be together,

159
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,520
just end this relationship early.

160

Actually, he's a nice guy.

161

You're right.

162
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't know love and romance.

163
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,910
Love is prone to be

164
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,550
a person's weakness,

165
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,240
it can also be

166
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,550
the strongest armor.

167
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,040
I think love is the very thing

168
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,360
best worth trying

169
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,430
and pursing without hesitation in the world.

170
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,590
You're so sentimental today.

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,880
I'm leaving.

172
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,400
It's raining heavily. Where will you go?

173
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't you consider your personal love?

174
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,430
No, I don't.

175
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,120
I have no weakness,

176
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
nor do I need any armor.

177
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,760
Wu Mengxing,

178
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,550
help me pick it up.

179
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,190
Why don't you do it yourself?

180
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,280
It doesn't matter. Let me help you.

181
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,880
Here.

182
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:53,910
Thank you.

183
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,760
Would you like some hot water?

184
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,280
Thank you.

185
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,910
Thank me?

186
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,310
How come?

187
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,520
He never said "thank you" to me.

188
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm sorry.

189
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,190
It doesn't matter.

190
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,400
What's wrong with him today? What does he want to do?

191
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,120
Gao,

192
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,910
I sent you a document,

193
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,670
in which there're all the health product projects

194
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,590
of Blue Crown Company

195
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,760
and the detailed description,

196
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,310
formula ingredients

197
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,480
and treatment direction of each product.

198
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,880
You may ask me if you have any questions.

199
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,790
I saw it.

200
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,160
I'm back now,

201
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,240
so I can help you write apps.

202
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,480
We're not short of hands.

203
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,280
We learnt

204
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,590
the definition of function limit in the previous lessons.

205
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,070
We usually don't work out

206
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,670
the function limits

207
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,120
by definition

208
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,910
as it is

209
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,830
rather troublesome.

210
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,830
In today's lesson…

211
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,280
The more I come into contact with Li Xun,

212
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,760
the more difficultly I find I can understand him.

213
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,880
Sometimes I think I'm close to him,

214
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,360
but he treats me coldly.

215
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,480
Do any of you

216
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
know what this means?

217
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,160
Zhu Yun.

218
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,280
Zhu Yun.

219
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,670
Don't you want to know my answer?

220
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,040
My mom told me to stay away from you.

221
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,160
But I said

222
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,240
no.

223
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,590
The apps of Blue Crown…

224
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,390
I don't need you.

225
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,790
Are you going to drive me away?

226
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,070
I said I don't need you.

227
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,280
Can't you understand?

228
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,390
You're

229
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,440
so strange.

230
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,830
I have to work.

231
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,070
You can leave.

232
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,550
Li Xun,

233
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,680
it's you who invited me to the practice base.

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,350
I don't come as soon as called,

235
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,390
nor do I leave at random.

236
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,390
Don't think to drive me away.

237
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,590
Li Xun, I applied for the volleyball course for you,

238
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,960
but you've been absent for several times.

239
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,440
If you don't go to class again, you'll fail it.

240
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,760
Well,

241
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,110
which school are you from?

242
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,390
The School of Computer Science.

243
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,550
If I had normal  network signals,

244
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,960
I wouldn't come to play volleyball.

245
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,440
What about you?

246
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,960
I also have abnormal network signals.

247
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,920
Well, everyone, fall in.

248
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,110
It's time for class.

249
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,240
Let's do some warm-up exercises.

250
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,200
Move your wrists and ankles.

251
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,310
Who is he?

252
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,040
He's

253
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,680
Jiang Xingchi.

254
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,350
The student with special sports talent in Class 2

255
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,280
and a national second-class athlete.

256
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,150
He's also the attacker of our university's volleyball team.

257
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,200
Then why does he still come to have volleyball class?

258
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,480
He likes to show off himself.

259
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:20,720
Turn your waists.

260
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,680
Everyone, listen.

261
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,310
We have new students today,

262
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,150
so I'll teach you how to serve again.

263
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,830
There're many ways to serve in volleyball.

264
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
You should master

265
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,680
the most basic and simplest way,

266
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,480
underhand service from the side.

267
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
I'll ask Jiang Xingchi to show to you.

268
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,870
First, stand with your side

269
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,000
facing the net.

270
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,200
The distance between your feet is slightly wider than your shoulders.

271
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,200
Slightly bend your legs.

272
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,200
Hold the ball with your left hand in front of your chest and abdomen.

273
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,590
Slightly throw the ball up vertically.

274
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,760
Then swing your right hand backward and take your shoulder as the axis.

275
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,040
When the ball falls into the proper area,

276
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,110
go and serve it

277
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,920
with the part between the center of your palm and the side of your palm.

278
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,790
Well, Jiang Xingchi, serve.

279
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,630
Got it?

280
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,760
Yes.

281
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,390
Then start practicing.

282
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,590
Try to find the right service way.

283
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,920
If you have any questions, you can come to me

284
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,550
or Jiang Xingchi.

285
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,830
The new students

286
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,830
can learn from those with service experience.

287
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,920
Go and practice.

288
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,310
Okay.

289
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,760
Hurry up and be serious.

290
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,000
Zhu Yun.

291
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,920
Thank you.

292
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,110
Zhu Yun.

293
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,040
Try, try serving the ball

294
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,520
with this part.

295
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,040
Have a try.

296
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:07,790
Yes.

297
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,760
No.

298
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,520
In fact, you should guarantee

299
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,150
the tension of this part of your arm.

300
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,070
Serve the ball with this part.

301
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,150
Try.

302
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,960
Okay, I'll have a try.

303
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:21,960
Are you okay?

304
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,520
Let me check.

305
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,310
Why, why is it so red?

306
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,310
What's wrong?

307
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,590
She's hurt.

308
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,280
-She's hurt. -Let me see.

309
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,680
Can you move your wrist?

310
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,830
Yes.

311
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,760
Can you feel tingling pain?

312
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,870
A bit.

313
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,760
It's not serious.

314
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
But be careful.

315
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,350
How about I send her to the infirmary?

316
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,870
Yes, yes, yes.

317
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,110
I can go myself.

318
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,150
Well, let me send you there.

319
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm familiar with there.

320
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,630
Okay.

321
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,550
Yes.

322
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,680
Jiang, send her to the infirmary.

323
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,550
You actually served in the wrong way.

324
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,110
If you had tensed this part of your arm,

325
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,040
you wouldn't have hurt your arm.

326
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,390
Well, go on practicing.

327
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,550
Listen carefully.

328
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,280
New students shouldn't serve the ball by force

329
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,310
before mastering the right way.

330
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,070
Be careful.

331
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,200
Okay. Okay.

332
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,000
It isn't serious.

333
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,150
Use ice to reduce her swelling.

334
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,790
Yes. Okay.

335
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,300
Don't worry.

336
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,110
Thank you.

337
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,240
Let me do it myself.

338
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:18,920
I'll help you.

339
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,550
I can do it myself.

340
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,070
Let me help you.

341
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,760
Does it hurt?

342
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,680
Are you from Class 1 of the School of Computer Science?

343
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,790
I saw your show

344
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,830
at the art performance of our university.

345
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,520
You're nicknamed Piggy, right?

346
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,480
Go along with you!

347
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,870
It doesn't matter. I can handle it myself.

348
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,790
The time isn't up.

349
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,720
Apply it for a bit longer.

350
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,110
You must seldom take exercises in normal times.

351
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,920
In fact, the new learners like you

352
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,040
get hurt most easily.

353
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,760
The volleyball is very hard.

354
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,280
No.

355
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,440
The volleyballs we use in class are all soft.

356
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,870
We usually use hard ones

357
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,310
for training and games.

358
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,200
If you use our balls, you'll be badly hurt.

359
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,550
Really?

360
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,280
If you don't believe me,

361
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,240
I'll take you to watch our training

362
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,350
and show you a smash.

363
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,110
Are you in the volleyball team of our university?

364
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,960
Yes.

365
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,390
You don't know.

366
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,480
Let me tell you.

367
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,630
Before we came,

368
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,390
the volleyball team of our university

369
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,310
just trusted to luck.

370
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,390
However, after we joined,

371
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,070
we've become one of the top six quickly.

372
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,310
And I'm still the MVP

373
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,200
of our university.

374
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,920
Oh, the boys of your class are so weak.

375
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,590
They're too frail to stand a gust of wind.

376
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,920
Especially, that boy who were absent for several times

377
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,240
is just like a chicken.

378
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,390
You know nothing.

379
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,830
I dream of

380
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,720
staying with him

381
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,150
stably and peacefully.

382
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,520
It's okay.

383
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,720
It doesn't hurt. I'll leave first.

384
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,200
Hi, could I have your WeChat account?

385
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,590
In this case, we may keep in touch in the future.

386
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,440
There's no need.

387
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,240
Hi.

388
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,280
Hi.

389
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,630
Could I have your WeChat account?

390
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,110
In this case, we may keep in touch in the future.

391
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,960
You got hurt in volleyball class.

392
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,550
Coach Tang asked me to follow up your condition.

393
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,070
If you can't go to class next time,

394
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,070
I can ask for leave for you.

395
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,520
Okay.

396
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,630
Scan my QR code.

397
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,040
What did you want to do?

398
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,630
Did you do it on purpose?

399
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,350
Sorry.

400
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,000
If your smart phone doesn't work, I can repair it for you.

401
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,200
I'm Li Xun

402
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,110
from Computer Applied Technology Class 1.

403
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,440
You've gone so far.

404
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,200
Repay me if it doesn't work.

405
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,310
Will you drive me away? You actually thought out such an idea.

406
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,630
[Welcome to today's health class. Understanding the exercise methods of channels, you can live long.]
Thank you

407
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,200
[Welcome to today's health class. Understanding the exercise methods of channels, you can live long.]
for coming to my class

408
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,960
[Welcome to today's health class. Understanding the exercise methods of channels, you can live long.]
and listening to the TCM knowledge.

409
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,040
[Welcome to today's health class. Understanding the exercise methods of channels, you can live long.]
Our whole body

410
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,960
is full of channels,

411
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,280
which are the major passages

412
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,590
for the movement of human qi and blood.

413
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,760
And they

414
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,830
are also the main paths

415
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,520
combining various human parts.

416
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,870
In fact,

417
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,550
we may have small illnesses in life,

418
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,790
such as headache, slight fever and other common illnesses.

419
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,790
For example,

420
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,110
smartphone addicts

421
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,070
are easy

422
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,110
to have sore cervical spines.

423
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,480
Where is the acupoint?

424
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,520
Dazhui acupoint.

425
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,350
Just here.

426
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,630
If you have a sore cervical spine,

427
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,110
you can massage this acupoint.

428
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,920
Massage it. Yes.

429
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,040
Wu Mengxing, Wu Mengxing

430
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,590
take that out.

431
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,150
But the release time is fixed.

432
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,920
If we don't do it now, we'll be more pressed for time later.

433
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,280
We thought

434
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,790
our interface system is very complicated.

435
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,680
Why don't we adopt the design of the manikin directly?

436
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,200
It's a good idea.

437
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,630
See.

438
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,590
If this is our interface,

439
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,760
the users can choose

440
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,520
their sore parts from the manikin.

441
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,550
We can design to pop up

442
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,790
the options and descriptions of the illnesses,

443
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,280
which's more instructive.

444
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,830
We can establish a model according to this manikin

445
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,720
and divide the human body into several parts,

446
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,060
such as head, limbs, waist and back.

447
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,070
In this way, we can have a more unified system.

448
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:12,920
Very good.

449
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,870
Is it okay, Group Leader Li?

450
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
Group Leader Li, what do you think of it?

451
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,520
Will we take her advice?

452
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,630
He doesn't say no, so I think he agrees.

453
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,280
So arrogant.

454
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,920
Only I can help you.

455
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,520
Deng Jia?

456
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,150
Yes.

457
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:48,760
Du Ting?

458
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,310
Yes.

459
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Coach, all are present.

460
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,790
Go back to your position.

461
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,480
Everyone,

462
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,200
you'll practice in groups

463
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,680
this class.

464
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,870
You can practice in pairs.

465
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,630
Make pairs at will.

466
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,830
Coach, can a boy and a girl form a group?

467
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,480
Sure.

468
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,870
But you'd better

469
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
choose a partner

470
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,830
of the similar strength.

471
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,760
In this way, all of you can practice effectively.

472
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,000
Okay.

473
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,720
Make groups.

474
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,480
Zhu Yun,

475
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,760
why don't we make a group?

476
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,310
We're greatly mismatched.

477
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,040
It doesn't matter.

478
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,550
I can teach you.

479
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,200
And I can also

480
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,520
protect you.

481
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,550
What's your opinion?

482
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,440
You acted so fast.

483
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,680
Okay, report your grouping.

484
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,550
Jiang Xingchi

485
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,440
and me, Li Xun.

486
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,760
I don't want to form a group with you.

487
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,310
Don't you want to compete with me?

488
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,870
You're asking for trouble.

489
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,280
Will we continue?

490
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,720
Yes.

491
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,350
Jiang Xingchi, let me be your partner.

492
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:29,790
Come on.

493
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,350
Don't come here.

494
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,720
-Serve. -Stand aside.

495
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,520
Well.

496
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,350
Er, what does she want to do?

497
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,830
Actually, you didn't have to compare with Jiang Xingchi

498
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,790
as he's a national second-class athlete

499
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,630
and the main attacker of the volleyball team of our university.

500
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,520
You're no match for him.

501
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,680
It seems that you admire him very much.

502
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:32,830
No.

503
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,630
But he's just gifted in sports.

504
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,440
Is he?

505
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,440
Is he?

506
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,040
Let me go. There're people coming and going.

507
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,480
Am I powerful?

508
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,310
Let me go.

509
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,040
Am I powerful?

510
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,680
I admire you from the bottom of my heart.

511
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,680
Will you praise him next time?

512
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,790
It's just fact.

513
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,520
Go back to work with me in the base.

514
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,870
Didn't you fire me?

515
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,760
Fang Shumiao,

516
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,870
why do you take out all your clothes?

517
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,040
You came back just in time.

518
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,520
Do you have time

519
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,240
on the weekend?

520
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,070
What do you want me to do?

521
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,070
Go out with me.

522
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,590
It's improper for me

523
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,200
to disturb the date of the senior and you.

524
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,000
I don't go out with him.

525
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,590
Do you cheat on him?

526
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,240
Zhu Yun,

527
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,310
please be careful what you said.

528
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,590
I don't cheat on him.

529
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,110
I just have the most popular dates with him,

530
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
but we haven't confirmed our relationship,

531
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,110
so both of us are free.

532
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,070
Well.

533
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,630
See, it's just him.

534
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,280
Super Man.

535
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,790
What a rustic name.

536
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,390
This is his online nickname.

537
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,000
We didn't meet,

538
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,720
but we've talked happily.

539
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,870
We plan to meet on the weekend.

540
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,350
You may feel awfully disappointed after seeing him.

541
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,110
But it's good for you to meet him.

542
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,480
If you think he's not suitable for you, you can break up soon.

543
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,150
Zhu Yun,

544
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,550
I think

545
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,350
I'll meet

546
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,920
my Mr. Right this time.

547
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,070
Which one do you think is better?

548
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,630
You must be cheated by the seller show.

549
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,960
Is it so obvious?

550
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,000
The blue one is better.

551
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,040
Don't put it into your trousers.

552
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,110
I'll try.

553
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,760
Will you go for a date?

554
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,310
Yes.

555
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,480
To avoid the extremely embarrassing meeting scene,

556
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,280
I found a helper.

557
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,280
Who?

558
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:02,960
You.

559
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,960
I won't go.

560
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,150
Do you want to watch me take risks alone?

561
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,520
Don't wash your hair or put on makeup

562
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,760
or wear high-heeled shoes

563
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,680
on the weekend.

564
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,760
Then I'll have to keep silent and maintain a poker face

565
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,110
when you date, okay?

566
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,110
Yes.

567
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,000
To avoid your embarrassment,

568
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,760
I also find another person.

569
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,760
Who?

570
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,630
Wu Mengxing.

571
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,870
Fang Shumiao organized a small fellowship meeting.

572
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,590
We'll go out on the weekend.

573
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,870
I wonder whether she invited others.

574
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,070
Our class rep also joins.

575
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,110
What fellowship meeting?

576
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,200
I don't know.

577
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,350
There're boys from other departments.

578
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:50,520
Does the blue one really look better?

579
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,350
Come over.

580
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,390
Do you know why

581
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,830
Fang Shumiao invited you?

582
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,440
Don't worry.

583
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,800
Dress yourself well.

584
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,270
[Nanhu University
Study Extensively, Practice Earnestly, Seek Improvement Constantly]
But I can't drive a kart.

585
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,550
[Nanhu University
Study Extensively, Practice Earnestly, Seek Improvement Constantly]
It doesn't matter. I'll teach you.

586
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,190
[Nanhu University
Study Extensively, Practice Earnestly, Seek Improvement Constantly]
Can you drive it?

587
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,630
Sure. I've driven it several times.

588
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,070
Awesome.

589
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,800
It seems to be this car.

590
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,040
Is he the net friend you want to see?

591
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,480
Maybe.

592
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,360
Hello,

593
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,590
I'm Fang Shumiao.

594
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,520
I'm Super Man.

595
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,480
Yes, he is.

596
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,070
Zhu Yun,

597
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,320
we meet again.

598
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,750
So why did you ask me to come?

599
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,630
It's he who asked me to bring my roommate.

600
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,750
Do you know each other?

601
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,270
I have something else to do.

602
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,670
Enjoy yourselves. I'll go first.

603
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,320
No, Zhu Yun.

604
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,360
Monitor, class rep.

605
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,480
Quickly, quickly.

606
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,190
Did you invite Li Xun?

607
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,800
I also wanted to ask you.

608
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,960
Well, Li Xun has no work to do

609
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,840
in the base today.

610
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,750
It's a fellowship meeting.

611
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,750
I invite him to come with us.

612
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,000
Won't you mind?

613
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,360
Li Xun is the major backbone of our class

614
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,630
and this year's top scorer of science.

615
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,880
Can he join us?

616
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,400
Okay.

617
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,880
It's interesting to play

618
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,920
with more people.

619
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,320
Get in.

620
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,440
Zhu Yun,

621
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,590
get in.

622
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,320
Who drives?

623
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,040
Monitor,

624
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,400
you really drive…

625
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,040
Shut up.

626
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,480
…so fast.

627
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,360
Do you feel crowded?

628
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,710
Sit closer to me, okay?

629
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,590
It isn't crowded.

630
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,320
Does your arm still hurt?

631
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,630
Could I check your arm?

632
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,800
No. It doesn't hurt at all.

633
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,590
In fact, the exercise sequelae

634
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
are quite serious.

635
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,550
You'd better let me check it for you.

636
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,180
My arm has recovered.

637
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,750
Really?

638
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,800
Yes.

639
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,230
They begin. They begin. They begin.

640
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,670
They're driving so fast.

641
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,630
There's, there's corner overtaking.

642
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,360
Shumiao, come on.

643
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,440
Monitor, come on.

644
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,230
Go, go.

645
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,000
What's wrong with her?

646
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:42,840
How do you feel?

647
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,920
So thrilling.

648
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,840
What's the matter?

649
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,070
What's wrong? Are you okay?

650
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,710
Let me help you.

651
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,840
Are you okay?

652
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,960
Do you feel a little dizzy?

653
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,670
How are you feeling?

654
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,800
Are you dizzy?

655
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,400
How many years have you used this lighter?

656
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,960
Why don't you walk slowly?

657
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,590
I've used it for a long time.

658
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,670
Why not take a seat?

659
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,040
Sit down, sit down quickly.

660
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
I'll get you water.

661
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,070
Are you alright?

662
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,670
What's wrong with you?

663
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,480
Here you are.

664
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,520
Don't drink this.

665
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,840
You'll feel even uncomfortable after smelling it.

666
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,440
I'll buy you plain water

667
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,110
Do you have any facial tissues with you?

668
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,920
No.

669
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,110
I'll buy for you.

670
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,630
I'll also go.

671
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,270
Come on.

672
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,440
Have some water.

673
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,270
Just spit it out.

674
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,320
Here comes the water. Here comes the water.

675
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,190
Don't you want to compete with me?

676
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,070
You're asking for trouble.

677
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,440
Li Xun, come on.

678
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Li, Li Xun.

679
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,190
He keeps driving before Jiang Xingchi.

680
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,110
Li Xun, come on.

681
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,190
Monitor, class rep,

682
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,880
Li Xun is so amazing.

683
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,520
Thanks for sending me back.

684
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,110
You won. Why do you look unhappy?

685
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,230
Give back the coat to Jiang Xingchi

686
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,190
and let him wash himself.

687
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,000
It's improper.

688
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,270
I stained his coat.

689
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,360
He happened to squat in front of you.

690
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,520
How dare he date the belle of our class?

691
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,800
Who is the belle?

692
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,710
Fang Shumiao.

693
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:00,960
I'll leave.

694
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,880
So stubborn.

695
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,590
What's this?

696
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,480
You won't have to go to volleyball class later.

697
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,550
Certificate of diagnosis.

698
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,840
I took the sick leave notes for your exemption from sports and dancing courses

699
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,320
from the university hospital,

700
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,710
so you don't need to go to volleyball class later.

701
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,550
Do you think I can't play volleyball well?

702
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,920
You really have no gift for sports.

703
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,800
Repeat it.

704
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,590
Well,

705
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,320
God is fair.

706
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,360
You're tall, handsome and talented.

707
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,670
Your figure is better than that of models.

708
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,230
Your IQ is higher than that of Einstein.

709
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,400
So it's normal for you to perform badly in sports.

710
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,550
Do you think I'm no match for him?

711
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,800
He's good at sports.

712
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,270
So we don't need to compete with him in sports.

713
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,800
It turns out this is the feeling

714
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
of keeping failing a course.

715
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,750
I must

716
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,000
go to volleyball class.

717
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,320
So stubborn.

718
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,670
The school knows about the mark change.

719
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,860
♫I pass by the world♫
Are you mad?

720
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,590
I thought if my score was higher,

721
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,800
♫And pass through the night♫
my dad would give me more pocket money.

722
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,110
♫And pass through the night♫
Your mother needs money to stay in hospital.

723
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,670
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
What are you busy with?

724
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,500
Does it have anything to do with you?

725
00:44:59,190 --> 00:44:59,920
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
What's wrong?

726
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,440
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
Li Xun.

727
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:04,060
Li Xun.

728
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,620
♫It's the intuition of the dream♫

729
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,340
♫That breaks through the boundary♫

♫We won't break up♫

735

♫Stay with me from the hustle and bustle♫

736
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:50,500
♫It's the fulcrum of your palm♫

737
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,540
♫That gives me the courage to move forward♫

738
00:45:53,540 --> 00:46:00,500
♫Just like the flame in the night♫
