♫The person I used to be is gone♫

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,980
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,380
♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,260
♫We would bloom in the darkness♫

[Xu Lina  Gao Jianhong: Lina, we have arrived. Are you at school?]
Lina.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,960
[Xu Lina  Gao Jianhong: Lina, we have arrived. Are you at school?]
We have arrived.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,470
[Xu Lina  Gao Jianhong: Lina, we have arrived. Are you at school?]
Are you at school?

24
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,430
Gao.

25
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,310
This is for you.

26
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,190
You bought it?

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,400
Last time you treated me to dinner,

28
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,520
so just take it

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,080
for a return gift.

30
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,680
You are so polite.

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,800
Thank you.

32
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,150
I don't understand.

33
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,000
I chose one that I thought was good.

34
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,240
Do you like it?

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,120
Yes.

36
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,590
Don't you open it?

37
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,310
I like everything you give me.

38
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:02,870
Okay.

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,280
Gao, only you come?

40
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,240
Where's Li Xun?

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
Has he come yet?

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,910
Yes.

43
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,280
Where is he?

44
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,430
In the room.

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,000
We changed our project

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,030
as he said.

47
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,240
I was just looking for him.

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,280
Let's go upstairs.

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,430
He's sleeping.

50
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,030
He sleeps at this point?

51
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
Is he an old man?

52
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,710
He's irritated recently.

53
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,840
Don't bother him.

54
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,630
He scolds people mercilessly.

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,400
Really?

56
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,080
Fine.

57
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,560
Then I'll go shopping.

58
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,150
Let me go with you.

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm free

60
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,240
and want to take a walk.

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,000
All right.

62
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,750
This is so cute.

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
Yeah.

64
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,150
This Macchiato is too sweet.

65
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,590
I'll get fat.

66
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,710
Then give it to me.

67
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,150
I'll buy you a new one later.

68
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,590
This.

69
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,430
Thank you for your coming.

70
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,240
Welcome to the comprehensive oral care brand.

71
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,520
May I help you?

72
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,560
I want to buy a toothbrush for my friend.

73
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,720
Would you recommend some?

74
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,430
Okay.

75
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,070
Then you can take this

76
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,430
marble electric toothbrush.

77
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,430
It sells well.

78
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,360
It can clean teeth effectively.

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,680
Really?

80
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,510
There are twelve modes

81
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,750
for you to adjust the intensity by yourself.

82
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,480
Is this for lovers?

83
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,950
Yes, it's for lovers.

84
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,630
It's pretty. Then I'd like to take a pair.

85
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:39,830
Okay.

86
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,310
Will that be cash

87
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,070
or charge?

88
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:42,830
Cash.

89
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,870
-Okay. -Wait.

90
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,680
I'll buy it myself.

91
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,830
Card.

92
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,830
Okay.

93
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,000
You are back.

94
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,680
Yeah.

95
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,680
I bought some fruit. Have a taste.

96
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,270
Okay.

97
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,800
How was the discussion today?

98
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,040
Pretty good.

99
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,630
That's good.

100
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,950
Why did you come back so late?

101
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,600
I was stopped on my way back.

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
Go for the competition.

103
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,190
[Go for the competition. You are always No.1 in my heart. U smile every day.  Xu Lina]
You are always No.1 in my heart.

104
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,680
[Go for the competition. You are always No.1 in my heart. U smile every day.  Xu Lina]
You smile every day.

105
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,310
Xu Lina.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,430
Let's go to the restaurant we ordered last night.

107
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,720
Several groups eat together.

108
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:57,950
How many of you are there?

109
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,600
Zhu Yun?

110
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,360
You go first.

111
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,040
Bye-bye.

112
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,510
I remember when you graduated from high school,

113
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,390
you changed the phone number?

114
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,560
It suddenly occurred to me

115
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,190
I forgot to ask your mobile number last time I saw you.

116
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,270
You also come to the competition?

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,390
Last time I asked you, but you didn't tell me.

118
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,070
I didn't see your name on the list.

119
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,800
Come on.

120
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,950
Does it need to hide so deeply?

121
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,630
I'll have a group meeting later.

122
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,920
It'll end bout seven o'clock.

123
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,800
Then let's have a meal.

124
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,040
No thanks.

125
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,390
We are old classmates.

126
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,190
I haven't seen you for so long.

127
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,310
How about we have a meal and talk about the past?

128
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,950
Our group has an appointment to have dinner together.

129
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,360
Li Xun also comes?

130
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,160
Of course.

131
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,800
You can keep your own trump deep.

132
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,480
I really want to see

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,720
how capable he is.

134
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,270
Then I'll go first. I'll be late.

135
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,430
Wait,

136
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,040
tell me your phone number.

137
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,680
Let me make a note.

138
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,800
I didn't bring my cell phone with me.

139
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,830
I can't remember the number.

140
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,430
That's amazing.

141
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,510
Next time.

142
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,040
Bye, old schoolmate.

143
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,800
Have you submitted it?

144
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,270
Deadline is 12:00.

145
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,950
It's 11:40 now.

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,720
What are you doing?

147
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,480
Click submit.

148
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,070
Test it again?

149
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,430
No need. You've packed it.

150
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,800
Test it again.

151
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,070
How many times have you tested it?

152
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,160
What if there is a problem with this platform?

153
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,720
There are only three competition platforms.

154
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,800
Windows,

155
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,600
Linus,

156
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,310
and Unix.

157
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,360
Even pupils won't make any mistake.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,510
But

159
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,830
I'm afraid.

160
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,210
[Uploaded]

161
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,870
Isn't it over?

162
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,680
That's it?

163
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,800
What a hare.

164
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,000
Hello. Hello. Hello.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,510
Here.

166
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,080
Okay.

167
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,840
Hello. Hello.

168
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,840
I'm so sorry.

169
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,720
I had a jam due to heavy rain.

170
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,200
It doesn't matter. I've just arrived.

171
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,270
Is that so?

172
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,000
Well,

173
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,910
I'd like to leave for a while.

174
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,720
Order me a Macchiato.

175
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,390
Okay.

176
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:48,870
OK.

177
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,600
Waiter.

178
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:00,870
Hello.

179
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,840
A glass of Macchiato, not too sweet.

180
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,320
Okay.

181
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,080
Thank you, Feng.

182
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,000
How is it?

183
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,480
Isn't this a good place?

184
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,630
You should have avoided suspicion at this time.

185
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,750
But you asked me out alone.

186
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,600
I've invited you to such a far place.

187
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,150
It has avoided suspicion enough.

188
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,750
Fang Zhijing.

189
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,000
What happened on earth?

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,960
Isn't that the sponsor of the competition?

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,630
Feng.

192
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,150
I heard that

193
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,790
Nanhu University has a pretty good

194
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,630
project recently.

195
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,320
The judges loved it.

196
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,080
You heard about it?

197
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,510
Have you seen their project?

198
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,630
How did you like it?

199
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,960
What's wrong?

200
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,320
Are you scared?

201
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:55,910
Scared?

202
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,120
Not at all.

203
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,960
Anyway,

204
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,750
you can't be more careful.

205
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,670
By the way, Feng,

206
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,120
can you

207
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,150
discuss with Mr. Chen

208
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,600
and ask him to apply for a star prize with the organizing committee?

209
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,200
There is no such award.

210
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,840
It won't work.

211
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,840
Feng.

212
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,320
Listen to me first.

213
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,870
Think about it.

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,630
Haven't we made an agreement?

215
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,720
The contract is ready,

216
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,600
waiting only for signature.

217
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,750
Mr. Chen also

218
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,550
needs to enhance his performance this year,

219
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,440
right?

220
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,000
If something goes wrong here,

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,750
the company must treat him as a joke.

222
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,790
How should I persuade Mr. Chen?

223
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:38,870
How about this?

224
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,080
I can give in three more percent

225
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,000
in the patent transfer fee.

226
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,030
Feng.

227
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,600
Later,

228
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,750
for the annual patent transfer fee,

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,670
you will take 30 percent

230
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,600
and me, 70 percent.

231
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay.

232
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,600
I'd have a try.

233
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:00,870
Great.

234
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,320
Thank you, Feng.

235
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,000
I have a meeting this afternoon.

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,720
I have to go.

237
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,790
Let me walk you out.

238
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,030
Wait, Feng, take an umbrella.

239
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,550
Thank you for that.

240
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,240
Discuss with Mr. Chen.

241
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,200
Fang Zhijing?

242
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,960
Isn't that one beside Fang Zhijing

243
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,870
from our

244
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,320
competition's sponsor?

245
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,510
You know him?

246
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,440
He was also present in the forum.

247
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,960
What is Fang Zhijing doing with him?

248
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
What are you up to?

249
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,480
He must be trying to do something.

250
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,750
During the competition,

251
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,870
meeting with sponsors privately

252
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,840
is against the rules.

253
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,200
Don't be so impulsive.

254
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,440
I'm going to report them to the organizing committee.

255
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,200
Do you have any evidence?

256
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,910
We saw it with our own eyes.

257
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,440
So what?

258
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,910
Did you hear what they said?

259
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,360
It's against the rules to meet privately.

260
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,030
But at most, they will get a notice of criticism.

261
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,870
Can it help?

262
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,960
What a coincidence.

263
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,030
We even came across him.

264
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,670
I didn't expect Fang Zhijing to have such a move.

265
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,750
What happened to Fang Zhijing?

266
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,120
When we had coffee this afternoon,

267
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,360
we met Fang Zhijing.

268
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,240
I've never any mean person like him.

269
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,440
We saw them staying

270
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,600
with someone from the organizing committee.

271
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
What happened?

272
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,550
Sorry. I'll answer the phone first.

273
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,080
The competition will start soon.

274
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,750
He met the sponsor

275
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,840
in secret in a far place.

276
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,480
They wouldn't have a normal chat only.

277
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,120
I think they're just discussing

278
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,390
about the direct determination of award winners.

279
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,600
They have determined the result of the finals?

280
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,080
What finals?

281
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,270
They are cheating fools like us.

282
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,960
Why is it so cold?

283
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,870
Has the taxi arrived?

284
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:02,910
Not yet, but soon.

285
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,440
What would you like for dinner?

286
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,720
Some people

287
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
are really mean.

288
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,790
They can do anything for an award.

289
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,240
Being able to sell patents are a kind of ability.

290
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,600
Instead of gossiping here,

291
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,270
some people would better go back and improve

292
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,150
their level.

293
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,270
What level should I improve?

294
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,600
The level of playing tricks and pulling strings?

295
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,320
What bullshit are you talking about?

296
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,840
Whether it's bullshit

297
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,480
is clear to everyone.

298
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,320
Xu Lina.

299
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,150
What right do you have to slander me

300
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,550
playing tricks and pulling strings?

301
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,910
You are just a gifted student of folk dance

302
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,600
who was enrolled by points adding.

303
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,360
Aren't you clear about

304
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
your programming level?

305
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,200
Have you no shame

306
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,870
to say this?

307
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,750
Make it clear.

308
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,080
You are clearer than me

309
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
how many people you asked for help

310
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,480
to make your shabby system.

311
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,390
You alone can never

312
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,960
enter the finals in your life.

313
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,960
But I've improved

314
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,480
it for at least three times.

315
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,630
Right, Li Xun?

316
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,790
Miss Xu.

317
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,790
Next time, before you criticize someone,

318
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,000
consider whether you have this ability first.

319
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:31,840
You.

320
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,120
Here we go.

321
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,320
How can there be such a person?

322
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,480
Fang Zhijing.

323
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,840
Is what Xu Lina said true?

324
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,200
Zhu Yun,

325
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,240
why are you so naive now?

326
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,750
Can you ask this directly?

327
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,360
I asked you if it was true.

328
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,870
You participate in this competition

329
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,910
because you really want to compete with me?

330
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,870
What a pity.

331
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:20,750
I'd love to

332
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,480
compete with your God Li.

333
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,270
But there's no chance.

334
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,390
Maybe next time.

335
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,870
It's all cut and dried

336
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,720
You are scared once Li Xun attends?

337
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,200
You're using such unscrupulous means.

338
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,150
The judges think my stuff is good. So is it called means?

339
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,790
People like Xu Lina are playing tricks.

340
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,790
You saw it too.

341
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,630
They have their resources.

342
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,120
I have my way.

343
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,120
We are the same.

344
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,200
And I don't care about it.

345
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,030
Do you know the essential difference

346
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,550
between them and me?

347
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,200
They can choose to talk nonsense or not.

348
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,270
I can also choose to listen or not.

349
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,080
But whether they talk nonsense or not,

350
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,960
my result will not be changed.

351
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,720
If I choose to listen,

352
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,390
at most, I will be annoyed for a while.

353
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,960
If I choose not to listen,

354
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
then I'm the winner.

355
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,120
You're so smart.

356
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,790
You should understand

357
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,150
who is better.

358
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,440
In this world,

359
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,030
heroes are always judged by success.

360
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,720
People always

361
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,510
worship the strong.

362
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,910
Believe it or not.

363
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,960
As long as I keep succeeding,

364
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,510
everyone will forget today's criticism

365
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,030
and become my fanatical followers

366
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,670
and admirers.

367
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,670
Okay, I'm done.

368
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:54,910
I have to go.

369
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,110
Are you okay?

370
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,720
I'm fine.

371
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,680
I squeeze so much time out,

372
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,750
not to see you like this.

373
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,550
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,680
Do you hate Fang Zhijing?

375
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,240
I see.

376
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,070
Don't you ask why?

377
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,920
Yes.

378
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,790
What if the reason doesn't convince you?

379
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,640
It doesn't matter if there's no reason.

380
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,400
Everyone can make decisions based on their emotions.

381
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,960
Do you have a way?

382
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,750
No.

383
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,790
Do not overdo it.

384
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,550
Something has no result originally.

385
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,720
Stop loss in time.

386
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,790
Waste less time.

387
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,880
I'm tired. You can leave.

388
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,310
Hello.

389
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,830
How are you feeling now? Are you nervous?

390
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,480
You know what?

391
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,720
On the day of the competition,

392
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,030
the group leader will get to the stage to explain first

393
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,790
and the judges will score on the spot.

394
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,680
You have only ten minutes to explain.

395
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,510
Then it's the work demonstration.

396
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:48,960
Zhu Yun.

397
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,030
Class rep.

398
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,440
Mr. Lin.

399
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,830
I mean,

400
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,030
you need to demonstrate it first.

401
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,440
In a short time,

402
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,720
show clearly the work's creativity,

403
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,240
technology roadmap,

404
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,590
and application prospect

405
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,030
to the judges and audience.

406
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,270
This is important.

407
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,030
Got it?

408
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,310
Yeah.

409
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,510
Mr. Li.

410
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,110
that USB encryption project

411
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,680
of the Information Technology University

412
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,960
will be awarded anyway?

413
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,510
Miss. Zhang told me about this.

414
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,000
I also inquired it indirectly.

415
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,000
There is definitely a rumor

416
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,920
saying that

417
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,000
a star prize will be set up.

418
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,310
Don't think so much about it.

419
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,270
This is beyond our control.

420
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,110
Just mind your business.

421
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,550
We learn for ourselves,

422
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,030
right?

423
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,200
I see.

424
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,960
I have other lessons.

425
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,550
I'm waiting for your good news.

426
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,680
Bye-bye.

427
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,510
All right, goodbye, Mr. Lin.

428
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,720
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

429
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,400
Didn't you listen to Mr. Lin?

430
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,720
They gave them a star prize.

431
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,350
This is good for us.

432
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,310
The biggest competitor left.

433
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,160
It will do us no harm.

434
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,550
We have a better chance.

435
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,830
No chance.

436
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,310
He will still stand on the stage like a success,

437
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,720
saying those acceptance speeches proudly.

438
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,310
No one knows how dirty he is.

439
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,830
No one can tear off

440
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,270
his hypocritical mask either.

441
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,030
In this world,

442
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,920
there is no absolute fairness.

443
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,550
Moreover,

444
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,790
there are countless roads to victory.

445
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,550
Even if one way is blocked by you,

446
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,440
there are still countless ways for him to take.

447
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,400
Where's Li Xun?

448
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,550
Where is he?

449
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,030
He hasn't been back for days.

450
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,750
He didn't answer any call or WeChat massage.

451
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,240
I didn't know he came for competition

452
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,200
or travel.

453
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,070
I'm tired. I'd like to go back to have a rest.

454
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,160
By the way, Feng,

455
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,550
can you discuss with Mr. Chen

456
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,920
and ask him to apply for a star prize with the organizing committee?

457
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,720
Do you really think no one can defeat you?

458
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,160
Li Xun.

459
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,750
Even you block one of his ways,

460
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,350
there are countless other ways he can take.

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,960
Princess, have a look again.

468
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,100
Stop that.

Where's Li Xun?

I don't know.

471

Congratulations.

472
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,160
You know what?

473
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,240
You won the first prize this time.

474
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,750
Really?

475
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,880
And what about you?

476
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,160
I can't compete with you.

477
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,830
I got a star prize.

478
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,000
You don't even have a chance to compete with me.

479
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,240
Are you disappointed?

480
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,110
Where's Li Xun?

481
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,790
He is absent again?

482
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,920
He's busy.

483
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,720
He is really mysterious.

484
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,400
He doesn't leave any chance to others to worship him.

485

You can get this result in my freshman year.

486
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,960
That's great.

487
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,480
Let's have a chat later.

488
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,750
Bye.

489
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,720
He is really bold-faced.

You go.

498
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,200
Thank you.

499
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,070
Great.

500

Next

501
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,790
is our most important link.

502
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,440
We have a work

503
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,070
that stood out at the competition stage

504
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,590
and got the opportunity to sign the contract in advance.

505
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,720
The purpose of this competition

506
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,510
is to promote exchange and cooperation

508
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,880
This work has taken the first step for us.

509
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,200
So

510
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,830
we set up a star prize.

511
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,350
The winner is the Information Technology University's

512

Participants are Fang Zhijing, Wang Yujun and Zhang Shuo.

514

Well, we also invite

to present the award to them on stage.

518
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,270
Thank you.

519
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,880
I'll call Mr. Lin.

520
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,790
Can you say something about winning the prize?

521
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,830
Yes, sure.

522
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,590
Hello, everyone.

523
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,640
I'm Fang Zhijing.

524
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,750
Right here.

525
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,270
First of all, I would like to thank the organizing committee

526
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,270
for giving us this star prize.

527
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,790
Secondly,

528
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,590
I want to thank all of you here.

529
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,200
Thank you for your hard work. Thank you.

530
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,790
Get down.

531
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,200
I know

532
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,960
there are a lot of rumors in the school recently,

533
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,550
saying that I cheated

534
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,350
or I stole others' work.

535
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,550
Originally,

536
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,920
a clean hand wants no washing.

537
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,590
As I have never done it,

538
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,350
I don't need to explain too much.

539
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
But for the rest of my team,

540
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,400
this is quite unfair.

541
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,880
So right here,

542
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,000
I solemnly clarify to everyone that,

543
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,270
I, Fang Zhijing,

544
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,350
have never done anything that

545
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,440
violated the rules of the competition.

546
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,070
Those irresponsible remarks,,

547
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,880
slanders, or false accusations,

548
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,110
will damage the reputation

549
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,200
of this information contest,

550
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,880
and a great insult to

551
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,590
the fairness and impartiality of this contest.

552
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,750
It's an insult to the fairness of the competition

553
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,270
that you can win a star prize for this shabby project.

554
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,880
Is it Li Xun?

555
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,880
Who is this?

556
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,310
Li Xun.

557
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,440
What's up?

558
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,750
You have been disappearing for days.

559
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,960
Where have you been these days?

560
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,590
I went to do something bad.

561
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,030
What do you mean?

562
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Well, I mean,

563
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,830
your so-called encryption interface

564
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,480
is totally vulnerable

565
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,880
and doesn't deserve this prize.

566
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,240
Li Xun.

567
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,030
You should be responsible for your remarks.

568
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,880
Am I afraid of responsibility

569
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,750
or are you afraid of responsibility?

570
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,510
Yeah. Are you afraid of responsibility?

571
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,440
Yeah. Yeah.

572
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,070
You are afraid?

573
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,440
You are afraid?

574
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,590
Afraid?

575
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,310
Okay.

576
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,830
If

577
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,440
he can crack my encrypted USB disk,

578
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,070
I can give up

579
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,110
this patent transfer fee

580
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,310
to him.

581
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,590
But if

582
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,720
you can't break it,

583
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,880
you, need to

584
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,480
apologize to me.

585
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,200
Okay.

586
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,680
It's a deal.

587
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,000
For the sake of fairness,

588
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,960
I'd better use the computer of the organizing committee.

589
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,440
Help yourself.

590
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,680
This competition will be wonderful.

Li Xun is cracking Fang Zhijing's encryption USB disk.

595
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,430
I've seen your plan introduction.

596
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,310
Good concept.

597
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,350
Of course.

Or I can't take it.

Within a minute,

600
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,110
I have three ways to crack it.

601

Okay.

This USB disk contains my personal privacy.

603

If he can crack it,

604
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,550
I'll show it to you all.

606
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm sure.

Go ahead.

608

You're very considerate.

To prevent forgetting the password,

610
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,270
while the USB disk is encrypted,

611
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,680
usually a key is generated.

612
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,440
Indeed.

613
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,440
Our patent

614
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,400
considers that many people forget their passwords.

615
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,270
But you are not skilled enough.

616
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,350
What is generated is a local static key.

617
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,640
This key

618
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,350
can be found

619
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,510

represents the drive letter to be unlocked.

622

This is the local static key you saved.

623

Empty disk copying.

Now,

642
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,000
I am about to use Ghost

643

to copy the disk.

644
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,350
But I have to say

645
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,030
your encryption software is quite secure.

646
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,030
Even in DOS,

647
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,640
it also prohibits the use of Ghost.

648
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,030
Once Ghost is activated,

649
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,350
the USB disk will pop up automatically.

Even if you plug it back in,

652
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,590
it cannot be seen in Ghost.

653
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,680
Therefore,

654
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,000
I used

655

I insert two USB disks

00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,830
and make direct copying, and decryption succeeded.

659
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,110
Because this encryption software

660
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,590
is associated with the serial number of the USB disk,

661

00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,920
Li Xun.

692
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,000
Three seconds are left.

693
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,480
Chairman Peng.

694
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,510
Look at him.

695
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,280
What do you mean?

696
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,360
You can't afford to play?

697
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,360
Who can't afford to play?

698
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,710
You can't afford to play?

699
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,000
Look at him.

700
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,590
He can't afford to play.

701
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,030
How is it?

702
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,630
Admit failure?

703
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,110
Do you still need me to explain to you?

704
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,510
The third method

705
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,400
is a physical method.

706
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,360
As long as the flash granule

707
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,480
or the main control chip is replaced,

708
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,590
the original software encryption

709
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,440
will be automatically invalidated.

710
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,360
I don't need to explain

711
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,480
such a simple truth to you, right?

712
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,000
Sorry.

713
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,280
I just delayed you a minute.

714
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,320
But then,

715
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,960
I have to delay you for a little longer.

716
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,920
This is the surveillance video of last Saturday afternoon

717
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,070
from a cafe on Nanchang Road.

718
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,070
What does that mean?

719
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,000
Tian Feng is really my senior.

720
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,400
I admit we should avoid suspicion before the competition.

721
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,760
But I haven't seen him for a long time.

722
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,480
We just met and had coffee. What's wrong?

723
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Any problems?

724
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
Any problems?

725
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,060
Really?

726
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,550
By the way, Feng,

727
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,840
can you discuss with Mr. Chen

728
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,150
and ask him to apply for a star prize with the organizing committee?

729
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,710
Think about it.

730
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,230
Haven't we made an agreement?

731
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,110
This is the cafe I went to that day.

732
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,320
The day I saw him.

733
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,510
Mr. Chen also needs to enhance his performance this year,

734
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,230
right?

735
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,550
If something goes wrong in the end,

736
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,960
the company must treat him as a joke.

737
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,590
How should I persuade Mr. Chen?

738
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,000
How about this?

739
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,590
I can give in three more percent

740
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,840
in the patent transfer fee.

741
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,960
Later,

742
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,510
for the annual patent transfer fee,

743
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,320
you will take 30 percent

744
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,190
and me, 70 percent.

745
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,230
Okay.

746
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,110
I'd have a try.

747
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,960
Look what you've done?

748
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,960
Mr. Chen.

749
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:50,880
Mr. Chen.

750
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,880
Mr. Chen, listen to me.

751
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,320
Li Xun.

752
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,000
I remember you.

753
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,030
This student,

754
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,590
I feel like you're

755
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,400
kind of breaching the rules of the competition.

756
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,510
This will also affect

757
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,030
your performance.

758
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,710
I see.

759
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,710
Then can you tell me

760
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,400
why you did this?

761
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,630
Because of love.

762
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,420
♫Everything is different when we watch the sky from the sea bottom♫

763
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,340
♫The person I used to be is gone♫

764
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,180
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

765
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,500
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

766
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,900
♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

767
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,030
♫We would bloom in the darkness♫

768
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,070
Li Xun, I love you!

769
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,190
You are so cool!

770
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,880
♫The knight and the king♫
Li Xun.

771
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,480
Li Xun.

772
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,940
♫Both stubborn, are having the same dream♫

773
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,840
♫Wherever I go, I just want to wander with you♫

774
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,260
♫My princess will never be sad again♫

775
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,280
♫If I am the king♫

776
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,980
♫Who is proud and arrogant like wild and wind weeds♫

777
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,700
♫I only want you to be at my side whatever it takes♫

778
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:04,160
♫And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning♫

779
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,400
You beat

780
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,880
us jury's face today.

781
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,440
That's good.

782
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,670
You finally supervised

783
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,440
the fairness and justice of our competition.

784
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,360
We will revoke this star prize.

785
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,440
But

786
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,190
you have to be punished.

787
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,150
I know.

788
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,070
By the way,

789
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,550
I have a project in Sanya this summer vacation.

790
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,230
It's still a secret stage.

791
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,510
Would you like to go with me?

792
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,150
Let me think it over.

793
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,760
You are putting on airs.

794
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,230
All right, see you later.

795
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,840
Let's go.

796
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,280
Fang Zhijing.

797
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,360
In fact, you are smart in some ways.

798
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,150
Some of your ideas are also correct.

799
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,590
In this world,

800
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,000
it's true to judge heroes by success.

801
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,960
But it's a pity.

802
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,320
You got the end time wrong.

803
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,630
There's still a long way to go.

804
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,280
It is not

805
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,030
over yet.

806
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:53,840
Okay.

807
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,630
I'm waiting for it.

808
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:00,590
Let's go.

809
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,840
Are you happy?

810
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,670
Then give me a smile.

811
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,190
Silly girl.

812
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,360
Are you so happy?

813
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,480
Yeah.

814
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,630
I've never been so happy.

815
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:39,880
That's good.

816
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,110
Otherwise, I will lose a lot.

817
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,110
Where did you go the other day?

818
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,480
You really think I can decode

819
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,590
Fang Zhijing's encrypted USB

820
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,360
within one minute?

821
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,230
I've been working for several days.

822
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,710
I'm so exhausted.

823
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,110
Li Xun.

824
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,150
What kind of person do you think can be called a princess?

825
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,360
Princess,

826
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,550
first,

827
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,550
must have a pair of lofty eyes.

828
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,510
In addition,

829
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,280
she must have an innocent and fragile heart.

830
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:42,880
Yes, of course.

831
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,360
If she has

832
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,840
a bit spirit of desperate adventure,

833
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,000
that would be better.

834
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,630
♫I pass by the world♫
You think he and I...

835
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,320
♫I pass by the world♫
Perfect match.

836
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,230
Slow down.

837
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,150
♫And pass through the night♫
Li Xun.

838
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,710
I want to start a business with you,

00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,480
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫

♫It's the intuition of the dream♫
I came to see you.

845
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:49,700
♫That breaks through the boundary♫
