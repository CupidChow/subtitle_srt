♫The person I used to be is gone♫

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,980
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,380
♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,260
♫We would bloom in the darkness♫

♫Like the white sails in night navigation are protecting the ocean♫

00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,940
♫I see a clear direction♫

♫Who is proud and arrogant like wild and wind weeds♫

[Episode 16]

21
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,960
Oh, thank you so much.

22
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,720
It's nothing.

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,440
I've added lots of WeChat accounts.

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,800
Come on.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,830
I specially booked crisp pastries.

26
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,800
They taste so good.

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,110
They're quite famous in Shanghai.

28
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,550
Come and have a taste.

29
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,470
Everyone can have a taste.

30
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,040
Come on.

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,670
Give you this.

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,000
Let others taste it. Let others taste it.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Well, come here. Come here.

34
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,230
Is it tasty? How does it taste?

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,400
It tastes good.

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,160
Yes.

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,510
I think this restaurant is good.

38
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,790
There is also one portion. This one.

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,790
Take it.

40
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,350
Thank you.

41
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,000
Have a taste.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,840
It tastes good.

43
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,400
It tastes very good.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
I entered the final, Li Xun.

45
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,670
Thank you very much this time.

46
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,230
Thank you.

47
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,280
Not at all.

48
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,510
Thank you for giving me advice.

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,790
Thank you so much.

50
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,000
It doesn't matter.

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,190
Are you Zhu Yun?

52
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,670
I heard from Gao that

53
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,840
you're also the main member of the Nanhu University Base.

54
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,440
May I have your WeChat account?

55
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,560
Let me have your QR code scanned.

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,040
Gao showed me the source codes

57
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,510
of your Blue Crown app a few days ago.

58
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,630
The source codes are concise and accurate.

59
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,910
It's a pity that

60
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,190
you don't participate in this competition.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,510
But there're also some problems with this competition.

62
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,230
What do you mean?

63
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,790
Some contestant

64
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,670
has managed to win by devious means,

65
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,160
greatly shocking us.

66
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,160
Do you mean our senior?

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,950
He's simply the shame of the School of Information Technology of our university.

68
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,040
It's rumored in the campus that

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,670
his tutor and sponsor once cooperated.

70
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,190
Knowing they set up a new studio recently,

71
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,840
his tutor and sponsor got several topics in advance.

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,880
When they almost finish them,

73
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,790
they can invite some students to do some tail-in work.

74
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,950
In this case, they can not only profit by patent sales,

75
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,950
but also win some prizes.

76
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,510
They keep the good points of both.

77
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,320
And Fang Zhijing,

78
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,070
who won the Special Attention Award in this competition,

79
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,120
to press the crystal ball with us.

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,670
Is he that student

81
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,440
we saw on the stage?

82
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,560
Yes.

83
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,280
It's just him,

84
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,630
Fang Zhijing.

85
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,000
Who are you talking about?

86
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,110
Xu Lina,

87
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,790
why didn't you invite me to dinner?

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,470
You're too busy to have dinner with us.

89
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,670
Zhu Yun,

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,110
it's really you.

91
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,430
I remember you're at Nanhu University.

92
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:41,990
Well,

93
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,790
you should have told me

94
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,790
you would come to our university,

95
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,160
so that I could

96
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,400
do the honors.

97
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,160
Can't you

98
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,160
recognize me?

99
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,520
I'm Fang Zhijing.

100
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,760
Long time no see, Fang Zhijing.

101
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,280
You're also here for the competition?

102
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,040
I didn't see your name on the list.

103
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,230
Were you eliminated?

104
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,470
It's funny.

105
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,520
She could design the Blue Crown app,

106
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,550
let alone the final.

107
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,160
You must be Li Xun.

108
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,790
Hello.

109
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,910
I've heard a lot about you.

110
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,910
I'm Fang Zhijing.

111
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,040
Your Blue Crown app

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,280
turns out to be a success,

113
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,640
but it's buggy every now and then.

114
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,310
It would be better if it could run smoothly.

115
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,790
It doesn't matter.

116
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,760
You're freshmen,

117
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,230
so it's normal for you to have some weaknesses.

118
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,160
Yes, it's normal.

119
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,910
Its DAUs are ten times more than the expected ones.

120
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,870
So we still need to upgrade the server.

121
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,670
It's a pity that

122
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,230
we can't fight it out

123
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,080
in the competition this time.

124
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,600
Well,

125
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,990
enjoy yourselves.

126
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,520
By the way, Zhu Yun.

127
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,870
Please tell me in advance

128
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,230
before coming to our university next time.

129
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,470
Such a supercilious guy

130
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,990
will invite his destruction sooner or later.

131
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,310
Yeah, I'm here.

132
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,080
Go upstairs directly.

133
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,670
Okay, bye.

134
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,430
Well, Zhu Yun,

135
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,350
do you have something else to talk with me?

136
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,870
If there's nothing, I'll leave first.

137
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,960
See you another day.

138
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,790
Do you still remember Xiaoyan?

139
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,870
Of course.

140
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,670
I went to see her at her cemetery

141
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,110
during the Spring Festival this year.

142
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,110
She has gone for so long.

143
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,160
I wish her well in heaven.

144
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,760
Honey, I'm coming.

145
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,110
Let me introduce to you.

146
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,200
This is my old classmate Zhu Yun.

147
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,870
This is my girlfriend Wu Yuxin.

148
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,470
Hello, Zhu Yun.

149
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,720
Let's go to dinner.

150
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,790
Your teacher is still waiting for you.

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,960
Be free.

152
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,760
The competition is a mere formality,

153
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,310
let alone the forum.

154
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,790
What do you mean by that?

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,430
I'm not interested

156
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,760
in the forum,

157
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,550
but our project team has cooperated

158
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,590
with the sponsor of this competition.

159
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,870
So they invited me

160
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,350
to the launch ceremony.

161
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,080
I'm leaving.

162
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,430
I'm the first prize winner

163
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,790
of this competition.

164
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,350
All right, just be quiet.

165
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,350
See you, Zhu Yun.

166
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,640
You told her too much.

167
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:56,870
Don't worry.

168
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,040
She can do nothing to me.

169
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,080
What would you like to eat today?

170
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,550
Zhu Yun,

171
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,640
where did you go?

172
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,230
What's the matter?

173
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,280
Let's go.

174
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,400
Zhu Yun,

175
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,310
we're leaving.

176
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,550
Speak.

177
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,790
Let's join in the competition.

178
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,950
It's a piece of cake for you.

179
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
As long as you take it a little seriously,

180
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,430
you can win as easily as winking.

181
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,910
Why do I waste my time

182
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,070
doing such an unimportant thing?

183
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,910
Li Xun,

184
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,360
let's join in the competition.

185
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,830
Why did you change your mind?

186
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,760
I just want to participate in it.

187
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,590
Tell me why.

188
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,880
Tell me why.

189
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,710
Won't you join it?

190
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,760
No, I won't.

191
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,040
You're also fed up with him?

192
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,910
Don't laugh at me.

193
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,190
No, no.

194
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,950
It's normal.

195
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,830
Ordinary girls can't stay with him for long.

196
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,400
Well, it's quite normal.

197
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,480
Why?

198
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,950
Li Xun has his own plans for everything.

199
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,910
Let me tell you.

200
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,910
I asked him to help me

201
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,550
design music synthesis software.

202
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,430
He was not available for a month.

203
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,040
Later, I paid him,

204
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,280
and he agreed to do it for me.

205
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,000
He'll start his own company.

206
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,280
He's prone

207
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,790
to suspicion,

208
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,710
so he can't accept their investment easily.

209
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,880
And he needs to save money to start his company himself.

210
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,400
Well,

211
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,910
why must you participate in the competition?

212
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,040
I just don't want that bastard to win.

213
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,400
I can't let him win the first prize.

214
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,670
Who?

215
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,430
Fang Zhijing.

216
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,880
My best friend in high school

217
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,910
was Liu Xiaoyan.

218
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,480
Xiaoyan was very close to a senior

219
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,520
in Senior Two.

220
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,240
She only told me about it.

221
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,920
[Vanilla]

222
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,310
It's melting.

223
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,240
Why don't you put it in the freezer and take it out later?

224
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
No one will take it away.

225
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,120
No.

226
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,360
What if someone else takes it?

227
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,950
He loves vanilla ice cream best.

228
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,590
You keep talking about him.

229
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,790
Who is he?

230
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:31,950
I'm here.

231
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,280
This is for you.

232
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,710
Vanilla ice cream. Thank you.

233
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,790
I haven't finished my homework. I'll leave first.

234
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,640
Bye-bye.

235
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,430
Bye-bye.

236
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
The last one.

237
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,640
It's hard for me to get it.

238
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,880
I told you

239
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,280
we'd better stay together secretly.

240
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,400
It was also on that day that

241
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,640
Liu Xiaoyan and Fang Zhijing's secret relationship

242
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,250
[The puppy love in Senior Three is exposed. Come and have a look!! Come and have a look]
was exposed on the school forum.

243
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,890
[The puppy love in Senior Three is exposed. Come and have a look!! Come and have a look!! [Including a photo]]

244
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,040
What's up?

245
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,910
Someone posted it to the school forum.

246
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,640
I got it.

247
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:41,830
The IP address

248
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,000
turns out to be our school computer room.

249
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,400
Someone in our school did it.

250
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,670
What a busybody.

251
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,590
Well,

252
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,280
we can say we happened to go home together.

253
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,430
My bike was broken, so...

254
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,590
Our teachers won't believe it.

255
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,790
It's the critical moment

256
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,760
for the selection of "Provincial Merit Student".

257
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,790
If it weren't for you,

258
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,360
there wouldn't have been such a mess.

259
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,520
Fang Zhijing was elected as the "Provincial Merit Student" for two consecutive years.

260
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,430
If he was elected thrice,

261
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,670
he could be recommended to the Information Technology University directly.

262
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,190
But Fang Zhijing was criticized at school

263
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,280
because of the photo.

264
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,280
Unexpectedly,

265
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,240
[Liu Xiaoyan: I've fallen in love with you since last semester...]
Fang Zhijing released his chat information with Xiaoyan out of context

266
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,910
[Liu Xiaoyan: Thank you, darling]
in order to get the recommendation certificate

267
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,400
and shifted all the responsibilities onto Xiaoyan,

268
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,790
making her the target of public criticism.

269
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,520
[More details! More disclosures!]

270
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,880
She's so shameless!

271
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,590
It's just her.

272
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,840
[Real killer moves in silence. She usually looks low-key, but she's such a coquettish girl.]
Good as she looks, she's such a nuisance.

273
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,190
[Real killer moves in silence. She usually looks low-key, but she's such a coquettish girl.]
Stop pretending.

274
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,950
Xiaoyan.

275
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,910
Why did you

276
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,280
post some of your QQ chat information with Xiaoyan

277
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,120
and deliberately nip off the information unfavorable to you?

278
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,910
Did you see me do it?

279
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,190
And it's none of your business.

280
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,070
But it's not the truth.

281
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,920
It's you who plague Xiaoyan.

282
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,480
Plague?

283
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,720
Do I plague her?

284
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,960
Xiaoyan is so kind to you,

285
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,040
but you hurt her ruthlessly.

286
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,590
If so,

287
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,790
why can't she sacrifice for me?

288
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,390
Xiaoyan is very sad now.

289
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,630
Go and see her.

290
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,040
It's really inappropriate for us to meet now.

291
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,350
If others find we stay together,

292
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,680
I really can't make it clear.

293
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,200
Then her sacrifice will become meaningless.

294
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,680
Then at least comfort her.

295
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,240
I said

296
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,720
I have no relationship with her.

297
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,920
Don't bother me again.

298
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,870
Fang Zhijing.

299
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,350
Fang Zhijing actually made a statement.

300
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,150
Fang Zhijing refuses her,

301
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,440
but she still plagues him shamelessly.

302
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,590
Xiaoyan seemed to live in darkness since that day.

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,760
Fang Zhijing was still a good student in everyone's eyes.

304
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,630
Xiaoyan became silent

305
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,960
until one day...

306
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,830
Zhu Yun, there was something wrong.

307
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,440
Liu Xiaoyan took sleeping pills.

308
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,150
How is she?

309
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,830
I don't know. She is still in the emergency room.

310
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,280
Liu Xiaoyan's family member?

311
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,790
I, I'm her mom.

312
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,240
The patient's central nervous system

313
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,720
has been inhibited by a large number of sleeping pills.

314
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,430
Because of long time of brain hypoxia,

315
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,480
she has brain death.

316
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,390
It's of no use to rescue her again.

317
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,920
How could this happen?

318
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,110
Aunt. Aunt. Aunt.

319
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,240
-Aunt. -Xiaoyan.

320
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,480
Xiaoyan.

321
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,830
Xiaoyan.

322
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,280
My girl.

323
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,550
Fang Zhijing.

324
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,680
My girl.

325
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,630
My girl.

326
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,790
What do you want to do?

327
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,550
Shame on you!

328
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,920
You know Xiaoyan is shy.

329
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,870
When she was laughed at by other students,

330
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,630
she still cared about your feelings.

331
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,720
But you

332
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,960
confused right and wrong

333
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,790
and caused her to be slandered by others

334
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,310
for a recommendation certificate.

335
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,760
Do you have a conscience?

336
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,070
I didn't ask her to take the sleeping pills.

337
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,630
It's because she had psychological problems.

338
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,960
Am I to blame?

339
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,070
As soon as I heard about her accident,

340
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,830
I rushed here.

341
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,200
I've done my utmost.

342
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,590
She killed herself because of you.

343
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,830
-It's you who killed her. -Zhu Yun.

344
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,070
It has nothing to do with me.

345
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,630
You can't say that.

346
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,760
The bad guys in the fairy tale world

347
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,550
will never come to a good end.

348
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,550
But we don't live in the fairy tale world.

349
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,440
The bad guy enjoys a good life,

350
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,310
with excellent studies and sweet love.

351
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,960
He feels as if nothing had happened.

352
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,440
He has no sense of guilt.

353
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,390
Why?

354
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,440
A bad thing

355
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,000
never dies.

356
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
The result proves everything.

357
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,310
I can't let him stand on the podium.

358
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,240
Never.

359
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,390
Why do you come to me suddenly?

360
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,200
You look serious.

361
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,280
Gao,

362
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,000
I want to participate in the information security competition with you.

363
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,520
Okay.

364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,150
You said...

365
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,240
I changed my mind.

366
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,830
Okay.

367
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,150
There're many groups in the competition.

368
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,200
To be honest, I'm a little unsure about it.

369
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,830
I thought to find helpers.

370
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,150
Do I need to register?

371
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,760
No.

372
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,440
I can add your name directly.

373
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,110
I'll send you the project progress later.

374
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:02,870
Okay.

375
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,480
Zhu Yun,

376
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,280
why do you want to join in the competition suddenly?

377
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,870
I want to win the first place.

378
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,720
Good.

379
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,200
I'll go to meet Mr. Lin.

380
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,070
Let's go together.

381
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,680
Let's go.

382
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,000
Look,

383
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,070
you've done a good job.

384
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,280
Keep calm.

385
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,720
Do you think my project can stand the test?

386
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,520
Yes, sure.

387
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,200
This is the printed list of the finalists of various universities.

388
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,070
Have a look.

389
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,550
Mr. Lin, you already read it.

390
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,870
So please help us make an analysis.

391
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,040
I don't have much to say.

392
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,720
Only some common universities

393
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,960
and national defense universities

394
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,110
have real strength in the computer science major.

395
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,480
I don't have much to remind you.

396
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,870
Remember,

397
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,960
it depends on your real strength.

398
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,760
Read it yourself.

399
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,680
There's a strong group in the Information Technology University.

400
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,440
Their project is practical.

401
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,100
It's estimated they can win a prize

402
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,110
and profit by patent sales.

403
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,870
Is their group leader named Fang Zhijing?

404
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,350
What's their competition topic?

405
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,000
Mr. Lin,

406
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,830
it's time to have a meeting.

407
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,070
Okay.

408
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,280
Don't forget to close the door when you leave.

409
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,280
[List of the Finalists of the "Jianguang Electronics Cup" First Nanhu University Students' Information Security Competition]

410
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,310
[Fang Zhijing]
USB Intelligent Encryption Interface.

411
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,070
Is his competition topic

412
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,070
"USB Intelligent Encryption Interface"?

413
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,200
It's very practical.

414
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,390
If he wins by this project and applies for a patent,

415
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,790
I guess lots of enterprises will compete to buy it.

416
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,040
What's the matter?

417
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,110
Don't worry.

418
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,200
Our project is not bad.

419
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,110
If we do it carefully, it's also competitive.

420
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,790
Gao,

421
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,350
let's go and invite Li Xun to join us, okay?

422
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,790
Why do you mention him suddenly?

423
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,480
He isn't interested in the competition.

424
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,070
I'll go and talk with him again.

425
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,440
We two can also make it.

426
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,960
You also want to win the first prize, right?

427
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,280
With him, we can win it for sure.

428
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,630
Are you so unsure of yourself?

429
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,140
No,

430
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,350
but the final is drawing near.

431
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,390
Or are you unsure of me?

432
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,520
That's not what I meant.

433
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,520
Whatever.

434
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Go and ask him yourself.

435
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,550
But don't miss

436
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,200
to defend the ARP spoofing attack.

437
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,590
Such an attack is always disguised as a gateway

438
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,310
or a host in the network.

439
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,870
So you need

440
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,440
to deploy some monitoring points in the network

441
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,480
to monitor the false ARP data packets,

442
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,040
find out

443
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,150
the ARP attack source

444
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,630
according to the false MAC

445
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,790
in the false ARP data

446
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,440
and finally deal with the attack source.

447
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,970
[Interception failed]

448
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,130
[Interception succeeded]

449
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,970
[Interception succeeded]

450
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,450
[Interception failed]

451
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,390
We can't resist the flooding attacks at all.

452
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,920
As long as the attack source is slightly disguised,

453
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,390
it can bypass our defense system.

454
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,040
I'll try again.

455
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,150
I'll go out to take the air.

456
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,630
Can you design

457
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,830
the encryption interface of the USB device?

458
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,110
What?

459
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,720
Can you design

460
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,000
the encryption interface of the USB device?

461
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,110
We work together every day.

462
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,310
What are you thinking about?

463
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,070
I'm serious. Can you design it?

464
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,240
If the encryption interface

465
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,550
is only made for functions,

466
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,760
we can find a single-chip computer as the main processor

467
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,590
and equip it with some interface chips.

468
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,550
I'm not familiar with hardware,

469
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,000
so it may take some time to design it.

470
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,830
It's easy to design the software

471
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,870
as I just need to deal with the interface firmware

472
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,110
and key management.

473
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Is it of high difficulty?

474
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,200
Why do you ask me this?

475
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,280
Princess, do you want to receive an outsourced project for us?

476
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,070
You've improved.

477
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,870
You know to find work for yourself.

478
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,870
I have to remind you.

479
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,390
Don't serve them at a low price.

480
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,520
Charge high for it.

481
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,150
How long will it take you to finish it?

482
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,550
It depends on the offer.

483
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,960
What if you are very, very satisfied with the offer?

484
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,070
Then it depends on the requirements.

485
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,590
I have very, very high requirements.

486
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,590
There're various kinds and degrees of encryption methods

487
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,870
in the world.

488
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,040
Advanced encryption is a process of continuous improvements.

489
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,310
But it won't take long

490
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,520
if it is only to realize the functions

491
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:47,920
of encryption interface.

492
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,280
What's up?

493
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,680
These are common sense questions.

494
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,240
Why do you ask me?

495
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,000
100,000 yuan.

496
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,280
Not enough.

497
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,280
This is just the deposit.

498
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,630
He's bursting with joy.

499
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,680
I know how much money

500
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,830
you have.

501
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,240
Princess,

502
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:20,830
I guess there's no one tenth of the deposit

503
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,760
in your card.

504
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,550
How can you pay me?

505
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,960
So I said it's the deposit.

506
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,550
Let me calculate.

507
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,830
I try to transfer 2,000 yuan

508
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,520

Flooding attacks

585
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,590
generate a large number of false MAC addresses

in the network,

587
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,920
so you

588
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,590
defend against them

589
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,150
by the strategy of configuring switch ports.

590
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,150
Spoofing attacks

591
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,720
will disguise themselves as gateways

592
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,590
or hosts in the network.

593
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,200
You choose to deploy some monitoring points

594
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,280
in the network

595
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,350
to detect false ARP data packets,

00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,070
find out the ARP attack source

597
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,070
according to the false MAC

598
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,550
in the false ARP data

599
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,000
and finally deal with

the attack source.

601
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,590
The idea is kind of feasible,

602

650
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,000
I remember the first time I got a computer,

651
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,520
I was so excited that

652

681
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,920
I think we should rewrite all the codes.

682
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,040
We don't need to rewrite all of them.

683
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,150
Just reconstruct the codes with problems, okay?

684
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,520
We must rewrite all of them.

685
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,710
We're pressed for time.

686
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,840
Your program

687
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,110
is like a swimmer in cotton-padded clothes.

688
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,520
We can't find its bugs in the beginning,

689
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,590
but more bugs will occur with time going.

690
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,710
By then, we can do nothing to improve it.

691
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,710
I deleted the previous program,

692
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,630
so let's rewrite.

693
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,920
Okay.

694
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,630
Gao,

695
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,360
are you alright?

696
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,670
Yes.

697
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,920
Both of us want to win.

698
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,070
It's good that

699
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,400
he can help us to win, isn't it?

700
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,000
I've stayed up late for several days,

701
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,960
so I'm a bit tired.

702
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,000
I'd like to have a rest in the dormitory.

703
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,710
Go back to rest early.

704
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,360
Go to sleep in the dormitory.

705
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,710
I have no time to sleep.

706
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,750
Li Xun,

707
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,630
be kind to Gao later.

708
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,920
Am I unkind to him?

709
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,000
He is still the project leader.

710
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,150
It's still he who will introduce the project

711
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,360
in the competition.

712
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,110
Am I kind enough to him?

713
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,630
What are you doing?

714
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm putting up a bed for you.

715
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,750
Sleep on such a bed?

716
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,070
It's a bit like a farewell ceremony.

717
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,920
You may die from overwork

718
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,040
if you keep staying up late.

719
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,960
You stay up late more often than me.

720
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,320
Don't compare with me.

721
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,750
Come here.

722
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,630
Come here.

723
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,880
Sleep.

724
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,270
Why are you staring at me?

725
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,960
Close your eyes and sleep.

726
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,270
All the lights are on. How can I fall asleep?

727
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,230
Haven't you slept?

728
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,590
I make a plan.

729
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,070
Don't worry about me.

730
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,270
As we're more and more pressed for time,

731
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,590
I should make a detailed plan,

732
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,320
so that we can arrange

733
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,840
every hour and every day effectively.

734
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,590
Li Xun,

735
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,400
be sure to win.

736
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,520
Be sure to win.

737
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,750
Don't worry.

738
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,430
You paid me, so I'll help you win.

739
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,070
You can ask me to do whatever you want

740
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,520
after the competition.

741
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,040
Write it down.

742
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,480
You said I could ask you to do anything I like.

743
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,400
Words alone are no proof.

744
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,400
Just put it down carefully.

745
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,440
But what you said is ambiguous.

746
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,190
You said it yourself.

747
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,040
After the competition,

748
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,270
Li Xun can ask me to do anything he likes.

749
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,230
Zhu Yun.

750
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,000
Why do you return me my bank card?

751
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,400
God knows how long

752
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,000
I can get your pay.

753
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,000
I just want this.

754
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,940
♫I pass by the world♫

755
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,260
♫And pass through the night♫

756
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,820
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫

757
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:37,820
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫

758
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,700
♫It's the intuition of the dream♫

759
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,420

Li Xun,

762
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,960
♫Spreads and later it wins the world for me♫
what I'll say is serious.

763
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,750
♫The clock keeps ticking♫
No matter what you want to do

764
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,040
♫The clock keeps ticking♫
and what goals you want to complete in the future,

765
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,590
♫I am leaning on your shoulder♫
you can count me in.

766
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,270
♫We won't break up♫

767
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,550
I'm not kidding.

768
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,070
♫Stay with me from the hustle and bustle♫
I'll keep my word.

769
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:24,580
♫It's the fulcrum of your palm♫

770
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,620
♫That gives me the courage to move forward♫

771
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:34,580
♫Just like the flame in the night♫

772
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,590
I know.

773
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,260

♫It's the intuition of the dream♫

782
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,000
It's an insult to the fairness of the competition

783
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,210
♫That breaks through the boundary♫
that you can win the special prize for this shabby project.

784
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,150
It's all cut and dried

785
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,590
You're using such unscrupulous means.

786
