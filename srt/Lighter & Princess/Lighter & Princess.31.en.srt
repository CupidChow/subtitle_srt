What time is it now?

00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,240
What time?

It's after ten o 'clock.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,990
It's the weekend.

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,550
Can't you just let me sleep in?

27

Come on.

28
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,630
We have guests at home at noon.

Why don't we eat out?

30

Haven't you had enough of eating out?

Get out of the bed.

32
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,880
Did you ask Xiuzhu over?

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,720
No.

34
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,320
Why not?

35
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,600
That's a family dinner.

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,720
Why should I ask him over?

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,630
He isn't our family.

38
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,470
How ungrateful you are!

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,230
He took care of you

40
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,400
when you were abroad.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,950
Now that he is alone in China,

42
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,400
of course we have to take care of him.

43
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,320
Even so, I don't have to ask him over.

44

I still owe him old duck soup.

48
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,630
So I did.

value family affection most.

58

How nice it is for the family to sit down together

59
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,320
and have a nice meal.

60

Mom, why are you talking about that?

61
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,000
What does it have to do with him?

62
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,600
Since he is here, we're a family.

63
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,000
It'll be a joke

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,230
if he mistakes the relatives.

65
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,400
Since when are we a family?

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,630
We are certainly a family.

Do you know it?

103
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,790
I only know that netstat is a program that

104
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,430
accesses the network and related information in the kernel,

105
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,990

But I am petty.

143
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,640
I don't want to admit that

144
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,670
you're just like other people in prison.

145
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,400
My mother forced me

146
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,960
to learn computer at the beginning.

147
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,760
But I got into programming

148
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,520
because of you.

149
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,720
I have to admit that

150
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,720
you got me interested in programming,

151
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,110
and you convinced me that

152
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,080
technology can benefit society,

153
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,200
so I look down on those

154
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,870
who use technology for evil,

155
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
and those who are complacent after doing evil

156
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,400
even more.

157
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,870
Hou Ning was in prison for some reason.

158
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,910
He was withdrawn

159
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,230
and was bullied badly when he was a kid.

160
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,990
Later, someone saw that he had good computer skills

161
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,280
and made friends with him.

162
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,070
His friend tricked him

163
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,590
into hacking accounts.

164
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,240
He spent six months in jail.

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
When he got out, his friend came to him again.

166
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,880
He believed again

167
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,880
and was arrested once more.

168
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,400
Good skills?

169
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,760
He was caught twice in all.

170
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,280
He was caught for the first time

171
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,760
because his friend was too greedy,

172
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,550
giving the game away.

173
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,590
He was caught for the second time because his friend benefited from both sides.

174
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,360
He asked Hou Ning to steal the important information of a company,

175
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,590
and sold it for a large amount of money.

176
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,040
The boss of that company offered a reward

177
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,910
to catch the hacker.

178
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,480
His friend came out

179
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,360
and sold him.

180
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,670
You can't always defend him like that.

181
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,830
He was already in jail once.

182
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,830
However, he didn't repent.

183
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,400
He was out of luck.

184
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,000
It's not about bad luck.

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,520
He knew what he was doing.

186
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,710
By bad luck, I mean

187
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,400
he didn't have anyone around

188
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,640
to pull him up.

189
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,710
You're awake?

190
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,070
Drink some water.

191
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,190
I can't feel my legs.

192
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,190
Are you unwell?

193
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,070
How many nights have you been up?

194
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,640
It was the same case in the van during the last team building.

195
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,190
Go to the hospital sometime.

196
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,000
You got up so early.

197
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,000
Going to bed early and getting up early makes us healthy.

198
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,670
I don't see you going to bed early.

199
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,590
The early bird catches the worm.

200
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,360
I'm going out to buy breakfast. What kind of worm are you going to eat?

201
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,760
Steamed buns stuffed with pickles.

202
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,950
You made do with it last night.

203
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,400
You have to catch up today.

204
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,280
Go.

205
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,880
Let's go to have a meal.

206
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,040
You live by photosynthesis, huh?

207
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,480
Nothing in the fridge. What do you eat?

208
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,000
Would you like braised beef

209
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,670
or stewed chicken and mushroom?

210
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,710
Are you such a good cook?

211
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,560
[Noodles with Braised Beef
Noodles with Stewed Chicken and Mushroom]

212
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,660
You won't eat anything but instant noodles.

213
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,040
I'll eat it if you cook it.

214
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,790
I'll cook it if you eat it.

215
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,240
I'll eat it if you cook it.

216
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,280
Hello, here is your order.

217
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,830
Thank you.

218
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,670
What are you looking at?

219
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,880
You've shaved all the meat off.

220
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,590
You do it.

221
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,670
I can't.

222
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,550
Then shut up.

223
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,550
Now I want to know what to do next.

224
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,830
Add it now. Add what?

225
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,070
Green onion.

226
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,830
Green onion?

227
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,760
Ginger.

228
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,430
Are you sure?

229
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,910
How did you live before?

230
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,550
You don't know how to cook, either.

231
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,830
That's normal.

232
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,310
We live and eat for free in prison.

233
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,550
Hou Ning used to do all this.

234
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,640
Do you think we can settle it by giving him some money?

235
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,000
Do you think he's after the money?

236
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,520
He's got a lot of character.

237
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,240
And that stupid game

238
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,640
has no money.

239
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,190
Don't take the opportunity to belittle my game.

240
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,520
He just won't let me leave him alone.

241
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,310
He's not a kid anymore.

242
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,240
He does act like a kid.

243
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,550
What should we do?

244
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,040
I'll try to contact him.

245
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
Did he get much data by hacking the background system?

246
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,550
Our system is susceptible

247
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,760
in front of him.

248
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
When to invade

249
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,430
and to what extent

250
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,710
depends on his mood.

251
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,400
Apply starchy flour.

252
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,310
What's starchy flour?

253
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,550
-I don't know. -This one.

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,710
Do it before cooking.

255
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,480
Now you...

256
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,790
No, I'm going to fry it.

257
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,280
Coming.

258
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,070
Let me take a look.

259
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,430
It isn't open.

260
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,000
It's burnt.

261
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,070
There is smashed cucumber.

262
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,910
Make do with it.

263
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,830
How does it taste?

264
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,430
Tasty.

265
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,240
Braised beef or stewed chicken and mushroom?

266
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,400
It is a question.

267
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,830
Have you figured out what to do with it?

268
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,880
Not yet.

269
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,950
Well, think again.

270
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,190
I think well.

271
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,400
I have no way.

272
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,180
You can't eat it.

273
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,550
It's a waste of food.

274
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,760
Zhang Fang is right.

275
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,910
You're incapable.

276
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,550
Which one do you want?

277
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,240
Don't you loathe me?

278
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,790
No.

279
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,880
Give me another bite.

280
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,240
Hou Ning.

281
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,040
He found you tracking him.

282
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,040
That's normal.

283
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,360
[Idiot]
He even translated for me.

284
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,830
He thinks I can't read English, huh?

285
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,670
He values UE.

286
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,830
You're going to do your dirty game again.

287
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,680
Aren't you looking for Hou Ning?

288
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,590
No.

289
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,280
No?

290
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,920
I can't find him.

291
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,350
Waste of time.

292
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,240
What if he attacks again?

293
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,440
Let him come.

294
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,590
I'm not afraid.

295
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,110
It's not my project.

296
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,110
It's no use staring at me.

297
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,520
I'm in charge of my project.

298
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,590
You don't care. I do.

299
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,240
I don't believe I can't find him.

300
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,310
Good luck to you.

301
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,240
Then give me the general direction.

302
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,350
You give up to me?

303
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,720
You are the one who has provoked him.

304
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,350
I find you've really changed a lot.

305
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,520
Did you ever talk to me like that?

306
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,070
Desperate rabbit will bite.

307
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,200
Yeah.

308
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,040
Even a worm will turn.

309
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,390
You're nice to everyone

310
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,200
except me.

311
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,040
Can you be objective?

312
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,760
To tell the truth, who cooks for you

313
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,000
and who cleans for you.

314
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,680
You can't survive a few days without me.

315
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,520
You feed me your burnt fish.

316
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,630
That's because you interrupted me.

317
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,110
I told you I would cook.

318
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,760
You didn't listen to me.

319
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,110
Can you?

320
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,390
Yes.

321
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,870
I'll walk you downstairs.

322
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,150
You haven't paid me yet.

323
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,790
I haven't paid you yet?

324
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,920
You want to get paid?

325
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,480
Yeah.

326
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,240
How much do you want?

327
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
How much is it for an hour?

328
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,040
Is 50 yuan enough?

329
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,480
Kind of.

330
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,480
Go.

331
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,200
OK.

332
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,350
You don't have your coat.

333
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,870
Come back. You don't have your coat.

334
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,310
It snows.

335
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,520
It's so cold. You don't have to see me off.

336
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,520
Go upstairs.

337
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,240
I'm not cold.

338
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,200
It smelts.

339
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,920
Maybe you're more cold-blooded.

340
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:57,790
Li Xun,

341
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,680
do you have any dreams?

342
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,630
Go on like this.

343
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,110
Then I'll go first.

344
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,350
Your Highness.

345
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
I have something to announce.

346
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,070
This is

347
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,440
the princess I invited here.

348
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,580
♫Take an unknown train♫
Why do you call me like that?

349
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,280
What should I call you?

350
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,520
♫And let love go to its destination♫
Li Xun.

351
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,390
♫And let love go to its destination♫
What kind of person do you think

352
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,680
can be called a princess?

353
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,150
♫The more we look forward to it, the more we fear injury♫
First,

354
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,550
must have a pair of lofty eyes.

355
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,390
♫And the more we fear leaving one day♫
In addition,

356
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,150
♫And the more we fear leaving one day♫
she must have an innocent and fragile heart.

357
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,280
♫Now the world it is upside down♫

358
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:43,920
♫And we were floating on the sky♫
Let me know when you get home.

359
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,140
♫Now the world it is upside down♫

360
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,380
♫Cause I'm so loving you♫

361
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,660
♫Now the world it is upside down♫

362
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:06,320
♫And we were floating on the sky♫

363
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,580
♫Now the world it is upside down♫

364
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,180
♫cause I'm so loving you♫

365
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,240
♫And you loved me too♫

366
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,150
Did you find the guy who hacked us?

367
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,310
It's not that easy.

368
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,110
I heard he knew Li Xun.

369
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,310
Don't be a busybody.

370
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,150
Li Xun.

371
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
What on earth is going on?

372
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,960
Look, they become buddies.

373
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,920
What do you think they're working on?

374
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,480
It's easy to guess.

375
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,920
Think about it.

376
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,590
What's the toughest thing for the company right now?

377
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,960
Hacker.

378
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,150
Li Xun found the right one.

379
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,520
With Mr. Dong here,

380
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,150
the hacker is basically stuck.

381
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,590
Mr. Dong doesn't know how to use computers. How can he catch the hacker?

382
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,760
You are

383
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,200
just too rigid.

384
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,680
Who do you think Mr. Dong is?

385
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,870
As long as you give him a phone and a photo,

386
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,830
there is no one in this city that he can't find.

387
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,720
Why didn't Li Xun go to Mr. Dong in the first place?

388
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,520
He may be afraid of

389
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,680
how Mr. Dong deals with it

390
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,680
when he finds the hacker.

391
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,870
What does it mean?

392
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,110
Mr. Dong always plays around with us.

393
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,310
If he gets really mad...

394
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,390
What is he going to do?

395
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,070
He is Mr. Dong.

396
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,240
What's up?

397
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,480
What did you discuss with Dong Siyang?

398
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,790
How are you going to find Hou Ning?

399
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,350
I don't know.

400
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,680
I always feel a little uneasy.

401
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,110
There is nothing to worry about.

402
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,630
Dong Siyang is more nervous than we are.

403
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,920
We can start again as many times as we fail.

404
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,310
He can't afford that anymore.

405
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,680
He's betting it all on our company.

406
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,280
If he wins, he bounces back.

407
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,870
If he loses, L&P stomps him to death.

408
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,630
Do you get me?

409
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,920
But if not for us,

410
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,440
Fang Zhijing and Gao Jianhong would not target the company.

411
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
What are you talking about?

412
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,590
People don't have to die if they keep their necks down, huh?

413
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,390
Remember,

414
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,390
there are only two roads in this world,

415
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,310
one waiting for death,

416
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,110
the other looking for death.

417
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,790
Dong Siyang is not a man waiting for death,

418
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,070
and neither are we.

419
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,790
So you can rest assured.

420
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,390
He will find Hou Ning.

421
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,590
That's what I'm most worried about.

422
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,870
Zhang Fang said if Mr. Dong was really mad...

423
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,480
Don't listen to that blabbermouth.

424
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,760
Dong Siyang has a sense of propriety.

425
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,200
You mustn't do anything stupid again.

426
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,630
Mind your own business,

427
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,590
and don't worry about it.

428
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,200
This is my own business.

429
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,380
[Msg. from an unknown source
You had someone come after me]

430
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,150
Has Hou Ning been found?

431
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,350
What will Dong Siyang do after finding Hou Ning?

432
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,720
I have no idea.

433
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,280
Why don't you get in touch with Dong Siyang?

434
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,110
I can't reach him.

435
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,150
You didn't even try.

436
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,830
Here we go again!

437
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,000
Are you finished?

438
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,920
If you want to know, ask yourself.

439
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,590
I can't find him.

440
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,350
Why don't you go back to your place?

441
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,520
You don't have any job, do you?

442
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,760
We must settle this matter today.

443
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,000
It's no use you worrying about that all day.

444
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,280
Why not?

445
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,590
I'm going to warn you one last time.

446
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,240
Blind Box of Love is winding down.

447
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,310
You can do this if you want,

448
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,790
but not now.

449
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,960
You're not getting anything done

450
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,200
until this is worked out today.

451
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,790
That's what you did last time.

452
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,350
Zhu Yun.

453
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,870
That's what you did three years ago.

454
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,760
We let it be when you were irritable

455
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,760
and went crazy.

456
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,720
No one asked you if you didn't say it.

457
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,390
But you ended up spending three years in prison.

458
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,790
There are better ways to do it.

459
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,520
We can do the project at any time.

460
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,070
If we can't do this one, we can do the next one.

461
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,590
But it's too late if you make a mistake.

462
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,310
Do you still remember what Mr. Lin said to you?

463
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,240
Follow the right path.

464
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,680
Mr. Dong said he would have a sense of propriety.

465
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,870
Is his sense of propriety the same as that of normal people?

466
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,310
You looked for him yourself

467
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,350
and didn't leave it to Dong Siyang at the beginning

468
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,110
just because you were afraid that Mr. Dong was too cruel, right?

469
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,480
I just want him to be cruel.

470
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,870
What do you mean by that?

471
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,150
Hou Ning needs to learn a lesson.

472
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,630
I'm going to use him,

473
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,520
but he's unscrupulous right now

474
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,430
because of some skills.

475
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,960
Dong Siyang should teach him a good lesson.

476
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,110
Well, what if Dong doesn't do it properly?

477
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,870
He shouldn't.

478
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,000
What does "should" mean?

479
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,550
No, you have to follow him.

480
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,960
Just in case.

481
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,200
You need to call him right now.

482
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,350
OK.

483
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:06,960
Hello.

484
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
How's that? Did you find him?

485
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,240
Yes?

486
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,040
Give me the address and I'll be there now.

487
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,000
Why are there two vans?

488
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,040
I hope there's nothing wrong.

489
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,040
I'll check it out.

490
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,550
You wait here.

491
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,550
I'll go in and have a look.

492
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,440
You wait in the car.

493
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,920
Close the windows and lock the doors.

494
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,320
OK.

495
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,150
Let go of me.

496
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,920
I'm telling you, I know who you are.

497
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,430
You are the boss of My Heart Flying Network Company.

498
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,070
You used to be a jerk

499
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,750
and even did time.

500
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,480
Didn't you do time?

501
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,190
Let me go.

502
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,360
Li Xun.

503
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,400
Li Xun, you're such a jerk.

504
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,520
You ganged up on me.

505
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,110
So much nonsense.

506
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,320
Ganged up on you?

507
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,270
Why did you hack my system?

508
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:49,960
You deserve it.

509
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,920
Go on.

510
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,040
Let go of me.

511
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,800
Work this out

512
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,230
between you two.

513
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,360
Don't be polite to him.

514
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,070
Do you hear me?

515
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,440
Hou Ning.

516
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,750
Turn around.

517
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
Be a man.

518
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,840
I'm a man.

519
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,440
You ganged up on me, didn't you?

520
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,360
I'm telling you.

521
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
I'm telling you, you dare not to let go.

522
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,840
You dare not to let go.

523
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,150
I dare not?

524
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,920
You dare not.

525
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:48,670
Do I dare?

526
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,230
I'm telling you, L&P is still on top of you.

527
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,440
You still haven't got your woman back.

528
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,920
Don't do this.

529
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,230
Do I dare?

530
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,230
Do I dare?

531
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,480
You do. You do. You do.

532
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:01,960
Do I dare?

533
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,400
You do.

534
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,800
Hou Ning,

535
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,800
if you do something wrong,

536
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,710
you will be punished.

537
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,360
Li Xun.

538
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,270
Go.

539
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,070
Did you see it?

540
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,750
Nothing.

541
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,520
Hou Ning is fine.

542
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,110
He's really fine.

543
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,110
Look at Hou Ning.

544
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,040
Isn't he there?

545
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,920
If you do something wrong,

546
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,880
you will be punished.

547
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,190
He's really fine.

548
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,070
We were just trying to scare him.

549
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,070
I've been regretting it.

550
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,400
I've been regretting it abroad that

551
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,070
I didn't stop you.

552
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,360
I was afraid you'd do

553
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,630
something stupid again on impulse.

554
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:34,100
♫Cause I believe I love you♫

555
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,660

561
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,480
♫True love will take it's course♫
You said there was no one around Hou Ning

562
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,220
♫True love will take it's course♫
to pull him up.

563
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,440
♫The hot firework♫
I was around you,

564

565

♫Keeps burning for me because of you♫

566
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,480
He said I was your knight,

567
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,920
but I was the first one to leave you.

568
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,370
♫Cause I believe I love you♫

569

♫The hot firework♫

♫Keeps burning for me because of you♫

580
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
What you're doing

581
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,920
is very bad, okay?

582
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:12,590
Yes.

583
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,710
Yes.

584
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,590
But we were just messing around.

585
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,270
Messing around?

586
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,110
Seriously,

587
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,670
you were kidnapping and threatening.

588
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,150
If Hou Ning hadn't let you go,

589
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,880
you'd all be in custody.

590
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,190
This is a really bad case.

591
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,670
We won't do it again.

592
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,920
But I was

593
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,880
so angry at the time.

594
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,040
That brat...

595
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:42,840
I was too impulsive.

596
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,230
I was too impulsive.

597
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,150
You can't break the law

598
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,040
just because someone else did.

599
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,840
Shall we get Hou Ning in custody

600
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,480
for breaking into your background system?

601
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,920
We won't hold him accountable.

602
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,800
You're tied, huh?

603
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,270
Give and take, right?

604
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,710
Do you think

605
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,630
I have anything

606
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,110
to add to this letter of self-criticism?

607
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Why do you think they were so bold?

608
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,110
That's quite normal,

609
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,840
because you are bold, too.

610
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,670
When Li Xun first got out of prison,

611
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,480
you didn't know anything about it,

612
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,230
but you were just desperate

613
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,630
to help him.

614
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,190
That's not the same.

615
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,150
What's the difference?

616
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,480
Men are desperate for career,

617
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,480
while women are lawless for love.

618
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,520
God

619
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,630
is fair.

620
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,520
I've always been scared,

621
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,880
and I've been even more scared since he got out.

622
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,400
I feel like I'm so terrified that

623
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,670
I fear more

624
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,440
his accidents than his failures.

625
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:49,880
Don't panic!

626
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,630
That's OK.

627
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,110
He behaves himself for the time being,

628
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,040
because you're with him.

629
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,710
So I decided not to go.

630
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm not leaving again.

631
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,070
What's the mess?

632
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,800
Who are those guys?

633
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,920
I haven't seen them before.

634
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,920
What are you guys doing here?

635
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,400
Who are you?

636
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,920
I work here.

637
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,440
What are you doing here?

638
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,110
I'm here to work.

639
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,840
Don't you have the day off?

640
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,480
What are you doing here?

641
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,270
Where is Hou Ning?

642
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,190
Are you unlawfully detaining him?

643
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,710
Nonsense. We are not.

644
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,360
I just received education in the police station.

645
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,920
We brought him here

646
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,880
and offered him good food and drinks.

647
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,520
He went in and didn't come out.

648
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,590
We couldn't talk him out of it.

649
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,750
You can

650
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:27,840
talk to him.

651
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,000
You don't want to see Li Xun stand up,

652
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:53,590
right?

653
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,440
As long as Li Xun farts,

654
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,840
you would come up and smell it.

655
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,590
What are you doing?

656
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,270
In the past, you copy others.

657
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,920
Now you dare to steal the source code?

658
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,840
I will give them the source code directly.

659
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,190
Companies like that

660
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,190
are not worthy to be our competitor.

661
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,460
♫That breaks through the boundary♫

662
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,640
♫The first sight♫

663
