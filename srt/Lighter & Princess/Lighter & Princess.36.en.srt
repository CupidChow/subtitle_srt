00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,670
He still doesn't want to see me?

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,320
Don't think too much. Have the surgery first.

24
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,600
Let's talk about other matters after you recover.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,320
Even if I'm dying,

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,000
he still doesn't want to see me?

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,880
Right?

28
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
What's wrong with you, Gao?

29
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,320
I'll call the doctor.

30
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,630
I told Fang Zhijing.

31
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,070
At that time,

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I was supposed to have a bright future.

33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,910
I could finally get rid of his shadow.

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,350
But he provoked Fang Zhijing.

35
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,470
He insisted.

36
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,230
I begged you.

37
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,350
I begged you desperately.

38
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,120
Why didn't you lower your head once?

39
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,120
You know

40
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,350
he did it for you.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,950
I know.

42
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,000
I know.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,440
But when Fang Zhijing came to me that day,

44
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,880
I was so angry.

45
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,630
I hated him.

46
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,910
I just wanted to destroy him.

47
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,230
I told Fang Zhijing

48
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,350
Li Xun's sister lived in the Guojiao Hotel.

49
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,230
He'll keep an eye on you

50
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,910
as he said.

51
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,280
I don't need to waste my time.

52
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,070
But for his sister coming here,

53
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,510
he won't let you go.

54
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,040
When she leaves,

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,470
he'll try many ways to make you suffer.

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,440
I just wanted to teach Li Xun a lesson.

57
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,160
I didn't expect the result.

58
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,870
I never thought Li Lan would die.

59
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,720
I was afraid that things would be exposed.

60
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,200
I was afraid that Li Xun knew from Fang Zhijing

61
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,760
I said it.

62
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,840
I could only make him hate Fang Zhijing more.

63
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,310
I was scared.

64
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,990
Do you understand?

65
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,840
I was really scared.

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,790
I always want to forget

67
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,160
this matter.

68
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,080
But I can't forget it.

69
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,550
I also dreamed that,

70
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,110
the three of us

71
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,080
stood on the top of the mountain,

72
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,400
talking about Blue Crown's APP.

73
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,520
In my dream, the three of us,

74
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,110
on the day when we had the farewell dinner at the base,

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,080
we stood on the roof

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,040
and chatted about our dreams and future.

77
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,550
Our L&P

78
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,280
will always leave you a position as the partner.

79
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,550
You will always have a share

80
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,960
in our L&P.

81
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,430
Eternal trio.

82
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,200
At that time,

83
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,310
the days were so good.

84
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,990
I always recall

85
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,990
these things.

86
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,600
The more I think,

87
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,310
the more serious headache I have.

88
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,870
The more it hurts,

89
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,720
the more I hate him.

90
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,520
We shouldn't be like this.

91
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,670
He was wrong.

92
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,640
He forced me. He kept stepping on me.

93
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,230
He asked me if I regret.

94
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,430
Zhu Yun, go ask him.

95
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,790
Ask him.

96
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,600
Ask him whether he regrets or not.

97
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,600
Gao.

98
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,310
Everyone would make mistakes.

99
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,280
Li Xun has forgiven you.

100
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,670
Impossible.

101
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,200
How can he forgive me?

102
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,310
He shouldn't have forgiven me.

103
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,790
It's me.

104
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,160
It's me who wanted to step on him.

105
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,280
It's me who stopped him standing up.

106
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,310
It's me.

107
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,160
Don't think too much.

108
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,670
Go and have the operation first, OK?

109
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,110
I won't have it.

110
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,790
I know it's useless to have an operation.

111
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,160
I know.

112
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,520
The surgery department urged again.

113
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,550
Director Liang still has surgery behind him.

114
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,640
Tell them.

115
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,200
I won't have it.

116
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,520
Gao.

117
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,640
I'm tired.

118
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,670
I just want to take a break.

119
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,840
I won't have it.

120
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,350
I'm tired.

121
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,600
I just want to take a break.

122
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,230
Let Gao Jianhong answer the phone.

123
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,960
It's Li Xun.

124
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,720
Gao Jianhong.

125
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,640
Aren't you convinced?

126
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,550
If you are not convinced,

127
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,080
come through the operation.

128
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,360
Wait a minute.

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,670
Zhu Yun.

130
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,790
Ask him.

131
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,480
If he regrets a little bit,

132
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,590
tell him

133
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,360
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,360
Don't worry.

135
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,360
You will be fine.

136
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,240
Will Li Xun regret it?

137
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,240
I can answer for him.

138
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,430
No.

139
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,640
At least he'll never admit it.

140
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,640
He was so lonely for the first half of his life.

141
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,640
He was almost alone

142
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,760
and as stubborn as a stone.

143
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,120
He seldom admits mistakes,

144
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,480
so how can he say regret

145
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,950
and negate the road he have taken?

Go talk to them.

I'm not going.

152
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,360
Okay.

153
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,830
I want the name of L&P.

154
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,950
Okay.

155
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,310
He will use another method

156
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,910
to express his feelings.

157
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,160
I always believe that his heart is soft

158
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,790
and it will become softer and softer.

159
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,430

or a ripe peach,

161
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,790
he'll become increasingly sweet

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,040
to keep confidential the information

173
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,430
that can not be obtained from public channels

174
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,480
during the negotiation, signing and implementation of this agreement.

175
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,160
Thank you for agreeing to a settlement.

176
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,160
Gao also agreed to it.

177
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,430
He's having rehabilitation training these days.

178
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,550
He is more active than anyone else.

179
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,160
He doesn't want to come.

180
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,160
Maybe he doesn't want to face it.

181
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,550
This is a joint decision of all clients.

182
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,040
We are a small company.

183
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,120
We need to consider the future.

184
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,710
If the consumption is too high,

185
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,950
the loss will outweigh the gain.

186
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,790
We all know

187
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,590
there are no joint decisions.

188
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,910
Only Li Xun can make a decision from beginning to end.

189
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,760
No matter it's due to

190
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,760
past friendship or sympathy,

191
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,790
I'm grateful to him.

192
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,590
At least Gao's efforts can be kept partially.

193
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,760
What are you thinking?

194
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,950
Everyone in this building

195
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,430
doesn't know what L&P really means.

196
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,880
They don't know

197
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,430
how many passions and ideals are contained

198
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,400
and the days of struggle in this name.

199
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,280
You're emotional.

200
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,120
Sometimes I really envy you and Li Xun.

201
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,830
At your age,

202
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,640
you can still fight to the end for a name.

203
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,640
I really can't compete with you

204
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,400
in your persistence.

205
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,880
Look.

206
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,000
Still so handsome.

207
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,670
Let's go.

208
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,000
We've signed on it. Let's go for lunch.

209
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,950
Okay.

210
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,190
Someone just said you're still so handsome,

211
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,280
You did?

212
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,400
Let's go.

213
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,040
Teng,

214
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,950
this is all yours.

215
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,070
Put it in.

216
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,520
Somewhat…

217
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,950
Look.

218
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,520
The former picture.

219
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,280
Xiaojian.

220
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,710
I just put two new rolls of paper in the toilet.

221
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,070
Don't forget to pack them.

222
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,590
Unbelievable.

223
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,670
Our company

224
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,430
is just to be redecorated.

225
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,360
Who will take your little shit?

226
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,710
Listen, Fang.

227
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
If you still keep

228
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,310
your habit

229
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,400
of being mean,

230
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,520
you really can't find a wife.

231
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,430
You guys earn income and I cut down expense.

232
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,950
Right?

233
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,640
We should finish our tasks

234
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,790
to make our company bigger and stronger.

235
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,760
Isn't that the truth?

236
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,360
Fang.

237
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,590
It's unnecessary.

238
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,590
The handsome Group Leader Li is here.

239
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,360
He can earn enough money for you.

240
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,880
Is it necessary for you to save money?

241
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,120
He will run out of his talent one day.

242
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,590
Don't you have to be vigilant in peace?

243
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,000
I do want to quit.

244
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,120
Look. He is out.

245
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,120
Now, Li Xun announces several things.

246
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,400
The first thing.

247
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,430
Zhu Yun and I are not going to developing games anymore.

248
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,880
We leave it to Zhao Teng.

249
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,280
Shouldn't you discuss this with me?

250
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,070
Gosh.

251
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,120
Second,

252
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,760
our company will change its name

253
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,550
to L&P.

254
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,680
Everyone of you is the original shareholder.

255
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,590
Really?

256
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,280
Yes.

257
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,830
Shareholder?

258
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,550
Finally.

259
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,070
L&P will still be in charge of Mr. Dong.

260
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,110
Okay, this is great.

261
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,960
Wait for a while.

262
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,240
The second thing. The second one.

263
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,150
What does it mean?

264
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,760
Shareholder?

265
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,240
I, we are both shareholders?

266
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,550
Yes.

267
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,040
I, I'm getting rich?

268
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,760
Yeah.

269
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,000
I get rich!

270
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,280
This meal is on me today,

271
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,550
Xiaojian,

272
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,390
Burn my two rolls of paper to celebrate it!

273
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,630
I'm also a shareholder.

274
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,960
Mr. Dong's treasury can be cast away.

275
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,630
Buy a new one.

276
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,870
We are a game company with a current income of more than 100 million yuan.

277
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,680
Finally, we can have ice bars whenever we want.

278
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,480
Think about it.

279
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,150
Not long after

280
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,520
Group Leaders Li and Zhu came here,

281
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,680
we have already become rich.

282
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,110
What do you think

283
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,870
we can be in three years?

284
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,520
Let me start.

285
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,760
My plan is

286
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,440
after I come back

287
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,000
from studying abroad

288
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,720
three years later,

289
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,070
I want to give my girlfriend

290
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,680
an unforgettable wedding.

291
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,310
Then I will go abroad and marry a girlfriend.

292
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,630
That's hard.

293
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:44,960
Mr. Dong.

294
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,830
Buy a private plane

295
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,760
and apply for a pilot silence.

296
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,150
You're going to carry passengers with a plane?

297
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,000
I won't have a traffic jam.

298
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,350
It's not difficult.

299
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,480
You're talking big.

300
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,310
How about you, Group Leader Zhu?

301
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,870
You.

302
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
I think the express site at the door is too noisy.

303
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,790
You want to ruin it?

304
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,520
They put too much stuff every time.

305
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,590
Everybody wants it to move away.

306
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,830
Actually, it's not difficult.

307
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,150
Half a year later, this floor will be ours.

308
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,040
Excuse me.

309
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,870
Is this Flying Company?

310
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,000
Zhu Yun.

311
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,550
Well, Yun.

312
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,200
I heard that

313
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,390
Xiuzhu has returned to France for an exhibition.

314
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,000
Why didn't you tell us?

315
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,280
Dad,

316
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,790
mom,

317
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,760
I do have something to tell you.

318
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,870
No hurry.

319
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,110
Let's go home first.

320
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,310
We should have a good chat.

321
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,040
Why don't you close the door?

322
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,590
Is it necessary?

323
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,550
Everyone can enter your house, right?

324
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,000
When did he come out?

325
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,350
A long time ago.

326
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,070
He came to you as soon as he was released?

327
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,440
No.

328
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,960
I went to find him.

329
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,760
Why did you do that?

330
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,070
How long are you going

331
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,790
to keep this from me and your father?

332
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,590
Mom.

333
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,440
Let's talk in peace.

334
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,630
The time when I returned home to apply for a visa,

335
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,920
he was released and I came across him.

336
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,760
I didn't intend to stay.

337
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,040
But then I learned that

338
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
the company we founded together was robbed away.

339
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,920
So I decided to stay and start a business with him

340
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,070
to take back the company.

341
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,790
Xiuzhu also knows it.

342
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,870
He didn't hold a painting exhibition here.

343
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,350
Great.

344
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,830
So you guys worked together to cheat us.

345
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,240
You are really able enough.

346
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,390
Now you know it.

347
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,960
We're together again.

348
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,390
Zhu Yun

349
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,110
Listen up.

350
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,920
I don't agree with you.

351
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,150
Your father won't agree.

352
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,000
We disagreed a long time ago.

353
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,280
We won't agree in the future.

354
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,760
We'll never agree!

355
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,680
Who is he?

356
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,680
He was in prison.

357
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,920
This is a lifelong stain for him!

358
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,070
He can't get rid of it.

359
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,920
We were all wrong back then.

360
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,790
But everyone paid the price.

361
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,440
Li Xun is really extreme sometimes.

362
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,960
But he's already changing.

363
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,240
Leopard can't change its spots, you know.

364
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,960
How much can he change?

365
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,440
You're right.

366
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,590
Now that you know

367
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,790
he just can't change

368
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,150
the firmness in his bones,

369
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,070
no matter how long we are apart,

370
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,870
I would still fall in love with him so easily.

371
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,390
You what?

372
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,550
You were brainwashed by him.

373
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,390
You are Zhu Yun's father?

374
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,440
Let's have a chat.

375
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,310
I heard Yun mention you.

376
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,520
That means

377
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,920
she's been working for you this period of time?

378
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,310
Your daughter is my boss now.

379
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,830
She works for herself.

380
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,550
What's your point?

381
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,280
I want to talk about them two kids.

382
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,520
Talk about children?

383
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,960
Do you have kids?

384
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
No. I'm single.

385
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,200
No wonder.

386
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,350
Then maybe you can't understand

387
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,960
the parents' heart to their children.

388
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,040
To be honest,

389
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,280
Yun's mother is indeed a little emotional.

390
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,960
But we do so for her.

391
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,720
We want to avoid detours for her

392
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,680
so that she won't feel wronged again.

393
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,680
I don't like this.

394
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,280
Your daughter dates Li Xun,

395
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,390
which is a detour

396
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,790
and will make her fell wronged?

397
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,630
You are bullying Li Xun

398
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,150
who has no grown-ups to support him?

399
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,440
So you are here

400
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,070
to support Li Xun?

401
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah.

402
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,680
Today, I want to represent his elder

403
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,000
to chatter with you.

404
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Okay, tell me.

405
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,280
What's good and special

406
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,440
about Li Xun?

407
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,830
I'll just mention one thing.

408
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,310
Without him,

409
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,280
my company has already collapsed.

410
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,830
Is he excellent

411
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,630
and special?

412
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,310
Go on.

413
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,870
Brother,

414
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,110
it's hard for them

415
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,000
to be together.

416
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,070
You know

417
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,760
your girl can't let Li Xun go.

418
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,760
Right?

419
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,040
What's this called?

420
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,520
It's called obsession.

421
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,630
You should know your girl's character

422
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,590
better than I do.

423
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,830
Can you two stop

424
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,960
them in this way?

425
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,310
Besides.

426
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440
Who didn't make mistakes when young?

427
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,280
You can't never let go

428
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,680
a mistake made by Li Xun.

429
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,240
You show no mercy to those in the wrong when justice is on your side.

430
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,000
I agree with you on this point.

431
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,550
It's true that Li Xun is a

432
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,200
very special child,

433
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,040
disobeying common sense.

434
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,440
But this kind of genius always

435
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,920
has half of devil incarnation.

436
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,790
I think you,

437
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,590
you are great.

438
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,790
You can be persuaded.

439
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,590
But it's no use

440
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,110
telling me this.

441
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,310
You have to go up and talk to your wife.

442
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,440
No, no, no.

443
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,000
When I go up, it'll really become a big accident scene.

444
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,960
Why do we talk about this here?

445
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,520
Actually, to tell the truth, I think

446
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,440
it's up to them

447
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,040
to make a decision.

448
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,960
I love that.

449
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,440
It will take a while for them.

450
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,550
There is a noodle shop nearby.

451
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,630
The noodles with sweet and sour pork ribs are very good.

452
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,040
Let me buy you a bowl of noodles.

453
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,040
How do you know I like sweet and sour pork noodles?

454
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,550
You really love it?

455
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,830
Let's go.

456
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,590
Go.

457
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,440
You're not welcome here.

458
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,830
I want to talk to my daughter about something.

459
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,070
You don't want to come in and listen, right?

460
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,790
Mom.

461
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,350
I'll save you face today.

462
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,200
But I hope you can stop.

463
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,720
I won't let my daughter be with you.

464
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,960
Mom.

465
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
This is our home

466
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,200
You have no right to interfere.

467
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,960
You have no right to make a decision.

468
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,110
Zhu Yun.

469
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,520
I gave birth to you and raised you up.

470
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,630
You said I have no right now?

471
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,240
Aunt.

472
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,680
You can put forward any conditions.

473
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,920
My condition is that, you

474
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,280
do not show up in front of us again.

475
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,240
My daughter has been good,

476
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,240
clever and sensible since childhood.

477
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,870
But since she was with you,

478
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,920
she seemed to be possessed by evil.

479
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,830
Do you know how

480
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,200
you tortured us family?

481
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,720
Mom, if that's your attitude,

482
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,150
we can't talk anymore.

483
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,150
Then we won't talk.

484
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,480
I'm not here to chat with you.

485
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,590
I don't want to quarrel with you.

486
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,960
But I'm telling you exactly.

487
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,760
This is our only daughter.

488
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,870
We don't want her to marry you.

489
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,760
Aunt.

490
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,870
You are Zhu Yun's mother.

491
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,960
No matter I like to listen to what you said or not,

492
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,480
I have to finish listening.

493
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,870
I just said,

494
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,150
you can put forward any conditions.

495
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,550
I will try my best to satisfy.

496
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,040
We are not

497
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,720
that kind of snobby

498
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,070
and unreasonable family.

499
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,870
Our requirements for future son-in-law

500
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,720
is that as long as

501
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,520
he has a happy family

502
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,870
that is equal in social status as us.

503
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,760
My daughter never made any mistakes since childhood.

504
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,440
Her husband should be clean as well.

505
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,920
That's not too much, right?

506
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
If you can do something

507
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,870
to clean up the stains on your file

508
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,200
and invite your parents

509
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,440
to sit together with us

510
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,150
to talk it over.

511
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,630
I think I can agree.

512
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,480
What's your opinion?

513
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,790
Aunt.

514
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,630
Zhu Yun has the ability to change the world.

515
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,200
You just want her to listen to you.

516
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,760
You, you.

517
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,440
I beg your pardon?

518
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,830
It depends on you, Dad.

519
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,310
I will try.

520
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,760
Are you hungry?

521
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,310
There is a good

522
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,070
noodle restaurant nearby.

523
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,680
I'll treat you.

524
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,830
You didn't leave?

525
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,000
I have been here all the time.

526
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,350
Your mother is so good

527
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,960
and forthright,

528
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,830
why was her daughter so timid?

529
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,870
I wasn't timid.

530
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,390
But don't blame her.

531
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,040
She has been a teacher for decades.

532
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,520
This is her thinking inertia.

533
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,550
I apologize to you for her.

534
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,480
Princess.

535
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,390
You take me as a fragile doll again.

536
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,480
Never mind.

537
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,110
We have a lifetime

538
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,590
to convince her.

539
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,830
What are you reading?

540
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,520
That book you gave me.

541
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,150
Is it wonderful?

542
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,680
Not bad.

543
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:06,680
Zhu Yun.

544
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,310
Why don't we do something practical?

545
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,040
What do you mean?

546
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,630
If you want a massage, just say it.

547
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,040
That arm.

548
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,760
It's over?

549
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,960
Your hand.

550
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,150
Have you finished it?

551
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,200
Is there a reward?

552
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,830
Reward?

553
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,760
You even ask for a reward?

554
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm ticklish.

555
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,150
Reward.

556
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,390
Li Xun.

557
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,110
Let's have a baby.

558
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,480
You want to use a child against your mother?

559
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,520
It has nothing to do with this.

560
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,150
Then why do you suddenly want to have a baby?

561
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,350
I want the baby to accompany you.

562
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,760
You're one and a half years older than me.

563
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,070
You're almost thirty.

564
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,550
It's the right age.

565
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,790
But it still depends on you.

566
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,520
We just got together

567
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,150
and your career is not stable.

568
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,440
Most importantly,

569
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,040
we're not married.

570
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,230
We have no birth permit.

571
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,000
Forget it

572
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,960
Forget it?

573
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,840
Why don't you just forget it?

574
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,800
I want a baby too.

575
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,880
Let's have one.

576
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,110
Really?

577
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,880
Yes.

578
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,840
That's it?

579
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,710
That's it.

580
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,040
Go somewhere with me tomorrow.

581
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,550
I'm leaving then.

582
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,320
If you need anything, please contact me.

583
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:49,880
Okay.

584
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,150
This house is…

585
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,630
I bought it.

586
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,920
You bought it here?

587
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,920
Or why did I bring you here?

588
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,630
You didn't come to work the day before yesterday and yesterday

589
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,710
because you went to buy a house?

590
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,880
That's a quite speedy deal.

591
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,710
How much did it cost?

592
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,400
Why do you ask how much?

593
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,590
I don't trust you in spending money.

594
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,070
Are you applying for a loan or borrowing money from others?

595
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
I borrowed usury.

596
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,270
I borrowed money from Ren Di.

597
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,400
Would you like to visit it?

598
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,040
Show me around.

599
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:55,630
Okay.

600
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,630
Zhu Yun.

601
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,320
I've always had no idea about family.

602
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,800
I think marriage

603
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,320
is just a long love.

604
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,230
The most important thing in love is to be happy.

605
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,230
I don't want you to sacrifice a lot.

606
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,040
I hope you are happy

607
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,520
when staying with me.

608
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:38,920
And what about you?

609
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,360
Are you happy with me?

610
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,040
It's not bad.

611
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,440
So Can I take the last sentence

612
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,630
as a proposal?

613
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,520
Zhu Yun.

614
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,960
We need to do something meaningful together.

615
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,550
Don't you ask what it is?

616
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,920
What's it?

617
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,590
Excuse me?

618
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,440
Are you here to get married?

619
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,590
Of course.

620
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,520
All of you?

621
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,840
Yes. Yes.

622
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,670
Get away.

623
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,480
No. No.

624
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,150
They came with us.

625
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,840
You have many family members.

626
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,710
Only a couple can get in for a time.

627
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,190
Everyone else is waiting outside.

628
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,550
Please show me your account book and ID card.

629
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,110
Go.

630
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,230
Okay, just a moment, please.

631
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,480
Are you nervous?

632
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,070
Yes.

633
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,590
You still have time to regret.

634
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,040
I'll go in later.

635
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,230
You can't rob this chance, okay?

636
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,040
All right?

637
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:17,630
Okay.

638
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,190
Okay.

639
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,630
You are quite nervous?

640
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,270
I…

641
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,270
You're not married yet.

642
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,800
Let go.

643
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,230
But to be honest,

644
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,190
you look too casual when you get the marriage certificate.

645
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,000
Look at us.

646
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,550
Yeah, we are dressed up.

647
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,190
Yes.

648
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,270
Look, we are all dressed up.

649
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,920
It hasn't been washed yet.

650
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,550
What?

651
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:41,480
Shirt.

652
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,230
No.

653
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,400
It's no use your mother comes.

654
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,190
It's legal.

655
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,520
Look at the camera.

656
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,150
Look at the camera.

657
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,480
You two, stand closer.

658
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,440
Smile. Smile. Smile. Smile.

659
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,190
Laugh happily.

660
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,880
Li Xun

661
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,670
I ask you to smile,

662
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,000
not to sneer.

663
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,800
Hurry up.

664
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,920
I'm afraid they would come to stop us.

665
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,840
Smile. Okay.

666
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,440
Smile. Smile. Smile. Smile.

667
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,150
Three,

668
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,320
two,

669
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,520
one.

670
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,880
Come on in.

671
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,480
Hello. Hello. Hello.

672
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,630
It's so beautiful,

673
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,880
Change your shoes. What are you doing?

674
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,230
Should I change my shoes?

675
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,670
No need. Just go straight in.

676
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,230
No need to change.

677
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,880
By the way, Group Leader Zhu,

678
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,400
a lucky star shines a good place.

679
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,360
Smile every day.

680
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,270
I wish our dear Political Commissar Zhu

681
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,880
happiness in new house and marriage.

682
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,710
Take this couple electric toothbrush

683
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,070
as a witness of your love.

684
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:43,920
What a coincidence.

685
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,480
I just bought a pair the other day.

686
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,590
It's also the marble black and white couple style.

687
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,230
It's a coincidence.

688
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,230
This pair can be

689
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,400
given to Ren Di and Liu.

690
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,840
What a coincidence.

691
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,590
Here you are. My gift.

692
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,480
Thank you, Mr. Dong.

693
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here you are.

694
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,230
Good luck. Thank you.

695
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,360
Congratulations to Mrs. Li.

696
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:00,920
Thank you.

697
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,920
It's too big.

698
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,670
How about you? You came empty handed?

699
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,110
Then you robbed my roommate away

700
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,630
and made me pay the rent myself.

701
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,630
You ask me for a gift now?

702
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,840
He is good at calculating.

703
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,920
Come and see the lake.

704
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,520
The lake looks very comfortable.

705
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,230
This is surrounded by a lake on four sides, three sides.

706
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,880
Take a seat. I'd like to get you some water.

707
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,960
Do you have any drinks?

708
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,520
You can have a look.

709
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,440
It's good. Gentle winds blow.

710
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,710
Ready?

711
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,190
Hurry up.

712
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,960
Okay. Hurry up.

713
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,040
Get closer. Get closer.

714
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:35,710
Get ready.

715
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,440
Get ready.

716
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:37,840
Okay.

717
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,920
One, two, three.

718
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,800
Later, our game Invincible General

719
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,270
is ranked top three in the annual list.

720
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,000
But Dong Siyang's greatest wish

721
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,750
is still to become a five-star driver.

722
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,040
Ren Di and Liu are finally engaged.

723
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,800
Gao Jianhong and Xu Lina

724
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,150
exit the company's operation

725
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,710
and find a place to recuperate.

726
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,960
Fang Zhijing is

727
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,630
reported by his company's shareholders for embezzlement

728
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,440
and taken away by the police.

729
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,880
Sometimes I feel the world

730
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,110
is like a battlefield.

731
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,920
Everyone is struggling to resist.

732
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,360
Some people die in battle,

733
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,320
some give up

734
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,040
and some are still fighting.

735
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,920
Fighting requires great strength and courage.

736
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,630
I don't have that much skill.

737
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,800
So I can only be a follower.

738
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,070
But he does.

739
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,270
Is it good to

740
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,440
be married?

741
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,110
Yeah.

742
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,800
People said

743
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,440
marriage is the tomb of love.

744
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,920
I can't see it.

745
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,550
There is a saying.

746
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,960
If time could stop at the moment when we first met.

747
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,750
If time could stop at the moment when we first met.

748
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,400
If people really look back on their lives

749
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,400
on their deathbed,

750
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,710
she

751
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,400
may be the last person

752
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,110
