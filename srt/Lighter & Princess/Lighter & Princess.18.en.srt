Li Xun,

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,040
thank you for helping me today.

23
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,040
I'll wait for you at Wenshan Lake

Do come.

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,720
I have something to tell you.

27
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,160
You're really going?

28
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,440
Go back to rest.

29
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,040
You're busy for the whole day.

30
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,070
Why didn't you refuse her?

31
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,750
Did she give me the time to refuse her?

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,720
Let's go.

33
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,070
Well done, Li Xun.

Hello.

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,320
Help me, Ren Di.

44
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,230
You were robbed?

45
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,190
No.

46
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,670
Is it about Li Xun?

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,510
Go ahead.

48
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,040
How do you know that?

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,880
Well.

50
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,320
Isn't it about him?

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,560
Yes.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,070
Tell me.

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,630
Another girl likes him?

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,750
What kind of girl is she?

55
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,720
She is good-looking.

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,560
What do you think now?

57
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,350
Ren Di,

58
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,560
I want to ask you a question.

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,510
If I confess initiatively,

60
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,040
will I be looked down upon?

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,470
Li Xun always looks down upon others

62
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,400
whether you take the initiative or not.

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,840
It's difficult for you.

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,280
Who is more beautiful,

65
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,880
that girl or Liu Sisi?

66
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,470
Both are beautiful.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,880
Come on.

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,400
You stay with Li Xun every day.

69
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,950
Why can other girls get a chance

70
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,630
to get close to him?

71
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,400
I was too busy to pay attention

72
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,440
to that these days.

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,070
Here is my advice.

74
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
Strike first to gain the advantage,

75
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,630
or you'll always be single.

76
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,190
But what if I will confess first and be declined?

77
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,560
Then I will advise you again.

78
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Men are like canteen's food.

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,520
Men are like canteen's food.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,990
Though the food doesn't look delicious,

81
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,550
it will be sold out if you're late.

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,080
But I don't think Xu Lina

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,160
is his type.

84
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,310
If you know

85
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,520
what his type is,

86
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,760
why bother calling me now?

87
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,280
Don't flatter yourself.

88
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,040
Li Xun looks free and easy,

89
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,350
but he won't accept others easily.

90
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,230
Emotion is his weakness.

91
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,110
So you have to make up your mind.

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,840
Don't betray him once you confess.

93
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,670
Ren Di,

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,310
give me a favor.

95
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,470
Well,

96
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,910
what kind of hairstyle do you want?

97
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,040
Try all of them.

98
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,720
OK.

99
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,400
Do you think it looks good?

100
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,520
I think with this hairstyle,

101
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,990
you can just put on a wedding dress

102
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
and go to the church.

103
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
You're so late.

104
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,910
I went to fetch it right after my performance.

105
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,520
It's Xu Lina's fault.

106
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,040
No one will confess in the morning.

107
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,350
Hurry up.

108
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,910
Come on.

109
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:02,910
Go.

110
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,310
Do you think he and I...

111
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,990
A perfect match.

112
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,910

♫Have you ever changed?♫

♫I've been walking so long♫

176
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,520
What are you smiling at?

177
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,120
Hypocritical.

178
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,280
Who?

179
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,760
Who?

180
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,550
Who?

181
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,120
Who?

182
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,590
Who?

183
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,190
Who?

184
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,790
Who?

185
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,670
I have my king.

186
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,640
I'll always be loyal to him.

187
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,910
I will fight for him

188
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,950
and die for him.

189

[Three years later]

00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,660
[Year of 2015]

191
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,310
I understand your feelings very much.

192
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,310
But it's over.

193
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,550
Yes.

194
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,910
Chen Tao is excellent.

195
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,240
I believe with his own efforts,

196
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,400
he can also be admitted to the School of Graduate.

197
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,790
Bye.

198
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,590
Miss, what can I do for you?

199
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,910
Have you read the list of recommended students publicized downstairs?

200
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,160
Not yet.

201
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,830
Why, why is there no Fang Shumiao on the list?

202
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Hello, Shumiao.

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,830
Where are you?

204
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,190
I'll talk with you later.

205
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,950
I'm dealing with a murder case in the hospital.

206
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,640
Murder case?

207
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,310
Wu Mengxing,

208
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,310
how great you are!

209
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,360
We're going to graduate,

210
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,310
but you get a punishment record.

211
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,040
I don't think you need to take the postgraduate exam.

212
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,590
What a coward!

213
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,190
He even reported such a thing.

214
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,950
You aren't a coward,

215
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
but you were badly hit.

216
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,360
I can't understand.

217
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,430
Did I ask you to help me?

218
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,400
I can't bear seeing
it.

219
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,880
He was bullying you.

220
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,480
You wrote the paper.

221
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,830
Now we're both involved.

222
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,950
That's what you want?

223
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,480
Wu Mengxing, please go to window No. 2 to get the medicine.

224
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,120
There are drugs for external use and oral administration.

225
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,670
Go back and take them.

226
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,640
Are, are you leaving?

227
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,830
Otherwise?

228
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,880
You can walk by yourself.

229
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,550
You want me to send you back?

230
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,280
She hasn't come in yet?

231
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,240
She is calling.

232
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,430
What happened?

233
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,120
It smells delicious.

234
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,790
I dumped the jerk

235
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,120
and he removed my name

236
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,120
from the paper we wrote together.

237
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,710
Is it necessary?

238
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,950
He should list you as the second author, at least.

239
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,590
He did it on purpose.

240
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,790
He dated me

241
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,070
because I'm a native.

242
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,190
But he got

243
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,950
nothing from me.

244
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,310
He should nurse a grievance.

245
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,240
You're hardheaded.

246
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,040
Zhang Zhicheng,

247
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,670
are you a man?

248
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,910
You take your undeserved gain for granted.

249
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,790
You're going too far.

250
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
Listen.

251
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,910
Go to students' affairs division tomorrow morning

252
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,480
and cancel Wu Mengxing's punishment record.

253
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,280
There's a world of difference

254
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,760
between men.

255
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Fang Shumiao's ex-boyfriend

256
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,590
is a drag on her study.

257
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,310
However, Zhu Yun and her boyfriend

258
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,360
are making progress together.

259
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,830
When will you and Li Xun

260
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,520
take the exam for postgraduate recommendation?

261
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,040
Tomorrow.

262
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,640
Go for it.

263
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Enjoy the food.

264
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,240
Enjoy the food. I'm hungry.

265
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,070
There are eggs.

266
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,360
Hello, Ren Di.

267
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,640
Have you finished your exam?

268
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,400
Tell Li Xun

269
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,280
the room is settled.

270
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,950
I paid for him first.

271
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,280
What room?

272
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,710
An office.

273
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,880
He wants to rent an office?

274
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,790
Yeah, he's starting a company.

275
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,790
Don't you know?

276
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:24,870
Hello.

277
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,520
Why didn't you take the exam?

278
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,550
Is it today?

279
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,310
You don't plan to take the postgraduate recommendation, right?

280
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,870
I didn't say I'll go to the School of Graduate.

281
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,310
I'm going to suspend school and start a business.

282
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,000
What are you going to do after graduation?

283
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,200
Set up a company.

284
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,830
Why didn't you tell me?

285
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,200
Nothing tangible is yet in sight.

286
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,280
What can I tell you?

287
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,480
You've even found an office.

288
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Ren Di knows that you want to rent an office.

289
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,680
I'm the only one in the world who doesn't know.

290
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,920
Isn't it ridiculous?

291
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,870
Is this the so-called storm center?

292
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,790
I want to tell you after it's all set up.

293
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,590
Inform me after it's all set up?

294
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,110
What do you think?

295
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,480
Did you ask me?

296
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,280
Have you ever wondered what my mother will do

297
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,440
if I give up the postgraduate recommendation

298
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,440
and start a business with you?

299
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,310
What will she do?

300
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,680
She'll kill me.

301
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,680
Do you include me in your plan?

302
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,550
Li Xun,

303
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,150
I always think I'm close to you,

304
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,390
but I still can't understand you.

305
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,480
I heard everything

306
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,070
about you from others.

307
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,790
I feel that I'm doing a jigsaw puzzle.

308
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,350
I'm your girlfriend.

309
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,630
I want a place in your future.

310
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,790
Is that unreasonable?

311
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,760
I don't want to talk with you.

312
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,830
Zhu Yun.

313
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,000
Zhu Yun.

314
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,070
How unfortunate!

315
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,870
I met the wrong person.

316
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,720
My whole life is destroyed. Zhu Yun.

317
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,590
You said you'll fight for me.

318
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,590
What?

319
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,870
Now are you going to abandon me?

320
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,680
Cut it out.

321
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,140
♫A moment of palpitation♫

322
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,760
Leave me alone.

323
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,020
♫As long as you're by my side♫

324
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,080
♫I forgot time unconsciously♫

325
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,520
You'll take oral test later, right?

326
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,870
None of your business.

327
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,260
♫Without you, even joy feels lonely♫

328
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,590
Dine with me after the test.

329
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,150
I have no time.

330
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,300
♫I feel full warmth and endless love♫

331
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,870
What's wrong?

332
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,110
Your back hurts again?

333
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,440
I'll pick you up after the test.

334
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,590
What to do?

335
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,040
Have a big dinner.

336
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,790
I have no time.

337
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,630
You must eat.

338
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,630
I have no appetite.

339
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,440
You must eat.

340
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,790
No.

341
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:19,790
Eat.

342
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,200
No.

343
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,520
Eat.

344
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:20,830
No.

345
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,390
Play scissors paper stone.

346
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,870
The loser shall drive the other one back.

347
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,110
Scissors, paper, stone.

348
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,630
Scissors, paper, stone.

349
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,920
♫At a moment, in reversely flying days♫

350
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,390
Go.

351
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,110
Drive me there.

352
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,960
Go. Come on.

353
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,200
♫By my side, or on my pillow♫

354
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,740
♫You say every good night♫

355
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,630
Run. Run.

356
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,680
Leave me alone.

357
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,200
Be careful.

358
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,390
Hold tight to me.

359
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,310
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

360
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,480
Stop.

361
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,240
Reach out.

362
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,790
Press it.

363
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,200
Are you ready?

364
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,440
Really?

365
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,040
Yes.

366
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,040
You bring me here for dinner?

367
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,520
This is our new company.

368
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,280
New company.

369
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,110
Really?

370
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,310
Yes.

371
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,960
To make you the first one

372
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,870
who see the new company,

373
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,960
I moved all the furniture in myself.

374
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,000
I think you just don't want to pay.

375
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,630
Now the company is founded.

376
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,550
Each expenditure

377
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,310
shall be approved by all shareholders.

378
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,550
Who is the other shareholder?

379
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,870
I won't tell you.

380
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,630
Anyway, she is a strong shareholder.

381
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,590
Like me,

382
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,920
she holds 50% of the shares.

383
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,310
I have no money.

384
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,790
I can only invest technologically.

385
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,280
Money-mad.

386
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,480
You're high profile.

387
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,280
You rent such a big place for a new company.

388
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,520
Come back.

389
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,590
Out there belongs to other companies.

390
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,920
This is a shared office.

391
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,830
Only this room belongs to our company.

392
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,790
Stingy.

393
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,870
I have a question.

394
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,310
Can you install furniture?

395
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,390
You're cruel. You always exploit me.

396
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,040
Over there is a shared storage.

397
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,440
Fetch the tool box for me.

398
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,550
Go.

399
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,830
Don't disturb staff in other companies.

400
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,630
Turn right.

401
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,920
What's this?

402
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,280
This is

403
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,000
L&P.

404
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm asking you

405
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,200
the meaning of these two letters?

406
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,520
This is the name I gave the company.

407
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,550
Did you ask the shareholders

408
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,590
before giving the name?

409
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,070
The name is meaningful.

410
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,390
What is it?

411
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,110
Lucky & Power.

412
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,350
L&P.

413
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,390
Come on.

414
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,480
Isn't it Lighter & Princess?

415
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,390
Lighter & what?

416
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,240
Princess.

417
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,870
Tell me what it means?

418
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,520
Lighter & Princess.

419
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,870
I see. That's what you think.

420
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,550
Isn't it?

421
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,440
Princess,

422
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,630
don't be so narcissistic,

423
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,150
right?

424
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,070
Listen to me for such an important thing.

425
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,200
I'll be responsible for the name of our company

426
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,920
and all external explanations.

427
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,390
We'll do what you said?

428
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,550
Why?

429
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,000
I also hold half of the shares.

430
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,350
I have objection to the ownership structure.

431
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,760
Now that we each hold 50% of the shares.

432
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,830
Who will decide if we don't agree

433
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,550
with each other?

434
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,520
What do you want to do?

435
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,110
-We must... -What do you want to do?

436
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,920
What do you want to do?

437
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,760
What do you want to do?

438
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,760
What do you want to do?

439
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,150
I don't want anything.

440
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,280
What do you want to do, Zhu Yun?

441
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,830
I don't want anything.

442
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,150
What do you want to do?

443
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,590
Do you give up?

444
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,920
Do you give up?

445
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,390
Yes.

446
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,110
Say yes.

447
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,790
Yes.

448
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,550
Then claim your shares.

449
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,520
OK.

450
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,960
Will you claim them or not?

451
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,000
Will you?

452
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,480
Yes.

453
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,240
How many shares?

454
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,070
50%.

455
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,480
Who will decide?

456
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,440
I will.

457
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,920
Who will decide?

458
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,350
I will.

459
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:39,790
Repeat it.

460
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,790
I will.

461
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,350
Who will decide?

462
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,680
I will.

463
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,110
Who are you?

464
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,790
I'm Zhu Yun.

465
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,590
Really?

466
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,680
Who are you?

467
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,070
What about my studies?

468
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,110
You can continue to study

469
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,760
or go to work.

470
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,440
If you want to study abroad,

471
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,830
I'll stay here and wait for you.

472
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,680
Do whatever you want.

473
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,960
I'll support you.

474
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,520
Li Xun,

475
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,040
I want to start a business with you.

476
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,480
Let's start from L&P.

477
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,720
He isn't a student of our university.

478
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,350
But his shape is like that of Li Xun.

479
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,390
Hi.

480
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,960
Not at all.

481
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,390
Do you have time?

482
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
I want to ask you something.

483
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,440
No.

484
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,550
Hey. Hey.

485
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,150
I want to ask you about someone.

486
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,790
Who?

487
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,760
Is there

488
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,280
a blond boy here?

489
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,760
There are many blond boys in our school.

490
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,150
Which one do you mean?

491
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,150
The one with the blondest hair.

492
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,630
Are you ordering?

493
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,960
The most handsome and best guy.

494
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,720
Is he

495
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,960
Li Xun?

496
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,590
You're clever.

497
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,200
Well. Follow me.

498
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,070
Xun.

499
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,720
I come to meet you.

500
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,870
Why are you here?

501
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,870
Where is your blonde?

502
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,280
Where is your blond hair?

503
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,280
Where is your blond hair?

504
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,680
What are you doing here?

505
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,870
Nothing.

506
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,150
I came to see you.

507
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,720
Why do you dye your hair black?

508
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,040
None of your business.

509
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
I'm really not used to it.

510
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,390
Great.

511
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,720
It looks plausible.

512
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,000
Do you want to have some water?

513
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,040
Thank you.

514
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,240
You're his girlfriend?

515
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,680
Just make a greet.

516
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,150
Don't shake hand.

517
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,630
Come on. Sit down.

518
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,390
Are you really his brother?

519
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,630
Of course.

520
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,520
Why isn't your surname Li?

521
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,480
We're cousins.

522
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,350
If you don't mind,

523
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,280
you can call me Li Yizhuo.

524
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,520
Don't talk to a fool.

525
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,830
or you'll become a fool.

526
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,870
I'm not a fool.

527
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,590
We haven't met each other for a long time.

528
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,960
Can't I come to see you?

529
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,440
No.

530
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,960
Why?

531
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,480
Why don't we go out and dine?

532
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,040
I'm not hungry.

533
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,680
I can't eat as I like.

534
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,870
Why?

535
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,520
Do you know what I do?

536
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,200
Can't you tell from my dress?

537
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,240
Opera singer?

538
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,240
Come on.

539
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,590
I have to show you something.

540
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,480
Watch it

541
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,240
5, 6, 7, 8.

542
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,440
1, 2, 3, 4.

543
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,200
For the first time in my life,

544
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,390
I feel that I have

545
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,720
a small vocabulary.

546
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,280
OK.

547
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,550
Stop.

548
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,960
What's wrong with you?

549
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,390
Can you tell it?

550
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,150
You know that I'm a dancer,

551
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,440
so I can't eat as I like.

552
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,790
Forget it.

553
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,680
You aren't a dancer.

554
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,070
You keep practicing the same things.

555
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,390
No wonder you dad said you're wasting time.

556
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,920
You're so harsh.

557
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,440
I dance well.

558
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,630
They're really relatives.

559
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,680
What do you think?

560
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,550
Great.

561
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,550
Which aspect?

562
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,590
You're in good shape?

563
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,590
How tall are you?

564
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,240
Only

565
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,070
185 cm.

566
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,110
Stop talking with him.

567
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,240
He's a Latin dancer.

568
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,720
He's a bad dancer without a partner.

569
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,790
You're still solo now.

570
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,350
A bad dancer?

571
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,720
Am I a bad dancer?

572
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,280
I'm an experienced Latin dancer.

573
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,390
You haven't seen my progress recently.

574
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,590
What are you doing here?

575
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,310
I came to you for something.

576
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,000
No.

577
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,440
Think about it.

578
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,480
No even if I think about it again and again.

579
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,390
Xun,

580
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,960
I'm doing it for you.

581
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,760
Fu Yizhuo,

582
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,480
we haven't contacted each other

583
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,350
since we were expelled from school?

584
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,960
Do you understand?

585
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,920
Go.

586
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,480
No.

587
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,200
No.

588
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,630
Then I'll go.

589
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:03,830
Go.

590
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,760
Where are we going?

591
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,720
Close the door when you leave.

592
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,440
What's going on?

593
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,480
Nothing.

594
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,790
You decline before

595
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,070
listening to him.

596
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,200
Trivia.

597
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,830
What's the connection between you and his family?

598
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,350
We have no connection.

599
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,790
Why did he come to you?

600
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,720
Go.

601
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,590
What's wrong?

602
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,720
Why do you stop?

603
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,590
You hide everything from me again.

604
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,350
Li Xun,

605
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,200
you're not alone now.

606
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,680
We need to talk with each other.

607
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,040
I see.

608
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,480
Let's go.

609
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,790
Where?

610
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,440
Go to talk with each other.

611
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,000
Go to talk with each other at home.

612
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,630
But you left him in the office.

613
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
Just let him stay there.

614
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,680
We need someone

615
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,240
to dispel the smell in the new office.

616
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,000
He is the right one.

617
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,070
What did Fu Yizhuo want to talk with you?

618
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,070
Nothing else.

619
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,110
His father wants to enter in the technology industry

620
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,240
and wants to invest in our company.

621
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,200
That's great. Why do you decline?

622
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,550
Princess,

623
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,440
do you know what I like most

624
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,200
about you?

625
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,870
What?

626
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,720
Be serious.

627
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,550
What I like most about you is that

628
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,680
you'll never figure out

629
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,110
what you're thinking.

630
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,040
Tell me

631
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,630
what it is like.

632
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,360
Look.

633
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,920
You just do things directly.

634
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,590
You're always as good as your words

635
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,670
as if you sign contracts with others.

636
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,270
But you know what,

637
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,480
few people will work

638
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,230
following the contracts.

639
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,750
You're quite similar to Fu Yizhuo.

640
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,230
Really?

641
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,110
Yes.

642
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,630
We were more similar to each other when we were little boys.

643
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,360
I made my first big income

644
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,270
from him.

645
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,110
When I was a junior,

646
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,800
I took

647
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,670
a very important exam for him.

648
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,360
I got full score for all subjects.

649
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,270
He gave me 1,000 yuan.

650
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,590
That's a big sum.

651
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,920
Unfortunately, we were caught due to lack of experience.

652
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,480
When he was going to take the unified exam,

653
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,960
his dad threatened

654
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,230
to prevent him from dancing

655
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,520
if he couldn't get the graduation certificate.

656
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,150
You know what happened later.

657
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,550
Because of the accident,

658
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,590
I was on familiar terms with your mom.

659
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,040
That was the first time I saw you.

660
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,670
Through your window,

661
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,000
I saw a lot of balloons and streamers

662
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,550
hung in the room.

663
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,270
Everyone talked and laughed.

664
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,150
You cut the cake in the center.

665
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,800
It was like a fairy tale world.

666
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,190
Fu Yizhuo's father

667
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,400
started out as a steel worker.

668
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,070
He is doing big business.

669
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,230
But he should also predict that it'll be difficult

670
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,190
for the real industry in the next few years.

671
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,110
I think he wants to prepare for it.

672
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,480
I heard that he poached many elites

673
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,590
in the Internet technology industry,

674
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,040
but he doesn't know anything

675
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,110
about the industry.

676
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,190
Why does he want to meet you?

677
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,710
He said he wanted to make investment.

678
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,840
Actually, he wants an expert

679
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,590
under his control to work for him.

680
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,880
Then you'd better not go.

681
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,630
You're lovely.

682
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,000
Are you still angry?

683
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,000
It's a waste of time for me

684
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,110
to talk so much.

685
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,800
I don't agree.

686
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
We're communicating.

687
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,440
I see.

688
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,000
I won't send you back.

689
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,590
I'm going out tonight.

690
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,480
What are you going to do?

691
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,440
To arrange everything for that fool.

692
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,400
I don't think he is clever enough to do it

693
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,800
or take care of himself.

694
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,550
What's wrong?

695
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,670
You said we should talk with other.

696
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,550
Now you explain nothing to me.

697
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,070
I found a rule.

698
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,040
What is it?

699
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,840
Someone is so nice to

700
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,880
those who call him younger brother.

701
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,070
I also found a rule.

702
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,880
What is it?

703
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,190
I can be nicer to those

704
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,710
who call me elder brother.

705
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,550
Call me brother.

706
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,000
No.

707
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,670
Come on.

708
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,000
No.

709
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,520
Call me brother.

710
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:56,840
No.

711
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,400
Will you? Will you?

712
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,040
Will you? Will you?

713
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,230
Fu Yizhuo fought fiercely

714
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,400
with his dad.

715
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,670
He wanted to dance,

716
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,040
but his dad didn't think he could make it.

717
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,630
Fu Yizhuo had no friends

718
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,270
except me.

719
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,360
Great.

720
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,150
Good job.

721
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,400
Hi, Li Xun's girlfriend.

722
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,360
Hello.

723
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,000
My name is Zhu Yun.

724
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,320
You thought of that!

725
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,000
You left your phone number in my bag.

726
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:18,630
Thanks.

727
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,630
Only you can convince Li Xun.

728
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,320
I have no choice,

729
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,230
so I turn to you for help.

730
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,630
I just saw you dancing there.

731
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,230
He looked like what Li Xun said.

732
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,960
Like what? A wire pole.

733
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,520
Never mind.

734
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,750
I'm used to it.

735
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,710
He came to see me yesterday

736
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,270
and told me a lot

737
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,840
about you two.

738
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,670
What?

739
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,550
He said you pursued him

740
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,230
with great efforts.

741
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:58,710
At first,

742
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,150
he didn't even think about it.

743
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,920
However, you threw yourself at him.

744
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,110
You didn't leave even if he drove you away,

745
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,590
so he agreed to date you.

746
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,960
He is really harsh.

747
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,630
I know it's overstated.

748
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,230
I can guess what he

749
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,320
told you about me.

750
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,070
Like telling stories,

751
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,590
he tells only the outline

752
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,000
but never the details,

753
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,880
because he never shows weakness,

754
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,800
especially in front of those who he cares.

755
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,040
But why do you always call him Xun?

756
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,880
Is this a special nickname between you two?

757
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,270
Did he tell you something about him and me?

758
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,590
Which aspect do you mean?

759
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,840
Xun's girlfriend...

760
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,110
My name is Zhu Yun.

761
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,710
Do you want to know

762
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,110
exactly how he and I met?

763
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,320
Little Li Xun

764
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,190
was co cute.

765
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,840
How did you two know each other?

766
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,710
Promise me one condition.

767
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,710
Then you'd better not say anything.

768
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,320
I don't know if you'll tell me the truth.

769
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,480
I'll tell you the truth.

770
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,270
Who can testify?

771
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,710
My sincerity extends

772
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,400
as far as my heart goes.

773
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,440
Li Xun is right.

774
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,070
You're really a fool.

775
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,000
OK.

776
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,840
I trust you,

777
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,270
or I won't come here.

778
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,070
What did he tell you

779
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,840
about how we met?

780
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,230
A mistake.

781
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,520
What a great mistake!

782
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,630
How can he say that?

783
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,400
I think it was a deliberate plan.

784
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,520
Back then we were students

785
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,840
of the best high school in the city.

786
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,520
But I didn't like school.

787
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,440
I always played truant in the first year of senior high school.

788
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,110
I met him once.

789
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,550
Come on. 1, 2.

790
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,670
I, I, I...

791
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,750
Go.

792
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,520
Wait.

793
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,670
Our schoolbags.

794
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,440
Go fetch them.

795
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,040
Leave them there.

796
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,920
My homework is in the schoolbag.

797
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,840
Now that you skip class, why bother caring your homework?

798
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,960
Go fetch them down there.

799
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
You want to do your homework?

800
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,590
I can do it for you.

801
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,150
20 yuan a subject.

802
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,440
It's too expensive.

803
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,190
It's too expensive?

804
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,040
50 yuan a subject

805
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,480
and a review.

806
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,150
What do you think?

807
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,800
Deal.

808
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,360
I have no money.

809
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,150
I'll pay for you.

810
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,550
Hello. What are you doing?

811
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,360
Which class are you in?

812
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,270
Nothing. I'm walking.

813
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,840
Later, he always did my homework for me to earn money.

814
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,590
He seemed to always be

815
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,630
short of money in high school.

816
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,520
Later I learned that

817
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,920
his mother was terminally ill.

818
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,000
Happy New Year!

819
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,270
Happy New Year!

820
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,480
I decided to go abroad.

821
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,040
I went to Xu Lina.

822
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,710
Lina,

823
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,840
will you give me a chance?

824
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,070
She said

825
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,880
she likes you.

826
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,620
