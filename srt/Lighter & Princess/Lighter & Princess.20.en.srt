♫Everything is different when we watch the sky from the sea bottom♫

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,820
♫The person I used to be is gone♫

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,980
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,380
♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,260
♫We would bloom in the darkness♫

00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,940
♫I see a clear direction♫

[Episode 20]

21
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,670
Hello.

22
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,510
Oh, I'm exhausted.

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,280
Come here.

24
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,600
You're tired.

25
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,320
What's wrong?

26
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,160
Li Xun,

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,840
am I too nice to you?

28
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,470
It seems that since we were together,

29
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,070
your abdominal muscles are gone gradually.

30
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,400
No.

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,510
Guess what I saw

32
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,230
in our school today.

33
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,950
You saw Liu Sisi?

34
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,560
Liu Sisi.

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,750
You mentioned her again.

36
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,070
You mentioned her again.

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,040
Who did you see?

38
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,350
This year's Information Security Competition

39
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,720
will be held in our school.

40
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,000
Really?

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,910
I read the competition catalogue

42
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,350
and saw something interesting.

43
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,470
What is it?

44
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,160
Our matchmaker is back.

45
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,040
Fang Zhijing.

46
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,910
He makes me speechless.

47
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,280
Every time when I'm going to forget him,

48
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,320
he appears to seek attention.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,440
Drug dealers have a great influence in China,

50
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,160
especially cancer drugs.

51
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,600
Yes. They can penetrate into all companies.

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,350
Gao,

53
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,510
come in.

54
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,230
They can penetrate into all companies.

55
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,720
If we can have a smooth cooperation,

56
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,790
it'll be a great convenience

57
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,400
to the experimental data

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,630
of L&P company.

59
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,280
Gao.

60
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,000
Li Xun is over there.

61
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,520
Gao,

62
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,040
what are you doing here?

63
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,870
There's something I'd like to talk about with you.

64
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,520
Have a seat.

65
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,430
Would you like some water?

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,230
No need.

67
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,870
What's wrong?

68
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,640
You look anxious.

69
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,400
I saw Fang Zhijing.

70
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,600
I saw him

71
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,990
staying with the organizing committee.

72
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,840
They seemed to talk about

73
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,990
the competition three years ago.

74
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,470
Li Xun,

75
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,990
can you get as far away from him as possible?

76
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,200
Don't provoke him during this period.

77
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,160
You should tell him to do that.

78
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,520
I can't handle him.

79
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,910
I can only ask you.

80
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,720
I've submitted our winning materials of

81
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,520
the last competition to the University of London.

82
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,470
Without further ado,

83
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,870
I'll get the offer

84
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,430
after a while.

85
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,280
It's critical to me during this period.

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,960
I can make no mistake.

87
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,550
I see.

88
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,230
Li Xun,

89
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,910
I'm begging you.

90
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,430
Don't say that.

91
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,080
Gao,

92
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,760
don't worry.

93
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,160
I have no time to do that.

94
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,670
I'll fetch you some water.

95
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,720
The location of the spotlights.

96
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,110
Check it.

97
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
Have you both confirmed the information flow?

98
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,960
Yes.

99
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,640
Is there any problem with the procedure?

100
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,720
Leave it to me.

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,670
Old Lin,

102
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:04,790
this is for you.

103
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,400
Enter the competition items

104
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,550
for me.

105
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,870
I'm having no time.

106
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,470
Please ask someone else.

107
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,110
Who?

108
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,080
If I can, I won't come to you.

109
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,720
You're my last choice.

110
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,670
Zhu Yun left with you.

111
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,470
She didn't answer my phone call. Who can I ask for help?

112
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,470
Hurry up.

113
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,960
Enter it now.

114
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,520
Mister, I'll help you.

115
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,870
You're...

116
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,550
My name is Fang Zhijing.

117
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,470
Fang...

118
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,110
We knew each other in the first competition.

119
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,720
Fang Zhijing from Information Technology University.

120
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,200
Yes.

121
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,760
Hello.

122
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,350
Hello.

123
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,310
Mister,

124
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,520
what else should I pay attention to?

125
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,350
Just tell me.

126
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,870
No.

127
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,760
Thank you. Hurry up.

128
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,430
Leave it to him if he wants to,

129
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,870
or it may be tricky if I see and use

130
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,760
something improper.

131
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,470
I'll help you.

132
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,230
OK.

133
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm leaving.

134
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,110
Stop.

135
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,160
Check all machines.

136
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,080
Don't go

137
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,230
before you confirm that

138
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,840
all software of the team can work.

139
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,840
Don't try to be lazy.

140
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,840
Check machine there.

141
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,670
That's what Li Xun is like.

142
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,200
He is a bit stubborn.

143
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,280
Don't take it to your heart.

144
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,760
I won't.

145
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,400
It happened long ago.

146
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,400
All is my fault.

147
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,040
I won't blame him.

148
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,230
Young people make mistakes easily.

149
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,110
There is still a long way to go.

150
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,550
Perhaps you'll be good friends.

151
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,400
You're right.

152
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,840
I heard men of talent

153
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,870
come out one after another from the Computer Science Department of Nanhu University.

154
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,910
With your constant guidance,

155
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,960
no wonder Li Xun is so capable.

156
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,910
Li Xun is somehow special.

157
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,280
In terms of programming,

158
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,040
students are completely different from each other.

159
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,910
If a student can't understand,

160
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,600
even a great teacher can't help.

161
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,280
Li Xun dropped out of school

162
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,430
and started a company as a senior.

163
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,080
I always tell him to slow down

164
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,350
as he is still young.

165
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,720
But he won't wait.

166
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,720
Look,

167
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,310
so many famous hospitals

168
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,470
and pharmaceutical factories across the country

169
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,160
seek cooperation with him.

170
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,990
Thinking it was inappropriate,

171
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,640
he declined them.

172
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,310
Yes.

173
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,080
Only he can reduce

174
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,760
the error rate to below 1%.

175
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,110
Now it's a seller's market.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,430
It's good times for you young people.

177
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,040
My generation is less

178
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,190
courageous, creative

179
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,590
and bold than you.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,880
Back then,

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
we... -Mister,

182
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,790
I finished my work.

183
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,790
I'll go to the bathroom.

184
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,190
OK.

185
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,400
Mister,

186
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,190
how to connect this?

187
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,640
That old man

188
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,430
has no sense at all.

189
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,480
No wonder he is still

190
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,880
at a low rank.

191
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,670
Damn.

192
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,710
Hello.

193
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,790
The connection was bad.

194
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,550
Tomorrow morning?

195
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,790
OK. I see.

196
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,830
What's wrong?

197
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,430
What can I do for you?

198
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,280
Can we talk?

199
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,190
Go ahead.

200
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,950
Why did you go to the organizing committee?

201
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,400
You're well-informed.

202
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,710
Does it have anything to do with you?

203
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,830
It really has nothing to do with me?

204
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,830
Group leader Fang,

205
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,400
can you stop playing dirty

206
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,000
and be responsible?

207
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,160
You don't need an award or go abroad.

208
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,760
What's your weakness?

209
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,430
It seems that you care about Gao Jianhong.

210
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,400
I know it.

211
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,400
He has been asking

212
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,830
what I said to the organizing committee

213
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,660
these two days.

214
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,790
He worries that he can't get the offer, right?

215
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,550
OK.

216
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,520
I won't cause trouble,

217
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,360
but I have a condition.

218
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,590
You

219
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,640
apologize to me.

220
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,760
Don't take yourself seriously.

221
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,760
If you apologize to me in public

222
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,480
at the opening ceremony of this year's competition,

223
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,790
and admit that

224
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,790
what you did was baseless,

225
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,120
you slandered me

226
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,190
and damaged my reputation,

227
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,430
I'll think about it.

228
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,710
If you apologize,

229
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,190
Gao Jianhong will have a promising future.

230
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,670
It's reasonable, right?

231
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,240
OK.

232
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,000
I promise.

233
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,360
I can apologize in public,

234
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,430
but I won't apologize to you.

235
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,480
It's true that you colluded with the sponsor

236
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
to set the award.

237
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll apologize

238
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
to the organizing committee

239
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,430
and every contestant that

240
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,280
I broke the rules

241
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,070
and affected the competition.

242
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,640
That's all.

243
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,760
They have nothing to do with me.

244
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,670
Fang Zhijing,

245
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,310
you'd better accept that.

246
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,550
If I find you

247
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,710
play dirty secretly,

248
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,790
I won't let you go

249
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,160
as I did last time.

250
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,880
I'll destroy you completely.

251
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,120
Don't threaten me.

252
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,400
I don't buy it.

253
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,760
This is Nanhu University.

254
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,550
Good luck.

255
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,760
OK.

256
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,670
We'll get rid of it this time.

257
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,790
Leaders of the organizing committee,

258
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,240
judges,

259
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,240
teachers and students,

260
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,360
good morning.

261
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,070
The semi-finals

262
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,430
and finals of this year's Nanhu University Students' Information Security Competition

263
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,520
will be held

264
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,640
in Nanhu University.

265
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
It's our great honor.

266
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,000
On behalf of Nanhu University,

267
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,950
I'd like to accord

268
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,550
a hearty welcome to all of you.

269
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,000
This competition...

270
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,670
Old Lin,

271
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,790
let me say something.

272
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:45,880
Hello, everyone.

273
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,550
My name is Li Xun.

274
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,310
All of you here should remember

275
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,190
the competition three years ago,

276
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,000
as I did something that broke the rules

277
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,880
of the competition out of my impulsion.

278
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,710
It's an insult to the fairness of the competition

279
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,670
that you can win a star prize for this shabby project.

280
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,000
I interrupted the competition

281
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,950
and caused influence

282
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
and losses to all contestants.

283
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,670
Am I afraid of responsibility

284
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
or are you afraid of responsibility?

285
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,550
I'd like to

286
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,880
apologize to the organizing committee

287
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,310
and every contestant.

288
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,590
Li Xun. Li Xun. Li Xun.

289
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,760
I sincerely hope that

290
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,950
such thing will never

291
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,670
happen again.

292
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,160
Good. Great.

293
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,310
Li, Li Xun came here and admitted

294
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,880
his mistake with courage.

295
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,950
Thanks.

296
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,830
When I get my offer,

297
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,880
I'll treat you to dinner.

298
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,950
Thank you.

299
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,640
Hello, everyone.

300
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,830
Now that Li Xun

301
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,430
mentioned it,

302
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,360
on behalf of the organizing committee,

303
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,190
I will announce

304
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,590
a decision we've made recently.

305
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,520
Since we received reports,

306
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
the organizing committee attached great importance to it

307
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,670
and established a special investigation team.

308
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,480
We confirmed that

309
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,590
Li Xun broke the competition order

310
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,590
three years ago

311
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,590
causing extremely bad effects.

312
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,190
It's a violation of the rules.

313
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,910
The organizing committee decided

314
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,160
to cancel the first prize

315
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,950
of Zhu Yun and Gao Jianhong

316
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,670
in the same group with him last time.

317
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,240
Li Xun, Zhu Yun and Gao Jianhong are not allowed

318
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,040
to participate in the competition for three years.

319
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,830
That's all.

320
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,190
Yes. This university is out-of-way.

321
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,430
I can't buy what I want.

322
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,830
Our university is much better.

323
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,830
I don't even want to come to this place.

324
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,910
A stupid university.

325
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,240
Yes. Stupid.

326
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,950
What do you want to do?

327
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,550
Fang Zhijing,

328
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,630
no matter where you go,

329
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,590
no matter you try to do,

330
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,070
you'll never make it,

331
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,200
I'll keep an eye on you

332
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,680
until you pay enough price.

333
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,390
Gao,

334
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,680
come to work in my company.

335
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,520
Let's work together.

336
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,110
Li Xun,

337
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,790
What do you think I am?

338
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,150
A dog

339
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,520
that comes and goes at your beck and call?

340
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,240
You give me a slap

341
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,830
and throw me a piece of meat,

342
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,350
so I should be grateful to you?

343
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,150
Sorry.

344
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,200
I asked around.

345
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
Fang Zhijing clearly said that

346
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,000
if you apologize to him in public,

347
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,390
all will come to an end.

348
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,480
Why didn't you do as he said?

349
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,550
You promised that

350
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,480
you wouldn't provoke him.

351
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,150
What happened today

352
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,630
is what you want?

353
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,680
No,

354
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,280
but I don't owe him.

355
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,480
But you owe me.

356
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,150
I begged you.

357
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,280
I begged you desperately.

358
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,960
Why didn't you lower your head once?

359
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,830
I know that

360
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,070
you're capable, proud and aloof.

361
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,720
Even now,

362
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,440
you don't want to say that

363
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,240
you're wrong.

364
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,040
You thought you lowered

365
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,390
your head as you said sorry to me.

366
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,280
I've tried my best.

367
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,760
Li Xun,

368
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,830
Since I am

369
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
inferior to you,

370
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,310
I can avoid you, OK?

371
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,200
But now

372
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,310
you don't give me a chance to do that.

373
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,960
Are you satisfied

374
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,240
to see me like this?

375
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,070
Gao,

376
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,790
for what I owe you today,

377
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,440
I'll pay you back twice.

378
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,240
I've always treat you as a friend.

379
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,760
If you don't mind.

380
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,240
we'll still

381
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,350
be teammates.

382
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,240
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,830
Good. Good.

384
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,760
Hurry or hurry Hard.

385
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,680
Hurry or hurry hard.

386
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,200
Hurry or hurry hard.

387
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,960
Hurry or hurry hard.

388
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,720
It's almost.

389
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,200
You watch all kinds of sports matches.

390
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,550
In addition to all ball games,

391
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,350
now you're watching curling.

392
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,520
Do you know its rules?

393
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,960
Yes.

394
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,720
The rules are the same.

395
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,680
I know it as I see it.

396
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,150
Great.

397
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,150
Hurry or hurry hard.

398
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,680
What, what are you doing?

399
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,550
I want to watch the news.

400
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,110
According to the "2016 White Paper

401
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,000
on Talent Development" released today...

402
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,760
Is this news?

403
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,350
They are just trivial matters.

404
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,870
There are 5,954

405
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,480
talent support projects.

406
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,240
On average, more than

407
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,630
1,000 college students in the city

408
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,200
start business and get employment every day.

409
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,440
Please see the details next.

410
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,760
Medical development

411
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,240
has gone through many stages.

412
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,310
At this stage...

413
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,280
Isn't that Yun?

414
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,000
Take the road of intelligent medical treatment.

415
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,870
Did you see her?

416
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,000
With the development of the Internet, big data

417
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,390
and cloud computing in the future...

418
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,110
No.

419
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
You're wrong.

420
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,390
It's a general trend.

421
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,870
The one in gray back there.

422
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,240
Yes.

423
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,110
Can't you recognize her?

424
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,440
Hello.

425
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,350
Gao is still angry.

426
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
I'll convince him step by step.

427
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,550
You should understand him.

428
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,000
He prepared a year

429
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
to apply for the university.

430
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,000
It happened suddenly.

431
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,200
I see.

432
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,070
You've had a long day.

433
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,350
I'll try to convince him, too.

434
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,830
It's also a good choice to work with us.

435
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,830
Check you out. I saw you on TV.

436
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,680
The development of the Internet, big data

437
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,350
and cloud computing...

438
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,390
Oh no.

439
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,960
What's wrong?

440
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,310
I was captured in this news.

441
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,480
My mom must have seen me.

442
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,790
She is like big data detection.

443
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,000
No. I must go home

444
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,280
to tell her the truth.

445
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,720
When will you leave?

446
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,350
Li Lan will come tomorrow.

447
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,040
I'll pick her up after sending you.

448
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,350
Why is she coming here?

449
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,920
It's dusty in the flower nursery.

450
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,480
She has a pterygium in her eye.

451
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,440
I asked her to come here for an operation.

452
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,920
Shall I wait for her?

453
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,000
It doesn't matter.

454
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,280
It's a minor operation.

455
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,630
I'll let you meet formally

456
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,520
when she's fully recovered.

457
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,240
I have no other relatives.

458
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,440
What do you mean?

459
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,920
You know what I mean.

460
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,440
So we're going steady

461
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,280
You won't change?

462
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
No.

463
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,110
Anyway, I can't find anyone better.

464
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,000
Princess.

465
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,000
I love you.

466
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,350
What did you say?

467
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,070
You hate to part with me?

468
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,630
I'll come back

469
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,110
in a few days.

470
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,280
No hurry.

471
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,280
Spend more time with your parents.

472
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,830
Li Lan won't leave soon.

473
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,280
No.

474
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
We're back.

475
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,140
Mom, I'm back.

476
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,870
Welcome.

477
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,110
What will we have for dinner?

478
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Wash your hand.

479
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,070
We'll have dinner soon.

480
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,280
Mom, you made so many dishes.

481
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,480
Enjoy it.

482
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,830
Dad,

483
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,790
mom,

484
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,480
I want to tell you something.

485
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,960
Well,

486
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,390
have dinner first,

487
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,680
and then we'll talk about it.

488
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,720
I gave up postgraduate recommendation.

489
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,520
I want to start a business.

490
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,550
No, I disagree.

491
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,110
Don't you ask me what I think?

492
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,040
Don't you want to know?

493
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,960
Yes.

494
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,340
Prepare to go

495
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,760
abroad from now on.

496
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,630
You've fallen a long way, you know?

497
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,200
You already know

498
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,870
what Li Xun and I are doing?

499
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,110
Well. It's important.

500
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,350
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

501
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,520
When will you tell us the truth?

502
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,150
Mom, he's not who you think he is.

503
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
What is he like?

504
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,350
There was a reason for his cheating back then.

505
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,000
He needed money.

506
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,520
So he cheated?

507
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,350
In this case,

508
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,680
he can kill others for money?

509
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,960
You're going too far.

510
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,680
Don't say that.

511
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,000
When did you learn

512
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,830
to talk back?

513
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,790
Calm down.

514
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,040
As the saying goes, it's difficult for a poor family to bring forth a good son.

515
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,630
Actually, I don't agree with that.

516
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,390
A golden phoenix may fly

517
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,480
out of a henhouse.

518
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,280
It depends on his fortune.

519
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,720
He can't get rid of

520
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,390
the deep-rooted bad habits.

521
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,390
He has no such habits.

522
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,680
I know best

523
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,870
whether he has such habits.

524
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,280
I've taught so many students.

525
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,590
People like him

526
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,000
are extremely insecure inside.

527
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,960
He'll try his best to make a difference

528
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,790
when he has the chance.

529
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,630
No.

530
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,630
He does.

531
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,760
You know why he pursued you?

532
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,150
He is trying to take revenge on me.

533
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,870
I pursued him.

534
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,070
Yun,

535
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,110
don't talk for him, OK?

536
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,390
We know you best

537
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,720
as your parents.

538
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,720
And you saw

539
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,040
what he did in the competition.

540
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,240
Dad,

541
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,110
you know what,

542
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,110
he took part in the competition for me.

543
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,680
You're an easy target of for such people.

544
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,720
When can you be alert like a grown-up?

545
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,110
But Fang Zhijing

546
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,720
broke the competition rules.

547
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,150
It's unfair to other groups.

548
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,150
You can't judge that.

549
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,550
Even if

550
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,480
it's unfair,

551
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,280
you should complain according to the procedure.

552
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,310
But you broke

553
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,760
competition rules

554
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,000
before reporting to teachers and school.

555
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,480
You deserve to be disqualified.

556
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,830
Look.

557
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,790
You were used.

558
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,390
You're quarreling with us.

559
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,240
You don't notice that, right?

560
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,720
You're so naive.

561
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,240
Too childish.

562
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,440
Come back.

563
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:55,920
Yun.

564
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,790
I haven't finished yet.

565
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,040
Where are you going?

566
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,150
What's wrong with you?

567
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,310
Why are you so rebellious now?

568
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,790
You can do little things you like.

569
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,390
I don't care.

570
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
But this is a big choice in life.

571
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,870
You have to do what we say.

572
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,390
You know what,

573
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,760
youth is the most precious

574
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,280
thing in our life,

575
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,480
especially to girls.

576
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,550
But now you

577
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,870
choose to start

578
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,070
a business with others

579
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,150
instead of further study.

580
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,790
You won't have more choices in the future.

581
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,760
The bastard will

582
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,200
confine you in a place.

583
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,920
Calm down.

584
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,070
Yun,

585
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,760
we're reasonable.

586
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,920
No matter what you want to do,

587
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,350
let's have a good talk first.

588
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,720
I have nothing to talk with you.

589
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,760
Put your luggage down.

590
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,680
Is he more important than us?

591
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,040
What if I say yes?

592
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,390
Stay here. Don't go anywhere.

593
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,000
Reflect on yourself.

594
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,870
What's wrong, Lan?

595
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,520
Nothing.

596
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,550
I caught a cold.

597
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,870
Don't worry.

598
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,350
Here is the menu.

599
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,760
Order what you like.

600
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,100
I...

601
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,590
Order a bowl of noodles for me.

602
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,280
OK.

603
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,040
Whether you eat or not, it costs 258 yuan per person.

604
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,760
That's expensive.

605
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,550
Let, let's dine somewhere else.

606
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,550
No need.

607
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,310
Waiter.

608
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,830
Waiter.

609
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,590
Please order for me.

610
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,440
You ordered too many dishes.

611
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,830
It's worth it.

612
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,040
Enjoy it.

613
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,110
Well.

614
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,630
The flowers are selling well recently.

615
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,350
Really?

616
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,070
Here you are.

617
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,270
Li Xun,

618
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,880
don't give me money again.

619
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,630
I kept all the money

620
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,880
you gave me.

621
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,230
I can pay for my treatment.

622
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,920
Then why didn't you see a doctor earlier

623
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,880
before I forced you?

624
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,110
You have extra money?

625
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,400
Did Zhang Dagang stop drinking?

626
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,040
Lan,

627
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,190
you can divorce.

628
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,150
I'll take care of An'an.

629
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,040
Zhang Dagang

630
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,480
can't teach him.

631
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,070
We know that clearly.

632
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,550
Lan,

633
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,190
even if you can bear it,

634
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,320
you need to think about An'an.

635
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,320
He'll study in my city.

636
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,440
OK.

637
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,400
OK.

638
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,070
Take the treatment first.

639
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,920
We'll talk about it later.

640
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,670
Don't worry.

641
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,320
I'll be there with you.

642
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,480
I'll arrange it.

643
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,800
OK.

644
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,110
Li Xun,

645
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,670
you seem to have changed.

646
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,440
Really?

647
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,920
How?

648
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,520
You seem to know

649
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,110
how, how to love others.

650
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,630
You know what,

651
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,070
I've reserved a room in a hotel for you for a week.

652
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,800
I want you to spend more time here.

653
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,000
No need.

654
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,630
I'll go back after the operation.

655
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,920
Ten days after the operation,

656
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,110
you have to go back to remove the stitches.

657
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,960
And I want you to meet someone.

658
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,140
Who?

659
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,750
She should be your acquaintance.

660
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,150
You'll know when you see her.

661
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,590
OK.

662
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,360
I'll leave it to you.

663
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,520
OK.

664
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,190
I'll arrange it.

665
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,190
OK.

666
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,920
Enjoy the food.

667
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,400
Don't look at me.

668
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,710
Gao Jianhong,

669
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,550
let's talk.

670
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,070
I've been waiting for you all night.

671
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,880
Let's talk.

672
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,070
I have nothing to talk with you.

673
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,480
Well, think about it.

674
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,520
We're trapped by Li Xun.

675
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,270
He doesn't let me go now.

676
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,630
He destroys

677
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,070
our future.

678
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,040
We're on the same boat.

679
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,880
No, we aren't.

680
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,840
You're inferior to him.

681
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,070
OK.

682
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,110
I got a chance

683
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,630
to manage trainees.

684
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,150
On good terms with several investors,

685
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,070
I can recommend you.

686
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,880
You also know that

687
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,400
they're from big companies.

688
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,960
Help me to persuade Li Xun

689
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,440
to let me go.

690
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,800
Let's give in on both sides.

691
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,800
Get out.

692
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,320
Gao Jianhong,

693
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,840
are you out of your mind?

694
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,520
What have you got

695
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,550
by working with Li Xun?

696
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,480
He stole your thunder in the competition

697
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,710
and made you miss the offer.

698
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,320
Even your favorite girl likes him.

699
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,400
Fang Zhijing,

700
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,800
listen.

701
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,480
Li Xun and I are brothers.

702
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,270
He is ten thousand times better than you.

703
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,630
I'm willing to work with him.

704
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,800
And

705
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,520
He'll keep an eye on you

706
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,230
as he said.

707
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,670
I don't need to waste my time.

708
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,400
But for his sister coming here,

709
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,800
he won't let you go.

710
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,440
When she leaves,

711
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,670
he'll try many ways to make you suffer.

712
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,960
It's almost the final.

713
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,110
Be careful, or you'll fail again.

714
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,070
Please fill out the form.

715
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,110
Please keep your room card.

716
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,710
Thank you.

717
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,920
It hurts?

718
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,710
No.

719
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,440
Li Xun,

720
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,270
can we cancel the reservation?

721
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,590
It's too expensive.

722
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,660
I paid the money.

723
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,360
It's wasteful.

724
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,110
If you think so,

725
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,190
remember to go downstairs for breakfast tomorrow morning.

726
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,520
But...

727
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,320
Fine.

728
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,920
Just have a good rest.

729
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,800
I'll do something tomorrow afternoon

730
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,190
and pick you up for dinner.

731
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,800
No need.

732
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,630
OK.

733
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,150
Here you are.

734
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,320
Go.

735
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,550
Get back to your business.

736
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,750
What would you like for dinner?

737
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,190
-Leave me alone. -What would you like?

738
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,630
Hello.

739
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,040
Please show me your breakfast coupon.

740
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,190
Waiter.

741
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:23,800
Coming.

742
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,520
Excuse me.

743
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,400
Is there hot water?

744
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,270
Yes. Over there.

745
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,150
Thanks.

746
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,920
You're welcome.

747
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:51,920
Could you please hurry up?

748
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,920
I'll help you.

749
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,270
Thanks.

750
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,040
Not at all.

751
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,320
Here you are.

752
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,710
Thanks.

753
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,550
Hello.

754
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,800
Are you Li Xun's sister?

755
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,230
Hi, I'm Li Xun's friend.

756
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,800
My name is Fang Zhijing. I'm here for a competition.

757
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,190
Hello.

758
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,070
Hello.

759
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:29,800
This is for you.

760
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,190
Thank you so much.

761
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:33,630
Never mind.

762
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,040
Thanks.

763
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,440
You took the drugs. Have some porridge

764
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,320
to warm up.

765
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,110
Thanks.

766
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Take your time.

767
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,960
This breakfast is very expensive.

768
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,880
It's 128 yuan each person.

769
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,800
It's so expensive.

770
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,150
It costs more than 500 yuan staying here one night.

771
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,670
I stay here just because

772
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,920
it's near the venue.

773
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,480
Young man,

774
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,920
can I cancel the reservation?

775
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,800
Of course.

776
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,840
I'm also looking for a cheaper hotel.

777
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Do you know

778
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,880
where there is a cheaper one?

779
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,270
Hell, Gao. What's wrong?

780
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,520
Where are you?

781
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,630
Something happened.

782
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:32,400
Yun,

783
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:33,360
where are you going?

784
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,000
Zhu Yun,

785
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,150
Fang Zhijing is a bastard.

786
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,150
He swindled Li Lan away to scare you.

787
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,440
He left early in the morning after giving statements.

788
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,520
We know he did it, but we can do nothing.

789
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,110
Li Lan is gone.

790
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,360
You're the only one I've got.

791
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,960
Let's go to meet my parents.

792
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,390
