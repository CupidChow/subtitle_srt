00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,830
Be quiet. Be quiet.

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,280
Move to the middle a little bit.

168
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,520
Stand properly.

169
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,310
Ren Di,

we'll do Photoshop to put him there.

Everyone, look at the camera.

178
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,280
Yes.

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,360

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,310
I know that

235
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,760
our company's original major business

236
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,670
was medical software for all kinds of reasons.

237
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,040
You are the seniors of L&P.

238
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,480
But we need to adjust

239
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,360
the company's future development.

240
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,670
After all, we're not a charitable company.

241
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,790
So we decide to

242
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,640
remove the this business segment.

243
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,070
Thank you for your understanding.

244
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,040
Mr. Gao,

245
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,710
just tell us directly.

246
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,710
Did you sell our medical software?

247
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,440
Yes.

248
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,200
I did sell it.

249
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,240
It's not a secret.

250
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,870
The medical industry requires heavy investment

251
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,440
and a high professional technology threshold.

252
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,480
And it doesn't generate yield in a short time.

253
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,680
A small company like us

254
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,000
can't support it.

255
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,390
We're a small horse.

256
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,630
We can't pull such a big carriage.

257
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,550
It depends on the horse's strength.

258
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,760
You're right.

259
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,550
I can tell you honestly that

260
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,790
source of funds for the company's development in the next step

261
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,790
is the payment for this software.

262
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,550
Of course,

263
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,830
it also includes

264
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,520
your severance pay.

265
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,520
Financial executive.

266
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,550
I got it, Mr. Gao.

267
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,720
About the compensation,

268
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,240
the financial executive will talk about it with you.

269
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,830
Don't worry.

270
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,440
I won't treat you unfairly.

271
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,110
Please.

272
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,110
This way, please.

273
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:03,960

This is not the first time we meet,

277
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,000
but I still want to

278
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,550
introduce myself.

279
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,960
My name is Gao Jianhong.

280
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,390
I am the company's new shareholder,

281
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,070
legal person and general manager.

282
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,000
There's a question that's been bothering me lately.

283
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,070
I was thinking

284
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,440
what the goal of L&P is.

285
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,590
Today,

286
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,520
I can tell you clearly

287
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,830
our goal

288
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,350
is to make profit.

289
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,350
What is most profitable?

290
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,390
Online education or shared commerce?

291
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,760
You can air your opinions.

292
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,240
Let's decide on the company's new direction together.

293
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,630
After working with me for some period,

294
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,550
you will know that

295
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,110
I am very open-minded.

296
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,920
I want to make money together with you.

297
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,040
Let's work together

298
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,240
towards the new dream

299
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,310
of L&P.

300
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,830
Good! Good! Good!

301
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,720
I've made an appointment with several investors.

302
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,870
Go on with your work.

303
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,870
Okay. Okay, Mr. Gao.

306
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,070
I heard that you refused to appeal.

307
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,790
Zhu Yun has gone abroad.

308
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,200
It has nothing to do with me.

309
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,790
Do you have to do this?

310
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,630
Will Zhu Yun know everything you did for her?

311
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,830
Have you completed the change of business registration?

312
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,960
It was completed

313
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,240
yesterday.

314
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,550
Gao,

315
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,590
we will talk about work only,

316
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,240
not the past in the future.

317
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,070
Do you need me

318
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,240
to report work

319
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,310
in such a place?

320
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,280
I have to warn you that

321
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,150
we can only

322
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,680
talk about the past.

323
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,870
Do you think you will have a future?

324

Li Xun,

325
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,240
don't blame me.

326
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,720
I used to give up everything.

327
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,240
Going abroad for further study, the postgraduate recommendation,

328
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,240
everything that our school recommended.

329
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,590
I put down my pride and self-esteem

330
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,240
and even gave up my love.

331
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,790
I just wanted to stay far away from you.

332
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
But you didn't even give me the chance.

Think about

334
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,590
what you have done these years.

335
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,480
Did you ever consider others' feelings

336
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
when you made a decision?

337
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,070
Who did you really care?

338
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,630
I really hate you sometimes.

339
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,150
How could you

340
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,790
be so selfish

341
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,520
and so arrogant?

342
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,680
You wanted to say these words long ago, right?

343
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,790
Does it feel good to endure humiliation?

344
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,440
No,

345
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,390
to submit to humiliation

346
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,680
and ask for insults.

347
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,590
It's not important.

348
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,280
What's important is that I succeeded.

349
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,040
Do you see it clearly?

350
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm telling you,

351
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,150
your system has been sold.

352
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,720
I don't want an online medical system.

353
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,790
Just take everything you did

354
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,070
as an initial step for my startup.

Let your 1% go to hell.

359

360
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
have lost.

Don't judge too soon.

There's a long way ahead.

363
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,680
I can take back

364
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,480
what I gave to you.

365
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,550
Li Xun,

366
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,280
that's the way you are.

367
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,590
You think you're superior

368
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,310
even when you're in prison.

369
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,000
You have such an end

370
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,760
not because of anyone.

371
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,590
Don't blame Fang Zhijing or me.

372
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,440
It is because you asked for it.

373
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,480
You deserved it.

374
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:55,920
By the way,

375
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,310
do you know how Fang Zhijing

376
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,520
found your sister?

377
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,630
I told him.

378
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,310
What did you say?

379
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,590
What did you say?

380
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,630

Calm down.

384
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,680
There is a library

385
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,830
and computers in the prison.

386
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,480
Enjoy your time.

The new hairstyle suits you very well.

388

I will kill you!

389
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,440
Calm down.

486
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,760

What does he have?

488
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,240
We spent three years to make these achievements.

489
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,760
Don't tell me that with such achievements made,

490
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,630
you still don't have the courage to fight him.

491
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,520
You don't have to be sneering at me.

492
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,830
After all,

493
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,240
it's you who did it,

494
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,350
and you have to pay for it.

495
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,480
But no matter what happens,

496

Let's drink a toast

499
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,310
to us, three rich girls.

500
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,280
Cheers. Cheers.

501
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,790
Zhu Yun,

502
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,390
we three gather because you've come back home.

503
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,200
Though Ren Di and I are in the same city,

504
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,720
I couldn't meet her as often

505
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,790
as her fans.

506
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,440
What a bad friend.

507
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,960
It's not true.

508
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,720
You are a busy layer.

509
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,590
You don't have time to meet us.

510
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,310
Right?

511
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,440
But, Fang Shumiao,

512
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,830
it's strange that you took such a cross-boundary job.

513
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,550
You majored in computer,

514
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,790
and now you become a lawyer.

515
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,760
She did not major in computer

516
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,110
in university.

517
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
She majored in student union.

518
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,110
That's right.

519
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,440
People have to

520
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,720
keep correcting their trajectory.

521
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,150
I think

522
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,550
the profession of lawyer

523
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,920
suits me very well.

524
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,280
What's the name of your law firm?

525
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,310
My law firm

526
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,790
is very famous in Shanghai.

527
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,390
Its name consists of the family names of three founders.

528
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,790
My boss's family name is He,

529
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,920
and my master's family name is Yuan.

530
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,040
You know what?

531
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,280
Our boss Lawyer He is really handsome.

532
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,960
It's a pity that he has married.

533
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,550
He married his first love who he met

534
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,630
in university.

535
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,110
Like you, his wife is a talent returning home.

536
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,480
What is that?

537
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,960
It's blinking.

538
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,200
You didn't get her.

539
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,280
She wants to tell you

540
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,070
lawyer is a profitable profession.

541
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,760
Don't talk nonsense.

542
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,000
We don't buy a diamond rings for ourselves.

543
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,680
Which boss bought it for you?

544
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,280
I'll have to

545
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,340
return it after a few days.

546
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,440
It's such a large-value gift presentation.

547
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,920
It needs to be notarized to be effective.

548
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,760
I don't plan to marry him.

549
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,830
I need to return it if we break up.

550
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,630
I'm really a bit reluctant to return it.

551
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,240
Look, it's blinking.

552
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
So beautiful.

553
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,920
Do not show it off.

554
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,870
I'm going to be jealous.

555
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,790
Enough, enough.

556
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,960
When you break up,

557
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,550
and I'll introduce a good man to you.

558
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,630
Fang Shumiao,

559
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,040
your life is really changeable.

560
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,550
It's colorful.

561
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,590
Come on. Stop showing it off.

562
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,720
I will be jealous.

563
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,040
We have a boy classmate named...

564
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,350
Wu Mengxing.

565
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,150
I heard that he cried sadly hugging you

566
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,280
when we graduated.

567
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,350
Are you still in touch?

568
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,310
He's now working in Municipal College Youth League Committee.

569
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,480
He has a bright future.

570
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
I have a case stuck there.

571
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,520
So you have made up your mind

572
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,480
and plan to

573
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,790
lure him?

574
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,440
Don't talk nonsense.

575
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,350
He's going to have a child, okay?

576
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,200
So we can't hear suona solo again.

577
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,150
Well, this party,

578
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,520
tell us about you.

579
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,590
How did you feel

580
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,920
when you saw your old lover?

581
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,440
You went back to the university to try luck to meet him, right?

582
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,720
Of course not.

583
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,110
I went back to the university

584
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,960
as I am about to leave.

585
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,830
I didn't expect that...

586
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,720
Why are you staring at me?

587
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,630
Are you interrogating me?

588
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,590
Is that an occupational disease of lawyer?

589
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,040
It's not an occupational disease,

590
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,350
but curiosity and gossip about an incredible story.

591
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,920
I don't have any gossip.

592
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,070
I'll leave tomorrow.

593
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,550
I'll go abroad two days later.

594
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,310
I can't play a role in exaggerated dramas.

595
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,070
Is Li Xun still so handsome now?

596
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,440
He's not as handsome as Wu Mengxing.

597
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,550
What are you whispering?

598
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,440
What did you say?

599
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,750
A toast to Wu Mengxing.

600
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,110
A toast to Wu Mengxing.

601
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,360
Why drink a toast to Wu Mengxing?

602
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:21,920
Just drink a toast to him.

603
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,840
Just drink a toast to him. Toast. Toast.

604
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,710
A toast to him for his wealth.

605
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,440
A toast. A toast. A toast to Fang Shumiao.

606
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,880
Your coffee.

607
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:51,880
Thanks.

608
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,360
Thanks.

609
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,750
Didn't you sleep well last night?

610
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,070
Not bad.

611
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,150
You've got back your purse.

612
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,920
Why are you still unhappy?

613
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,960
I'm not.

614
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,670
Do you know why Li Xun

615
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,920
took away the key

616
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,800
and then returned it?

617
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,270
Why?

618
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,230
He took away the important object

619
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,480
because he cares;

620
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,400
he returned it

621
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,550
because he has put it down.

622
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,360
A man revisited an old place

623
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,590
to recall the past, grasp the present

624
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,750
and look into the future.

625
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,270
At last, he decided to

626
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,150
resolutely

627
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,230
move on alone.

628
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,230
That's quite sentimental.

629
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,880
I'm driving.

630
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,630
Hello, mom.

631
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,070
Hello, Yun.

632
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,400
Are you with Xiuzhu?

633
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,480
He's beside me.

634
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,750
That's good.

635
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,960
Your dad let me call you to ask

636
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,710
when you will arrive.

637
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,320
We'll arrive soon.

638
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,320
Okay. Okay, okay.

639
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,000
I'll make more delicious dishes for you.

640
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,750
She urged us.

641
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,440
The 14th Internet Conference

642
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,320
will have a grand opening in the next a few days.

643
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,320
The conference is organized by L&P.

644
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,710
As the city's leading Internet enterprise,

645
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,800
L&P takes the lead among other game companies

646
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,630
as usual.

647
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,550
It has become a benchmarking enterprise of self-developed games in China.

648
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,270
You two old classmates are doing really well.

649
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,840
L&P will speed up its efforts

650
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,750
to upgrade the new version

651
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,040
and overseas issuance of its current games.

652
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,920
It is committed to bringing Chinese games to the world.

653
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,880
Thank you.

654
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,710
I'm here to take the money.

655
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,400
This is for Li Xun?

656
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,000
Li Xun was not supposed to ask Ren Di for money.

657
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,520
It is positioned to empower various lines and industries through the Internet.

658
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,150
This will contribute to China's Internet Industry.

659
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,750
Li Xun is L&P's major shareholder.

660
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,550
He should not be short of money by reason.

661
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,400
Why did he ask Ren Di for money after he was released from prison?

662
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,230
It is indeed a bit strange.

663
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,400
It has built a bridge of efficient communication

664
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,360
for whole-chain enterprises and related institutions and professionals,

665
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,150
creating a high-end communication platform

666
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,190
that has sustainable and healthy development ability

667
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,040
and wide industry influence.

668
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,960
What's wrong?

669
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,750
Li Xun is not on the list of shareholders.

670
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,520
Did he entrust someone to hold shares on half of him?

671
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,440
If the media knew that

672
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,070
L&P's biggest shareholder

673
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,750
served a sentence in prison,

674
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,800
it would be bad for L&P's development.

675
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,630
It is possible.

676
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,000
But Fang Zhijing is on the list of shareholders.

677
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,590
Fang Zhijing?

678
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,480
The person who was blinded by Li Xun?

679
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,590
No matter what happens,

680
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,360
Li Xun will not forgive Fang Zhijing,

681
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,320
nor will he cooperated with him.

682
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,000
I need to go back.

683
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,590
How about I go in with you?

684
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,440
No need.

685
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,070
In fact,

686
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,440
you have nothing to do with them now.

687
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,070
I'm not doing this for anyone.

688
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,070
I also invested efforts in L&P before.

689
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,840
I need to figure out what's going on.

690
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,040
Mr. Gao.

691
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It's been a long time,

692
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,150
old classmate.

693
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,960
It's been a long time.

694
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,110
Go.

695
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,550
I'll show you around.

696
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,440
Zhu Yun, you must know that

697
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,070
I'm working on games now.

698
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,000
This is the Project Department.

699
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,270
Look at the hardware.

700
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,710
I require them to update the hardware

701
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,000
to the highest configuration every six months.

702
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,110
A handy tool makes a handy man.

703
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
When we were frogs in a well

704
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,710
in the base back then,

705
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,800
we felt proud.

706
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,360
Now I finally know behind an able man there are always other able men.

707
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,880
This is the Planning Department.

708
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,400
They quarrel in the conference room every day.

709
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,150
After they quarrel in the conference room, they quarrel in the office.

710
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,270
Even a dozen conference rooms aren't enough for them.

711
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,040
I'm going to change the two upper floors into open space.

712
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,590
There should be at least

713
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,710
two brainstorming sessions behind closed doors every month.

714
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,590
The Legal Department is downstairs.

715
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,440
It was not until I opened a company that

716
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,920
I knew that it's expensive to engage lawyers.

717
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'll have to spend millions of yuan on engaging lawyers a year,

718
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,920
but I can't save it as we're a big company easily attacked.

719
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,270
I'll show you around downstairs.

720
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,550
Gao,

721
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,110
let's have a talk in a private room.

722
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,960
Okay.

723
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,040
Zhu Yun,

724
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,630
how do you think of my company?

725
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,520
I know you graduated from

726
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,230
a famous university,

727
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,320
and you're knowledgeable.

728
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,190
But I won't treat you as an employee

729
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,110
if you work in my company.

730
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,590
I will give you some an option.

731
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,070
Why does Fang Zhijing's name

732
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,630
appear in the list of shareholders of L&P?

733
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,550
So you're here to question me.

734
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,440
Why does Fang Zhijing's name

735
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,070
appear in the list of shareholders of L&P?

736
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,360
Why can't his name appear on the list?

737
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,840
Fang Zhijing is not only L&P's shareholder,

738
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,270
but also L&P's vice president

739
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:03,800
chief technology officer

740
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,000
and my partner.

741
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,150
Gao, what happened?

742
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,110
Three years ago, Li Xun excluded me

743
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,750
and entrusted the company to you.

744
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,960
You know every well everything that happened

745
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,840
between us and Fang Zhijing.

746
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,360
What you did

747
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,270
is like putting a knife in him.

748
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,150
I just want to put a knife in him.

749
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,710
What?

750
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,190
Gao,

751
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,430
whatever happened between you and Li Xun,

752
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,000
Fang Zhijing can't stay in L&P.

753
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,190
This is Li Xun's company.

754
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,920
This is my company!

755
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,920
You checked L&P's equity structure,

756
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,190
so you should clearly see that

757
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
Li Xun does not hold any shares in L&P.

758
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,880
When he was put in prison,

759
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,000
he transferred all your shares to me.

760
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,190
And I sold your

761
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,480
online medical system.

762
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,070
So from then on,

763
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
Li Xun no longer has anything to do

764
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,000
with L&P.

765
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,000
You occupied L&P

766
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
by making use of Li Xun's trust in you.

767
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,440
I should have known that this is not his company.

768
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,400
Li Xun won't destroy L&P's future and reputation

769
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,140
in order to make money.

770
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,880
Whatever you say.

771
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,960
Anyway, I have the final say

772
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,880
in L&P now.

773
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,550
He will not let you go.

774
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,880
To be honest,

775
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,840
since we were in university,

776
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,710
I've been looking forward to

777
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,550
a life-and-death contest with Li Xun.

778
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,070
The result of the contest

779
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,110
is going to be unbearable.

780
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,270
Even if Li Xun did something wrong,

781
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,190
he was sincere to you.

782
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,320
You're still the same as before,

783
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,710
not giving anyone any chance.

784
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,230
You always stand at Li Xun's side without conditions.

785
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,040
Compared with the pain and suffering he has caused me

786
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,320
since university,

787
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,040
this cut in him is far from enough.

788
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,400
You can't win him.

789
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,670
I admit he's a genius,

790
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,150
but we can have a lot of geniuses in this era.

791
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,590
Things are different from they were in our university time.

792
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,040
L&P has many geniuses

793
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,440
like him.

794
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,110
I can have many geniuses as I want.

795
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,670
What can he rely on to win me?

796
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,840
But you forget one thing.

797
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,480
There are many geniuses in this era,

798
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,040
but there's only one Li Xun.

799
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,750
And there's only one Gao Jianhong.
