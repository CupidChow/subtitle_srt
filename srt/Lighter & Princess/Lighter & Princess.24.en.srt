♫Everything is different when we watch the sky from the sea bottom♫

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,820
♫The person I used to be is gone♫

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,980
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,380
♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,260
♫We would bloom in the darkness♫

♫The knight and the king♫

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,940
♫I see a clear direction♫

10

[Episode 24]

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,120
How is it?

22
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,350
Gao Jianhong

23
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,400
cheated Li Xun and took away L&P.

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,790
Aren't they good friends?

25
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,430
Friendship is ultimately unreliable.

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
Xiuzhu.

27
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,870
Can you me a favor?

28
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,470
Go ahead.

29
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,430
Although we agreed not to change the plan

30
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,280
whatever happens after we are back…

31
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,560
Get to the point.

32
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,030
But

33
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,360
you may have to drive back to Linyang alone.

34
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,000
Then?

35
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,470
Then you might have to

36
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,000
have dinner with my parents alone.

37
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,360
Okay.

38
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,750
When I have dinner with them,

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,280
I can tell them our experience in the past two days

40
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,960
and tell them

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,000
how you met Li Xun unexpectedly.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,870
Then I'll talk about

43
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,190
the thing of L&P.

44
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,030
Finally, I'll tell them

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,120
the key you lost and finally got back.

46
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,240
Just buy me some time.

47
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,870
I'll be back after I deal with my matter.

48
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,360
What else to deal with?

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
You're going to see him?

50
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,360
We have broken up.

51
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,310
That he left the key

52
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,000
is everything he wants to tell me.

53
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,310
He wanted to

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,240
leave our love where we should forget.

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
What's left between you?

56
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,630
This company is our dream.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,520
I can't leave L&P alone.

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,630
I have to see Li Xun again.

59
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,960
Elegantly speaking,

60
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,080
this is self-deception.

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
Vulgarly speaking,

62
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,870
you ask for torture.

63
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,590
People

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,680
always think of some high-sounding reasons

65
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,560
to jump into the abyss of suffering.

66
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,080
You’d better scold me directly.

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,630
I should scold myself if so.

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,430
I have said that

69
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,310
my prediction is accurate.

70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,750
Then you promised?

71
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,190
No.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,750
Think about it.

73
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,680
If I go to have

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
dinner with your parents,

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
they would kill me.

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,400
If my mom learns it,

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,240
she must be standing at my room door tomorrow morning.

78
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,680
Why not consider it?

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,590
Tomorrow morning?

80
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,390
She will call you soon later.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,720
What can we do?

82
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,270
What can we do?

83
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,160
Then I'll tell her.

84
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,680
I can tell her

85
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,310
a friend came to me.

86
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,480
He returned from abroad.

87
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,950
And I will take

88
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,750
you with me to meet him.

89
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,870
It could take two days.

90
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,120
Great.

91
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,800
You forced me to lie. Great?

92
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,720
Then you call her.

93
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,720
You. You.

94
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,360
You.

95
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,800
Come on.

96
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
This is the Internet Conference.

97
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,190
It's not a fan club.

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,560
Can you lower your voice?

99
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,000
You also know

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,750
how crazy fans are now.

101
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,390
That bastard will really come?

102
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,680
The Internet Conference is the most important industry event.

103
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,600
Companies with names will come.

104
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,560
And L&P is the host.

105
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,950
Gao Jianhong and Fang Zhijing will definitely come.

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,270
As long as the two of them come,

107
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,680
Li Xun will not miss it.

108
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,750
Go in.

109
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,600
Come on.

110
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,240
Get in.

111
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,920
Back up.

112
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,000
It has contact information and address.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,600
We are recruiting programmers. Please have a look.

114
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,630
Hello.

115
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,600
Hello.

116
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,830
Here's my card.

117
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,830
Take a look.

118
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,870
Let me introduce myself.

119
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,430
I'm a promotion specialist

120
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,270
from Zhaoyang Network Operation Company.

121
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,240
My name is Hong Xiaowei.

122
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,390
Sorry, I don't have a business card.

123
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,870
Never mind.

124
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,480
What do you do?

125
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,560
I'm a programmer.

126
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,630
Programmer?

127
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,000
That's just right.

128
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,120
Take a look.

129
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,950
This is our product.

130
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,240
The function is to help current college students

131
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,430
contact part-time jobs.

132
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,560
Xiaojian Part Time?

133
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,920
Miss,

134
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,310
since you are a programmer,

135
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,390
can you check

136
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,360
if we can improve our software?

137
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,630
I think you can improve

138
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,950
its functions.

139
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,510
Now there are only simple

140
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,270
work introduction and contact information.

141
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,800
Work value evaluation can be added later.

142
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,360
And now

143
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,870
users can only search for work by themselves.

144
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,480
I think it can make intelligent recommendation

145
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
based on their strengths.

146
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,190
But does your backstage

147
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,160
record the user's search history?

148
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,430
No.

149
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,430
That would be a waste.

150
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,190
Real data is the most valuable resource.

151
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,480
You need to

152
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,160
understand the needs of each user.

153
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,190
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,240
Gradually improve it.

155
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,680
This software has a good starting point

156
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,870
and a large market demand.

157
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,000
You are great.

158
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,510
I can't see this at ordinary times.

159
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:50,870
Sister,

160
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,480
what about you?

161
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Do you have any suggestions?

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,560
Me?

163
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,000
My suggestion is

164
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,680
changing a name

165
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,560
because Xiaojian Part Time

166
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,920
sounds not very lucky.

167
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,950
It might be lucky if its name is changed.

168
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,870
It makes sense.

169
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,870
It makes sense.

170
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,920
Do it step by step.

171
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,720
After it has many registered users in the future,

172
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,920
advertisers will come to you.

173
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,800
I will go for it.

174
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,390
You are so awesome.

175
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,600
I envy you.

176
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,630
As for Xiaojian Part Time,

177
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,560
who is Xiaojian?

178
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,600
Wait a moment.

179
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,160
Guo Shijie.

180
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,270
Come on, come on.

181
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,360
Come here.

182
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,000
This is my boyfriend.

183
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,920
We two just graduated from college this year.

184
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,630
He works several jobs alone.

185
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,480
Xiaojian Part Time

186
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,600
is our joint venture project.

187
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,120
Yes, exactly.

188
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,480
But his main job

189
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,960
is in Flying Network Company…

190
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,480
My Heart Flying Network Company.

191
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,000
My Heart Flying Network Company.

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
He's the art director.

193
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,480
But people usually

194
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,510
like to call him Xiaojian.

195
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,910
Hello. Hello.

196
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,480
Hello. Hello.

197
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,670
She is a programmer.

198
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,550
She's amazing.

199
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,790
You are a programmer?

200
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,000
It’s just right.

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,440
Our company is recruiting programmers.

202
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,630
You can have a look.

203
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,550
Here is my business card.

204
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,600
The art director of your company even takes charge of recruitment?

205
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,480
There are only four people in our company,

206
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,790
including the boss.

207
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,390
It’s just started.

208
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,790
Miss,

209
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,200
have we met somewhere before?

210
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,030
I'm sorry.

211
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,840
We'll leave as we have activities.

212
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,200
-Are you leaving? -That's fine.

213
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,910
If you are interested in our company,

214
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,790
-keep in touch with me. -Remember to contact us.

215
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
So good to be young.

216
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,790
Agreed.

217
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,150
Standing at the right air outlet,

218
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,150
anybody can succeed.

219
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,030
Hello, which company are you from?

220
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,550
L&P.

221
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,840
Check in here.

222
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,320
Okay.

223
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,440
Give it to me.

224
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,960
All right, guests and friends.

225
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,000
Welcome to

226
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,080
the 14th Internet Conference.

227
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,080
At this moment,

228
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,120
we have invited

229
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,910
our model worker in the online celebrity world, Miss Luna

230
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,390
and Mr. Gao Jianhong.

231
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,150
Welcome.

232
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,960
Next is

233
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,480
our link of taking photos.

234
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,120
Please look at the photographer ahead.

235
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,440
Now we leave the time to you

236
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,910
Luna. Luna. Look here.

237
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,670
This is Gao Jianhong's wife?

238
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,910
Can you take off your sunglasses

239
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,030
so that we take some more pictures?

240
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,790
Xu Lina?

241
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,600
She is Xu Lina?

242
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,240
Didn’t Xu Lina always

243
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,630
chase after Li Xun?

244
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,120
Why did she marry Gao Jianhong?

245
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,080
Our venue is ready.

246
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,720
Please come to our meeting place

247
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,670
to take a break.

248
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,910
Thank you both.

249
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,480
Thank you.

250
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
Al right. Friends.

251
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,910
L&P,

252
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,360
lucky and power.

253
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,630
At this moment, we are also looking forward to

254
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,440
the activity site of this Internet Conference.

255
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,240
Your seats are here. Please follow me.

256
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,200
This one.

257
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,960
Let's go there.

258
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,200
I saw Mr. Li.

259
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,910
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

260
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,670
Long time no see, Zhang.

261
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,510
Long time no see.

262
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,360
Mr. Gao, your position is here.

263
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,670
Mr. Gao.

264
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,720
Hi, Mr. Gao.

265
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,270
Long time no see.

266
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:22,790
Hello.

267
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,120
Long time no see.

268
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,320
Okay, everybody.

269
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,750
Next,

270
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,270
let's welcome the Vice President of L&P Company

271
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,480
Mr. Fang Zhijing to make a speech on the stage.

272
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,270
Let's welcome him with applause.

273
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,840
Hello everyone.

274
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,150
I'm the Chief Technology Officer of L&P,

275
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,840
Fang Zhijing.

276
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,000
For Chinese games,

277
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,510
this year

278
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,270
is a year of rethinking

279
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,670
about the return of value.

280
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,790
Why do I say that?

281
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,270
Then we should go back to

282
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,390
the earliest pioneer era.

283
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,150
All we pursued was data

284
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,120
and running water.

285
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,390
Now, the industry is focusing on

286
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,030
social value of industry,

287
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,960
to explore how companies and industries

288
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,080
have a more long-term development.

289
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,240
With our life getting

290
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,360
closer and closer with games,

291
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,630
games are not limited to the pure category

292
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,670
of entertainment and creative culture.

293
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,480
Sir.

294
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,240
It is also a new educational tool.

295
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,390
Excuse me, sir.

296
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,910
Would you please cooperate with us?

297
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,440
In 2018.

298
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,030
Sir.

299
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,000
Please cooperate with us.

300
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,240
You can't sit here.

301
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,870
It enables many users to master programming knowledge.

302
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,360
Sir.

303
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,080
Please leave.

304
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,360
I know him.

305
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,270
Okay.

306
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,270
In an environment of education and entertainment,

307
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,360
it has a mindset.

308
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,320
I remember the chief cultural officer of Sony.

309
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,840
Have you considered it?

310
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,840
How much?

311
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,030
Say a number.

312
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,120
All.

313
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,910
What?

314
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,360
What I want is everything you have.

315
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,440
What do you want me to give you?

316
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,600
Not “give”

317
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,910
but “return”.

318
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,840
You have another chance.

319
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,520
Let me ask you one last time.

320
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,590
Are you convinced?

321
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,000
Li Xun.

322
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,560
Are you crazy?

323
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,630
If you say you regret it now,

324
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,200
I'll consider letting you go.

325
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,630
It's the same answer however time you asked.

326
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,120
If a man reaches this step,

327
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
he is a little funny.

328
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,360
How can we use games as a carrier?

329
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,750
You don't deserve

330
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,200
the name L&P.

331
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,240
From today on,

332
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,360
I would take L&P back.

333
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,030
You came to tell me this?

334
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,240
Li Xun.

335
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,750
I've been long waiting for this day.

336
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,150
I'm glad

337
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,600
this contest

338
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,910
occurs after graduation.

339
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,910
In this case,

340
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,600
we can avoid unserious fight.

341
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,390
I'd like to see

342
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,510
how you take back

343
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,000
the name of L&P.

344
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,510
So I believe

345
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,030
Chinese games

346
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,670
are promising.

347
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,960
I'm from My Heart Flying Network Company.

348
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,000
We recruit programmers.

349
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,320
Would you like to take a look?

350
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,510
So you find

351
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,600
a new company so soon?

352
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,670
Yeah.

353
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,750
Your resume is half done.

354
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,240
It's good if people don't dislike you.

355
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,750
You have no right to dislike others.

356
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,670
I'll contact you.

357
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,630
All right, you can call me at any time.

358
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,510
Here's a business card.

359
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,510
Have a look.

360
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,150
If necessary,

361
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,360
just call me.

362
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,630
Bye.

363
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,390
Hello!

364
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,480
You're still the same as before.

365
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,240
Always capricious.

366
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,440
You are also the same as before.

367
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,840
Always can't see far.

368
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,510
By the way,

369
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,240
Zhu Yun came to see me.

370
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Didn't expect it?

371
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,550
Neither did I expect

372
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,600
she's the same as before.

373
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,030
Even against the world,

374
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,360
she will still stand beside you.

375
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,390
This is between us.

376
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,480
You stay away from her.

377
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,360
You used to order this and that.

378
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,240
Today, for the sake that we used to classmates,

379
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,790
let me also advise you.

380
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,550
People should be aware of current affairs.

381
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,790
With your identity,

382
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,200
it’s hard to find a job.

383
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,000
Do you want me to help you?

384
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,720
It's different now.

385
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,350
Depending on yourself,

386
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,680
you can't climb a peak.

387
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,720
Gao Jianhong.

388
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,400
Remember.

389
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,960
I never need to climb a peak.

390
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,480
I’m just

391
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,200
an unsurpassable peak.

392
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,000
Go.

393
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,200
Is that company on

394
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,750
Li Xun's business card

395
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,240
the one we just met?

396
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,830
My Heart Flying?

397
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,200
The tier is broken?

398
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,240
On the way,

399
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,480
I got a call from your mom.

400
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,270
My mom?

401
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,240
What did she say?

402
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,270
She asked when we would return

403
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,310
and if we had met our friend.

404
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,830
I said yes.

405
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,790
As a result,

406
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
at this time,

407
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,200
the car gave an alarm.

408
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,240
I got out and had a look.

409
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,680
The tire is broken.

410
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,550
But why is your tire one size smaller?

411
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,000
The spare tire.

412
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
What did you say?

413
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,000
I said we had met him

414
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,510
We'll be back in two days.

415
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,480
I'm not going back yet.

416
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,830
I wrote a resignation email to the company.

417
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,400
I won't go abroad.

418
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,880
Oh.

419
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,880
A friend of mine

420
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
always invited me to hold an exhibition here.

421
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,310
You can stay in

422
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,960
in the name of helping me to hold the painting exhibition.

423
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,750
If we organize more international exchange activities,

424
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,680
it's helpful for you to get the green card.

425
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,880
And aunt won't doubt.

426
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,440
I'm sorry.

427
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,720
For what?

428
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,270
It's not fair to you.

429
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,960
You shouldn't

430
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,920
waste time in helpless thing.

431
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,310
Why are you so honest?

432
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,550
All right, all right.

433
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,720
Don’t make things

434
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,830
so complicated.

435
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,960
Even I choose to stay,

436
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,160
I have a lot of work to do.

437
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,830
I just think that,

438
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
staying with you

439
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,310
is comfortable and simple.

440
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,720
That is it.

441
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,750
Come and taste this latte.

442
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,830
My Heart Flying Network Company?

443
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,440
It also develops games.

444
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,270
Yeah. but most of its games

445
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,750
were cut off before they were launched online.

446
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,240
Long-term recruitment of programmers.

447
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,550
The monthly salary is only 6,500 yuan.

448
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,880
That's too little.

449
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,550
But if it's like the boy said yesterday,

450
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,350
even the art director came out to recruit,

451
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,030
6,500 is a big sum for them.

452
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,680
It looks like they are going bankrupt.

453
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,350
But Li Xun chose this company.

454
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,830
Are you kidding?

455
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,000
It’s small, shabby and unreliable.

456
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,480
Don't talk about dealing with L&P,

457
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,720
if Li Xun really goes here,

458
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,110
he can't even feed himself.

459
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,720
But does he have any other choice?

460
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,000
L&P is now the industry leader.

461
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,550
Even if any big company wants him,

462
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,240
as long as Gao Jianhong warns them,

463
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,830
they won’t hire him.

464
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,440
Zhu Yun.

465
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,030
Have you really made up your mind

466
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,510
to go to Flying?

467
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,750
Now that you have broken up.

468
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,440
What does it have to do with you

469
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,790
who he fights with and whether he is alive or not.

470
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,720
I didn't stay not just for him.

471
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,160
The battle with L&P

472
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,480
can't be avoided.

473
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,310
I must warn you.

474
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,480
It must be a scuffle.

475
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,160
When he raises his flag,

476
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,400
you shouldn’t jump into the pits.

477
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,070
Are you really going to get involved?

478
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,790
You really don't want to go back?

479
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,960
You don’t want your job?

480
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,160
Think about your career.

481
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,030
Think about annual salary

482
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,640
of a million US dollars you are going to get.

483
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,680
Now to me and Li Xun,

484
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,270
it’s not about money and benefits.

485
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,310
It's a dream.

486
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,200
Yes. You have time.

487
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,750
Don't say anything nice.

488
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,400
You are just being obsessed by him.

489
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
Bad debt.

490
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,510
Is there any express to me?

491
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,790
Look for it.

492
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,790
Let me see.

493
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,510
Two of them are yours.

494
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,110
Hello!

495
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,030
Excuse me.

496
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,790
Where is the My Heart Flying Network Company?

497
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,480
Right there.

498
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,200
Go from here.

499
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,480
There?

500
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,310
Take the elevator to the third floor.

501
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,880
Okay, Thank you.

502
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,790
Not at all.

503
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,880
Aren't there two?

504
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,000
Sure enough.

505
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
Hello, Director Guo.

506
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,480
I'm downstairs.

507
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,920
I didn't delay the interview?

508
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,510
Okay, I'll be right up.

509
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,470
♫I don't know how you've been♫

510
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,390
♫You don't know how I've been♫

511
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,590
♫Nothing has changed♫

512
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,550
♫Have you ever changed?♫

514

♫You don't know how I've been♫

515
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,030

516

517
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,920
♫I've been walking so long♫
First getting out, then getting in, don't you know?

518
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,680
Excuse me.

519
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,720
What is this?

520
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,310
Sorry. Sorry.

521
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,070
Put these two boxes in the back.

522
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,680
Okay.

523
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,510
Excuse me. Excuse me.

524
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,000
Make way. Thank you.

525
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,550
Come here. Make way.

526
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,110
What's going on?

527
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,110
Sorry.

528
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,680
Be careful. Be careful.

529
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,380
[My Heart Flying Network]

530
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,240
Have a drink of water first.

531
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,830
Thank you.

532
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,510
Our director is interviewing inside.

533
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,000
You're the next one.

534
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,590
Let me introduce.

535
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,750
His name is Zhao Teng.

536
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,440
We all call him Teng.

537
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,160
He is the flight attendant of our company.

538
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,270
No,

539
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,720
he is a programmer in our company,

540
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,750
Flight attendant?

541
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,160
What?

542
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,680
You’ve been in prison?

543
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,920
He always becomes surprised.

544
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,200
Guo Shijie.

545
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,000
Who do you lead to the company every day?

546
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,590
There's someone else. What do you mean?

547
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,350
She came for the interview?

548
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:36,680
Yes.

549
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,350
Come in together.

550
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,200
I can finish it earlier.

551
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,550
Go for it.

552
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,000
You come in too.

553
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,400
Come in.

554
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,880
He was in prison.

555
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,310
What have you done?

556
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,640
What are you looking at me for?

557
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
What about you? Give me your resume.

558
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,400
Or are you like him?

559
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,000
You have no decent resume at all?

560
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:30,920
I'm sorry.

561
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,790
Here is my resume.

562
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,640
Now young people

563
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,240
are incomparable with us at that time.

564
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,070
No qualifications.

565
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,830
Look here.

566
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,550
Guo Xiaojian!

567
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,960
Who do you recruit for the company every day?

568
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,200
Either a bastard or a liar.

569
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,550
Liar?

570
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,110
Please make it clear.

571
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,480
Please,

572
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,160
be more serious about fraud.

573
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,750
With this qualification, you won’t come to my company.

574
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,030
You have no confidence in your company?

575
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:23,830
I, I…

576
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,510
Can we talk about things as they are?

577
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,550
Let's just talk about it.

578
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,400
You don't think highly of your company at all.

579
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,510
If you always show that

580
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:30,960
the company will go bankrupt tomorrow

581
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,590
even when you interview someone,

582
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,880
how can you recruit talents?

583
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
You're right.

584
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,240
He is,

585
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,270
he is always like this.

586
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,510
Even if the company really has no strength,

587
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,680
you should also have confidence.

588
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,440
Only with confidence can we have good fortune

589
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,960
and touch good cards and turn over.

590
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,400
In addition,

591
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,400
you are the HR director of the company?

592
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,590
Yes.

593
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,160
Let me make a digression.

594
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,070
What do you think

595
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,160
is the most important for human resources?

596
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,480
What, what do you think?

597
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,070
It is to know people and abilities.

598
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,440
Otherwise, if you can't recognize the trump card,

599
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,480
that's too bad.

600
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,160
Yes.

601
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,590
Trump?

602
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,920
God, she nearly

603
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,720
confused me.

604
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,070
You mean you two are trumps?

605
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,550
Is that so?

606
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,590
Who is better?

607
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,240
You are the interviewer.

608
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,720
It must be up to you to judge.

609
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,510
But even if a great talent

610
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,480
needs to be discovered,

611
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,110
right?

612
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,240
You two

613
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,070
are acquaintances?

614
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,720
Kind of.

615
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,590
No.

616
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,960
Come on. Can you

617
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,550
reach an agreement first

618
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,830
before you came here?

619
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,550
How many companies interviewed you before?

620
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,510
I didn't take any interview when I was abroad.

621
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,440
They hired me directly.

622
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,510
This is the first company after I go back.

623
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,240
What about you?

624
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,750
I haven't had one before I got out of jail.

625
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,000
It’s the first time since I was released.

626
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,720
You have a master degree of Computer Science from Cornell University?

627
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:04,240
You once won the title of Oracle Excellent Intern.

628
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,640
You were also promoted to Google what?

629
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,550
Google Code Jam.

630
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,200
Global Finals.

631
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,590
Is it true?

632
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,640
Of course it's true.

633
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,070
Trump.

634
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,920
Great.

635
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,640
Friendly tips, Director Zhang.

636
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,830
President Dong will be back the day after tomorrow.

637
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,750
If you can't recruit any more people,

638
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,480
you can only prepare to break your arm

639
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,400
to please him.

640
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,400
You…

641
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,000
No.

642
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,790
Say something.

643
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,310
Comment on it.

644
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,030
In this company,

645
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,960
I work

646
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,920
and I get scolded.

647
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,200
They don't do anything

648
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,350
but play games

649
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,640
and eat.

650
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,720
Is it easy for me?

651
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,240
That's not easy for you.

652
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,480
The company belongs to everyone.

653
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,070
But someone must take the lead.

654
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,070
You take more blame,

655
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,000
which can only prove that you have done more work.

656
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,070
Those who don't work of course are right.

657
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,310
They don't even have a chance to get scolded.

658
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,240
Yeah.

659
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,720
He speaks very well.

660
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,310
Your name is…

661
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,510
Li Xun.

662
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,550
Yes, Li Xun.

663
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,880
Great guy.

664
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,640
Yeah.

665
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,880
How easy it is to talk.

666
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,920
What confidence, what fortune?

667
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,750
We can say that easily

668
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,440
because we don’t have to be responsible for it.

669
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,000
Right?

670
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,200
Yeah.

671
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,270
Look.

672
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,440
What is consciousness?

673
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,590
What is style?

674
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,440
That's it.

675
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,110
I think today

676
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,880
I know you better.

677
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,440
I'll contact you later.

678
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:54,920
See you.

679
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,160
Wait.

680
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,640
I'll be right down.

681
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,680
Teng.

682
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,110
My girlfriend came to bring me food again.

683
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,240
Bye-bye.

684
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,830
Only you have a girlfriend?

685
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,480
I'm so angry.

686
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,440
I can't see this.

687
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,070
What are you doing?

688
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,640
We’re attacking the city.

689
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,030
What’s up?

690
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,000
Can you do something serious?

691
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,830
It's easy. Two questions.

692
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,240
For the first question,

693
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,640
just answer it orally.

694
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Then the second one.

695
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,790
You have to do this program question.

696
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,510
What to do if the game feels bad?

697
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,480
What does this feel mean?

698
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,400
Look.

699
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,880
I said your resume is fake.

700
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,350
You play first.

701
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,830
How is it?

702
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,880
It's boring.

703
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,790
This game

704
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,590
is personally planned

705
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,880
and created by Director Zhang.

706
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,400
But apart from boredom,

707
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,270
do you have any other feelings?

708
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,960
A little bit stuck, not very smooth.

709
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,880
And the logical sequence is particularly bad, right?

710
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,510
That's all about feel.

711
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,310
Then I simply understand it as optimization and improvement.

712
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,000
Go on.

713
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,830
The data structure

714
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,400
and optimization algorithm have problems.

715
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,440
The resource loading is not dynamic.

716
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,960
It can’t timely release the memory

717
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,440
that is no longer used.

718
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,480
And look,

719
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,720
this character's response

720
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,240
to the player's instructions is not reasonable.

721
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,000
And the data transmitted by this network

722
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,110
should also be redundancy.

723
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,200
If you adjust these,

724
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,720
the feel should be greatly improved.

725
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,510
Answer this

726
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,000
programming question.

727
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,590
Can I ask a question before writing?

728
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,000
It’s an exam.

729
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,070
No chatting during the exam.

730
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,840
First answer the question.

731
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,030
It's the same whether I answer it or not.

732
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,510
You know.

733
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,590
Do you have any idea about this salary?

734
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,760
It’s up to you.

735
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,000
But I have one condition.

736
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,030
What condition?

737
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,190
The person taking the interview with me just now

738
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,000
should also be employed.

739
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,840
Your relative?

740
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,480
No.

741
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,840
In this case,

742
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,110
who is he for you?

743
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,550
You know what?

744
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,510
Our company forbids office romance.

745
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,880
You really think too much.

746
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,030
We do know.

747
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,480
But now we are really unfamiliar.

748
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,400
Unfamiliar?

749
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,630
Why do you help him then?

750
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,880
What do you think of our company?

751
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,400
You can’t get him here

752
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,670
because you know him.

753
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,960
You know, in our company,

754
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,960
you have to depend on your ability.

755
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,880
If it's really hard, forget it.

756
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,630
Wish you find the right employee soon.

757
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,510
Wait.

758
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,550
Come on. Come on.

759
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,760
Just this decent dress.

760
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,440
Sign it quickly.

761
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,070
Sign what?

762
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,880
Her.

763
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,590
You didn't hear about her nepotism?

764
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,670
It doesn’t matter.

765
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,550
Think about it.

766
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,550
We pay them 6,500 yuan a person

767
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,670
and just 13,000 in total each month.

768
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,000
Just?

769
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,670
It’s of great advantage for us.

770
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,400
You know nothing.

771
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,550
In addition,

772
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,800
Look at that man.

773
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,710
He can't even present a resume.

774
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,480
And he has been in prison for intentional assault.

775
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,400
You.

776
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,510
He was in prison,

777
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,030
and he may have

778
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,150
antisocial personality.

779
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,320
Hiring him

780
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,150
will bring us trouble.

781
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,110
Many people change to be good

782
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,920
after they are released

783
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,400
from the prison.

784
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,400
By the way,

785
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,710
Director Dong was also in prison.

786
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,590
So,

787
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,360
you don’t know how scary it is?

788
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,150
It’s not enough to have one?

789
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,710
What do you mean by hiring another one?

790
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,710
Double buff?

791
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,070
Anyway, I gave my suggestion.

792
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,190
But recruitment

793
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,030
is your business.

794
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,320
It’s up to you.

795
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
I’ll go back to work.

796
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:13,960
Teng.

797
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,030
Come here.

798
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,800
Tell me the truth.

799
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,000
Is she

800
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,960
really that good?

801
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,280
No, dude.

802
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,960
Even you can get paid.

803
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,230
Is she worse than you?

804
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,630
As for your connection,

805
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,960
his situation is quite special.

806
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,800
After all, he was once in prison.

807
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,590
And despite

808
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,550
his ability,

809
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,280
he hasn't contacted this industry for several years after all.

810
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,550
No one knows his ability now.

811
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,630
Of course.

812
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,760
Our company

813
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,840
also has a certain sense of social responsibility.

814
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,630
We are still willing to accept those

815
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,150
special persons

816
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,670
and help them to live in the society again.

817
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,110
But I also have one condition.

818
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,760
Now that you insist on

819
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,400
recruiting him,

820
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,840
you need to pay his salary.

821
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,590
Okay, I'll pay him.

822
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,920
You agree?

823
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,880
You are fast.

824
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,670
You are fast.

825
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,360
Then I'll tell you about

826
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,480
our future arrangement.

827
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,320
Since you two are together,

828
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,550
your salary is 6,500 yuan a month.

829
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,230
But here is a tip.

830
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,840
If you are late or leave early,

831
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,800
I would deduct your payment.

832
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,320
Of course, if he is late or leaves early,

833
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,710
I’ll also deduct your money.

834
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,320
If you accept this condition,

835
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,710
you can come to work tomorrow.

836
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,320
I won't let you down.

837
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,150
Okay.

838
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,320
Well, congratulations.

839
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,760
Then we will be colleagues from now on.

840
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,630
Don’t be polite.

841
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,280
Zhao Teng.

842
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:45,960
Zhu Yun.

843
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,150
Then I’m leaving.

844
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:48,800
Okay.

845
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,510
See you tomorrow.

846
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,070
Zhang Fang.

847
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,800
Fang.

848
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,550
Great.

849
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,880
You are

850
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,230
more and more shameless now.

851
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,920
That’s the businessman thinking.

852
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,440
That’s acrobatic skill.

853
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,550
Miss Zhu.

854
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,110
What a coincidence. I haven't seen you for a long time.

855
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,230
Coincidence?

856
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,400
You don't seem to be here.

857
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,710
I went to the Internet Conference the other day.

858
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,110
This company is good.

859
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,000
It has great potential.

860
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Where is the potential?

861
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,440
That’s what I want to ask you.

862
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,670
What do you like about it?

863
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,840
Here's a suggestion.

864
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,920
Stay away from me.

865
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,400
You don't have to be so resistant to me.

866
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,360
If we have the same goal,

867
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,000
it's not a bad thing to be in a company.

868
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,110
We can deal with L&P together.

869
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,480
I fight against L&P

870
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,000
because it's my stuff.

871
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,880
What reason can you have?

872
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,550
Because of our past friendship?

873
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,480
L&P used to be mine.

874
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,360
I want to get it back

875
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,190
as much as you do.

876
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,760
No matter what

877
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,400
our relationship is,

878
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,920
I always believe that you are a real genius.

879
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,280
That's why I came.

880
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,840
You don't understand, do you?

881
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,070
No matter I cheat

882
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,110
or starve to death on the street,

883
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,360
it's none of your business.

884
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,110
Take your elegant boyfriend

885
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,840
and great resume,

886
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,800
stay away from me as far as possible.

887
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,030
Understand?

888
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,230
I went to meet Gao Jianhong.

889
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,070
I also checked the shareholding structure of L&P.

890
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,230
I won't leave this time whatever you say.

891
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,880
See you tomorrow.

892
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,110
Hello.

893
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,920
Dong's special car will serve you.

894
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,760
Please get on the car.

895
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,400
Sir.

896
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,320
Sir.

897
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,710
Your car is great.

898
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,320
Why are you willing to carry passenger with it?

899
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,230
Is it

900
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,510
a good car?

901
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,070
I just had a long trip.

902
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,190
I haven't washed it for several days.

903
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,440
Don't mind.

904
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,000
This is very clean.

905
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,400
We must be serious in providing service.

906
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,880
You are an amateur driver?

907
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,550
Full-time.

908
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,320
Dong's special car will serve you.

909
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,230
Full-time?

910
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,360
Your car can make money?

911
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,480
Sometimes,

912
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,230
it's not important to make money or not.

913
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,440
The key is to be happy.

914
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,000
I like driving.

915
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,550
As long as I can drive and carry passengers,

916
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,230
I'll be happy.

917
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,800
Please drive faster.

918
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,710
I'm in a hurry today.

919
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:01,880
No problem.

920
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,400
It's not the traffic jam yet.

921
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,230
Soon.

922
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,960
My first day at work today.

923
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
First day at work?

924
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,280
Congratulations.

925
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,000
Go to a big company

926
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,320
and meet a good boss.

927
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,480
See you.

928
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,760
Please give me a five-star review.

929
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,440
Thank you.

930
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,510
Li Xun really went to that Flying Network?

931
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,280
Not only Li Xun,

932
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,510
Zhu Yun also went there.

933
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,590
Their company

934
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,360
has zero performance  now.

935
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,550
It won't last long.

936
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,360
Li Xun,

937
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,880
do you still like me?

938
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,800
When can you stop being narcissistic?

939
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,440
What's your relationship

940
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,000
with our team leader Zhu?

941
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,360
If you don't answer my call again, I will deduct your attendance.

942
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,610
