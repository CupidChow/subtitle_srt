[Episode 34]

22
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,150
In a word,

23
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,430
we have to design

24
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,680
a better and funnier game

25
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,150
based on the source code

26
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,870
of the "Blind Box of Love",

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,590
but the premise is to avoid

28
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,310
all possible legal risks

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,000
to enable our company to go public.

30
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,640
The code of "Blind Box of Love" is very complicated.

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,560
If we change the most critical part,

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
the specific function will be affected.

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,400
We spent a week

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,960
in proposing an alternative solution,

35
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,560
but we failed.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,960
You can't give up.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,400
Even if the game will lack some functions,

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,800
we can't give Flying Company

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,520
any chance to sue us.

40
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,360
Do you have any other solution?

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,960
Don't change the code.

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,120
This is a trap.

43
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,910
Li Xun wrote such a complicated code

44
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,430
because he wanted us to give up changing it.

45
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,080
Even if we change the code,

46
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,470
the situation is still under his control.

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,910
Mr. Gao,

48
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,750
then our "Perfect Girlfriend"...

49
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,470
Copy the code.

50
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
The only way

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,520
of launching the "Perfect Girlfriend"

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,750
in the shortest time

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,710
is to directly copy

54
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,560
the source code of "Blind Box of Love".

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,000
I disagree.

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
I disagree.

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,190
You go out.

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,630
Gao Jianhong,

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,120
are you crazy?

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I was tolerant of you stealing and hacking codes before.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,360
I know you're angry.

62
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,870
We used to imitate the styles

63
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,120
and core playing methods,

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,150
but you can't

65
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,710
directly copy his source code.

66
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,840
Calm down.

67
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,000
There are many open game source codes online.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,080
Many?

69
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,870
Can you find them out?

70
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,360
Do you think it's the "Gluttonous Snake" or "Link Game"?

71
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,800
Actually,

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,560
Li Xun wrote

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,400
the code independently.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,120
We can't find any similar one at all.

75
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,840
Gao Jianhong,

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,080
after our company goes public,

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,630
you can

78
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,470
suit yourself,

79
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,710
but it's the sensitive period,

80
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,240
we'll be imprisoned if you do so.

81
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,390
Now that I decide to copy his source code,

82
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,720
I've thought about how to deal with the lawsuit.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,190
I don't worry about this.

84
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,920
Infringement lawsuit

85
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,750
costs much but offers little compensation,

86
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,870
and it's hard to adduce evidence,

87
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,750
so their small company can't fight against us at all.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Believe me.

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,070
Within a week,

90
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,390
he'll drop the case.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,600
Do you believe it?

92
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,360
How will you fight against them?

93
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,600
You should know that

94
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,600
Li Xun's capital source

95
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,390
is not just Flying Company.

96
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
Now many investors

97
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,040
want to invest in his game,

98
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,240
and he has a brother

99
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,480
and Light Red Band.

100
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,120
They all can provide him with strong financial support.

101
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,950
They can help him at a crucial time.

102
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,750
It reminds me

103
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,680
of Ren Di,

104
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,560
the woman of Light Red Band.

105
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,310
Wasn't she your classmate?

106
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,800
Why does she help him

107
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,950
but not you?

108
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,000
Gao Jianhong,

109
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,480
I've never seen Li Xun giving up anything.

110
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,950
As for you,

111
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,750
I expect that

112
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,680
you can defeat him one day.

113
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,040
Then you have to take good care of yourself.

114
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
You're so anxious to launch the "Perfect Girlfriend"

115
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,270
for courting disaster?

116
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,070
Fang Zhijing!

117
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,480
Who do you think you are?

118
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,310
How dare you criticize me!

119
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,040
Only when I treat you as a partner

120
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,390
can you be my partner,

121
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,510
or else

122
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,310
you're just an employee.

123
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,950
You're nothing.

124
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,040
OK.

125
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,600
OK.

126
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,270
Remember your words.

127
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:11,750
OK.

128
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,240
I don't want to be imprisoned.

129
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,870
I'll redeem my shares today.

130
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,360
I quit.

131
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,310
OK.

132
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,120
I'll try best to handle your resignation procedures,

133
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,480
Mr. Fang.

134
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,270
Gao Jianhong,

135
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,950
see what you're looking like

136
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,720
by facing the computer.

137
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,480
Without me,

138
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,830
the company would have collapsed!

139
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,040
These years,

140
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,830
I solicited business,

141
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,040
investment and resources for this company!

142
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,560
Do you really think the company's development depends on you?

143
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,040
Well,

144
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,190
just see

145
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,680
how many employees will stay

146
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,560
and whether the company will collapse

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
after I quit.

148
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,120
Go public?

149
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,270
No way.

150
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,750
Fang Zhijing,

151
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,720
listen up.

152
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,630
What I care about is never

153
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,870
whether the company can go public.

154
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,430
What time is it?

155
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,600
It's four o'clock.

156
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,310
Let me do it. You go to have a rest.

157
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,270
No need.

158
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,960
From they getting the source code

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,440
to changing the art resources and technical functions,

160
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,240
we haven't had much time for preparations.

161
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,150
Are you sure?

162
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,870
Once Gao Jianhong copied the "Blind Box of Love",

163
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,720
given the level of L&P's platform,

164
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,720
he'll launch another similar game.

165
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,150
By then Flying won't definitely be able to fight back,

166
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,670
and we'll lose

167
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,270
the only capital source.

168
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,630
It's a bet.

169
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,320
Do you still believe me?

170
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,510
But you can't

171
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,240
upgrade the technology

172
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,960
and make preparations

173
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,910
for such a complicated intellectual property lawsuit at the same time.

174
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,550
Fang Shumiao can help us with it.

175
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,270
You don't need to do so much work alone.

176
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,000
You've stayed up late for a week.

177
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,960
After this war comes to an end,

178
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,440
I'll have enough time to rest.

179
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,600
Look. It looks good.

180
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,270
Yeah.

181
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,720
She looks like the idol you're chasing.

182
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,200
This is the hottest girls' group.

183
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,750
Gao Jianhong is really generous.

184
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,390
L&P always spends much money

185
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,320
on publicity.

186
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,360
60% of their investment are spent on publicity.

187
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,270
He has vigorously advertised it

188
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,440
at the beginning of the internal test.

189
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,240
I've finished its decomposition.

190
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,720
The left code belongs to the "Perfect Girlfriend",

191
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,480
and the right one is the "Love Blind Box".

192
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,840
They're the same.

193
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,030
They were not changed at all.

194
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,840
Congratulations.

195
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
Your Trojan Horse

196
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,480
has successfully entered L&P.

197
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,790
It's impossible.

198
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,910
Gao Jianhong provides us with evidence on his own?

199
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,390
It's not important.

200
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,240
As long as he copies our source code,

201
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,360
we can sue him.

202
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,320
I agree.

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,870
Maybe he

204
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,870
is eager to make an achievement to make L&P go public,

205
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,670
so he copied the source code.

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,910
Anyway,

207
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,120
he may think

208
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,080
he can force you to drop the case.

209
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,600
Li Xun.

210
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,120
Get ready to sue him.

211
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,670
I've prepared all the materials.

212
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,630
Ask Hou Ning if you have any questions.

213
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,600
When should we sue him?

214
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,480
It's not urgent.

215
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,240
After he launches the game

216
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,390
and makes a big profit.

217
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,790
These days,

218
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,270
you contact other companies.

219
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,320
Contact all the companies that

220
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,080
had trouble with L&P in copyright.

221
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,910
If they want us to sue L&P on behalf of them, it's better.

222
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,440
We can bear all the costs.

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,120
If they don't want,

224
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,390
it doesn't matter.

225
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,030
Try to collect more evidence materials.

226
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,120
Don't worry.

227
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,960
Just play to the score.

228
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,550
The codes are indeed the same.

229
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,080
Li Xun.

230
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,270
Li Xun.

231
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,910
-Li Xun. -What's wrong with Li Xun?

232
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,790
Li Xun.

233
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,630
You'll get better.

234
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,630
You can't go in.

235
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,630
Li Xun,

236
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,240
let me go.

237
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,600
You'll be out soon.

238
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,840
Well,

239
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,670
he'll just have a CT  examination

240
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,030
but won't die.

241
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,390
Be good.

242
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,600
Let me go.

243
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,390
What's wrong with him?

244
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm all right.

245
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,600
He has been here before, right?

246
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,720
Yes.

247
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,790
But he came

248
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,150
for his lumbar vertebra a few years ago.

249
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,750
What does he do?

250
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,670
IT, the computer industry.

251
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,360
I see.

252
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,150
Don't worry.

253
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,200
His disease is not serious.

254
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,960
It's a matter of his vertebra.

255
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,790
He suffers from vertebra osteoarthritis caused by lumbar vertebra

256
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,550
and has had obvious symptoms.

257
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,390
Well,

258
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,200
it is really a high-risk industry.

259
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,910
Some of your peers always die suddenly every year.

260
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,750
Can vertebra osteoarthritis cause a faint?

261
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,870
His back was stiff.

262
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,080
The blood could only flow to his shoulders,

263
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,240
but his brain

264
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,030
always required high oxygen and vigor

265
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,790
at high-intensive work.

266
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,960
So

267
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,120
he fainted.

268
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,750
What should he do?

269
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,600
Rest and exercise.

270
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,870
Xiuzhu.

271
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,790
Zhu Yun.

272
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,910
How is he?

273
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,390
He is all right.

274
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,030
I didn't know he's in hospital

275
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,480
until Guo Shijie told me.

276
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,030
These days

277
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,790
you didn't even call me.

278
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,670
You were right.

279
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,960
He is indeed in poor health,

280
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,630
but he just endured it.

281
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,320
No one has endless energy.

282
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,510
It's lucky for a man

283
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,200
to live a safe and healthy life.

284
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,720
This seems to be the first time

285
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,670
you keep my words in mind.

286
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,440
Are you sure?

287
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,120
You won't leave?

288
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,840
I won't.

289
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,670
I've never seen a girl

290
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,000
who drives herself into a corner

291
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,550
but never regrets it.

292
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,440
Zhu Yun,

293
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,270
I'm here

294
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,630
to say goodbye to you.

295
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,510
I've decided to give up.

296
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,390
After hearing it,

297
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,840
do you feel a little relaxed?

298
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,440
In the world,

299
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,510
there are many spoony women,

300
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,550
but few of them

301
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,840
can harmonize and shoulder

302
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,240
the destiny, work,

303
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,870
life and ideal at the same time.

304
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,320
Actually, you can't, either.

305
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,630
You're just trying to do it.

306
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,080
Well,

307
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,360
remember my words.

308
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,000
You and Li Xun have had

309
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,150
many regrets.

310
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,750
Stop wasting your time so recklessly.

311
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,550
Ask your heart

312
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,550
and summon your courage

313
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
to face them.

314
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,000
You're thinner.

315
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,480
Fighting for love is good,

316
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,270
but it's not romantic

317
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,000
to faint at work.

318
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,510
I see.

319
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,350
I'm leaving.

320
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,590
Who is that?

321
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,590
Morning.

322
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,880
Where's Li Xun?

323
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,160
He is inside.

324
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,440
How do you feel today?

325
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,640
I'm better.

326
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,240
I bring you congee. Heat and eat it later.

327
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,240
What's wrong?

328
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,160
What?

329
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,160
Give me.

330
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,200
Anything else?

331
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,400
And?

332
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,720
No.

333
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,510
And?

334
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,160
No.

335
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,830
Give me.

336
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,480
Nothing.

337
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,240
Give me.

338
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,400
You know me so well.

339
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,200
Hurry up.

340
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,920
They're confiscated.

341
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,400
Rest and recuperate.

342
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,750
I'll keep them for you.

343
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,830
You're annoying.

344
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,000
Who is annoying?

345
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,750
You.

346
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,160
What's wrong?

347
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,720
My arm

348
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,270
aches.

349
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:56,880
Here?

350
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,640
Ouch.

351
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,440
Ouch.

352
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,070
It aches or itches?

353
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,640
Ache.

354
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,790
No wonder it aches in this posture.

355
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,310
You want to be in hospital again?

356
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,240
I've asked Dong Siyang for your leave.

357
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,590
You can't go to work this week

358
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,400
but can only rest and recuperate.

359
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,750
You're self-assertive.

360
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,440
Princess, you're bold.

361
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,400
I can be bolder.

362
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,310
Really?

363
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,880
Just wait and see.

364
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,500
I want to see now.

365
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
You can get even with me

366
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,550
after getting better.

367
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,110
OK.

368
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,030
Hey, guys.

369
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,200
Have a meeting. Have a meeting.

370
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,880
Here.

371
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,480
Our Flying is now in a special period.

372
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,830
We'll directly

373
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,070
fight against L&P soon.

374
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,750
You have to make full preparations.

375
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,790
I just want to tell you a sentence.

376
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,640
Just do it.

377
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,110
Hou Ning,

378
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,960
tell them the follow-up work

379
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,640
about the "Blind Box of Love".

380
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,070
We need to optimize the process in the next update.

381
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,350
I've added double authentication

382
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,960
and the function of brushing instance zones with friends,

383
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,880
namely the multiplayer mode.

384
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,830
Players can also form teams in this game?

385
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,720
Political Commissar Zhu,

386
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,790
you're not involved

387
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,400
in any activity of the "Blind Box of Love", right?

388
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,640
I didn't mean to do it,

389
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,270
but I have to because you have a meeting around me.

390
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,790
OK, stand up. Stand up.

391
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,920
Move your limbs.

392
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,920
Listen to the political commissar. Come on.

393
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,510
Let's do eye exercises next time.

394
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,270
You can.

395
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,240
Think of Li Xun.

396
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,160
March.

397
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,790
1, 2, 3, 4.

398
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,200
5, 6, 7, 8.

399
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,550
2, 2, 3, 4.

400
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,070
5, 6, 7. Stop.

401
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,400
Body turning motion.

402
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,640
Ready, go.

403
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,110
1, 2, 3, 4.

404
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,640
What are you doing?

405
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,030
Check if it has any problems.

406
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,680
I've confirmed it with Li Xun.

407
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,480
It can be submitted to the court anytime.

408
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,160
What did he say?

409
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,440
Nothing special.

410
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,160
He said it's a right time.

411
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,240
The turnover of Gao Jianhong's "Perfect Girlfriend" reaches a peak now,

412
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,440
and L&P happens to

413
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,400
be reviewed by the CSRC.

414
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,880
It's the best time

415
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,920
to catch the sheep.

416
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,000
He's really ruthless.

417
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,400
L&P should pay off its debts.

418
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,790
Too many companies

419
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,030
have trouble with L&P in copyright.

420
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,070
Those small companies

421
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,830
tolerated its infringement

422
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,880
or couldn't harm L&P at all.

423
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,000
But we have concrete and enough evidence this time

424
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,110
so the top scorer Li is going to remove the evil.

425
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,790
When will it be submitted?

426
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,590
There are only 10-odd days left before the holiday,

427
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,030
and the lawyer of L&P must have

428
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,590
booked a ticket for holiday.

429
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,480
You're really vicious.

430
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,790
Thank you.

431
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,270
I'm off duty.

432
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,310
Wait for me.

433
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,110
I'll be back soon.

434
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,750
Come in.

435
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,400
Lawyer Wang, this is a court summons.

436
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,030
Put it here.

437
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,310
Won't you check it?

438
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,510
No, I won't.

439
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,270
Our company has received

440
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,640
too many letters from lawyers.

441
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,790
I'll check it after coming back from holiday.

442
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,200
Shanshan,

443
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,680
which company is going to sue our company this time?

444
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,030
Let me see.

445
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,880
It's a class action.

446
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,310
My Heart Flying Network is the main suitor,

447
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,110
and 10-odd companies are also involved in it.

448
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,790
Well, let me see.

449
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,000
Return my air ticket.

450
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,830
Call others back.

451
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,480
This lawsuit is easy,

452
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,590
but our company

453
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,510
is going to go public.

454
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Others will be prone

455
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,720
to make an issue of this class action,

456
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,110
and the shareholders will also

457
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,720
doubt our company.

458
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,160
Forget it.

459
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,200
But we're in a passive position.

460
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,400
Once it becomes serious...

461
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,310
Why don't you all

462
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,550
make me repeat my words?

463
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,110
Since I dared do this,

464
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,640
I have my own way to deal with him.

465
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,240
Do you understand?

466
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,200
OK.

467
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,310
Why are you here?

468
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Gao Jianhong is not here.

469
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,440
He doesn't live here now.

470
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,030
I'm here to see you.

471
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,030
Gao is ill.

472
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,440
Ill?

473
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,920
Brain glioma.

474
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,160
It's malignant.

475
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,510
The doctor said

476
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,270
it can be cured

477
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,550
if he undergoes surgery in time.

478
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,550
How can it be malignant?

479
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,680
He didn't even mention it to me.

480
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,750
He didn't tell anyone.

481
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,350
Once I saw him

482
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,200
going to the neurosurgery in the hospital,

483
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,920
so I found it out.

484
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,030
The doctor said

485
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,790
Gao doesn't want to undergo surgery.

486
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,640
Why do you tell me?

487
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,270
What do you think?

488
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,270
L&P is sued.

489
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,750
Li Xun does it?

490
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,640
Finally.

491
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,000
It's very troublesome.

492
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,750
If he can't find a solution,

493
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,000
L&P won't go public

494
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,270
but will give compensation.

495
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,640
A lot of compensation.

496
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,590
What's worse,

497
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,790
after Flying Network succeeds,

498
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,750
other companies will also

499
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,440
sue L&P one after another.

500
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,480
By then,

501
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,640
L&P will really collapse soon.

502
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,750
Aren't you going to leave office?

503
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,640
It's none of your business.

504
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,440
I don't want to interfere in it,

505
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,640
but I haven't sold my shares yet.

506
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,160
You know

507
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
no one will buy my shares

508
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,310
after L&P is sued.

509
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,160
By then, L&P won't go public,

510
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,680
and even I may lose money and be imprisoned.

511
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:18,750
What should I do?

512
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,310
You deserve it.

513
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:24,830
Yes,

514
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,830
I really deserve it.

515
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,000
What about Gao?

516
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,350
Have you ever thought about Gao?

517
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,440
He did this,

518
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,750
so he should be mentally prepared for it.

519
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,680
Xu Lina,

520
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,920
ask your heart

521
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,830
whether Gao Jianhong treats you well.

522
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,750
He helped you

523
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,270
when your family needed help most.

524
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,400
Even if he does wrong,

525
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,750
he is sincere to you.

526
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,400
I know it.

527
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,110
He's in poor health,

528
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,790
but he doesn't want you to know this.

529
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,680
Only after this matter is completely settled

530
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,000
can Gao undergo surgery in time.

531
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,590
You're his wife.

532
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,590
Do you want him to die?

533
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,310
What can I do?

534
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,000
Go to see Zhu Yun and Li Xun.

535
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,550
They'll listen to me?

536
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,920
Anyway,

537
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,590
Gao used to be their old classmates.

538
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,510
You can go with Gao's medical record.

539
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,400
Tell them Gao's disease

540
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,920
and shift the blame onto Gao.

541
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,920
You'd,

542
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,880
you'd better to persuade Li Xun

543
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,790
to see him.

544
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,160
It'll get the best effect.

545
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,160
You know little about Li Xun.

546
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,110
He won't listen to me.

547
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,110
I know little about Li Xun?

548
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,640
Do you think you know him well?

549
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,240
Li Xun's sister

550
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,680
breathed her last in front of him,

551
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,400
so he must be traumatized by the death of people around him.

552
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,510
He usually looks cold

553
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,270
but is actually emotional.

554
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,400
This time,

555
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,880
I believe he'll show mercy.

556
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:51,830
Thank you.

557
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,200
Have a seat.

558
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,510
You don't need to avoid us.

559
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,680
Go ahead.

560
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,590
How can I

561
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,550
persuade you to drop the case?

562
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,790
Why do we drop the case?

563
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,720
Gao doesn't know that I'm here.

564
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,680
This is Gao's medical record.

565
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,750
This is CT.

566
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,350
I didn't want to tell you,

567
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,270
but I really have no choice.

568
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,790
Brain glioma.

569
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,110
Malignant.

570
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,510
If you don't drop the case,

571
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,160
Gao won't undergo surgery.

572
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,240
I hope

573
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,200
you can show mercy to him.

574
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,590
He didn't tell anyone.

575
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,680
If he knows I'm here,

576
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,430
he must be very unhappy.

577
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,440
Fang Zhijing asked you to see us?

578
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,550
No.

579
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,510
He told it to me,

580
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,160
but I decide to come today.

581
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,720
He still retains

582
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,350
your group photo.

583
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,920
I have no choice.

584
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,750
Gao must undergo surgery immediately,

585
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,400
but this lawsuit

586
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,350
won't reassure him.

587
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,070
I decide to come myself.

588
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,110
Gao really doesn't know it.

589
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,590
He always wants to compete with you.

590
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,440
Actually, I've never done anything

591
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,510
for him these years.

592
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,200
He is dying.

593
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,110
I don't want to have any regret.

594
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:46,920
Zhu Yun,

595
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,720
persuade Li Xun.

596
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,480
Feeling hatred for someone

597
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,960
is very tiring.

598
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,480
He'd wasted four years.

599
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,590
Don't waste time on anyone else.

600
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,760
Throw them away.

601
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,030
Li Xun.

602
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,510
Zhu Yun,

603
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,110
do you think we should be bullied?

604
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,510
Why does Fang Zhijing think

605
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,400
we'll do as he likes?

606
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,360
You're so sure that Fang Zhijing asked her to see us?

607
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,920
Gao Jianhong impossibly yields to us,

608
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,320
even if he'll die!

609
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,710
It's malignant.

610
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,960
So?

611
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,000
Fang Shumiao called me.

612
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,960
She said the lawyer of L&P

613
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,440
wants to discuss about it with us.

614
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,150
As long as we reconcile with L&P,

615
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,550
they can pay as much as we want.

616
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,440
It must be Fang Zhijing's trick.

617
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,070
He is working with the shareholders to put pressure on us.

618
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,190
Is it possible...

619
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:12,880
No.

620
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,230
OK.

621
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,280
I'll ask Fang Shumiao

622
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,760
to reply them over the phone.

623
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,920
Fang Shumiao also said that

624
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,190
the CSRC has required L&P

625
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,480
to supplement materials

626
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,110
for the reason that

627
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,000
the restructured target company

628
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,110
is unstable

629
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,590
in its future business capacity.

630
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,440
So we can refuse to see them.

631
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,070
Go to see them.

632
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,360
Why not?

633
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,510
What are you doing?

634
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,190
They're waiting for you.

635
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,400
According to the 4th stratagem of the "Art of War,"

636
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,840
we should wait at  ease

637
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,360
and conserve strength

638
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,320
to deal the exhausted enemy

639
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,190
head-on blows.

640
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,920
How did you learn it?

641
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,670
I learnt it from you.

642
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,920
Why didn't you learn my merits?

643
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,440
Hurry up.

644
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,190
Don't occupy the reception room.

645
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,070
Settle the matter as soon as possible.

646
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,230
Lawyer He's client will come later.

647
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,400
Yes.

648
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,030
Long time no see,

649
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,670
Monitor Fang.

650
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,920
Long time no see.

651
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,630
Mr. Gao,

652
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,150
you're really not a gentleman.

653
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,550
Lawyer Fang,

654
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,280
where's your client?

655
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,150
Mr. Li is busy,

656
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,760
so I've been entrusted with the lawsuit.

657
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,550
Actually,

658
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,440
many investors want to invest in Flying these days.

659
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,400
Today some investors

660
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,510
go to see Mr. Li.

661
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,440
If you want to see him, you have to queue up.

662
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,920
I see.

663
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,800
Let's get straight to the point.

664
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,070
As a leading enterprise

665
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,140
in the game industry,

666
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,920
L&P has always devoted

667
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,590
to supporting small game companies in the industry.

668
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,230
In order to create a good industry environment,

669
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,190
we can spend 30 million yuan

670
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,550
in supporting the small game companies

671
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,920
represented by you.

672
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:24,880
What's your requirement?

673
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,710
Discontinue your unwarranted charge

674
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,550
against L&P.

675
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,710
L&P can spend 30 million yuan

676
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,760
on an unwarranted charge?

677
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,920
Don't you worry that you'll be always blackmailed?

678
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,590
Lawyer Fang,

679
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,110
a rumor will become a fact after it's spread many times.

680
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,110
Besides, too many companies

681
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,440
are jealous of L&P.

682
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,000
People are always interested

683
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,190
in ridiculous stunts.

684
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,800
Well,

685
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,280
for your charge,

686
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,000
we also reserve

687
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,070
the right to accuse you of defamation.

688
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,550
Of course, as I said,

689
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,070
as a leading enterprise,

690
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,320
L&P always wants to lead other companies forward.

691
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,960
We're tolerant.

692
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,280
We can spend 30 million yuan

693
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,230
in solving a problem,

694
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,280
but you

695
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,510
are different.

696
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,920
We...

697
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,000
As lawyers,

698
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,840
we need to give priority

699
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,320
to the interests of our clients.

700
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,360
You're entrusted with a class action.

701
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,800
You should ask

702
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,800
your other clients first, shouldn't you?

703
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,920
Are you teaching me how to do?

704
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,400
Miss Fang,

705
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,960
to tell you the truth,

706
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,280
actually, it's already an excellent deal.

707
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,960
You can persuade your clients.

708
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,150
Whether it's an excellent deal doesn't depend on you.

709
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,480
What's more, you should have paid it in compensation long before.

710
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,840
You must be a green hand.

711
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,150
I investigated you.

712
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,030
You're not a trained lawyer.

713
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,360
You switched to the profession of a lawyer after passing

714
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,360
the National Unified Legal Professional Qualification Examination

715
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:14,920
and didn't receive higher education.

716
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,400
No wonder you don't know the rules.

717
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,150
Your greediness

718
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,000
may break down our negotiation,

719
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,320
and you'll harm your clients' interests.

720
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,150
I'm indeed inferior to you in this aspect.

721
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,920
After all, after 7-year law learning,

722
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,500
you're only good at doing evil

723
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,150
for the bad.

724
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,190
Lawyer Wang,

725
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,000
go out.

726
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,440
I want to talk

727
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,710
with my old classmate alone.

728
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,710
OK.

729
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,440
Why did Li Xun

730
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,070
suddenly ask you to see me?

731
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,280
Xu Lina went to see Li Xun and Zhu Yun.

732
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,440
They know you're ill.

733
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,800
No wonder you're here.

734
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,280
Li Xun never wastes time on something meaningless.

735
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,710
If he decides to put it off to the last minute,

736
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,360
he won't give anyone a chance to speak.

737
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,280
He asked you to come

738
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,550
because he has swayed,

739
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,630
but I don't need it.

740
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,550
I don't want his sympathy.

741
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,440
Do you know

742
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,000
why I dared copy the "Blind Box of Love" directly?

743
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,150
Because you have no choice.

744
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,070
Have you never doubted

745
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,030
why I dared do so?

746
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,960
Hello, Shumiao.

747
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:54,960
Zhu Yun,

748
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,710
Li Xun has decided to drop the case.

749
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,590
When?

750
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,400
Just now.

751
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,590
So suddenly.

752
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,760
You've reached an agreement?

753
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,070
Zhu Yun,

754
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,030
be strong.

755
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,800
I send you a video.

756
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,280
Does he want Zhu Yun to be discredited?

757
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,030
Does he really care about someone?

758
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,760
Before I die,

759
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,440
I must defeat him once!

760
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,230
Tell me whether you regret or not!

761
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,230
I'll go on fighting against him!

762
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,440
Do you also stand by him?

763
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,630
Zhu Yun,

764
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,150
why do we become like this?

765
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,220
