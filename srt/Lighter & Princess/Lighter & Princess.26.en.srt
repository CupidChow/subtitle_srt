♫Everything is different when we watch the sky from the sea bottom♫

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,820
♫The person I used to be is gone♫

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,980
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,380
♫Even if the world fell apart into darkness♫

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,260
♫We would bloom in the darkness♫

♫like the white sails in night navigation are protecting the ocean♫

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,940
♫I see a clear direction♫

[Episode 26]

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,310
Unexpectedly, this store is still open here.

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,350
I know just a few stores.

23
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,310
Yes.

24
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,360
Back then you seldom took me

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,800
to restaurants like this.

26
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,590
That was a favor to you.

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,470
You remember it very clearly.

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,470
What is this?

29
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,000
Chronology of events.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,080
You didn't have time, right?

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,750
How long did it take you to write this?

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,150
What you wrote is just ordinary.

33
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,910
They are

34
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,430
historical events accessible to all.

35
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,400
But this kind of game needs a sense of curiosity.

36
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,630
It requires more details.

37
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,470
I've compiled several e-books

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,000
and posts on forums,

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,310
including some unofficial history records.

40
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,470
Unofficial history?

41
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,190
It is my favorite.

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
I make it for your study,

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,240
not for your curiosity.

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,710
You don't usually play games.

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,120
The last time I played a game

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,840
is...

47
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,150
Are telling me the last game you played

48
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,910
is the one I designed for you.

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,080
A game?

50
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,520
Three chances.

51
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,240
If you make it, I'll attend the morning self-study.

52
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,280
I also found several games

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,870
similar to Invincible Generals.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,000
The installation package is on the flash drive.

55
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,520
Tomorrow is the weekend.

56
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,030
Don't go to the company.

57
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,840
Take time to play

58
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,190
and feel it.

59
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,750
You stood up on impulsion.

60
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,960
Think about you capability before doing that.

61
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,840
Can't you say something nice?

62
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,560
So are you going to fight with Gao Jianhong?

63
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,590
Yes.

64
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,200
Invincible General will be our first bullet.

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,760
Be serious.

66
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,920
I see.

67
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,720
Boss,

68
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,190
I'll have a bottle of Erguotou.

69
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,390
Wait.

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,750
Are you going to drink?

71
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,680
Yes.

72
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,390
I want to celebrate.

73
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,160
OK.

74
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:33,800
Wait.

75
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,750
We don't need spirit.

76
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,720
Why? Mind your own business.

77
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,070
Don't drink.

78
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,040
None of your business.

79
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:42,950
Don't serve the spirit.

80
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
I won't pay for it.

81
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,190
I will.

82
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,360
Serve the spirit.

83
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,560
Well.

84
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,070
Excuse me.

85
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,000
Who should I listen to?

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,000
Me.

87
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,510
I'm the group leader.

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,830
Serve it, boss.

89
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,720
Thanks.

90
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,560
Can't I celebrate?

91
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,040
Don't need to walk me back.

92
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,560
I'm not drunk.

93
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,720
When I was abroad...

94
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,870
You've learned to drink abroad.

95
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,560
It has nothing to do with that.

96
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,480
You misguided me.

97
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,510
I learned to drink

98
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,590
from you.

99
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,950
I drank for the first time.

100
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,800
I played game for the first time.

101
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,750
The first bullet Invincible General.

102
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,510
I work desperately for the first time.

103
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,310
Great.

104
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,360
How were you doing abroad?

105
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,800
Great,

106
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,070
except that I had to speak English

107
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,600
and the food were terrible.

108
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,390
But I was happy

109
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,070
as I can do and learn

110
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,270
what I like.

111
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Won't you go abroad again?

112
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,240
Are you going to give up?

113
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,480
We'll miss

114
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,950
many things in our life.

115
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,560
I know what I want,

116
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,160
so every step I take is in that direction.

117
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,830
I'll never regret.

118
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,600
That's what you told me.

119
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,630
Don't say that I corrupt you.

120
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,270
Are you sober up?

121
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,920
Yes.

122
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,040
My room is up there.

123
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,190
Thank you for sending me back.

124
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,830
See you.

125
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,160
See you tomorrow.

126
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,510
What do you want to eat today?

127
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,430
What do you want to eat today?

128
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,680
Whatever.

129
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,070
Then eat nothing.

130
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,510
Who?

131
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,750
Who are you?

132
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,120
I want to meet Li Xun.

133
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,510
She wants to meet you.

134
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,430
Long time no see.

135
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,630
What can I do for you?

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,800
May I come in?

137
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
Do you have time?

138
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,870
Let's go out for dinner.

139
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,910
No.

140
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
He is cooking.

141
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,910
OK.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,120
Let's dine at home.

143
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,720
I didn't prepare food for you.

144
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,840
Never mind.

145
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,080
I'll prepare.

146
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,360
The dishes are ready.

147
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,320
Please enjoy your meal.

148
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,790
Send Mr. Wang back.

149
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,150
Enjoy it. Help yourself.

150
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,200
OK.

151
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,120
Do you really work

152
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,320
in Flying Company?

153
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,360
Ask Gao and you'll know.

154
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,440
He keeps watch on us every day.

155
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,510
How about Zhu Yun?

156
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,960
If you're curious about her,

157
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,670
ask her directly.

158
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,200
I know

159
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,670
she'll go to work there with you.

160
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,510
But don't you think it's a bit shabby

161
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,270
to start like this?

162
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,720
I'll leave the key here.

163
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,960
Drive my car.

164
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,510
My dad

165
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,480
has a vacant apartment.

166
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,840
You can live there

167
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,000
to make use of it.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,240
It's narrow here.

169
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,030
You're here to dig?

170
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,320
You want to keep me as toy boy?

171
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,360
Have you ever thought that

172
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,150
if we were together,

173
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,550
everything would be different now?

174
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,320
Can we make it up now?

175
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,840
I can't.

176
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,390
No.

177
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,600
I feel a little sick.

178
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,550
Li Xun,

179
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,790
you never regret it?

180
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,630
Xu Lina,

181
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,150
you specially come to this rent house

182
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,000
and remind me.

183
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,320
Thank you.

184
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,320
If there is one thing I don't regret,

185
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,960
it's that I refused you.

186
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,240
You're never

187
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,440
comparable to Zhu Yun.

188
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,270
See you.

189
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,630
Gao has been on a business trip for just a few days.

190
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,510
I have to tell him about this.

191
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,720
What are you doing here?

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,960
What am I doing here?

193
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,240
Get to know my enemy.

194
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,720
What else can you do

195
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,480
except playing dirty like this?

196
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,510
Playing dirty?

197
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,120
Gao thought of this.

198
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,750
It has nothing to do with me.

199
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,360
You're contemptible.

200
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,960
Good-for-nothing;

201
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,870
You look furious.

202
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,630
What did he do to you?

203
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,870
You make me sick.

204
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,960
Xu Lina,

205
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,270
don't forget that Gao provides everything for you.

206
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:29,670
Go.

207
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,080
Yes.

208
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,270
He bought the car for you.

209
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,150
Mom, time to eat.

210
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,000
Xiuzhu's painting

211
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
is so imposing.

212
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,360
I like it very much.

213
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,120
Thank you, aunt.

214
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:15,840
Come on.

215
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Please taste

216
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,510
this tomato beef soup I made.

217
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,150
Thank you

218
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,550
for making so many

219
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,480
dishes for us.

220
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,720
What are you

221
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,720
doing here this time?

222
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,510
I can help you.

223
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
No need.

224
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,960
I came to see

225
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,840
what Zhu Yun is doing.

226
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,270
She has been helping me

227
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,630
with the painting exhibition these days.

228
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,440
I'm going to ask her to go back in a few days.

229
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,150
You just rent this place.

230
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,550
I can help you with guest coordination and site layout.

231
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,480
When will your exhibition start?

232
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,870
-Next week. -Next month.

233
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,390
It'll start next week

234
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,480
and end next month.

235
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,960
OK.

236
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,630
I'll come to visit by the time.

237
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:13,960
Then

238
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,750
Zhu Yun can stay here to help

239
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,550
with your exhibition preparation.

240
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:19,960
Well.

241
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,910
Wish you a successful exhibition.

242
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,270
Thank you.

243
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:29,960
Mom,

244
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,960
I'll make a phone call.

245
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,240
Xiuzhu,

246
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,750
is everything alright

247
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,630
with Yun recently?

248
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,960
She has been helping me with my exhibition recently.

249
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,200
What's wrong?

250
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,750
To tell the truth,

251
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,630
although

252
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,360
that young man is in prison,

253
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,960
Zhu overloads

254
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,840
so much.

255
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,320
I fear that

256
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,080
she'll go to meet him

257
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,510
without telling us.

258
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,510
Keep an eye on her.

259
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,000
Don't worry.

260
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,600
I'll report to you as soon as possible if anything goes wrong.

261
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,270
OK.

262
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,240
I'm relieved to have you here.

263
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,200
Enjoy the meal.

264
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,670
OK.

265
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,840
You said the exhibition will start next week.

266
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,550
What if my mom comes next week?

267
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,390
Taste this tomato beef soup.

268
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,000
Do you like it?

269
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,000
I didn't expect that

270
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,120
you can draw

271
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,480
and cook now.

272
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,350
Sorry, aunt.

273
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,310
I'll answer the phone.

274
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,030
Hello,

275
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,480
mom.

276
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,350
Xiuzhu,

277
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,830
you're sending our enemy a bomb.

278
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,110
You said the exhibition will start next week and end next month.

279
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,720
My mom can come anytime.

280
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,550
What if she comes suddenly?

281
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,030
Don't worry.

282
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,110
I can deal with it.

283
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,960
I'm having dinner

284
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,440
with Zhu Yun and Aunt Liu.

285
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,110
It's almost midnight there, right?

286
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,880
I give you best.

287
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,160
I have to go back to work this afternoon.

288
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,720
Let's tell my mom that we'll meet exhibition guests.

289
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't spill the beans.

290
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,960
OK. No problem.

291
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,240
Your mom?

292
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,110
Mom,

293
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,790
Aunt Liu is here with me.

294
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,830
Do you want to talk to her?

295
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,240
OK.

296
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,720
Hello,

297
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,720
Jiang.

298
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,030
I...

299
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,350
Hello?

300
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,310
Hello?

301
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,920
I'll check it.

302
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,960
The phone hung up.

303
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,960
The infrastructure abroad is unreliable.

304
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,880
The connection is broken.

305
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,720
How about calling back?

306
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,590
OK.

307
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,590
Don't bother.

308
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,310
It's time to sleep.

309
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
How do you know that?

310
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,750
Uncle goes fishing and aunt

311
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,000
goes running every morning.

312
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,200
Now it's midnight there.

313
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,030
You remember it better than I do.

314
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,110
Of course. The lake near your house

315
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,640
connects to a private lawn.

316
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,720
It'll be wonderful

317
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,240
to hold

318
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,110
a wedding ceremony

319
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,750
in such a beautiful place.

320
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,960
By the way, aunt,

321
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,790
well,

322
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll meet a professor

323
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,240
of the School of Art

324
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,680
of Nanhu University.

325
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,440
I'm afraid I can't keep you and Zhu Yun company.

326
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,510
You're familiar with Nanhu University.

327
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,480
Yes, I am. I'll go with you.

328
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,920
Right.

329
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,680
Then, then I'll go with her.

330
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,640
No problem.

331
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,440
You can go together.

332
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,960
Leave the room card to me.

333
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,240
OK.

334
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,270
I'll go back first.

335
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,200
Taste this shrimp, aunt.

336
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,590
OK.

337
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,200
Great. We're safe.

338
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,160
So I covered you

339
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,240
to let you go

340
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,590
to your company for playing games?

341
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,790
It's important to the fate

342
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,590
of three people and Flying Network.

343
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,640
Why are you staring at me?

344
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,590
Zhu Yun,

345
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,550
you've changed.

346
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,510
You aren't who you were abroad.

347
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,440
You just finished

348
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,680
your work mechanically abroad.

349
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,200
But now when you talk about your game,

350
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,680
you sound so proud

351
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,920
and your eyes are shining.

352
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,110
After all, this is the first work

353
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,030
I'll complete as an independent group leader.

354
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,200
OK. I'll walk you upstairs.

355
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,350
No need. I can go up by myself.

356
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,920
Well, let me have a look at

357
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,830
the birthplace of the rising stars

358
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,920
of Chinese game industry.

359
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,200
We're a small company.

360
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,830
This elevator is old.

361
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,790
Wait.

362
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,680
Sir, wait.

363
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,590
You looked familiar

364
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,510
when getting off the car downstairs.

365
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,270
It's you.

366
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,510
Your friend?

367
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,720
Yes.

368
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,750
You work with Zhu Yun?

369
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,640
Hello.

370
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,640
Tian Xiuzhu.

371
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,400
Nice to meet you.

372
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,550
Hello,

373
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,750
are you painter Tian Xiuzhu?

374
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,480
Yes.

375
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,270
You're my idol.

376
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,960
I have two idols in my life.

377
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,270
One is Xu Kaiyang,

378
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,240
my university senior.

379
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,030
The other is you.

380
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,510
I like you so much.

381
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,790
It's an honor to our company.

382
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,830
He is seeing his idol.

383
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,750
In addition to its appearance,

384
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,880
talents matter a lot

385
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,070
to the strength of a company.

386
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
Zhu Yun

387
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,750
and our company chose each other.

388
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,880
We're a powerful combination.

389
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,750
In recent years,

390
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,160
startups in China

391
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,830
start from scratch

392
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,640
and develop step by step.

393
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,680
Li Xun. Li Xun,

394
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,000
let me introduce.

395
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
This is Zhu's friend.

396
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,310
Tian Xiuzhu, well-known painter.

397
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,270
He is very famous.

398
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,750
I know him.

399
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,350
Mr. Tian,

400
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,000
that's what he is.

401
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,550
He is indifferent.

402
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,240
Never mind.

403
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,640
Taste this.

404
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,240
OK.

405
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,480
If you don't like it,

406
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,510
I'll add some milk for you.

407
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,550
Thanks. All stages are cleared.

408
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,750
No wonder

409
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,030
you have time to do other things.

410
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,880
Xiuzhu,

411
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,160
we're going to work.

412
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,680
Would you go back first?

413
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,000
OK.

414
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,920
When should I

415
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,350
come to pick you up?

416
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,110
No need.

417
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,070
You came out with me.

418
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,070
Your mom is waiting for us.

419
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,960
You're right.

420
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,110
Come at 5 o'clock.

421
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:51,920
OK.

422
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,960
See you.

423
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,480
See you.

424
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,070
I'm leaving.

425
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,830
See you, Mr. Tian.

426
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,070
Taste this, OK?

427
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,110
No,

428
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,200
thanks for the offer.

429
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,640
Thank you.

430
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,590
I'm leaving.

431
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,790
Are you leaving now?

432
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,350
Let, let me see you out.

433
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,640
Zhu Yun, see him out. Go.

434
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,000
Take care, Mr. Tian.

435
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,070
Come here when you have time.

436
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,200
Take care.

437
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,070
I'll go say hello to aunt.

438
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,830
No need.

439
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,480
Mom.

440
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,270
Aunt.

441
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,960
It's just time.

442
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,000
Go out with me.

443
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:52,920
Yun,

444
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,750
I rent a room for you.

445
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,110
Mom,

446
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,310
you should ask me

447
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,590
before renting it.

448
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,070
It would be too late.

449
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,550
So many people wanted to rent the room.

450
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,510
Luckily, I signed the contract

451
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,510
and paid this afternoon.

452
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,440
Otherwise,

453
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,160
we can't check it now.

454
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,030
Now I can't choose

455
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,830
where to live.

456
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,960
You can choose,

457
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,350
and aunt will decide.

458
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,480
Xiuzhu,

459
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,920
what do you think about this room?

460
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,790
Great. Very great, aunt.

461
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,720
The environment is beautiful here.

462
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,590
And

463
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,310
it's secure here.

464
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,310
I think the most important thing is that

465
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,030
coincidentally,

466
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,070
it's just

467
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,480
one kilometer away

468
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,550
from my studio.

469
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
We can walk here.

470
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,350
Really?

471
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,510
Coincidence?

472
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,240
Mom,

473
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,550
you planned this with Xiuzhu?

474
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,000
No. No. No.

475
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,310
It has nothing to do with him.

476
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,480
I rented this room

477
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,790
for you on my own.

478
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,880
How much is the monthly rent for this room?

479
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,240
Don't worry about it.

480
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,240
I paid for three months.

481
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,240
You can pay me back if you have money.

482
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,350
I have no money.

483
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Never mind.

484
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,480
Well,

485
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,720
I think I need two domestic workers,

486
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,640
one for cleaning

487
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,400
and the other for cooking.

488
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,110
I want them to do housekeeping.

489
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,310
You'll pay them.

490
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,200
Aunt,

491
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,750
How about this?

492
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,880
Zhu Yun led a frugal life abroad.

493
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,200
Now let's make her life easy.

494
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,270
Tomorrow

495
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,720
I'll find a domestic worker to do cleaning for her.

496
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,830
I'll pay.

497
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,110
If Zhu Yun wants to eat,

498
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,590
go to my studio.

499
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,790
I can cook for her anytime.

500
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,350
Great.

501
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,590
Xiuzhu,

502
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,110
please take care of her.

503
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,350
Aunt,

504
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,200
don't mention that.

505
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,270
Please, aunt.

506
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,480
Please take care of her.

507
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,680
I will.

508
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,750
See you.

509
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,640
See you.

510
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
You cooperated well with my mom.

511
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,260
[Dance Training Fu Yizhuo]

512
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,310
Come in.

513
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,350
Go ahead.

514
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,830
Because of your girl friend?

515
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,790
Her name is Zhu Yun.

516
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,720
Just as I thought.

517
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,310
I guessed it.

518
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,680
Well,

519
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,960
you met the painter.

520
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,550
Don't mention him.

521
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,920
OK. I won't.

522
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,350
You forget it

523
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,070
if I don't mention?

524
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,640
I'm warning you.

525
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,790
Don't give me a lecture.

526
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,880
You look affected.

527
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,240
You don't need my help

528
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,830
in terms of career.

529
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,030
As to relations,

530
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,030
to tell the truth,

531
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,920
you're too naive.

532
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
You drove her away

533
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,000
time and again.

534
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,550
You hurt her feelings severely.

535
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,720
How did you know

536
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,590
she wouldn't stay with you?

537
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,240
You drove her away at your own will.

538
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,400
Did you ask her what she thought?

539
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,000
You're sulking here alone.

540
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,400
Why don't you ask her

541
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,070
if she is dating the painter?

542
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,200
Ask her?

543
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,830
You want me to ask her these questions?

544
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,880
How?

545
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,000
You're too paranoid.

546
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,640
The only thing

547
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,640
I'll never learn from you

548
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,680
since we met is

549
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,720
how you treat girls.

550
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,350
They're

551
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,110
the most precious flowers in the world.

552
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,590
A sign of disturbance

553
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,880
will ruin their luster

554
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,200
and fragrance.

555
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,070
That's why they

556
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,310
turn old more easily than men.

557
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,750
You're disgusting.

558
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,110
Stop dancing.

559
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,750
You know what,

560
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,200
you didn't give others a chance back then.

561
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,070
You chose for yourself.

562
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,590
So you don't know

563
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,830
how they got through.

564
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,790
I don't know if she still loves you.

565
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,510
But what I know is that

566
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,000
if you want to achieve any goals now,

567
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,480
she will be the most able person

568
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,030
to help you at any cost in the world.

569
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,400
Don't treat feelings as a computer.

570
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,590
It isn't binary.

571
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,750
You should be mature.

572
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,920
Computers are binary.

573
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,830
It accepts only two types of inputs,

574
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,750
because digital circuits can only accept 0 and 1.

575
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,240
That's because

576
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,960
nonlinear electronic components

577
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,030
have only two nonlinear regions.

578
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,750
Stop.

579
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
I won't think about this again

580
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,200
until this matter is completely solved.

581
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,240
Won't she think about it?

582
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,640
She's different from you.

583
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,880
She's easy to get into dead ends,

584
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,240
especially about you two.

585
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,590
If it's impossible,

586
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,200
don't let her misunderstand.

587
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,070
Don't let her miss her own chance.

588
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,350
You know what,

589
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,960
your tenderness is a double-edged sword to her.

590
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,750
Once she feels that you can't move on,

591
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,750
she won't move on.

592
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,350
I can move on.

593
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,960
Then why bother coming here?

594
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,880
I think

595
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,750
you are jealous.

596
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:11,880
Get out.

597
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,750
You're obviously flirting

598
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,790
under the guise of work.

599
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,110
Group Leader Zhu and Li.

600
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,790
You exchange you title

601
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,070
at the base back then.

602
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,270
She is right.

603
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,110
A secrete office romance play.

604
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,310
The PUA battle between female boss and male subordinate.

605
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,720
What you said

606
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,750
sounds filthy.

607
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,480
Come on. We're obviously praising your innocence.

608
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,790
Yes.

609
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,920
He just fixed

610
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,440
the computer for you

611
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,830
and you just had midnight snacks

612
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,270
somewhere that you two had visited together.

613
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,160
Isn't this flirting?

614
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,510
We did these for work.

615
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,790
But listen,

616
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,720
we'll start making weapon effects next week.

617
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,310
And...

618
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,680
We're not curious about that.

619
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,550
You're annoying.

620
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,550
Anyway, I'm energetic

621
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,310
after drinking coffee.

622
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,400
If you say nothing interesting,

623
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,880
we won't let you go.

624
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,750
Tell us what you are thinking.

625
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,550
What do you mean?

626
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,480
We agreed that

627
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,200
we would be ordinary colleagues.

628
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,680
She is exposing herself when trying to hide.

629
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,350
Let me ask you.

630
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,720
Are you happy?

631
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,510
Yes.

632
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,240
I can do what I like

633
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,200
without feeling tired,

634
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,480
just as I did at the base.

635
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,750
Honestly, I've known you for so many years,

636
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,550
but only when staying with Li Xun,

637
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,790
you can be passionate,

638
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,200
impulsive and brave to go forward

639
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,160
as if nothing would frighten you.

640
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,790
He did change me.

641
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:47,920
If I hadn't joined

642
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,350
the base back then,

643
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,310
I wouldn't have found that I like programming.

644
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,240
But it's history.

645
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,030
It's all over.

646
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,110
Now I have to consider my tone

647
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,270
when I speak to him.

648
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,680
I hope that we can talk normally.

649
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,790
You're worried because you care him so much.

650
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,400
I'm worried about both of you.

651
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,240
It has been so many years.

652
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,310
Why can't you make up your mind?

653
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,510
Get together if you like each other

654
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,590
and get apart if not.

655
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,310
Is it difficult?

656
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,200
Why don't you just change?

657
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,440
Pick one of my boyfriends.

658
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,720
You can try to

659
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,880
get along with them,

660
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,640
OK?

661
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,880
Or pick one of my clients.

662
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,590
Get out.

663
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,920
Drink it.

664
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:39,100
[Invincible General]

665
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,880
The deadline

666
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,000
for uploading past.

667
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,480
Click it now.

668
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,200
I'll test it again.

669
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,200
Come on. It's time.

670
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,550
Do you want the client to scold you?

671
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,640
It'll be ready soon.

672
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,830
When?

673
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'll upload it soon.

Thank you.

685
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,150
Never mind.

686
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,960
It's just a close beta.

687
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,670
It can't be perfect.

688
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,280
I think there are enough contents.

689
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,670
We can add more gradually after it's launched.

690
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,000
Keep in mind that

691
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,320
this company hasn't launched any product.

692
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,400
Invincible General is our only bullet now.

693
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,710
If we screw things up,

694
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,840
we have to pay for it this year and next.

695
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,280
Am I too indecisive?

696

Group Leader Zhu,

697

Now you don't need

698
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,710
anyone's affirmation.

699
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,440
You should have confidence in yourself.

700
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,030

how should we trust others

and build a family?

706
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,480
Get out.

707
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,400
OK.

708
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,440
I tried to play

709
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,760

710

It's really interesting.

711
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,360
Playing the close beta,

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,150
Great.

714

But

715
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,920
with its downloads after the official launch,

716
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,110
we’ll know whether the game is great.

Without promotion,

743

I know we should do promotion,

750

but we have no money.

It's users' first impression.

773

he can't draw what you want.

00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,030
It's strange.

873
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,840
Now that you don't like her,

874
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,030
why do you care about her staying with the painter?

875
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,360
Is he Li Xun?

876
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:09,190
Yes.

877
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,230
Shall I call him in?

878
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,410
♫That breaks through the boundary♫

879
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,770
♫The first sight♫

880
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:29,370
♫Spreads and later it wins the world for me♫

881
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:35,290
♫The clock keeps ticking♫

882
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:39,970
♫I am leaning on your shoulder♫

883

♫We won't break up♫

884

♫Stay with me from the hustle and bustle♫

885
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:56,570
♫It's the fulcrum of your palm♫

886
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,610
♫That gives me the courage to move forward♫

887
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:06,570
♫Just like the flame in the night♫

♫The clock keeps ticking♫

901
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,570
♫I also want to stand by your side♫

902
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,890
♫As long as I am brave enough♫

903
