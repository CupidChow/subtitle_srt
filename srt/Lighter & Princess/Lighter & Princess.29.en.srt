00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,120
Your car has a mileage

170
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,200
of over 50,000 kilometers for more than half a year.

171
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,150
A bit more.

172
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,360
What are they doing?

173
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,030
He's checking the air streams of the car.

174
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,320
Does Mr. Dong want to sell his car?

176
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,480
And this one.

177
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,080
Maybe.

178
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,720
50,000 yuan lower than the price

179
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,750
we mentioned.

180
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,030
Well, you're such a profiteer.

181
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,270
The car cover cost me 48,000 yuan.

182
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,840
Why does he sell his car?

183
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,240
Why, indeed?

184
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,720
Our company has economic difficulties. He wants to support the company.

185
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,870
Has our company met such a serious crisis?

186
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,390
Sure.

187
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,790
Cherish your working days now.

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,240
I guess our company

189
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,790
may go bankrupt soon.

190
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,240
"Rivalry among Seven Powers".

191
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,150
L&P is

192
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,670
hyping it

193
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,480
regardless of cost.

194
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,270
Whenever I open a website,

195
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,840
I can see this Internet-famous face.

196
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,080
They really want to eliminate us.

197
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,870
I played it carefully.

198
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,080
Their game is of exactly the same contents as ours,

199
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,240
but their system

200
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,510
is not as ingenious as ours.

201
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,840
Yes.

202
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,320
But I don't think

203
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,240
L&P wants to make its game "Rivalry among Seven Powers" seize the market for long.

204
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,670
They just want to earn as much as they can

205
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,270
by launching a new game.

206
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,480
They often

207
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,200
did such mean things.

208
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,240
This is their old style.

209
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,840
And they can also eliminate us by this chance.

210
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,870
The key is that their games have strong linkage.

211
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,480
L&P is

212
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,910
one of the top Chinese game companies

213
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,320
in the number of players.

214
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,720
So they have universal coins.

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,270
Players can use their coins in other games

216
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,960
besides "Rivalry among Seven Powers".

217
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,790
We have no such advantage.

218
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,480
We can't compete with them in this point at all.

219
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,750
I don't think

220
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,670
our company can overcome this difficulty this time.

221
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,600
Look,

222
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,150
they three don't come to work.

223
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,840
Zhang Fang

224
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,440
really has something to drink.

225
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,360
There're two cans of beer.

226
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,390
Each of us can have one.

227
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,030
Here you are.

228
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,390
Zhao Teng,

229
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,390
the Dark Iron Divine Sword has low-quality patches

230
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,670
and codes.

231
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,870
You'd better improve them again.

232
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, group leader.

233
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,240
In fact, I've known you're not an ordinary girl

234
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,870
since the first day you came here.

235
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,120
So although I'm a few years older than you,

236
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,150
I always call you group leader.

237
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,120
It's because I admire you.

238
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,630
It can't be helped.

239
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,030
So it's unnecessary

240
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,080
to improve those patches

241
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,240
and solve those bugs.

242
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Well, girl,

243
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,910
let's face it.

244
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,720
Come on.

245
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,080
Cheers.

246
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,270
To ourselves.

247
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,360
"Invincible General" wasn't that popular.

248
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,870
You've created a miracle

249
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,240
by making it sort of popular among the players.

250
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,910
So I think

251
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,150
we've really done our best.

252
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,270
We have a clear conscience.

253
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,020
But anyway, we should

254
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,720
guarantee the update the day after tomorrow.

255
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm going to find Li Xun.

256
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,600
Do you usually play games?

257
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,870
Yes, I play games.

258
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,630
I seldom play games.

259
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,080
What games do you play?

260
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,510
You don't play games.

261
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,440
Yes. I seldom play them.

262
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,870
There has been a very popular game recently.

263
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,670
I didn't hear of it.

264
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,840
It's about animation.

265
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,910
Many game developers like watching animations.

266
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,390
But I think it's actually a fun game.

267
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,000
Is it?

268
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,440
Yes.

269
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,270
The design in the game

270
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,150
is full of animation color.

271
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,240
That's pretty good.

272
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,480
What's the game mainly about?

273
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,720
It's about

274
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,240
the adventures of an animated character and...

275
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,550
Really?

276
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,870
Your friend?

277
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,320
Okay, you may talk first.

278
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,240
-Let's talk next time. -See you next time.

279
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,870
Bye-bye.

280
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,440
Dong Siyang sold his car.

281
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,870
Our company will become bankrupt.

282
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,790
What are you doing here?

283
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,440
The websites are full of the publicity ads of "Rivalry among Seven Powers".

284
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,390
What can I do?

285
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,440
What should we do now?

286
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,720
We can't change the direction

287
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,440
of a flying bullet.

288
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Just let it be.

289
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,030
What do you mean by it?

290
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,200
We have no money to invest in ads.

291
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,440
Anyhow,

292
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,600
we can't resist the Internet ghostwriters L&P hired.

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,870
We'd better stop our losses in time.

294
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,550
Can we just sit watching?

295
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,080
Of course not.

296
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,870
You and Zhao Teng continue to improve the game

297
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,270
to ensure the normal update the day after tomorrow.

298
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,150
And what about you?

299
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,790
Keep drinking coffee here?

300
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,120
This is my personal privacy,

301
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,200
Group Leader Zhu.

302
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,200
Anything else?

303
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,960
Don't you wash it for me?

304
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,270
Since you're so free, wash it yourself.

305
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,000
What are you doing?

306
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,320
Our company hasn't closed down. What are you doing?

307
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,840
What are you doing?

308
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,840
Don't move the company items.

309
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,200
No, Mr. Dong.

310
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,360
You know us well.

311
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,670
We aren't money lovers.

312
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,240
Our company is going to close.

313
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,240
So we want to realize something

314
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,790
as our dismissal wage.

315
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,830
It's fate that brings us together.

316
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,830
We have to end up finishing our service in this way.

317
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,920
What dismissal wage?

318
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,920
End up finishing your service?

319
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,960
What are you talking about?

320
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,720
Our company won't close.

321
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,920
And we'll begin to do something bigger.

322
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,000
Open it.

323
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,720
Where did you get so much money?

324
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,310
Where's Li Xun?

325
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,510
Get him back.

326
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,640
I see, Mr. Dong.

327
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,200
You'll receive a bigger project.

328
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,030
Tell us

329
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,200
what we should first do.

330
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,920
Go for team building.

331
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,400
Let's ignore the orders

332
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,920
and go for team building today.

333
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,510
It's in the suburbs.

334
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,400
Will Mr. Dong take us to go camping?

335
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,750
If we go camping in such weather, we will suffer.

336
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,070
This is our first team building activity.

337
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,790
What a rare chance. Don't be so picky.

338
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,720
It's strange to hold a team building activity now.

339
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,920
You know what,

340
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,440
we should rally our morale

341
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,200
at this critical moment.

342
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,680
Yes.

343
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,030
Zhang Fang should be criticized.

344
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,920
As the HR Director,

345
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,550
he first said we would be dismissed,

346
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,920
and shook our morale.

347
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,440
It's, it's my management strategy. Do you know?

348
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,750
By this way, I can find out

349
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,310
who will leave first.

350
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,110
Well,

351
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,680
it's simply entrapment.

352
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,920
Anyway, I'll live and die together with our company.

353
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,590
Right, Mr. Dong?

354
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,550
Li, Li Xun

355
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,270
didn't sleep last night.

356
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,750
He didn't sleep in the coffee shop the whole night.

357
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,030
No, he worked overtime in the company.

358
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,400
How long will it take to arrive at the destination?

359
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,750
Soon.

360
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,680
Where are we going?

361
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,270
You'll know when we get there.

362
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,480
Hello, Mr. Dong.

363
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,750
Welcome.

364
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,720
Mr. Dong,

365
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,590
the rooms you booked are ready.

366
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,640
Please tell me if you have any need.

367
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,350
I'll go to work first.

368
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,110
Okay, go ahead.

369
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,510
Okay.

370
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,590
Well, let's stay here tonight.

371
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,350
Don't think to work today.

372
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,680
Just enjoy your hot baths.

373
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,960
Don't waste my money.

374
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,160
It's expensive.

375
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,310
Each of you has a room.

376
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,110
You should have told us we would stay here tonight.

377
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,070
I didn't bring anything.

378
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,720
What do you want to bring?

379
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,680
There're wash supplies in the hotel.

380
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,640
Haven't you stayed in any hotels?

381
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,830
She's a girl.

382
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,750
Do you mean cosmetics?

383
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,270
You're such a pretty girl,

384
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,510
so you don't need any cosmetics.

385
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,480
Yes.

386
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,720
Well, let's not go back to our rooms now.

387
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Let's go for a meal first.

388
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,160
Let's go for a meal.

389
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,720
We're here

390
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,160
for team building today.

391
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,720
Let me say something.

392
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,200
Our company will win for sure. Cheers.

393
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,000
Good.

394
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,480
Well, don't forget me.

395
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,200
Just have one drink.

396
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,160
Can you drink?

397
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,200
She can't drink.

398
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,720
If so, don't try to drink with us.

399
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,400
Have some soft drink.

400
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,160
Come on.

401
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,350
She has another drink.

402
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,920
A woman hero.

403
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,200
Awesome, awesome.

404
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,680
I see.

405
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,070
She's waiting for Li Xun to save her.

406
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,830
Yes.

407
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,590
Come on.

408
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,480
Pour wine for me. Pour wine for me.

409
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,480
Well, let's have another drink.

410
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,200
No, I can't drink anymore.

411
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,960
He can't drink. I'll drink with you, Mr. Dong.

412
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,270
Um...

413
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,590
Good, good, good.

414
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,270
Come on.

415
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,110
Come on. Drink.

416
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,790
Let me tell you.

417
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,550
Some girls

418
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,480
can drink a lot.

419
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,160
Well.

420
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,680
Awesome.

421
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,270
Some girls

422
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,550
can drink more than us.

423
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,200
They can drink a lot.

424
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,000
Whoever faces the fish head must drink three cups.

425
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,510
Come on, pour it for me.

426
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,240
Er...

427
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,200
Mr. Dong, let me propose a toast...

428
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,680
Won't, won't you bottom it up?

429
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,680
Mr. Dong,

430
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,310
is this the first company you've established?

431
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,240
My third uncle

432
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,510
brought me up.

433
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,920
He was a worker in a machinery factory.

434
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,590
They made the first wheeled tractor

435
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,640
in China.

436
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,110
They were indeed admired by people back then.

437
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,200
My third uncle said he could

438
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,400
recommend me to enter the factory

439
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,720
after I retired from the wrestling team.

440
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,310
That was the plan.

441
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,920
Changes always went beyond plans.

442
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,550
The machinery factory was bankrupt and closed

443
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,440
before I retired.

444
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,590
Then I became a taxi driver.

445
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,160
Later, I was put into prison

446
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,400
for some years

447
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,640
as I helped my friend fight.

448
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,720
After I was released,

449
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,240
I didn't want to drive the taxi again.

450
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,200
I thought what I could do.

451
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,750
I walked on the street one day.

452
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,240
I remember it was in summer.

453
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,000
The land was roasting under the sun.

454
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,350
I felt so hot.

455
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,400
When passing by the gate

456
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,030
of an IT company

457
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,070
I, 10 meters away, was greeted with a gust of cool air

458
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
coming out of the opened electric glass door.

459
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,880
It cooled me off

460
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,830
suddenly.

461
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,590
So I began to rest at the door.

462
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,400
Guess what happened then.

463
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,270
A security guard came and drove me away.

464
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,920
It was in that moment that

465
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,070
I knew what I should do.

466
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,510
I wanted to open an IT company,

467
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,350
so no one could drive me away when I stayed in the air-conditioned room.

468
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,400
Come on.

469
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,200
To what you said.

470
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,680
Come on.

471
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,590
Come on. Cheers.

472
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,200
Cheers. Cheers.

473
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,680
To tell you the truth,

474
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,160
I've,

475
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,960
I've been

476
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,920
in this line

477
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,720
for less than 10 years.

478
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,440
I actually want to develop some good games.

479
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,070
Well, I've served in four or five companies.

480
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,300
I'm eager to develop good games.

481
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,590
I thought "Invincible General" could...

482
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,440
"Invincible General".

483
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,590
Yes, yes.

484
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,680
"Invincible General".

485
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,200
I thought it could

486
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,830
make a hit.

487
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,240
It's a pity...

488
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,960
I feel

489
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,350
so depressed.

490
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,270
We could earn some money

491
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,920
by the small game "Invincible General".

492
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,750
But L&P actually launched the same type of game.

493
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,070
Why have they always

494
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,160
gone against us?

495
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,070
Enjoy yourselves.

496
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,070
I'll go back first.

497
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,590
Mr. Dong is still here.

498
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,920
Stay a bit longer.

499
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,440
He's afraid.

500
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,750
He can't drink anymore.

501
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,400
He can't drink much.

502
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,510
Still a green hand.

503
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,550
He's a nice guy.

504
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,000
Let us drink.

505
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,960
It's because of us.

506
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,070
Because Li Xun and I have personal hatred with that company.

507
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,830
Which company?

508
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,640
L&P Company.

509
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,480
One of the bosses of L&P Company

510
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,640
is our university classmate.

511
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,480
We started L&P Company together

512
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,480
back then.

513
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,640
Li Xun was the leader at that time.

514
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,830
But something happened to him

515
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,480
when the company was just established.

516
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,720
You all know he was once put into prison.

517
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,680
He was put into prison

518
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,590
because he hit and blinded the other boss.

519
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,920
You all wonder

520
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,030
why I came here.

521
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,720
After Li Xun was released,

522
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,830
he chose to work here for some reason.

523
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,200
I've always supported his decision.

524
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,000
That's all.

525
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,160
Wait. Wait a moment. Wait a moment.

526
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,550
It, it confuses me.

527
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,550
Li Xun

528
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,350
hit and blinded the other boss.

529
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,790
Why, why did he hit him?

530
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,830
It involves his privacy, so I can't tell you about it.

531
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,590
You can think it's because of hatred.

532
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,720
Do you mean Li Xun took the lead

533
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,070
in the establishment of L&P?

534
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,720
Yes.

535
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,750
I've sensed that for a long time.

536
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,960
I've long thought there must be something wrong.

537
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,030
I think

538
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,200
he must have something

539
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,640
hidden.

540
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,640
I told you this to rebuild your courage.

541
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,000
L&P Company may discredit

542
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,920
or suppress us,

543
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,720
causing us to lose a project.

544
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,920
We can find another project.

545
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,310
We won't give up until we succeed.

546
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,350
So we've kept

547
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,790
fighting against the strong L&P Company.

548
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,270
Just fight against them.

549
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,510
This is our only way out.

550
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,920
We are a team now,

551
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,440
so we should live or die together.

552
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,590
Yes.

553
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,750
If they weren't

554
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,400
in our company...

555
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,200
Mr. Dong, please pardon my saying so.

556
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,000
...we can survive for another year or two at most, right?

557
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,830
We know it well.

558
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,480
There's no other good choice for us,

559
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,550
right?

560
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,400
Yes.

561
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,310
We don't blame you.

562
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,200
It sounds pleasant.

563
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,200
Yes.

564
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,110
Just fight against them.

565
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,160
Don't be afraid of them.

566
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:45,920
Right?

567
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,110
We should unite

568
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,750
to fight against the rubbish L&P.

569
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,270
Fight against them

570
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,400
Beat them.

571
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,200
Yes. Beat them.

572
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,350
Mr. Dong,

573
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,110
I'm sorry

574
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,310
for hiding you all this.

575
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,110
We thought they wouldn't

576
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,060
target at us within at least one year.

577
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,000
Unexpectedly, they acted so fast.

578
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,510
Do you think

579
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,240
I can't find out

580
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,640
your stories?

581
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,200
When did you know them?

582
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,200
Since Li Xun entered my company.

583
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,550
Did he talk with you?

584
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,510
It's obvious.

585
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,720
Originally, I didn't

586
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,000
allow a person who was put into prison for some years

587
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,550
and even couldn't present a resume

588
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,400
to enter my company.

589
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,550
What did he tell you?

590
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,160
Do you want to know

591
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,750
his description of you

592
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,070
or himself?

593
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Uh? Dong Siyang gave me this room card.

594
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,830
I didn't go wrong.

595
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,830
Yes.

596
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
There are two rooms.

597
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,440
There is another room inside.

598
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,550
You can choose which one you want to stay in.

599
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,000
Where are you going?

600
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,590
Or I'll book another room.

601
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,480
Suit yourself.

602
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,240
Did you tell our past

603
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,510
to Dong Siyang?

604
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,830
He's such a sensible person

605
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,310
that he could guess it.

606
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,400
I didn't need to tell him.

607
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,200
He has kept this photo.

608
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,400
He told me

609
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,480
you're thoughtful

610
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,030
but sometimes naive and silly.

611
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,350
And you're

612
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,270
absolutely capable,

613
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,200
loyal and persistent.

614
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,830
We've found out

615
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,510
your relationship.

616
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,240
You're still pretending not to care about each other.

617
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,720
Yes.

618
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,590
Life

619
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,160
and love

620
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,440
are like games.

621
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,110
Both of them are intertwined with various dangers

622
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,720
and intimacy and hatred.

623
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,480
That's why all of us are addicted to them.

624
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,680
Right?

625
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,710
Why don't you just express your love to each other?

626
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,110
Don't stare at me.

627
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,360
Aren't you cold?

628
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,000
Yes, I'm.

629
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,960
Come down.

630
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,320
Why did you drink for me?

631
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,670
Don't be self-sentimental.

632
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,480
But when Dong Siyang asked you to drink, you refused.

633
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,030
If I got drunk,

634
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,960
you wouldn't leave.

635
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,400
Then I would get drunk with you.

636
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,710
Why do you keep my photo?

637
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,150
You still put every piece together.

638
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,230
I could handle my own belonging.

639
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,710
Why is it yours?

640
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,440
Or is it yours?

641
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,320
Of course.

642
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,190
Okay.

643
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,840
Take it away after going back.

644
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,510
Silly girl.

645
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,320
Your look recalls me of something.

646
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,150
I went to look for my homework from you

647
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,670
in the university.

648
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,510
You were lying on the old deck chair on the terrace that day.

649
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,800
When you looked up at me,

650
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,190
you also wore such a look.

651
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,230
Li Xun,

652
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,360
did you once miss me?

653
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
What if I say no?

654
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,630
I don't believe.

655
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,030
I don't believe it.

656
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,920
Can we be together?

657
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,510
You've devoted yourself to the development of the company.

658
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,630
Both of us don't mention our relationship.

659
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,920
Does it mean

660
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,590
we forgot our past?

661
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,400
I told you before.

662
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,280
We, we

663
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,630
can't act so honestly,

664
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,000
or we may suffer.

665
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,550
I've forgotten

666
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,670
all the past.

667
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,030
Don't spend much time in taking a hot bath after drinking.

668
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,590
If you're drowned, no one can save you.

669
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,480
All is nonsense.

670
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,070
Why don't you speak what you think in your mind?

671
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,670
Bread with sausage or jam?

672
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,030
Do you have any bread with pickles?

673
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,190
Butter bread is also okay.

674
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,840
I find you and Dong Siyang

675
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,480
have something in common.

676
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,320
Both of you don't act according to common sense.

677
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,000
Our company is badly in need of money,

678
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,320
but he takes us to have fun here.

679
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,230
We go off the beaten track.

680
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,400
Li Xun,

681
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,550
do you still have other ways

682
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,440
to deal with L&P Company?

683
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,000
I met Fang Zhijing that day.

684
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,400
He said he just launched "Rivalry among Seven Powers" to ruin us.

685
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,920
He said our game

686
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,960
is sort of popular but profitless.

687
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,840
He could defeat us

688
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,070
as long as he sought some means.

689
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,800
I really hate him,

690
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,030
but I left without scolding him.

691
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,280
You're afraid of him?

692
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,920
Yes.

693
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,320
I'm afraid of him,

694
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,800
and I also hate him.

695
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,670
I've hated him for so many years,

696
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,960
but I've done nothing to strike back him.

697
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,630
I can do nothing but hide my anger.

698
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,070
I could just watch

699
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,230
he hurt Xiaoyan.

700
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,360
Later, when he hurt you,

701
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,320
I could also just sit watching.

702
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,800
You're not afraid of Fang Zhijing.

703
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,590
You're just afraid that we can't defeat them this time.

704
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,190
If it weren't for me,

705
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,190
you wouldn't have had hatred of him.

706
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,150
If I hadn't asked you to join in the competition with me,

707
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
your sister Li Lan would not have had an accident.

708
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,800
Zhu Yun,

709
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,920
you've thought so much.

710
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,230
If you're overcautious and indecisive,

711
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,550
finally you'll be baffled in everything.

712
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,360
Take it easy.

713
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,920
Their fear of us

714
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,150
is much more than your fear of him.

715
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,670
You're afraid of him,

716
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,190
so you've been watching him these years.

717
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,280
They're afraid of us,

718
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,590
so they think to deal with me as soon as I was released.

719
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Don't worry about them copying our ideas.

720
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,880
If they really develop

721
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
their own games carefully,

722
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,440
maybe I can't strike back them in the short term.

723
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,320
However, they target at me deliberately

724
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
and want to eliminate me,

725
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,480
so I have the chance to strike back them.

726
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,150
And it's fair.

727
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,840
You're afraid of him.

728
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,440
They're afraid of me.

729
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,440
Who are you afraid of?

730
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,320
I'm not afraid of anyone.

731
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,630
Silly girl.

732
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,460
♫If love has some temperature left♫
You haven't changed.

733
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,420
♫This dream will automatically exit♫

734
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,820

738

I believe whatever you said.

♫I was right at the crossroad♫

745
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,030
Gao Jianhong and Fang Zhijing are planning backdoor listing.

746
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,710
Make clear his purpose

747
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,550
to avoid his trap.

748
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,030
He knows Li Xun best.

749
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,710
Listen carefully.

750
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,070
If I can't prevent his company from being listed,

751
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,670
I'll change my surname

752
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,100
and admit my defeat before him.

753
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,000
Do you have a plan?

754
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,020
♫Fall in love with you♫
