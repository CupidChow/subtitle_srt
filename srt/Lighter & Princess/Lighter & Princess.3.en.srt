♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,550
I'll have a cup of Americano.

22
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,800
OK. Just a moment.

23
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,550
Thank you.

24
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,560
Please visit us again.

25
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,120
He's quite handsome.

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,720
But I wonder if you can handle him.

27
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,190
Coming. Coming.

28
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,400
Li Xun.

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,070
I'm Chen Minmin from School of Foreign Languages.

30
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,280
Would you like to dine with me later?

31
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,880
No.

32
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,320
Are you going back to your dorm later?

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,190
No.

34
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,510
If you need anything,

35
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,040
just let me know.

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,190
No need.

37
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,600
What a poser!

38
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,840
Is it fun?

39
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,520
I'm not stalking you.

40
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,640
I'm here on a mission.

41
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,470
Really?

42
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,790
Here's the thing.

43
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,310
The department has recently checked the attendance of morning self-study.

44
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,470
Well, we're freshmen and we just started school,

45
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,520
so the department keeps a close eye on us.

46
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,110
Are you in primary school or kindergarten?

47
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,990
Do you think it's useful to study in the morning?

48
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,470
No matter whether it's useful or not,

49
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,640
that's the rule of the school.

50
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,200
We should observe...

51
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,720
Here.

52
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,720
Press the space button.

53
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,740
[START]

54
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
A game?

55
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,960
Move the character around

56
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,760
to avoid the ball coming down from above,

57
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,520
and across the river.

58
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,870
Three chances.

59
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,600
If you make it, I'll attend the morning self-study.

60
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,470
Keep your word.

61
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,400
You called that a ball coming down from above?

62
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,790
It clearly smashes down.

63
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,670
How many balls are there?

64
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,230
Two balls for three chances.

65
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,160
I already know where the first one is going to land.

66
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm going to find out where the next one will fall next,

67
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,910
and pass it at the third chance.

68
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,840
That's simple.

69
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,310
This ball is going way too fast.

70
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,760
I've pressed the keyboard

71
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
as fast as I can.

72
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,470
Are you throwing in the towel?

73
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,200
Isn't there another chance?

74
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,960
Game over.

75
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,720
What's going on?

76
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,870
Editor.

77
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,720
This if statement means…

78
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,600
The player is dead when crossing the river.

79
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,040
If the player gets hit by a ball, he dies.

80
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,200
If he crosses the river, he dies too.

81
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,960
You must have got it wrong.

82
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,600
No.

83
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,200
I'll die anyway.

84
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,760
Yeah.

85
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,160
So this is a game to lose.

86
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,640
Yeah.

87
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,670
Why did you want me to play it?

88
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,840
I don't like you.

89
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,640
What?

90
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,200
Because I don't like you.

91
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,230
Why?

92
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,280
You are so fake.

93
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,520
You lose.

94
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,230
Don't come to me for morning self-study again.

95
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,110
And

96
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,990
this is my place.

97
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,600
You are not allowed to come up

98
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,040
without my permission.

99
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,160
Why couldn't you just cross the river?

100
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,200
I did.

101
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,640
So what?

102
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,990
He designed that program.

103
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,470
I died anyway.

104
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,840
Didn't he just make fun of you?

105
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
In fact,

106
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,280
his little game is quite simple.

107
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,840
Although I still don't understand

108
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,080
the meaning of that function,

109
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,520
the logic of the code is very simple.

110
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,870
Although I don't know

111
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,870
how the rich become rich,

112
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,670
I think the logic is very simple.

113
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,990
Fang Shumiao,

114
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,470
for whom did I suffer such humiliation?

115
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,840
Another four points will be deducted tomorrow.

116
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,670
Four points after four points.

117
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,520
How many four points are left?

118
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,840
What's the point of reading now?

119
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,190
You lost.

120
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,400
He said I was so fake.

121
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,070
I think he just has a problem with me.

122
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,400
Is it great to know how to program?

123
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,070
What's wrong?

124
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,120
Look at this.

125
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,190
Isn't it the same game?

126
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,520
It's said that he was the top scorer.

127
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,590
But he just used an example from the textbook.

128
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,640
Are you still reading?

129
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,070
Stop staying up and go to bed.

130
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,910
Did Li Xun irritate you so much?

131
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,120
Yes, he really did.

132
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,000
You!

133
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,360
Zhu Yun.

134
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,280
Morning.

135
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,520
You must be possessed.

136
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:35,760
No.

137
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,950
It's lights-out time. Where do you get the electricity?

138
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,950
Beware of electric shock.

139
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,000
I managed to get it from the water room.

140
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,430
Are you waiting for me?

141
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,120
Shall we play a ball game in the afternoon?

142
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,160
How about yesterday?

143
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,120
Sure.

144
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,640
Why are we sitting this far in the front?

145
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,830
People tend to be sleepy when the computer is hot.

146
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,710
I won't doze off in the front.

147
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,910
Looks like you're really in a fight with Li Xun.

148
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,880
It's not a big deal.

149
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,160
We lost another four points this morning.

150
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,280
It is

151
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,710
a big deal.

152
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,280
The professor is surnamed Lin.

153
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,670
The seniors said

154
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,590
they all called him Old Lin privately,

155
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
and he is a big shot

156
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,360
in the circle.

157
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,670
Nine out of ten coders are bald

158
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,950
and one is with sparse hair.

159
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,190
It's no exaggeration at all.

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,160
He hasn't come yet.

161
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,430
He doesn't even show up for the first class.

162
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,240
How can he be that arrogant?

163
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,040
Well,

164
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,760
this computer is broken and can't be started.

165
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,240
Broken?

166
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,880
Yes.

167
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,640
You can change a position.

168
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,160
Here.

169
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
So warm-hearted.

170
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,000
No, no, no.

171
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,710
What a fatal attraction!

172
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,160
Boys and girls,

173
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,040
have any of you

174
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,760
known about C language

175
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,880
or tried to write some small programs

176
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,280
in C language before?

177
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,640
We all know that

178
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,710
it's information society now.

179
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,040
The computer develops very fast,

180
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,710
and so does programming language.

181
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,000
Compared with the emerging programming languages,

182
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,160
C language is like me standing in front of you.

183
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,880
What's meaning?

184
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,760
It's getting old.

185
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
As the old saying goes,

186
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,360
older and wiser.

187
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,280
Age has many advantages.

188
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,640
The older it gets,

189
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,430
the richer and more rigorous it is.

190
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,710
No matter whether

191
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,880
you go on studying  algorithms,

192
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,790
compilation, database,

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,520
or operating systems,

194
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,000
the C language skills you're going to learn

195
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,190
will be the foundation

196
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,430
for all of your future programming.

197
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,790
The skills matter.

198
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,710
Don't repeat the common mistake

199
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,430
good students make,

200
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,070
that is, to be a bookworm.

201
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,710
At the mention of C language,

202
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,240
the first thing we need to know is what C language is.

203
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,550
So who can tell me

204
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,240
what C language is?

205
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,480
Raise your hand!

206
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,240
You studied so long last night.

207
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,520
The nail that sticks up will be hammered down.

208
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,480
Lend it to me.

209
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,000
Lend it to me.

210
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,520
Lend it to me.

211
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,670
What are you two talking about?

212
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,710
Are you reading other book?

213
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,550
Notes.

214
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,880
How detailed these notes are.

215
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,190
Could you

216
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,280
answer my question?

217
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,480
C language is

218
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,710
a process-oriented abstract programming language,

219
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,830
which is widely used in low-level development.

220
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,830
C language can be compiled in a simple way

221
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,760
to deal with low-level memory.

222
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,710
It's a high-level programming language

223
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,590
that produces only a small amount of machine language

224
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,670
and does not require any runtime support to run.

225
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,160
Despite its many low-level features,

226
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,670
it remains cross-platform

227
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,880
and can be compiled

228
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,520
on many computer platforms,

229
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,120
including embedded processors

230
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,550
and supercomputers.

231
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,070
Good job.

232
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,670
Let's give her a big hand.

233
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,520
Take your seat.

234
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,710
Your game is no big dead.

235
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,710
What a bookworm.

236
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,880
What's your name, girl?

237
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,640
I'm Zhu Yun.

238
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:57,790
Zhu Yun.

239
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,760
It's easy to remember and it sounds good.

240
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,950
You'll be my class rep.

241
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,430
I can't, sir.

242
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,550
You can.

243
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,670
Why can't you?

244
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,120
It seems you are not only shy but also modest.

245
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,670
It's a done deal.

246
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,910
You've got to stop being modest.

247
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,000
Let's move on.

248
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,830
Game over.

249
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,360
Mr. Lin,

250
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,070
as for the class rep,

251
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,520
you'd better find someone else.

252
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,760
Why?

253
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,830
Are you afraid it takes you much time?

254
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,830
Not really.

255
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,000
It's just a bit of a hassle.

256
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,190
What's

257
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,310
the difference?

258
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,160
Don't make a decision.

259
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,430
Go back and think about it.

260
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,520
We have a class tomorrow.

261
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,760
Could you answer me then?

262
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,950
I have to go to the canteen.

263
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,240
My wife will be mad at me

264
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,880
if I fail to buy red-cooked pork.

265
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,760
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

266
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,950
It's good to be an class rep.

267
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,400
You’re so lucky.

268
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,670
He is a big shot in the circle

269
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,190
and going to give us several specialized courses.

270
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,550
You can't do any harm

271
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,590
by cottoning up to him.

272
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,040
Come on, I'll wait for you.

273
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,710
From primary school to junior high school,

274
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,240
I have been the class rep

275
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,520
of Chinese, math, English,

276
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,880
biology, chemistry,

277
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,000
and geography.

278
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,670
If I was serious, my classmates were annoyed at me.

279
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,640
If I didn't take it seriously,

280
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,950
the teacher scolded me.

281
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,400
I was dog-tired every day, but couldn't please either side.

282
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,190
I'm not going to be an class rep again

283
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,880
after I made it to college.

284
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,670
Are you afraid he'll get you in trouble

285
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,120
if you're the class rep?

286
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,430
He's part of the reason.

287
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,120
Aren't you the perfect example?

288
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,760
Some people think the college entrance examination is the end.

289
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,910
This is absolutely wrong.

290
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,360
College is where

291
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,910
you're really taught how to live.

292
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,480
So the college entrance examination isn't the destination

293
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,430
or even the intermediate station.

294
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,630
You can't take it easy in college.

295
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,240
Is it time to choose class leaders?

296
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,390
Were you in?

297
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,480
No.

298
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:15,960
What about the class rep?

299
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,110
Class reps have the most contact with teachers

300
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,000
and are very important.

301
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,680
There is one.

302
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,350
Which class?

303
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,390
C language. It was settled today.

304
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,870
That's great.

305
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,550
Then do your best

306
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,110
and show your teacher what you can do.

307
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,040
I didn't say yes.

308
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,040
Why?

309
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,760
Do you dislike the class

310
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,870
or the teacher?

311
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,390
You can't always be so headstrong.

312
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,310
It's supposed to be

313
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,550
tough and tiring

314
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,000
to study or work.

315
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,590
Mom,

316
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,630
I really don't want to be a class rep anymore.

317
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,630
No way.

318
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,280
You have to listen to me.

319
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,760
I've worked on the education all my life.

320
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,150
I can tell you responsibly that

321
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,550
being a class rep will only do you good

322
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,310
and no harm.

323
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,760
But…

324
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,790
Enough.

325
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,070
When is the next C language class?

326
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,150
Tomorrow.

327
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,150
OK.

328
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,960
Then tell the teacher in class tomorrow that

329
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,760
you want to be the class rep.

330
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,870
You hear me?

331
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,590
Mom!

332
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,680
Just do as I say.

333
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,350
I have a meeting soon.

334
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,520
I have to go.

335
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,310
Do as you're told.

336
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,350
Are you going to do the laundry?

337
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,070
Yes.

338
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,520
That's a very good idea.

339
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,310
You can't be a good programmer

340
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,000
without breaking a few keyboards.

341
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,440
Class rep,

342
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,550
come here.

343
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,680
Distribute these copies to everyone.

344
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
Sir, I haven't decided yet.

345
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,040
Come here.

346
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,630
Is Director Liu your mom?

347
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,200
Yes.

348
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,310
Your mom spoke to me through one of the school leaders

349
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,310
about your concerns.

350
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,040
You don't have anything to worry about, do you?

351
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,550
The fact that I asked you to be the class rep means

352
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,520
I have every confidence in your ability,

353
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,150
doesn't it?

354
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,920
My mom said I agreed, right?

355
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,830
Yes.

356
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,920
Why? Is there a problem?

357
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,280
No.

358
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,240
Jianhong is organizing a programming interest group.

359
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,440
You should join it too!

360
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,350
Me?

361
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,150
Sure.

362
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,070
I join it.

363
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,110
How can you, the class rep, not join it?

364
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,870
Mr. Lin has agreed

365
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,760
to be the instructor of the interest group,

366
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,590
and even said that he would apply for a place

367
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,760
for us to do activities.

368
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,520
Join it.

369
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,680
So not only do you have to join it

370
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,520
but you also have to be in charge together with Jianhong.

371
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,630
Well, I finally got you back.

372
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,110
I tried to make a small program in C language,

373
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,630
but it never executes correctly.

374
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,480
Can you help me out?

375
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,630
I've been working on it all day.

376
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,240
I declare the pointer first.

377
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,000
Next all I have to do is

378
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,480
allocate space to the graph

379
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,630
and then I can manipulate the nodes directly.

380
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,350
Why?

381
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,870
Because there are nodes in the space of the graph.

382
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,760
I have to allocate memory space to the nodes

383
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,790
when I apply for a graph.

384
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,350
Why can't it be executed correctly?

385
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,760
Because I didn't give a graph memory address

386
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,720
to the pointer.

387
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,630
Why are you asking me when you know the answer?

388
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,350
Li Xun,

389
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,280
Old Lin has agreed to

390
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,240
tutor our interest group

391
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,550
and apply for a space

392
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,240
for our activities.

393
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,040
I'm not in.

394
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,200
I'm in.

395
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,040
So?

396
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,110
So?

397
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,040
I wanted to try out

398
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,070
Li Xun's C language level,

399
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,480
but he set me up

400
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,830
and I solved the problem by myself.

401
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,280
I think Li Xun is a master.

402
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,790
He deliberately led you into the answer.

403
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,110
It means he knew the answer.

404
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,590
I also feel that.

405
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,790
Li Xun is writing code in the dorm every day.

406
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,830
I can't read what he wrote anyway.

407
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,070
I don't think so.

408
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,240
Someone just bluffs.

409
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,280
He doesn't know anything about it.

410
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,960
How could he be a top scorer?

411
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,870
Someone is blinded by hate.

412
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,440
Someone helps others

413
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
and can't tell the good from the bad.

414
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,350
Zhu Yun has a point.

415
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,110
Actions speak louder than words.

416
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,550
If we want to know his level,

417
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,200
we need to see his jobs.

418
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,870
Anyway we can make the game he did last time

419
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,350
after a few classes.

420
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,870
That's the basic function.

421
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,870
It doesn't look good to me.

422
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,630
Indeed.

423
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
This is a place

424
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,440
Old Lin applied for us.

425
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:11,870
This is going to be the home

426
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,110
of our programming interest group.

427
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,110
This is the place where we can do our activities.

428
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,480
What do you think?

429
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,000
Pretty big.

430
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,040
It's so spacious.

431
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,240
It's a little dirty.

432
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,960
It'll be nice and tidy if we clean it up.

433
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,040
It's time to do some cleaning.

434
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,000
OK.

435
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,310
Gao,

436
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,590
why are you so interested in

437
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,830
Li Xun's programming skills?

438
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,240
I just want to know how big the gap

439
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,520
between us and the top scorer is.

440
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,480
You're not convinced, huh?

441
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,960
Everyone wants to be the top scorer, right?

442
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,240
Zhu Yun,

443
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,000
are you convinced?

444
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,480
I may be convinced by other top scorers,

445
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,110
but him…

446
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,790
See?

447
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,070
I think I'm just fine being normal.

448
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,070
It is extraordinary that

449
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,000
you can be admitted to Nanhu University.

450
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,830
Has Li Xun handed in the homework

451
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
assigned by Old Lin last class?

452
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,720
Everyone in the class turned it in except him.

453
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,070
I'm worrying about how to explain with Old Lin.

454
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,440
Well, hurry him up then.

455
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,440
Hurry him up.

456
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,830
I can't even avoid him.

457
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,920
Aren't you afraid Old Lin will yell at you?

458
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,390
Whatever.

459
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,150
I'll put up with it.

460
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,280
Li Xun is always so arrogant

461
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,000
and looks down upon others.

462
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,760
Don't you guys wonder

463
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,240
what his level really is?

464
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,390
It's so windy here that you can catch cold.

465
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,520
Didn't I tell you

466
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,760
not to come up without my permission?

467
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,480
Everyone in the class turned in the homework of C language except you.

468
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,040
I won't. I didn't do it.

469
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,350
If you don't turn it in, your usual grade will be deducted.

470
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't care.

471
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,310
Are you afraid to hand it in?

472
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,960
Afraid?

473
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,310
Yeah.

474
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,480
You appear to be a programming expert

475
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,110
who types codes on your computer every day.

476
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,960
What if you hand in your homework

477
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,240
with the codes full of mistakes?

478
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,350
Wouldn't that be a shame?

479
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,280
So the best thing to do is not to hand it in,

480
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,830
right?

481
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,520
Yeah.

482
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,760
Are you so interested in my programming skills?

483
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,590
What if you’re just a pretty face?

484
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,000
What's homework?

485
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,790
Find the maximum of three numbers.

486
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,830
So long.

487
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,790
How come I finish it in less than ten lines?

488
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,040
Flash drive.

489
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,760
It suits you.

490
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,870
Coming. Coming.

491
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,350
I got his homework.

492
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,390
I'm pretty sure he's nothing but just a pretty face.

493
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,150
Why?

494
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,390
Isn't the logic of the homework very simple?

495
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,830
It can be done in ten lines of code.

496
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,790
He managed to

497
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,440
write a hundred lines.

498
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,070
What is the most important thing about writing code?

499
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,000
It is to be simple.

500
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,830
He made such a simple logic

501
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,920
so complicated.

502
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,790
He's just making a mystery out of it.

503
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,240
Isn't he just a pretty face?

504
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,460
[Leave me alone, fool.]

505
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,280
This seems to be a virus.

506
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,920
You have an i7 processor

507
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,000
and 16 gigabytes of RAM.

508
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,760
Girl,

509
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,350
you are a computer science student, right?

510
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
You can even tell that?

511
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,960
You're so experienced.

512
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,760
How can the average student use

513
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,110
such a high configuration computer?

514
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,550
You must have spent a lot of money on it.

515
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,870
Do you think it can be fixed?

516
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,520
Leave me alone, fool.

517
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,350
Isn't it just a little virus?

518
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,040
No sweat.

519
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,830
Five minutes.

520
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,760
I'll have it fixed in five minutes.

521
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,310
OK.

522
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,000
Girl,

523
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,480
is Old Lin still

524
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,040
the head of our department?

525
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,590
Are you my senior?

526
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,590
I was admitted in 2001.

527
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,960
You must be a freshman.

528
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,760
Well, don't worry.

529
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,550
The Computer Science Department of our college

530
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,440
is famous,

531
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,790
so it'll be very easy for you

532
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,920
to find a job later.

533
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,440
I used to work in a tech giant.

534
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,040
Then why don't you work there anymore?

535
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,550
Well,

536
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,680
it sounds nice.

537
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,590
To put it bluntly, I was still like a migrant worker on the Internet.

538
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,870
That job consumes youth, hair

539
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,760
and waist.

540
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,590
Those in their thirties there

541
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,200
look like they are in their fifties,

542
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,960
and they are either in the office or in ER.

543
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,680
Those who don't want to die young should change careers.

544
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,870
Well, who did this to you?

545
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,070
One of my classmates.

546
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:43,830
Who?

547
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,920
One of my classmates.

548
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,000
One of your classmates?

549
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,550
No way.

550
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,000
How many classes have you freshmen taken in C language?

551
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,440
How is it possible to make it?

552
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,280
Wait a minute.

553
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,870
I have a virus here.

554
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,920
Yeah, I can't handle it with my flash drive.

555
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,790
Change it. Change it. Change it.

556
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,150
Take it easy.

557
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,000
Change it. Change it. Change it.

558
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,550
Change it. Change it. Change it.

559
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,680
Yes.

560
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,480
Yes. Yes. Yes.

561
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
It works. It works. It works.

562
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,280
It works.

563
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,000
I think maybe we should reinstall the system

564
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,590
in this case.

565
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,920
Why did you call me here in such a hurry?

566
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,310
Secretary Zhang, quick. Come on.

567
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:29,720
Come here.

568
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,680
Your turn. Change it with yours.

569
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,590
Here. Come here.

570
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,240
Use your secret skill.

571
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,920
Here. Be quick.

572
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,720
Have you done it the usual way?

573
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,590
Yes. It didn't work.

574
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,240
That's it. That's where it changes.

575
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,000
Here, it's going to pop out.

576
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,870
Is it made by the guy who created

577
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:40,960
the Worm.WhBoy.cw?

578
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,630
Her classmate.

579
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,960
Which year is her classmate in?

580
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,960
First year.

581
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,630
It's impossible. This is absolutely impossible.

582
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,760
Indeed. If…

583
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,480
None of us can solve it.

584
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,680
If her classmate could do that,

585
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,920
what else is he going to college for?

586
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,960
Am I right?

587
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,480
That's very professional.

588
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
It's way beyond our level.

589
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,550
Try again. Try again. Try again.

590
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,680
Why not ask him to meet us?

591
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,150
OK. OK. OK.

592
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,520
Girl.

593
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,680
Is it OK?

594
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,200
Not yet.

595
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,390
Would you introduce

596
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,390
your classmate to us?

597
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,520
Yeah, introduce him to us.

598
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,720
Let's communicate with him. Get him here,

599
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,870
so we can talk.

600
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,350
Yeah.

601
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,110
We want to make friends with him.

602
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,830
Isn't it fixed?

603
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,920
Gao,

604
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,630
here's your chance to practice.

605
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,590
Oh, no.

606
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,200
It totally turns into a brick.

607
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,760
Zhu Yun,

608
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,590
why don't you get Li Xun over

609
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,830
to tell us how this virus

610
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,070
is actually solved?

611
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,390
I won't ask him for help even if it turns a brick.

612
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,150
I'm going to the library to look things up.

613
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,920
It's just one virus. I just don't buy it.

614
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,760
Give it up.

615
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,280
Li Xun is really a genius.

616
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,630
He deserved to be the top scorer.

617
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,280
Fang Shumiao, do you have a conscience?

618
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,870
If someone has no character, no matter how high his IQ is,

619
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,200
he won't succeed.

620
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,280
Yun,

621
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,000
what about your homework?

622
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,310
Oh, no.

623
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,960
Old Lin is still waiting for me in the office.

624
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,480
You didn't write a virus

625
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,920
to keep from turning in your homework, did you?

626
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,870
Don't make an excuse.

627
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,920
Let me see what kind of virus it is.

628
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,110
Who wrote it?

629
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,150
Li Xun.

630
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,870
Li Xun,

631
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,110
you wrote it yourself?

632
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,720
You brat.

633
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:05,960
Hurry up.

634
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,550
Hurry up. Take a seat.

635
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,630
Take a seat.

636
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,920
Li Xun,

637
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,150
tell me how you wrote it in detail.

638
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,630
It's just a worm.

639
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,870
Worm?

640
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,390
Are you fooling me?

641
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,110
Don't hide it from me.

642
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,520
I've just patched

643
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,790
and fixed the zero day.

644
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,280
What else should I do?

645
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,070
You can't solve it by reinstalling the system either.

646
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,590
I planted a virus in every disk.

647
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,920
Every disk?

648
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,680
Go on.

649
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,590
I just want to try

650
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,630
to make something like Worm.WhBoy.cw

651
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,520
that can infect exe,

652
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,200
com,

653
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,870
pif,

654
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,760
src,

655
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,790
html,

656
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,520
and asp files,

657
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,920
terminate the anti-virus software

658
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,550
and delete

659
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,790
the backup files of the backup restore tool

660
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,310
so that the system can't be reinstalled.

661
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,390
You're terrible.

662
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,920
Do you want to bring down all the computers

663
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,280
in our college?

664
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,550
But Worm.WhBoy.cw is still too low-tech

665
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,960
and not subtle.

666
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,350
The more insidious the virus, the better.

667
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,000
What exactly are you planning to do?

668
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:11,960
Sir,

669
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,200
in fact, now the virus

670
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,150
is to obtain user information,

671
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,720
hijack the browser to install some programs,

672
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,070
or take it as a botne.

673
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,480
But a single computer

674
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,960
is not worth much as a botne.

675
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,760
What is there to steal from the average computer user?

676
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,310
That isn't worth attacking.

677
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,200
But the average person also has a lot of things

678
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,150
on their computer that they don't want to lose,

679
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,920
such as graduation papers, family photos,

680
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,630
designs, and company documents.

681
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,790
All of these can generate exchange value.

682
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
For example,

683
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,760
the 2008 Conficker

684
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,040
is actually the same thing.

685
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,310
It's just that it spread on the Internet.

686
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,630
The firewalls are getting smarter,

687
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,630
less vulnerable

688
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,350
and harder to attack.

689
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,110
But the automator virus

690
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,240
is still very efficient.

691
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,150
Exactly.

692
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,830
So I made this computer

693
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,150
a source of infection.

694
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,630
She'll get different people working on the virus.

695
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,520
Every time the system is reinstalled,

696
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,360
it'll be connected to a different hard drive

697
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,750
and the virus will have direct access to the information.

698
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,400
Sir,

699
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,670
did you just reinstall her system

700
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,040
with your hard drive too?

701
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,190
I was set up by you.

702
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,320
Don't worry, I only wrote the hack,

703
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,880
not the extract.

704
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,710
Li Xun,

705
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,190
tell me all about it.

706
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,360
I heard the worm has mutated.

707
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:39,880
Indeed.

708
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,190
Now Windows XP operating system

709
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,800
still has vulnerabilities.

710
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,110
Put this formula here.

711
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,230
Go over here again.

712
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,360
Then add another line.

713
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,880
Then repeat…

714
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,270
Sir,

715
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,190
your phone is ringing.

716
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,440
If…

717
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,230
Your call.

718
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,440
Hello.

719
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,550
Lin,

720
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,670
why aren't you home so late?

721
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,190
I forgot my house key.

722
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,320
Come back now.

723
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,630
Why did you forget the key again?

724
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,630
Fine. All right, all right.

725
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,800
I…I'll be right back.

726
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,920
I'll be right back.

727
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,070
Sorry, it's my wife.

728
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,550
Here about this?

729
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,630
I'll talk to you some other time.

730
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,480
OK.

731
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,110
Class pre,

732
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,400
why are you still here?

733
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,520
Sir, that virus.

734
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,230
Sorry. Sorry.

735
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,440
Li Xun,

736
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,840
solve it now.

737
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:49,800
OK.

738
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,630
Goodbye, sir.

739
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,750
Goodbye. Goodbye.

740
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,550
Li Xun.

741
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,670
Li Xun.

742
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,630
Here you are.

743
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,750
Are you going to solve it or not?

744
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,630
What time is it?

745
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,550
Stop pulling him.

746
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,110
Let him go, girl.

747
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Go back. Go back.

748
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,400
Let me go, girl.

749
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,110
Mr. Lin asked you to help me.

750
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,270
I have just made it very clear

751
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,480
in the office.

752
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,520
You can't even remember that?

753
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,480
I can't understand it even if I remember that.

754
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,800
You don't understand it, do you?

755
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,920
I thought every class rep

756
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,000
was excellent.

757
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,630
It seems that your interest group

758
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,840
didn't teach you anything either.

759
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,000
Will you do it or not?

760
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,590
What if I say no?

761
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,800
Are you still going to tell the teacher?

762
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,880
Li Xun,

763
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,630
I admit I'm not as good as you.

764
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,480
I sincerely seek your help.

765
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,040
Will you do me a favor?

766
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,630
Zhu Yun,

767
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,630
you should study hard

768
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,000
as you're worse than me.

769
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,040
What a scum!

770
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,590
What happened?

771
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,550
It's just a virus.

772
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,920
I don't believe I can't solve it.

773
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,360
Yun, get up.

774
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,150
I'm not going.

775
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,360
How can you not go?

776
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:26,960
You're trying to kill me.

777
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
I can't get up. I don't have the strength to get up.

778
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,480
-Hurry up. -I'm not going.

779
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,190
Yun,

780
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,480
the teacher will call the roll.

781
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,960
Come on up.

782
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,150
I don't want to go.

783
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,400
What am I supposed to do without you?

784
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,880
The credits will be deducted.

785
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,880
Get up. I'll wash your face.

786
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,270
Get up and I'll wash your face.

787
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,920
What's wrong?

788
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,550
Is it that simple?

789
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,150
Gao is awesome.

790
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,840
He really figured it out.

791
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,150
Go and wash yourself.

792
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,190
There is no end in learning.

793
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,880
The library will be closed soon.

794
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,320
Welcome to

795
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,150
Nanhu University Library again.

796
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,360
The lamb kebabs from Adao are tasty.

797
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,040
I just want to say thank you.

798
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,150
I solved the virus.

799
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,070
You talked to Mr. Lin

800
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,150
about the virus.

801
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,840
Gao and I looked into it

802
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,920
and really solved it.

803
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,150
Although the virus was also thanks to you,

804
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,670
we learned something at least.

805
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,520
Thanks.

806
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,400
Li Xun,

807
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,190
you get good grades and know how to program.

808
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,070
In fact, morning self-study

809
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,800
is a time for us to communicate with each other.

810
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,000
Would you like to come and tutor your classmates?

811
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,630
I have no time.

812
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,190
The scholarship the school paid me

813
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,270
isn't for tutoring my classmates.

814
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,360
But you're always absent from it.

815
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,400
It is a hot potato for Fang Shumiao, the monitor.

816
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,110
Do you know that the counselor has talked to her several times

817
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,960
because of it?

818
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,400
If this goes on,

819
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,880
our class won't be awarded with merit

820
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,800
and Fang Shumiao won't get extra marks for postgraduate recommendation.

821
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,800
She may be unhappy for the next four years

822
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,270
because you don't go to the morning self-study.

823
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,150
I know you don't care

824
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,880
if your marks are deducted,

825
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,440
but we are a group.

826
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,840
You still have to think about others,

827
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,480
right?

828
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,480
I knew you weren't cold-blooded.

829
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,630
Well, many students slack off

830
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,400
once they get to college

831
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,230
and waste the four years of college.

832
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,320
In fact, it is important to study in the morning.

833
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,110
Are you done?

834
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,040
Yes.

835
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,230
So you said yes?

836
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,150
What?

837
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,800
Do I have to give my heart to you

838
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,960
after eating ten of your lamb kebabs?

839
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,800
Are you unwilling to leave?

840
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,960
That's all right.

841
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,960
I don't have to go back to the dorm.

842
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,230
I…I didn't take my phone.

843
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,480
Open the door.

844
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,440
As a man, you don't follow school rules

845
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,800
and makes others suffer the consequences.

846
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,190
Do you have any sense of responsibility?

847
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,710
Open the door and give me my phone.

848
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,800
Open it.

849
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,710
You!

850
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,190
Don't answer my phone.

851
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,750
Stop.

852
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,000
Hello.

853
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,480
Hello, Yun.

854
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,750
Is Shumiao with you?

855
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,320
Sorry,

856
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,960
Zhu Yun is busy now.

857
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,840
I am sorry to interrupt.

858
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,190
Will you open the door?

859
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,110
I will drag you to the morning self-study.

860
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,320
Don't play any tricks on me.

861
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,920
You can't keep it closed forever.

862
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,750
I'm going to wait for you to open it.

863
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:01,440
What a fool.

864
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,800
♫I pass by the world♫
You don't have to keep an eye on me.

865
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,960
♫And pass through the night♫
We can be together in the open.

866
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,320
♫And pass through the night♫
You really gave yourself up?

867
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:26,190
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
He'd do anything to play tricks on me.

868
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:27,190
You clarified the fact?

869
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,070
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
Did his golden hair fade?

870
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,920
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
He didn't really dye

871
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,400
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
his hair black for you, did he?

872
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,500
♫It's the intuition of the dream♫

873
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,220
♫That breaks through the boundary♫

874
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,580
♫The first sight♫

875
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:52,180
♫Spreads and later it wins the world for me♫

876
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:58,100
♫The clock keeps ticking♫

877
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,780
♫I am leaning on your shoulder♫

878
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:09,820
♫We won't break up♫

879
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,940
♫Stay with me from the hustle and bustle♫

880
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,380
♫It's the fulcrum of your palm♫

881
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,420
♫That gives me the courage to move forward♫

882
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:29,380
♫Just like the flame in the night♫

883
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:37,060
♫Cause I believe I love you♫

884
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,620
