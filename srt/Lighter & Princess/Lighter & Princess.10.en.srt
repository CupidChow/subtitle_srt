♫The person I used to be is gone♫

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,980
♫Until when you broke into my world♫

[Episode 10]

21
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,040
Students now are quite arrogant.

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,720
You made trouble at such a young age!

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,160
Zhu Yun,

24
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,960
you think you are quite great?

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,110
I'm asking you.

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,350
I don't understand what you mean.

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,960
You don't understand?

28
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,320
You don't understand what I mean?

29
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,350
I've been responsible for the cooperation with universities for so many years,

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,400
but for the first time I met such a bad student like you.

31
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,470
Only you are great?

32
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,630
Only you know everything?

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,880
You treat me like a fool.

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
I really don't know that

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,040
students now are so vicious.

36
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,670
You wrote nonsense

37
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,560
to embarrass me.

38
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,440
Don't you have the face to be a student?

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,720
You insulted your senior deliberately.

40
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,040
You dare to do that as a student.

41
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,750
You'll be more terrible in workplace.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,910
Zhu Yun, listen.

43
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,160
What you did is such a bad conduct!

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,040
You destroyed the school-enterprise cooperation on purpose.

45
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,790
You'll be punished.

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,040
Dean Jia,

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,320
she is young,

48
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,510
but she did such a terrible thing.

49
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,350
She must take the responsibility.

50
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,000
Dean Jia,

51
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,600
as her teacher,

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,040
I can testify for Zhu Yun.

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,070
She will never do such a thing.

54
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,600
She wouldn't do it on purpose.

55
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,230
There is evidence.

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
She did it on purpose.

57
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,000
Go back first.

58
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,630
Xiaobei,

59
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,400
I'll figure it out

60
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,670
and give Xinchuang an explanation.

61
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,320
Thank you, Dean Jia.

62
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Please check it carefully.

63
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,750
I can deal with

64
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,000
Xinchuang.

65
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,280
I'll just accept

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,160
the punishment,

67
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,350
because I'm the person in charge after all.

68
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,670
But such behavior

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,880
has destroyed our school-enterprise cooperation

70
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,670
and brings shame on Nanhu University.

71
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,070
It'll cause a bad influence

72
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,470
on our future cooperation.

73
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,510
You must punish her severely.

74
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,560
Zhang Xiaobei,

75
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,070
you're going too far.

76
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,880
Zhu Yun is a freshman.

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,560
You want her to be punished now.

78
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,190
Are you going to ruin her whole life?

79
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,670
She has to be responsible for her evil deeds.

80
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,630
Did I plant her?

81
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,720
Obviously, you robbed their project first.

82
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,040
Miss Zhang,

83
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,750
watch your mouth.

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,910
I gave them

85
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,060
opportunities, resources

86
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,350
and media exposure.

87
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,000
You said I robbed their project.

88
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,750
Do you have any evidence?

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,280
You're blackening my name.

90
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,910
Are you going to destroy the school-enterprise cooperation?

91
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,670
You'd better mind your own business.

92
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,670
It isn't worth sacrificing yourself

93
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,550
to protect your student.

94
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,470
Hello.

95
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,080
Go ahead.

96
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,110
What's going on?

97
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,310
Zhang Xiaobei reported to our college

98
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,840
that Zhu Yun programmed like that on purpose

99
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,160
to destroy school-enterprise cooperation.

100
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,350
How did she convince them?

101
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,910
She prepared for it.

102
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,280
She asked Han Jiakang

103
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,200
to copy every version Zhu Yun wrote.

104
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,990
Han Jiakang even wrote a certificate

105
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,160
and signed his name to testify it.

106
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,760
I have to go.

107
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,280
What are you going to do?

108
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,720
How is Zhu Yun?

109
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,110
What did Zhang Xiaobei promise you?

110
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,280
Money,

111
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,910
project,

112
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,910
paper,

113
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,990
or doctoral qualification,

114
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,720
which one?

115
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,400
She promised to make me a regular worker.

116
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,160
Much cheaper than I thought.

117
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,040
Why do you criticize me?

118
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,550
Why do you blame me?

119
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,200
Obviously, Zhu Yun did wrong.

120
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,640
Why should I protect her

121
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,470
regardless of my future?

122
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,230
Who is she?

123
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,840
Apologize to Zhu Yun.

124
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,040
Are you waiting for me?

125
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,200
The app for Blue Crown.

126
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,670
You gave it to me without hesitation?

127
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,840
Aren't you going to sell it?

128
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,200
OK.

129
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,400
I'll overlook what Zhu Yun did.

130
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,280
I would save much effort if I knew

131
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,470
I could control you through her.

132
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,040
She caused trouble to me for you, right?

133
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,960
Look.

134
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,040
You students tried to

135
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,720
sacrifice yourselves one after another.

136
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,400
Do you think you're heroes?

137
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,230
Who can protect others?

138
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,200
What's wrong?

139
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,760
You'll regret one day.

140
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,400
Zhu Yun, Li Xun went to Zhang Xiaobei.

141
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,480
Li Xun.

142
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,310
Li Xun?

143
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,710
Turn round.

144
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,280
Why are you sitting here?

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Take a break.

146
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,640
You gave Zhang Xiaobei the app?

147
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,590
You were there that day, right?

148
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,120
You heard everything

149
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,160
when she went to me that day.

150
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,590
In fact, I had guessed what you wanted to do

151
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,670
when you went to her.

152
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,670
I just didn't want you to realize that

153
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,240
what you said and did

154
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,400
was heard and seen by others.

155
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,550
Princess,

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm not that fragile.

157
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,430
What's wrong?

158
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,590
You fool.

159
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,520
You wasted so much

160
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,480
time on her.

161
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,590
Never mind. You're a fool.

162
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,120
How much did you earn by selling the app to Zhang Xiaobei?

163
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,310
I can write

164
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,430
more apps like that easily.

165
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,790
Get over yourself.

166
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,910
Well...

167
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,060
No need to say.

168
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,520
Li Xun,

169
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,550
I'm not a princess

170
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,670
or a fool.

171
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,550
Let's wait and see.

172
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,310
Gao,

173
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,830
why are you sitting here?

174
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,400
Li Xun.

175
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,120
What's wrong?

176
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
Can you ask me

177
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
before making a decision?

178
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,880
Would you disagree?

179
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,190
Can't you try another way?

180
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,550
Did you find another way?

181
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,830
Now that the results are the same,

182
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,360
does it make a difference to ask you?

183
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,040
Li Xun,

184
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,310
you didn't design the app alone.

185
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,190
I also spent much effort on it.

186
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,190
I just want respect from you.

187
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,160
Is it hard for you?

188
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,910
I see.

189
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,760
But it was too urgent

190
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,880
to ask you.

191
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,280
Gao,

192
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,670
we were dealing with Zhang Xiaobei.

193
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,240
You know it.

194
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,520
If we hadn't acted quickly, we would have been at a disadvantage.

195
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,640
Instead, we don't

196
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,360
need to take offence at her.

197
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,590
Do you agree?

198
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,360
The last time,

199
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,950
for the sake of helping Zhu Yun.

200
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,550
You've been staring at it for half an hour.

201
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,000
Will any magic happen?

202
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,430
Hello.

203
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,760
Mom.

204
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,190
Yun,

205
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,760
it's late. What's up?

206
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,040
What are you doing, mom?

207
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,480
Me?

208
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,240
I'm reading a document.

209
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,480
What's wrong?

210
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,240
Nothing.

211
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,550
I miss you.

212
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,120
I miss you, too.

213
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,710
How are you doing recently?

214
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,590
Yun,

215
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,880
is something wrong with you?

216
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,830
No.

217
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,910
As an experienced educator,

218
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,950
I can tell that something is wrong with you.

219
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,430
Tell me

220
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,240
what happened.

221
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,040
Mom,

222
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
our project manager

223
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,430
is too strict with us.

224
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,000
That's normal.

225
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,360
Your base is doing projects.

226
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,670
Certainly you are treated

227
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,190
as professionals.

228
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,430
They won't be patient to you like your teachers.

229
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,280
But that's great.

230
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,640
You'll be more capable.

231
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,120
If they are not strict with you,

232
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,880
you won't make progress.

233
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,520
Mom,

234
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,240
there is a great decline in my grades.

235
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,520
I was in the fourth place at the beginning of this term,

236
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,160
but in ninth last time.

237
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,360
Why?

238
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,790
The courses are difficult?

239
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,280
No.

240
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,550
What's the reason?

241
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,520
An external project director

242
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,070
of the Center for School-Enterprise Cooperation

243
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,160
of our School of Graduate asked me to help with a project.

244
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,480
Working to a tight schedule,

245
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,550
I failed to do it well,

246
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,070
so she was mad at me.

247
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,910
It's nonsense.

248
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,190
The Center for School-Enterprise Cooperation of School of Graduate

249
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,590
has nothing to do with you undergraduates.

250
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,790
They even use you freshmen

251
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,550
as cheap labor.

252
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,550
They're going too far.

253
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,910
No.

254
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,280
She meant well.

255
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,830
She wanted us to practice more.

256
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,550
OK. I see.

257
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,670
Forget it.

258
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,310
I'll ask your dad to deal with it.

259
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,000
Tell me the name

260
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,480
of your manager.

261
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,710
Zhang Xiaobei.

262
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
This way, please.

263
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,830
Zhu Yun is a university student.

264
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,670
When I worked with your dad,

265
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,670
I held you.

266
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,120
Yes.

267
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,830
You were a little girl.

268
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,830
How time flies!

269
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,550
This way, please.

270
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,400
Where is your son?

271
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:30,880
He is in Britain.

272
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,520
Mr. Qian,

273
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,950
it's been a long time since we last met.

274
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,880
Come here.

275
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
I'm late. Sorry.

276
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,190
I'll drink later to apologize.

277
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,400
Don't stand there.

278
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,190
Come in.

279
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,070
Mr. Wang.

280
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,400
Do you remember Zhu?

281
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,950
Of course.

282
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,590
Our company asked him for help

283
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,950
last year.

284
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,400
Thank you,

285
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,640
Mr. Zhu.

286
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,070
Don't mention that.

287
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,920
Zhu and I

288
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,720
are old friends.

289
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,480
We haven't met each other for 2 to 3 years.

290
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,150
Yes.

291
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,550
Now that we have time,

292
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,720
let's get together

293
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,240
and communicate.

294
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,870
By the way,

295
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,720
clear up misunderstandings.

296
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,550
Fine.

297
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,200
Let's eat and talk.

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,680
Mr. Qian,

299
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,960
Mr. Wang,

300
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,110
Mr. Zhu,

301
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,550
Ms. Liu.

302
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,830
I'd like to say something,

303
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,040
or

304
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,390
I have no appetite.

305
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,760
In this case,

306
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,280
speak plainly.

307
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,240
First,

308
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,390
I admit my mistake.

309
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,240
Being immature

310
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,720
and impatient,

311
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,680
I was so eager to make my mark that I made a mistake.

312
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,150
But please trust me.

313
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,440
I meant no harm.

314
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,240
I meant well.

315
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,350
Zhu Yun's ability was recognized

316
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,960
when she took part

317
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,280
in the project of Blue Crown.

318
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,790
Due to my impatience

319
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,390
and bad temper,

320
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,240
I didn't communicate

321
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,550
with her well.

322
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,760
Zhu Yun,

323
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,240
I apologize to you sincerely.

324
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,310
I went too far before.

325
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,110
I'm really sorry.

326
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,760
Engaging in education,

327
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,040
I know many universities

328
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,280
like to cooperate

329
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,920
with enterprises.

330
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,280
This is great,

331
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,310
as it can provide students

332
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,390
with opportunities of social practice.

333
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,390
However,

334
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,240
some employees of enterprises

335
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,310
have a weak level of professional competence

336
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,240
and very low

337
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,520
moral integrity.

338
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,150
They treat

339
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,200
students as cheap labor.

340
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,000
They gain power using all kinds

341
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,870
of tricks to bully students.

342
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,350
They resort to

343
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,150
desperate means for benefits,

344
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,680
affecting students' future.

345
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,550
Some people even

346
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,110
insult students

347
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,790
in work.

348
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,200
That's too much.

349
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
I know now

350
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,200
some schools and enterprises

351
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,390
are under great pressures.

352
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,830
But, Mr. Wang,

353
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,150
reputation means a lot

354
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,590
to your big company.

355
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,070
If it brings disgrace

356
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,590
on your company,

357
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,830
you'll suffer losses, right?

358
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Yes.

359
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,960
I'll ask them to check it

360
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,040
carefully later.

361
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,920
You must check carefully.

362
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,200
Zhang.

363
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,060
Miss Zhang,

364
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,790
in any case,

365
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,630
it's rude of you

366
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,680
to splash Zhu Yun with water

367
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,760
on her face

368
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,550
in public.

369
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,150
Yes.

370
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,440
Well,

371
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,390
I'll state

372
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,830
clearly my stand.

373
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,200
It was

374
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,350
caused by

375
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,720
my insufficient supervision.

376
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,680
I'm directly responsible for it.

377
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,280
I'll drink this cup of wine

378
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,790
to punish myself.

379
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,680
OK.

380
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,680
Zhu Yun,

381
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
It's gross.

383
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,720
Did anyone bully you again?

384
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,310
What if I bully others?

385
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,350
Do you feel guilty?

386
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,110
No,

387
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,550
but I would have felt better

388
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,390
if I had defeated her

389
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,960
in my own right.

390
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,000
We all have

391
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,280
our own family,

392
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,150
origin and contacts.

393
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,630
These are the ability you just mentioned.

394
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,040
Zhang Xiaobei even bullied you using her company.

395
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,310
But I don't want to be like her.

396
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,200
Do you look down

397
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,630
on yourself sometimes?

398
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,870
Never.

399
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,760
You set a high

400
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,830
moral threshold.

401
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,680
A wicked person will be harassed by another of like ilk.

402
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,720
Han Jiakang

403
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,960
was badly bullied by her.

404
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,440
Just think that you punish her for him.

405
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,040
I printed it.

406
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,040
OK.

407
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,520
I'm coming.

408
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,520
You're really a princess.

409
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,200
Don't you work?

410
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,870
Yes.

411
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,280
Tell me if anything happens.

412
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,000
Don't try to deal with it by yourself.

413
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,720
Same to you.

414
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,550
Tell me if anything happens.

415
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,590
Don't try to deal with it by yourself.

416
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,720
I see,

417
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,350
Your Highness.

418
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,240
Why do you call me like that?

419
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,830
What should I call you?

420
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,480
Gao,

421
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,870
this search bar doesn't work.

422
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,280
Rewrite it this afternoon.

423
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,920
OK.

424
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,760
We haven't sold the app?

425
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,200
We will sell it.

426
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,920
We got it back.

427
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,720
What, what do you mean?

428
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,630
Ask princess.

429
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,590
You're out of your mind.

430
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,150
Send me the progress as soon as possible.

431
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,110
I fall behind a lot. I need to speed up.

432
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,870
If I were Gao, I would get angry, too.

433
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,040
He spent a long time

434
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,870
on developing the app

435
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,790
and paid for installing the motion capture system.

436
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,350
However, you two used it as a flirting tool.

437
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,310
Don't be so harsh.

438
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,790
Li Xun sold it

439
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,480
and you took it back at will.

440
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,200
Neither of you asked Gao about that.

441
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,240
I know that.

442
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,870
I apologized to him.

443
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,960
He said he was angry for a short while.

444
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,960
But he doesn't seem to be

445
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,920
so interested in the project

446
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,480
now at the base.

447
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,960
He did whatever Li Xun asked him to do,

448
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,550
but he said nothing.

449
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,790
To be honest,

450
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,960
I quit because of that.

451
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,920
Li Xun is capable.

452
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,040
But when we stay with him,

453
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,920
we have to let go of all our self-esteem

454
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,240
and be as humble as possible.

455
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,240
Is it worthwhile?

456
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,110
He is not that ruthless.

457
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,240
You are an exception.

458
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,110
Let me put it this way.

459
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,240
He is like anti-virus software,

460
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,960
killing every worm

461
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,520
except you.

462
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,040
You're his bug.

463
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,090
[Notice on Suspension of of Nanhu University Gym]

464
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,440
What are you doing?

465
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,240
Princess even walks to class?

466
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,280
By the way,

467
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,630
our school just sent a notice that

468
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,390
the wall outside the dance room was broken

469
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,040
and needed an overhaul.

470
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,870
We can't have aerobics classes, physical education

471
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,240
and dance classes there.

472
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,790
What do you want to learn?

473
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:11,960
I don't care.

474
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
I'll choose one for you.

475
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,960
Zhu Yun.

476
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,760
I came to say sorry.

477
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,830
You're still thinking about that?

478
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,440
I told you it doesn't matter.

479
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,040
I wasn't going to hide it from Zhang Xiaobei.

480
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,790
They're two different things.

481
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,200
I didn't act like a man.

482
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,870
I look down on myself.

483
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,350
I'm sorry.

484
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,590
I shouldn't frame my friend

485
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,790
by going against my conscience.

486
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,680
If you still consider me as your friend.

487
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,590
Sure.

488
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,070
I'm going back to my hometown.

489
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,520
Senior,

490
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,390
you're skillful.

491
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,920
Do you really want to go?

492
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,100
I want to change my life.

493
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,760
Actually, I don't like programming at all.

494
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,240
My parents are in poor health.

495
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,760
My fish pond is performing poorly.

496
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,390
To tell you the truth,

497
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,920
I transferred to the Computer Science Department

498
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,830
for the high income as a programmer,

499
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,150
so as to support my family.

500
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,070
However, I didn't make

501
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,630
money these years.

502
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,150
Besides, I don't feel happy.

503
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,390
It's a complete waste of life.

504
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,630
I'd rather go back home

505
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,760
and help my parents run the fish pond.

506
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,720
I have to catch a train at noon.

507
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,520
See you.

508
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,280
Han,

509
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,760
come to us when you need help.

510
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,520
Thank you.

511
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,480
What caused by Zhang Xiaobei came to an end.

512
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,680
She was exposed to the media by Xinchuang

513
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,150
and left office regretfully,

514
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,550
becoming a notorious villain.

515
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,150
Finally, the School of Graduate restored its integrity.

516
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,040
For the first time I see him so relaxed.

517
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,310
It's good for him to leave here.

518
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,870
I hope he makes the right choice.

♫Shrimp soldiers and crab generals are busy♫

Liu,

528
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,760
you had your hair cut?

529
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,280
Yes.

530
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,200
It was inconvenient.

531
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,480
And

532
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,390
someone said it didn't look good.

533
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,870
Well,

534
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,480
the boss let you sing here again?

535
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,070
Someone ordered.

536
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,110
We're popular.

537
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,280
This matter...

538
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,070
Fine. OK.

539
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,830
No problem.

540
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,790
OK.

541
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,590
There's a clogged toilet. Go fix it.

542
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,440
OK.

543
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,720
It has nothing to do with him.

544
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,200
-I'll help. -Shut up.

545
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,070
Mr. Wang,

546
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,920
Liu is a member of my band.

547
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,870
He came here for performance

548
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,440
instead of cleaning.

549
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,920
Is there anyone watching

550
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,830
your performance?

551
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,240
If he didn't promise

552
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,480
to work as

553
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,630
a cleaner back then,

554
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,720
you can't sing here again.

555
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,630
Moreover,

556
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,830
your poor band can't sell a ticket

557
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,310
and wastes my place.

558
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,720
Don't you feel shame?

559
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,760
Come out with me.

560
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,960
-Listen to me. -Come out with me.

561
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,630
I, I...

562
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,790
Are you out of your mind?

563
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,550
I,

564
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,070
I did that

565
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,790
to let our band play here.

566
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,150
Who are you trying to move?

567
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,550
You move yourself,

568
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,590
but I think you're poor.

569
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,630
I didn't.

570
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,390
I just want to be nice to you.

571
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,240
I don't need it.

572
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,720
Did I ask you to be nice to me?

573
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,870
Listen,

574
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,000
if you focus on such things instead of the performance of the band,

575
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,630
get lost.

576
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,630
My band doesn't need a toilet cleaner.

577
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,150
Is my performance just equal

578
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,440
to your cleaning in the toilet?

579
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,550
Ren Di, I like you.

580
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,000
But I don't like you.

581
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,040
Listen,

582
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,110
I'll never fall in love with a man

583
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,200
who moves me.

584
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,830
No matter how you change,

585
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,870
I won't like you.

586
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,720
It won't help even if you cut your head,

587
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,920
let alone cutting your hair.

588
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,760
Do you understand?

589
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,790
Do you understand?

590
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,720
Never change yourself for others.

591
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,960
It's not worth it.

592
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,730
[Nanhu University  Study Extensively, Practice Earnestly, Seek Improvement Constantly]

593
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,440
Zhu Yun,

594
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,310
you blushed.

595
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,630
Is it hot?

596
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,200
You're review the Basic Principle of Marxism at the base in front of me.

597
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,550
Do you want to die?

598
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,760
It's lunch time.

599
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,440
Do what you should do at the base.

600
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,520
I need to review, too.

601
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,070
You gave everyone else a day off.

602
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,240
Why don't you give me a day off?

603
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,200
You want me to treat you

604
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,000
like how I treat others?

605
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,480
No,

606
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,350
but this is not the same thing.

607
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,240
You're not going to have lunch?

608
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,350
I don't deserve it.

609
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,070
Productive forces and relations of production

610
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,480
are two inseparable aspects of social production.

611
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,440
Miss Zhang,

612
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,140
I'm Zhu Yun's mom.

613
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,800
Are you in your office?

614
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,480
Mrs. Zhu,

615
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,230
don't worry.

616
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,550
Zhu Yun is doing

617
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,040
very well in school.

618
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,630
She is clever.

619
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,960
She is responsible as the class rep.

620
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,880
She's in the top set.

621
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,960
Actually, I don't worry

622
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
about her study.

623
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,150
As soon as she learns every subject well,

624
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,840
she can get postgraduate recommendation

625
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,520
or go abroad in the future.

626
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,880
You're far-sighted.

627
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,960
She's just a freshman,

628
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,480
but you've planned everything for her.

629
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,670
As her parents, we should master the steering wheel

630
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,630
and help her adjust the direction at any time.

631
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,230
Did you ask Zhu Yun about her plan?

632
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,270
She is too young

633
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,190
to think

634
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,270
comprehensively.

635
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
Parents should take care

636
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,880
of these important events.

637
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,150
Miss Zhang,

638
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,190
are there any boys

639
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,480
who are close to

640
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,000
Zhu Yun in school recently?

641
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,070
Different from high school,

642
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,880
we don't spend all time with our students.

643
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,110
Moreover, they're all adults.

644
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,710
It's normal for them

645
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,360
to date someone.

646
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,400
Legally, she is an adult,

647
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,040
but she is immature mentally.

648
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,710
I'm not against her having a boyfriend.

649
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,750
But romance should be beautiful.

650
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,710
Zhu Yun is a simple girl.

651
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,440
I'm worried that she may be hurt by others.

652
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,840
But they are grown-ups.

653
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,150
They have to go their own way.

654
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,670
As her mom,

655
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,110
you should trust

656
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,110
and respect her

657
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,150
OK, Miss Zhang.

658
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,710
I'm leaving.

659
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,320
I want to see Yun.

660
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,190
OK. I'll lead you there.

661
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,630
I think she is at the base.

662
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,150
OK. Thank you.

663
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,070
The basis of exchange value.

664
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,800
Exchange value is the manifestation of value.

665
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,230
The value, but not the use value,

666
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,190
determines the proportion of

667
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,270
commodity exchange.

668
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,710
Value is the basis of exchange value

669
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,320
and exchange value is the manifestation of value.

670
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:31,800
This is...

671
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,710
Time to have lunch.

672
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,150
Say directly if you want to give me the bread.

673
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,150
Value is the basis of exchange value

674
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,000
and exchange value is...

675
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,270
Help me get some water as well.

676
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,360
Exchange goods with different values.

677
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,190
I want cold water.

678
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,190
The reason why...

679
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,040
The reason why commodities with different use values

680
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,400
can be exchanged in a certain proportion

681
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,750
is that they are valuable.

682
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,880
Commodity value in,

683
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,000
in governance regulations...

684
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,550
How do you want to be punished?

685
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,150
You hit me first.

686
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,150
I'm reviewing the course,

687
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,320
but you interrupt me all the time.

688
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,230
I can just review it at noon.

689
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,150
I've been busy with the base all term.

690
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,880
I haven't listened to this course well.

691
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,960
It'll be too late if I don't review it now.

692
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,550
Be reasonable, okay?

693
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,710
What are you looking at?

694
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,750
Is there any dirt on my face?

695
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,750
Don't move.

696
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,190
Zhu Yun.

697
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,630
Mom.

698
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,000
Zhu Yun,

699
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,150
come here.

700
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,190
Miss Zhang.

701
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,270
Mom,

702
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
why are you here?

703
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,070
The bureau asked me here for a meeting temporarily.

704
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,840
I didn't have anything to do at noon,

705
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,840
so I came to see you.

706
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,520
Your mom seldom comes here.

707
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,520
Stop your work.

708
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,800
Go have lunch with her.

709
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,550
Let's go, mom.

710
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,400
Won't you take your things?

711
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:10,710
Let's go, mom.

712
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,270
Or the canteen's food will be sold out.

713
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,520
Mom.

714
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,550
Yun.

715
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,800
This canteen is great.

716
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,880
I've checked it.

717
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,230
These are organic vegetable

718
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,190
and they are cheap.

719
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,190
Don't eat in those restaurants

720
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,400
at the gate.

721
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:40,880
I see.

722
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,710
I have too many classes

723
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,750
to eat out often.

724
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,590
Although you have many classes in the first year,

725
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,110
it's actually the most relaxed period.

726
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,040
Once you are a sophomore or a junior,

727
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,550
you should consider graduation.

728
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,360
So I suggest you take part in school activities

729
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,710
to increase your practical experience

730
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,230
as a freshman.

731
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,110
OK.

732
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,750
That was your base just now?

733
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,000
Yes.

734
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,630
Our base is great.

735
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,230
We freshmen

736
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,960
can make money by doing other companies' projects.

737
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,230
You're just a freshman.

738
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,070
Why are you in such a hurry to make money?

739
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,800
No,

740
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,800
I mean

741
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,590
now we're at the same level

742
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,190
with other companies.

743
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,550
The boy just now...

744
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,230
He is Li Xun,

745
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,360
the top of our major.

746
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,270
He applied to the school for the base.

747
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,960
Are you friends?

748
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,000
Yes.

749
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,840
We were just having fun.

750
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,000
But you may not

751
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,480
know him very well.

752
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,440
[Happy birthday]
I once punished a student

753
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,630
who made a deep impression on me.

754
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,550
Do you remember your 17th birthday?

755
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,550
Happy birthday to you.

756
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,440
Who?

757
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,840
Are you Director Liu?

758
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,000
What can I do for you?

759
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,710
I'm from Linyang No. 8 Middle School.

760
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,440
My name is Li Xun.

761
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,360
I know you.

762
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,040
I changed the scores of unified exams.

763
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,440
It has nothing to do with others.

764
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,040
You can expel me from school.

765
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,590
Cheating in the exams

766
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,960
is a serious offense.

767
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,880
Neither of you can escape the punishment.

768
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,880
This isn't negotiable.

769
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,000
Go back now.

770
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,520
♫I pass by the world♫
Li Xun,

771
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,800
♫I pass by the world♫
are you going to drive me away?

772
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,400
♫And pass through the night♫
I said I don't need you.

773
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,360

Can't you understand?

774
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,920
I'm sorry.

775
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,800
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
Hi,

776
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,960
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
could I have your WeChat account?

777
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,590
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
I'm sorry.

778
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,120
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
You should apologize.

779
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,800
♫It's the intuition of the dream♫

780
