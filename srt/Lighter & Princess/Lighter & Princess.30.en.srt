Yes, it is.

That is to say,

127
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,390
they'll constantly recharge in the game.

128
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,720
They'll pay more for the game.

129

I don't care whether you change your surname into mine.

141

169
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,950
It's because few people think of it.

170

Such games are reported

171
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,040
only because those followers

172
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,920
are investigated collectively

00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,000
after they add low elements.

174
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
There's still a risk of being reported.

175
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,560
I'll control

176
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,040
the game content strictly

177
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,040
to avoid such a risk.

178
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,160
Then let's begin.

179
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,630
No.

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,120
I can't agree with your poor idea.

181
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,390
It's such a bad game.

182
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,310
You said you wanted to make money,

183
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,430
so you tried to design

184
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,750
the games at the leading edge of technology.

185
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,800
Now you just think to date girls.

186
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,240
Let's vote.

187
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,600
Anyone who agrees with my plan can raise your hand.

188
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,000
I'd better quit.

189
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,080
Are you really angry?

190
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,030
You're happy

191
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,030
about such discussion.

192
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,240
Guo Xiaojian usually

193
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,600
looks serious.

194
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,030
He just smiled knowingly.

195
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,750
Don't get angry.

196
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,720
It's just a love-nurtured game.

197
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,320
There are not so many values.

198
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,910
Don't magnify and overanalyze it.

199
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,390
Go on with your meeting.

200
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,120
I'll do my own work.

201
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,750
Calm down.

202
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,960
I'll explain to you after the meeting.

203
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,750
I'll leave.

204
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,240
Haven't you left?

205
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:41,870
Let's go.

206
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,000
You may leave first.

207
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,320
Don't forget to turn off the lights if you're the last one to leave.

208
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:44,960
Okay.

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,630
Fang, there's a spicy crayfish restaurant beside my home.

210
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,670
Let's go and have spicy crayfish.

211
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,240
You said you would explain to me.

212
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,270
Where are you?

213
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,030
Come in, please.

214
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,120
I'll get something.

215
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,150
Go ahead.

216
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,320
Why do you blush?

217
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,840
Are you alright?

218
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,600
Yes.

219
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,150
It's raining.

220
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,870
Yes. The rain comes suddenly.

221
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,150
Yes, it comes suddenly.

222
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,750
Let nature take its course.

223
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,630
It's raining heavily.

224
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,790
Your tape.

225
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,870
Are you going to defeat Gao Jianhong

226
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,670
by this game?

227
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,600
Yes.

228
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,510
Li Xun,

229
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,630
if you want to defeat him ultimately,

230
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,080
you should at least think out a marvelous idea.

231
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,320
But I don't think your current plan

232
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,670
can make a hit.

233
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,630
It's nothing exciting.

234
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,440
This only shows that good works can stimulate human nature.

235
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,600
I don't care

236
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,270
whether my plan

237
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,030
is marvelous or not.

238
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,200
I don't need

239
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,240
to defeat him

240
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,200
but just make him full of fear of being defeated by me.

241
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,600
You've thought out a way to deal with him, right?

242
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,550
I'll tell you later.

243
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,630
You're as unreliable

244
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,720
as usual.

245
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,630
Thank you.

246
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,790
I won't help you with this project.

247
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,080
Don't have wishful thinking.

248
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,000
I just want to tell you this.

249
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,960
What?

250
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,240
Go on with your previous project

251
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,870
"Invincible General".

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,120
If our company wants to  keep a foothold,

253
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
we should not only make money

254
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,120
but also show our attitude by some games.

255
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,910
"Invincible General" is the signature game of our company.

256
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,790
You'll know it later.

257
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,510
What do you mean by that?

258
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,390
I know what you worry about,

259
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,510
and I'll settle everything for you.

260
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,670
Got it?

261
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,270
I want to say.

262
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,440
I know what you worry about,

263
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,630
and I'll settle everything for you.

264
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,790
Got it?

265
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,960
Yes.

266
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,720
Free up time on weekends.

267
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,870
For what?

268
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,440
My bed broke,

269
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,360
so you should be responsible for it.

270
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,080
Unlocked.

271
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,360
According to your request, this is an apartment with two bedrooms and one living room.

272
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,960
So big.

273
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,390
You acted much faster than Fu Yizhuo.

274
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,360
He doesn't know to rent an apartment.

275
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,510
I have rental experience.

276
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,960
How do you like it?

277
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,840
I'll give you a card number.

278
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,320
You should pay the rent every three months.

279
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,480
The apartment owner is abroad,

280
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,120
so you can stay here with ease.

281
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,080
You can work in this room,

282
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,200
and rest in the other room.

283
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,910
Move away the table

284
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,120
and put a bed

285
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,000
in this room.

286
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,480
Are you going to sleep in this room?

287
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,270
Leave it to Hou Ning.

288
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,750
He'll come back.

289
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,440
Let's go.

290
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,550
Where will we go?

291
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,030
Let me carry one for you, okay?

292
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,080
Your waist is so vulnerable.

293
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,840
Don't try to carry so heavy items, okay?

294
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,080
Then let's carry it together.

295
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,030
What did you buy?

296
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,670
I bought a pot.

297
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,790
It's I who bought the pot.

298
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,480
Your shirt is creased.

299
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,240
I wear it when sleeping.

300
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,440
But you haven't washed it.

301
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
It's still clean.

302
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,440
I wore it.

303
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,270
So?

304
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,880
So,

305
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,030
so you should wash it.

306
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,070
So shy.

307
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,200
I got a message,

308
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,880
but I'm not sure whether it's true.

309
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,110
What's it?

310
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,960
Gao Jianhong and Fang Zhijing are planning backdoor listing.

311
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,070
They're prone to extravagant fancies.

312
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,590
Are they going to court their ruin?

313
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,400
But if this is true,

314
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
they are preparing to submit materials.

315
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,310
So?

316
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,880
So if L&P Company is really listed,

317
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,270
we can't defeat Gao Jianhong anymore.

318
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,310
Listen carefully.

319
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,440
If I can't prevent his company from being listed,

320
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,960
I'll change my surname

321
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,720
and admit my defeat before him.

322
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,510
Do you have a plan?

323
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,960
No.

324
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,880
Haven't you had a plan or haven't you thought it well?

325
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,200
There's no difference.

326
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,270
Take good care of your project.

327
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,240
Li Xun,

328
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,830
I'd like to share everything with you, right?

329
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,790
You don't need to tell me.

330
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,030
I can guess it.

331
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,920
You're insightful.

332
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
But if I can't guess something, you should tell me.

333
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,790
What do you want to say?

334
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,200
We can't make the mistakes we made before.

335
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,440
No matter how you plan

336
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,000
to deal with Gao Jianhong next,

337
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,110
you should consult with me before you make any decision.

338
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,590
I'll tell you.

339
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,110
We should communicate with each other.

340
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,680
Li Xun, you're not alone now.

341
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,110
We need to talk with each other.

342
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,510
I see.

343
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,310
I actually said the same words as I had said four years ago.

344
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,350
Zhu Yun, you fool.

345
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,680
Come on.

346
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,440
Jin Cheng. Jin Cheng.

347
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,310
Can I get your autograph?

348
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,070
I like you so much. I'm your fan.

349
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,920
Jin Cheng. Jin Cheng. Jin Cheng.

350
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,000
Could you leave your autograph here?

351
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,880
Thank you, Jin Cheng. Thank you, Jin Cheng.

352
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Don't be so impetuous next time.

353
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,640
Thank you.

354
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,480
Jin Cheng, I love you forever.

355
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,920
Love you. Jin Cheng, I love you forever.

356
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,590
I saw him personally.

357
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,640
Jin Cheng, I love you.

358
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,400
I told Director Gao

359
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,070
and he agreed to your participation next time.

360
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,240
I don't want to participate in these boring variety shows.

361
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,720
I already promised to him.

362
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,750
Do you remember

363
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,240
how long you haven't written songs carefully?

364
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,110
Write songs?

365
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,750
Isn't that single I wrote last month good?

366
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,590
It's such an awful song.

367
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,400
Yes.

368
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,070
There's no difference.

369
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,030
But my fans like it very much.

370
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,880
It ranks first in both sales

371
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,240
and number of downloads.

372
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,920
Isn't it good enough?

373
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,270
Don't touch me.

374
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,640
Are you really mad at me?

375
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,790
I know the song sounds bad,

376
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,920
but our fans like it.

377
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,750
It's good

378
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,200
as long as they're willing to pay for our albums.

379
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,000
Ren Di,

380
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,270
times have changed.

381
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,590
Popular singers dominate the market.

382
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,070
We should write songs

383
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,720
according to the needs of fans.

384
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,960
Everyone tries to make a quick buck,

385
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,200
so we don't have to act against the times.

386
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,000
Again. Don't touch me.

387
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,590
The news that we quarreled and broke up

388
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,790
has still been a trending topic on the list.

389
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,310
If you keep mad at me

390
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,680
and we're shot again,

391
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,960
the news will be confirmed.

392
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,880
You've paid for it.

393
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,830
You've been trending topics in the whole month

394
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,110
and even the whole year.

395
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,590
You're just the resident guest of trending topics.

396
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,440
This is a routine operation.

397
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,200
I didn't expect that news would become the trending topic.

398
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,440
Maybe people

399
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,160
are interested in such topics.

400
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,070
Listen.

401
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,510
I won't see Light Red becomes a band

402
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,790
which attracts the public attention by hype and just creates low songs.

403
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,400
What do you mean?

404
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,960
You know my meaning well.

405
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,070
Do you want to kick me out?

406
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,590
Listen.

407
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,270
Without me,

408
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,300
Light Red wouldn't become so popular.

409
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,160
Light Red only belonged to you,

410
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,960
so you could decide who stayed.

411
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,680
But it's different now.

412
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,510
I'm the brand of Light Red now.

[Ren Di broke up with Jin Cheng and announced to withdraw from the Light Red Band, which shocks the netizens.]

446
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,830
Do you feel it a pity

447
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,720
if you withdraw from Light Red?

448
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,200
Legally speaking,

449
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,030
the Light Red Band belongs to you.

450
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Let me tell you something.

451
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,920
The car Jin Cheng drives

452
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,680
is the second car he bought this year.

453
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,160
So he has

454
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,350
a total of seven cars now,

455
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,110
five of which are red.

456
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,680
He actually doesn't like red.

457
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,200
As our band became popular

458
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,750
and our songs ranked top

459
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,480
in various lists

460
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,350
when he bought the first car,

461
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,680
so he thinks red is a lucky color.

462
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,070
As a result,

463
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,550
fans think he likes red

464
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,160
and make red the representative color of our band.

465
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,310
They think

466
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,310
he's a man as passionate as flame.

467
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,310
So naturally they think red is a lucky color

468
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,680
these years.

469
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,510
I think

470
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,640
he has forgotten

471
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,720
what his favorite color is.

472
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,030
He becomes confident after getting popular with fans.

473
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,240
Jin Cheng is no longer

474

Yes.

476
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,510
He has changed fast.

477
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,270
Nothing stays changeless,

478
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,030
especially men.

479

510
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,310
Hello.

511
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,070
Long time no see.

512
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,070
Long time no see. Long time no see.

513
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,350
Long time no see.

514
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,640
Enjoy yourselves.

515
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,310
Excuse me.

516
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,000
Okay.

517
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,830
I've figured out the information of that man

518
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,790
you saw last time at the police station.

519
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,790
He is Hou Ning, a hacker.

520
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,160
He and Li Xun met in prison.

521
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,030
He was put into prison twice.

522
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,160
Last time, he was sentenced to seven years in prison

523
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,310
as he hacked into a listed network company

524
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,880
and made a lot of money.

525
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,270
He could hack into a network company,

526
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,750
showing his high ability.

527
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,030
He stayed with Li Xun

528
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,720
after being released.

529
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,110
They had a humongous row

530
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,030
and fell out

531
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,880
after leaving the public security bureau last time.

532
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,720
Then he disappeared.

533
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,790
Have they fallen out?

534
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,000
Make clear his purpose

535
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,920
to avoid his trap.

536
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,350
Don't worry.

537
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,200
He knows Li Xun best.

538
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,960
Find him.

539
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,920
How is it going with Li Xun's project?

540
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,270
Since you asked me about it,

541
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,960
let me tell you something magical.

542
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,350
We worked on

543
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,160
the tracking and dispatch system last week.

544
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,000
He drew me a task

545
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,790
to follow.

546
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,000
Then I completed it

547
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,240
in a week.

548
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,200
I showed it to him today.

549
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,200
Guess what he said.

550
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,110
Did he ask you to redo it?

551
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,310
No.

552
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,350
He had finished it.

553
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,550
I finished it day and night in a week,

554
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,160
but he could finish it in half a day.

555
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,400
She's such an unusual talent.

556
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,790
You just stayed up late for one week.

557
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,880
Can't you stand it?

558
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,590
He has stayed up late for over 10 years.

559
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,880
If you stay up late for over 10 years,

560
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,790
you'll do better and faster than him.

561
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,160
Stop kidding me.

562
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,000
Xiuzhu.

563
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:55,830
Then

564
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,720
I'll leave first.

565
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,200
Okay.

566
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,550
What brings you here?

567
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,510
You must forget me.

568
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,590
We haven't seen each other for more than half a month,

569
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,440
Miss Zhu.

570
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,880
I'm single-minded

571
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,100
about my work.

572
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,960
You know it.

573
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,510
Li Xun, Li Xun.

574
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Go downstairs now.

575
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,680
What's up?

576
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,790
Stop asking me that.

577
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,030
I'm here to report to you.

578
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,750
If other man wins the love of Zhu Yun,

579
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,030
don't blame me for not reminding you.

580
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,510
What happened?

581
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,750
That handsome, unrestrained,

582
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,880
young and promising Painter Tian comes.

583
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,750
He's talking with Zhu Yun

584
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,790
downstairs.

585
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,070
Did he come?

586
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,440
Do you mean Mr. Tian Xiuzhu?

587
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,790
It has nothing to do with you.

588
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,110
Calm down.

589
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,830
Zhu Yun doesn't like him.

590
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,160
Do I look good in this suit?

591
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,200
Well,

592
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,070
you look strange.

593
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,830
You're like Kung Fu Panda.

594
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,750
Can it show my temperament?

595
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,680
Well, what's the matter with you?

596
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,790
Won't you go?

597
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,000
If I knew you would ignore me after I helped you paint the posters,

598
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,920
I would do it slowly.

599
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,510
I'm too busy with my work.

600
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,750
I'll meet and have dinner with you

601
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,400
this weekend, okay?

602
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,750
I'd like to have foie gras too.

603
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,720
Don't kid me.

604
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,000
You're not free today?

605
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,750
I'm occupied today.

606
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,880
I'm also busy today.

607
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,030
Mr. Tian.

608
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,200
Mr. Tian, here you are.

609
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,590
Sorry to keep you

610
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,750
waiting so long.

611
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,720
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

612
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,750
Then let's go upstairs.

613
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,920
Okay. Please go upstairs. Please go upstairs.

614
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,750
Well, this way, please.

615
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,720
I'm going to work.

616
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,030
Don't bother me.

617
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,350
Let's go.

618
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,310
Mr. Tian.

619
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
What happened?

620
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,000
Why do they invite him?

621
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,070
This way, please.

622
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,310
Please.

623
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,000
Our boss happened

624
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,270
to go out today.

625
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,350
Let, let me introduce to you.

626
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,200
This is our project leader

627
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Li Xun.

628
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,640
We meet again.

629
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,240
Project Leader,

630
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,880
you'd better stand up now.

631
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,830
Hello.

632
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:33,750
Come on.

633
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,750
This way, please.

634
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,310
Come.

635
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,000
Come. This way, please.

636
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,790
Go to this room.

637
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,510
What will they talk about?

638
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,110
I'm more curious than you.

639
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,920
Did you invite Tian Xiuzhu?

640
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,110
Yes. Yes, I did.

641
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,840
Did you contact him privately?

642
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,480
You may think so.

643
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,550
How did you get his contact information?

644
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,150
I saw it from the plan

645
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,150
Project Leader Li gave me.

646
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,320
There's an email address

647
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,440
on the page of the art requirements.

648
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,760
Are you sure Project Leader Li asked you to invite him?

649
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,590
Yes, definitely.

650
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,920
What else did he say?

651
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,510
He also said...

652
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,440
He told Mr. Tian that

653
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,800
our company has a heavy task.

654
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,510
The art style of our project

655
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,590
hasn't been determined.

656
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,920
If it delays being determined,

657
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,400
it'll cause extra costs

658
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,070
and overtime

659
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,280
of all the staff,

660
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,920
including you.

661
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,480
Go to have your meeting.

662
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,840
Then I'll go.

663
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,550
Add little tea.

664
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,150
I got it.

665
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,070
Project Leader Li asked me

666
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,230
to forward the second version of the poster

667
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,510
painted by Tian Xiuzhu to him.

668
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,480
I thought he wanted to check the effect.

669
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,360
Oh, he actually played a deep game.

670
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,710
I wondered

671
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,190
why he gave up

672
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,800
the priceless art resources easily.

673
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,760
I think Mr. Tian came for the sake of you.

674
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,590
I also think so.

675
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,320
He was jealous last time,

676
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,800
but now he forgets the bygones.

677
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,590
Awesome.

678
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,710
Let me make a bet with you.

679
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,590
What's the bet?

680
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,000
If Project Leader Li can't prosper our company

681
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,630
within two years,

682
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,880
I'll gouge out my eyes myself.

683
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,110
No need.

684
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,320
They've had a long meeting.

685
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,670
What are they actually talking about?

686
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,190
Why haven't they ended it?

687
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,840
I think

688
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,840
he behaves normally.

689
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,320
Others may think

690
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,190
they're close workmates.

691
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,590
I'm off duty.

692
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,750
Well, Mr. Tian.

693
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,030
Slowly.

694
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,760
You must have had a long day.

695
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,840
No, it's you who have had a long day.

696
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,510
Yes. I've had a long day.

697
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,760
Let's go together. I'll have dinner with you.

698
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,320
You're occupied tonight, aren't you?

699
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,230
I asked for leave.

700
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,710
Let's go.

701
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,550
Go.

702
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,550
What did you say at the meeting today?

703
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,030
We discussed

704
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,590
the art style of the game

705
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,110
and he asked me to design the images

706
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,070
of several main characters.

707
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,190
Your game is really good.

708
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,030
It includes various scenes, characters

709
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,400
and settings of different times.

710
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,110
If players can experience all the story lines,

711
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,710
I guess they'll be deeply fond of it.

712
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,960
You're an artist.

713
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,190
Do you also like such games?

714
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,840
I'm an artist.

715
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,920
but I'm not a monk.

716
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,710
If I play a blind box-style game,

717
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,760
I'll never know

718
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,840
who will spend a journey

719
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,550
with me.

720
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,070
Don't you like such an experience?

721
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,800
I don't like it, nor am I interested in it.

722
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,840
Thank you.

723
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,110
Do you really have time to do it?

724
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,630
I promised him.

725
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,020
Even so, you can go back on your word as you didn't sign a contract.

726
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,320
Think it over, Zhu Yun.

727
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,920
What do you mean?

728
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,320
Your words

729
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,880
are very important to me.

730
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,440
Perhaps I may go back on your word

731
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,510
if you keep asking me not to help him.

732
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,920
Of course, I hope that

733
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,000
all the projects of our company are successes,

734
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,400
including the game "Blind Box of Love"

735
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,840
I don't like.

736
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,630
But I really

737
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,710
haven't reached the level of Li Xun.

738
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:00,880
What level?

739
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,320
I just don't want to bother you for some reason.

740
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,150
Zhu Yun,

741
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,960
you should understand that

742
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,400
I'm not helping him

743
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,550
but you.

744
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,000
I said

745
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,150
I want you to succeed.

746
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,360
Besides,

747
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,480
it's very simple for me.

748
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,480
The sooner you succeed,

749
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,030
the sooner we can leave here.

750
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,760
I don't want you to keep staying here.

751
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,920
We had a very tense meeting today.

752
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,230
Did he embarrass you?

753
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,760
No.

754
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,960
He's

755
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,710
very stubborn.

756
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,880
He just wants to vent his moods.

757
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,590
I don't want

758
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,440
to evaluate his behaviors.

759
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,320
I just want to express my own opinions.

760
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,550
I know

761
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,880
he's very persistent,

762
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,670
but I didn't expect

763
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,150
he's so strict with himself.

764
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,000
I think

765
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,230
he has a serious health problem.

766
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,880
He just works by strong will.

767
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,880
What's wrong with him?

768
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,030
It's not particularly serious.

769
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,590
He lacks rest.

770
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,150
He used to spend

771
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,230
little time on rest.

772
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,000
Do you prefer this life?

773
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,960
In fact,

774
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,510
we've spent as much time together

775
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,030
as you and him,

776
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,190
but there aren't any exciting stories.

777
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,360
I prefer a stable life.

778
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,400
Because I think

779
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,280
it's not easy

780
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,840
to live a safe and healthy life.

781
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,710
I'm going to France for an exhibition at the end of next year.

782
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,360
I hope you can go with me.

783
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,550
Xiuzhu.

784
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,230
Zhu Yun,

785
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,670
don't rush to answer me now.

786
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,590
We don't know

787
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,150
what will happen in the future.

788
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,150
Help yourself.

789
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,550
Eat more.

790
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:52,880
Okay.

791
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,960
Have you thought it well?

792
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,030
Zhu Yun.

793
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,760
Something big has happened.

794
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,230
The background system of our project Invincible General

795
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,590
was hacked.

796
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:25,960
Do you know him?

797
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,110
You know him, too.

798
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,440
If you do something wrong,

799
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,360
you will be punished.

800
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:37,080
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫

801
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,300
