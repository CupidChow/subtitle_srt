♫The person I used to be is gone♫

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,700
♫I no longer believed a person could save another♫

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,020

[Episode 4]

21
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,390
Hello.

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,600
Zhu Yun,

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,950
Li Xun has come for morning self-study.

24
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,040
What?

25
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,880
Where are you?

26
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,710
Whose coat are you wearing?

27
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,360
Mine.

28
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,230
What a fool.

29
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,830
Where did you go with Li Xun last night?

30
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,950
We didn't go anywhere.

31
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,550
But you stayed out all night.

32
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,440
But he attends the morning self-study.

33
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,560
Don't be nervous. We're not here for invigilation.

34
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,320
Don't worry.

35
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,470
Mr. Lin and I

36
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,830
are here for something

37
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,640
but not giving you a class.

38
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,390
Li Xun, tell them.

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,950
I've applied to our department

40
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,800
for establishing a digital practice base

41
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,830
for us students.

42
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,030
Led by Miss Zhang

43
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,470
and instructed by Mr. Lin,

44
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,150
this base

45
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,560
can work as the second classroom practice

46
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,320
and offer credits as an elective course.

47
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,080
During practice in the base,

48
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,000
you can be exempt from morning and evening self-study.

49
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,350
It's excellent.

50
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,880
We can be exempt from morning and evening self-study.

51
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,000
That's great.

52
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,800
How did you persuade him?

53
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,200
We even won't have morning and evening self-study.

54
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,830
You pleased him

55
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,320
but hurt us.

56
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,030
Be quiet. Be quiet.

57
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,320
Any problem?

58
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,640
Miss Zhang,

59
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,320
can students of other majors join it?

60
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Of course.

61
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,470
I add something.

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,760
Students of other majors can join it,

63
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,320
but we have requirements.

64
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,910
Only after passing the final exam can you gain credits.

65
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,710
As freshmen,

66
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,640
you should focus on study.

67
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,030
If you want to fulfill the learning task

68
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,800
by taking part in social practice,

69
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,800
your learning can't be affected.

70
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,390
That's all.

71
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,640
Go on with your self-study

72
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,470
and discuss it after class.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,710
Don't you think

74
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,240
Li Xun fights against our interest group by doing this?

75
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,800
Li Xun!

76
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Zhu Yun,

77
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,320
you dislike me so much?

78
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,560
Why didn't you knock at the door?

79
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,320
I don't need to ask for your approval

80
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,760
for returning to my dorm.

81
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,390
I didn't mean to throw it at you.

82
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,470
Who did you want to throw it at?

83
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,270
You dislike him so much that

84
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,320
you want to hurt his body.

85
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,270
Read this.

86
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,390
Sorry, Yun is sleeping.

87
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,440
Li Xun responded with your phone?

88
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,710
Bad. So bad.

89
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,150
Let me join you.

90
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,510
Infect my computer with virus!

91
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,680
Absent from morning self-study!

92
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,080
Die in the river!

93
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,320
Absent from morning self-study!

94
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,590
Reply messages for me!

95
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,760
Absent from morning self-study!

96
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,030
It seems that

97
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,510
Li Xun only offended me in this.

98
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Zhu Yun,

99
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,760
you two have many conflicts.

100
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,950
Be cautious.

101
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,560
Why?

102
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,320
Hate begets love.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
Impossible!

104
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,390
What do you think of the three-point shot this afternoon?

105
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,950
Cool.

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,510
-Let's go on playing another day. -OK.

107
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,200
Invite more players.

108
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes. Invite players of the university basketball team.

109
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,390
Even if it rains, we'll also play?

110
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,510
Men should play basketball in rainy days.

111
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,830
Li Xun,

112
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,350
you've never taken part in any activity.

113
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,080
Join us.

114
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,710
Play basketball with us.

115
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,640
I'm not interested in it.

116
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,350
You can't?

117
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,640
I can't.

118
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,800
I'm only good at one sport.

119
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:39,910
I see.

120
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,590
Men shouldn't

121
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,470
waste physical power in something meaningless.

122
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,350
Join us.

123
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,350
Let's go.

124
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,350
Li Xun,

125
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,560
the base was established

126
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,390
after you consulted with Mr. Lin, right?

127
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,320
Does it have anything to do with you?

128
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,000
Mr. Lin knows that

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,390
my interest group

130
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,030
is organized for mutual learning

131
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,120
and improvement.

132
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,640
You don't join it

133
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,440
but establish a base that

134
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,710
can offer credits instead.

135
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,120
Why did you have such a policy advantage?

136
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,030
It turns out that you care about this.

137
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,800
I want to compete with you fairly,

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,270
but you put pressure on us publicly in this way.

139
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,590
As university students,

140
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,080
we should do those meaningful

141
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,240
but not waste time.

142
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,120
I don't waste time.

143
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,830
If the interest group wastes time,

144
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,150
the base won't waste time?

145
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,590
You're being paranoid.

146
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,200
I mean,

147
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,880
don't waste time competing with me.

148
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,320
Li Xun,

149
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,630
you run your base,

150
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,680
and I organize my interest group.

151
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,990
We mind our own business.

152
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,320
I won't occupy your space,

153
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,590
and you can't poach my members.

154
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,520
Please yourself.

155
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,160
Zhu Yun,

156
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,110
have a look.

157
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,560
How is it?

158
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
I made it by using Java.

159
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,590
It looks simple

160
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,400
but is easy.

161
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,920
Let me show you its system architecture diagram.

162
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,830
Create a new Maven.

163
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,590
Based on POM,

164
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,830
Maven can

165
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,830
facilitate our management of project dependencies,

166
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,830
build projects and generate code documents.

167
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,200
After setting up some parameters...

168
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,710
After setting up some parameters,

169
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,520
we can get

170
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,320
a new project with perfect organizational structure.

171
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,080
Good, Gao.

172
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,950
You designed

173
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,160
a clear architecture in a short time.

174
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,630
Well, Zhu Yun,

175
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,470
I also searched

176
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,400
the CCPC.

177
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,520
An online contest of China Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC)

178
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,320
will be held every August.

179
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,710
We can't take part in the CCPC this year,

180
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,110
but we can be prepared for the next one.

181
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,320
Its prize is good

182
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,470
for studying abroad and postgraduate recommendation,

183
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,110
and we can exercise ourselves in it.

184
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,040
You think about much as a freshman.

185
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,160
You're foresighted.

186
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm used to thinking about much.

187
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,350
Zhu Guang,

188
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,870
do you have any talent?

189
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,920
No, I don't have any talent.

190
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,870
Li Wei, can you play any musical instrument?

191
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,520
No.

192
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,350
Play the piano?

193
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,350
I can't.

194
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,560
Violin? Or Erhu?

195
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,280
-No. No. -Monitor Fang,

196
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,680
can you be quiet for a while?

197
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,560
No.

198
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,520
Here is the classroom for interest group.

199
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,560
You can go somewhere else

200
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,520
to invite others for the performance.

201
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,520
Now that you can't help me, don't stop me.

202
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,590
I can program.

203
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,590
Can I perform it?

204
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,040
Stop to take a break.

205
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,200
This group only has a few members, but you've driven away all of them.

206
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,870
Students are no longer active in activities.

207
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,710
We just need to choose a performer for the welcome party,

208
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,870
but nobody signs up for it.

209
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,320
Why don't they have a sense of collective honor

210
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,470
in the university?

211
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,440
In high school,

212
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,560
we always actively

213
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,710
took part in all the activities.

214
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,830
During the sports meeting,

215
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,350
even many students ran

216
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,800
800-meter or 1,000-meter race.

217
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,800
At the art performance,

218
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,990
I even performed crosstalk on stage.

219
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,110
Crosstalk is good.

220
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,830
Can't you perform it?

221
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,590
You assist me?

222
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,470
Impossible.

223
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,710
Unreliable. Unreliable.

224
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,200
Did you ask Ren Di about it?

225
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,400
Of course.

226
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,830
We filled the student information sheet

227
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,470
when the university started.

228
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,800
You may find one after browsing it.

229
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,160
You're going to date?

230
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,830
I'm going to accompany the patient in the hospital.

231
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,590
Who?

232
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,280
Wu Mengxing.

233
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,230
I learnt from the information sheet that

234
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
some classmates

235
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,710
are Level 10 pianist

236
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,830
or Level 9 violinist,

237
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,280
but they told me that they haven't played for many years.

238
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,400
They're all unreliable.

239
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,200
Wu Mengxing

240
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,590
is incommunicative,

241
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,990
but he's good at playing a traditional musical instrument

242
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,400
and often gave performances.

243
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,200
He is awesome.

244
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,830
Would he like to perform on stage

245
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,280
after having an operation for appendicitis?

246
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,470
Only by exploiting himself

247
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,230
can he know how potential he is.

248
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,110
I'm leaving.

249
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,440
Wu Mengxing. Wu Mengxing.

250
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,080
Monitor,

251
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,320
why are you here?

252
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,560
Don't get up. Don't get up.

253
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,350
You, you sit.

254
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,800
How are you? Are you all right?

255
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,400
I'm all right.

256
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,920
Wu Mengxing,

257
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,710
you've been sick for some days,

258
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,870
but I didn't come to see you until now.

259
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,950
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,950
It doesn't matter.

261
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,320
Monitor, you're busy with class affairs.

262
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,440
I understand you.

263
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,800
I can take good care of myself.

264
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,470
Well, do you get better?

265
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,630
Can you leave hospital?

266
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,440
Almost.

267
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,200
I had an operation yesterday.

268
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,350
The doctor said that I can leave after discharging gas.

269
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,950
Discharge gas?

270
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,160
That is, fart.

271
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,040
How can you fart?

272
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,830
Do activities.

273
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,680
I see. Stand up.

274
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,920
Let me help you walk.

275
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,470
Now?

276
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,950
It doesn't matter. Go on walking.

277
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,040
You should tell me early.

278
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,400
You had an operation, but your families aren't here.

279
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,320
Don't stand on ceremony.

280
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,870
I can look after you.

281
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
You fart. You fart.

282
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,470
Now you've farted,

283
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,520
so you can leave hospital?

284
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,160
Don't worry, monitor.

285
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,470
I won't reduce our class attendance rate.

286
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,080
I'll apply for leaving hospital tomorrow.

287
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,280
It doesn't matter.

288
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,920
Take your time,

289
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,680
as long as you have a certificate for sick leave.

290
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,800
Wu Mengxing,

291
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,350
you develop yourself in an all-around way.

292
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,520
I know you can play a traditional musical instrument

293
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,080
and often gave performances.

294
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,830
What can you play?

295
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,750
Suona.

296
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,950
You, you're awesome.

297
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,750
Suona is the quintessence of Chinese culture.

298
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,750
Mengxing,

299
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,630
our department will have a welcome party next Monday.

300
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,560
Would you like to promote traditional culture

301
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,990
and play it in public?

302
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
I can't play it,

303
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
but my father can.

304
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,630
I can only sound it.

305
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,520
Why did you write that you often gave performances?

306
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,200
My father was invited to play it at weddings or funerals in our village,

307
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,750
so I just sounded the Suona

308
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,280
and served as a stopgap.

309
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,800
It doesn't matter.

310
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,710
Let's talk about it another day.

311
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,320
It's late.

312
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,080
I'm leaving.

313
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Have a good rest.

314
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,630
Monitor,

315
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,680
take care.

316
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,470
Why didn't my father teach me?

317
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,800
[Interest Group of Class 1 of the Computer Science Department]

318
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,470
Gao,

319
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,710
this is the Maven dependency

320
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,800
of Java web.

321
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,870
It indeed becomes simpler in this way.

322
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,200
And it also looks clean and tidy.

323
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,520
Old Lin told us

324
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,990
to simplify codes as far as possible.

325
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,680
After finishing this,

326
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,750
let's learn how to turn web into desktop program.

327
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,440
Fang Shumiao,

328
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,950
have you finished programming?

329
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,440
Fang Shumiao.

330
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,400
Fang Shumiao,

331
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,950
you're absent-minded.

332
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,800
You took to Wu Mengxing in the hospital?

333
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,800
Don't mention him to me.

334
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,520
You just came back from the hospital,

335
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,560
but he has become your enemy now?

336
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,950
Wu Mengxing looks honest

337
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,440
but is actually bad.

338
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,320
He told a lie.

339
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,870
He didn't give performances often

340
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,950
but just sounded the Suona

341
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,950
at weddings or funerals instead.

342
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,800
Traditional musical instrument playing

343
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,990
isn't true. He can't play the Suona at all.

344
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,750
When you needed him,

345
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,920
you thought highly of him,

346
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,560
but now you scold him.

347
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,560
Fang Shumiao, you're bad.

348
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,040
Yun, only you can help me.

349
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,080
Gao.

350
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,870
I think here should be modified, right?

351
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,320
Yes.

352
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,350
It's not simple enough.

353
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,440
Hello, everyone.

354
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,630
I'm Fang Shumiao from the Computer Science Department.

355
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,990
I'm Zhu Yun.

356
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,560
Today, we're going to perform crosstalk...

357
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,800
...to amuse you.

358
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,040
Zhu Yun,

359
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,230
facing so many audiences,

360
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,440
I ask you a question.

361
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:19,990
OK.

362
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,750
Have you ever gone to university?

363
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,630
Of course.

364
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,990
We're now in the university.

365
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,080
Thank you.

366
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,320
You've finished?

367
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,520
Isn't it funny?

368
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,160
Turn on your computers and learn now.

369
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,350
Don't waste time.

370
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,590
What do you mean?

371
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,320
Monitor Fang,

372
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,560
you've given a performance,

373
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,990
and we've also acted as the audiences.

374
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,990
It's time to get down to business.

375
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,950
Well, now that you watched our performance,

376
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,680
you should make an evaluation.

377
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,080
Do you want to know the truth?

378
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,560
If you don't want to defame our class,

379
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,320
don't perform it.

380
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,040
Just this?

381
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,720
You might as well ask Zhu Yun to touch her navel round her back.

382
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,240
Is our performance really so bad?

383
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,040
You performed very well.

384
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,240
What's the name of this performance?

385
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
You two created it?

386
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,630
I think it should be named living sculpture.

387
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Li Xun,

388
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,590
don't insult us.

389
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,590
Why don't you type your code on the roof

390
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,110
but come to make fun of us instead?

391
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,800
Don't you have self-knowledge?

392
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,350
You didn't

393
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,630
learn

394
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,630
but played house instead.

395
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,350
If you still do

396
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
such meaningless things in the university,

397
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,190
your interest group would better break up

398
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,960
to stop wasting time and resources.

399
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,870
Li Xun, we're classmates.

400
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,800
You shouldn't speak bitingly.

401
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,520
Yeah.

402
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,110
You're pretentious.

403
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,240
Now that you look down upon us,

404
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
why are you here?

405
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,190
Mr. Lin has agreed to

406
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,800
transferring here to our practice base,

407
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,040
so here will belong to us.

408
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
Why?

409
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,760
Stop.

410
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,870
We're indeed inferior to you.

411
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,830
We played house.

412
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,350
But, is it interesting to compete with us

413
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,080
for this territory?

414
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,430
Yes.

415
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,720
Welcome party?

416
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,320
You should give a performance at it.

417
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,630
Other performers will play musical instruments, sing or dance.

418
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,110
They're boring.

419
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,110
But if you stand on stage,

420
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,720
the audience may laugh directly.

421
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,190
It'll be very good.

422
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,960
I'll perform on stage.

423
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,390
Will you go to watch my performance?

424
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,560
You're inviting me?

425
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,590
You want me to go?

426
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,080
Immature.

427
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,190
Pupil.

428
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,040
Class cadres can get 20 points.

429
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,720
Excellent classes

430
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,520
will get extra 20 points.

431
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,190
Students who participate in the municipal first-level project

432
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,720
of social practice can get 50 points,

433
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,670
and the prize winners will get extra 50 points.

434
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,560
You haven't finished yet?

435
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,390
I just finished modifying a paragraph. I've sent it to you.

436
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,800
Zhu Yun, stop modifying.

437
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,150
I didn't report our program at all.

438
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,910
Our class quits this activity.

439
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,870
You can give up, but I won't.

440
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,110
I can turn it into a talk show.

441
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,910
Yun,

442
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,430
give up.

443
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,390
No.

444
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,150
I'll absolutely perform this talk show.

445
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,560
What's the function of this paper plane?

446
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,720
This is the theme of this freshmen's joint performance.

447
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,080
Take care. Take care.

448
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,000
Take good photos.

449
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,110
This girl plays the violin well.

450
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,830
She also looks good.

451
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,960
Yeah, she is pretty,

452
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,190
but maybe I can't conquer her heart.

453
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,800
Her heart doesn't want to be conquered by you, either.

454
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,560
I'm Zhu Yun from Class 1 of the Computer Science Department.

455
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,590
Since I was young, I've never liked my family name.

456
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,590
As we know...

457
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,150
OK?

458
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,040
Come on.

459
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,520
Thanks. Thanks you all.

460
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,760
Actually, I played it

461
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,870
for a boy.

462
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,900
[Freshmen's Joint Art Performance]

463
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,720
He just came here.

464
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,320
Li Xun from the Computer Science Department!

465
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,350
Maybe you don't know me,

466
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,720
but today I must tell you something.

467
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,630
I

468
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,870
always like you!

469
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,720
Express love?

470
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,320
Li Xun is here?

471
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,590
Yes, he is under the stage.

472
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,320
Li Xun should be blamed.

473
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,430
He shouldn't leave that girl alone.

474
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,520
If I'm fake, you're also fake.

475
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,800
Zhu Yun,

476
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,190
Li Xun is here.

477
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,670
Can you give up?

478
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,430
Come on.

479
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,910
Girls who learn music

480
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,720
are really extraordinary

481
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,190
and enthusiastic.

482
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,390
She was so brave and outspoken

483
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,040
in expressing her love.

484
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,720
Now,

485
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,520
let's welcome Zhu Yun from Class 1 of the Computer Science Department

486
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,830
to bring us a talk show.

487
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,430
Let's welcome her with applause!

488
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,910
Zhu Yun! Zhu Yun! Zhu Yun!

489
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,960
Hello, everyone.

490
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm Zhu Yun from Class 1 of the Computer Science Department.

491
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,960
Since I was young, I've never liked my family name.

492
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,350
As we know,

493
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,960
regardless of whether a girl is pretty or not,

494
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,830
as long as her family name is related to animals,

495
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,190
such as pig (zhu), sheep (yang) and cow (niu),

496
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,000
her name is vulgar.

497
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,080
My father dotes on me.

498
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,760
He has encouraged me since my childhood.

499
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,390
He even gave me a cute nickname,

500
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,240
Piggy.

501
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,830
"Piggy," he said,

502
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,590
"whatever you want,

503
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,480
I'll do my best to get it for you."

504
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,960
"Really, dad?"

505
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,190
"I want a dog." I replied.

506
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,910
"No way!" He said.

507
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm very happy in the university,

508
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,720
because single students (single dog) are everywhere.

509
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,630
One day, I saw an in-your-face ownerless dog

510
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,910
near the first canteen.

511
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,000
It has a golden coat.

512
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,630
It is said that it's very clever

513
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,040
and promising,

514
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,000
so I decided to keep it.

515
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,390
Now that I'd kept it,

516
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,390
I wanted to cultivate it

517
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,150
into a top dog.

518
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,560
I told the chef of the first canteen that

519
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,720
I wanted the dog at the gate.

520
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,520
Then the chef came out with a kitchen knife

521
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,480
and asked me whether I wanted a braised or steamed one.

522
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,240
I refused him and told him that

523
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,800
I wanted to send it to school

524
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,960
and cultivate it into a top dog.

525
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,630
The chef took a dislike to me.

526
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,150
He asked me

527
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,560
whether I was insane or not.

528
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,390
Regardless of whether I was insane or not,

529
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,320
I insisted on keeping this dog.

530
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,870
I wanted it to attend morning self-study.

531
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,240
I fondled and asked it

532
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,870
whether it

533
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,720
wanted to go to school.

534
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,390
Do you think it's useful to study in the morning?

535
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,760
Three chances.

536
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,040
If you make it, I'll attend the morning self-study.

537
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,190
Game over.

538
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,040
But it bit me.

539
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,520
You are so fake.

540
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,430
While I had myself vaccinated against rabies,

541
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,040
I thought about whether I fondled it in a wrong way or not.

542
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,630
I still went to see it the next day,

543
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,590
because I could have myself vaccinated against rabies,

544
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,870
but it couldn't have itself vaccinated against me.

545
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,830
Are you afraid to hand it in?

546
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,000
Afraid?

547
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,960
This seems to be a virus.

548
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,960
At the third time,

549
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,190
I specially brought it kebabs.

550
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,830
Do I have to give my heart to you

551
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,000
after eating ten of your lamb kebabs?

552
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,720
I…I didn't take my phone.

553
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,870
Open the door.

554
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,350
Hello, Zhu Yun is busy now.

555
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,240
OK. OK.

556
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,320
As you expect,

557
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,670
it ate my kebabs

558
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,150
but bit me again.

559
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,560
It's really ungrateful.

560
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,430
To achieve my goal,

561
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,110
I was going to brainwash it.

562
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,390
Since then,

563
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,080
I'd been calling it

564
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,080
genius, master or top dog.

565
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,480
It seemed to understand my meaning.

566
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,320
Once I call it top dog,

567
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,830
it kept wagging its tail

568
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,000
and was very happy.

569
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,590
Later,

570
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,080
everyone knows that

571
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:09,350
there is golden retriever named Top Dog in the Computer Science Department.

572
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,350
K.O.

573
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,350
After all, I'd paid so much sunk cost,

574
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,760
so I decided to educate it for the last time,

575
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,430
but it didn't appreciate what I did for it,

576
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,390
so I got angry.

577
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,040
I thought it might be better to raise a pig than keep it.

578
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,110
I should kill it.

579
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,430
I asked the chef to take it away angrily,

580
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,560
but after all,

581
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,150
it was a dog,

582
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,280
so I should rescue it.

583
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,630
I hurried to the first canteen,

584
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,630
but I saw this golden retriever faded in the pot

585
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,280
after opening the door.

586
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,350
It turns out that the golden retriever was just a rural dog.

587
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,430
It fell into the paint bucket

588
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,080
and was dyed golden,

589
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,320
but it finally restored its original appearance.

590
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,590
The chef muttered,

591
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,910
"It's just a rural dog."

592
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,760
After hearing this,

593
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,630
this dying rural dog immediately barked,

594
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,240
"Who are you scolding? I'm the top dog

595
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,870
but not a rural dog."

596
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,390
Thank you, I'm Zhu Yun.

597
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,630
Great! Great!

598
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,110
Great! Great!

599
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,430
Hi, dear students,

600
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,590
it's surprising that

601
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,080
the girl from the Computer Science Department...

602
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,390
What are they doing?

603
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,240
What's up?

604
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,670
Piggy,

605
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,190
it turns out that you keep an eye on me.

606
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,190
You don't have to keep an eye on me.

607
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,910
We can be together in the open.

608
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,020

609

You're awake.

619
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,040
Your phone always vibrated just now.

620
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,240
My Renren account has been flooded with messages.

621
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,190
It's not a big deal.

622
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,870
The post has been set to the top on the forum.

623
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,760
You go viral, Zhu Yun.

624
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,000
Piggy,

625
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,480
it turns out that you keep an eye on me.

626
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,630
Tell me the truth.

627
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,080
When were you with Li Xun?

628
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,280
You should be blamed for it.

629
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,000
I bravely gave myself up for you.

630
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You really gave yourself up?

631
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,240
Fang Shumiao, you want to be beaten?

632
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,480
As the saying goes,

633
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,080
only those who care about you keep an eye on you.

634
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,720
If you don't

635
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,390
take to Li Xun,

636
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,520
you don't keep an eye on him.

637
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,910
OK, I'm wrong.

638
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,480
Go wash your face and brush your teeth.

639
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,800
We need to attend class at 10 o'clock.

640
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,430
I'm about to take a bath.

641
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,280
I was so tired that I forgot to take a bath yesterday.

642
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,190
Fang Shumiao,

643
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,520
will I be recognized

644
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,830
if I go out?

645
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,520
You're not

646
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
a gossip female star,

647
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
so you won't be recognized.

648
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,240
Others are just interested in it momentarily

649
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,670
and will forget you soon.

650
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,350
You're awesome.

651
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,870
I heard that you've been with Li Xun.

652
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,350
Oh, no.

653
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,960
Even you, who seldom come back

654
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,910
know it.

655
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,520
Fang Shumiao,

656
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,760
go with me.

657
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,000
If you don't wear that piece of clothes,

658
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,320
nobody will recognize you.

659
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,080
Did you watch yesterday's video?

660
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,040
At the welcome party,

661
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,960
that girl from the Computer Science Department seemed to express love.

662
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,110
I even secretly searched her account for browse on Renren. com,

663
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,590
but I couldn't search that boy's account.

664
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,760
That video is really sweet.

665
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
And that boy is very handsome.

666
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,350
He seems famous.

667
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,480
His name is Li Xun, right?

668
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,870
-Yes. -He even called her Piggy

669
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,110
in a low voice.

670
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
So warm.

671
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,280
The love story of Piggy and ownerless dog

672
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,150
is sweet.

673
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,480
I ship them. I ship them.

674
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,080
I seem to have forgotten to bring my campus card.

675
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,960
Search for it again.

676
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,320
Girl,

677
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,590
I want to borrow your campus card.

678
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,110
I also forget to bring it.

679
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,000
Whose is this?

680
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,480
Zhu Yun.

681
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,590
Is this that girl of the Computer Science Department

682
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,040
who expressed love?

683
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,040
-She seems to be that girl. -She's really that girl.

684
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,150
Is it hot?

685
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,480
No, it's not hot.

686
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,870
Why were you so timid?

687
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,520
You'd been recognized.

688
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
Why did you escape?

689
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,830
My lie was exposed on the spot.

690
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,190
Of course I escaped.

691
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,760
What are you doing?

692
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,520
I'm about to issue a statement.

693
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,870
Why don't you invite some reporters

694
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,480
and launch a press conference?

695
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,150
It's useless to make explanation.

696
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,150
I just learned web programming yesterday

697
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,240
but apply it today.

698
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,720
How is it?

699
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,390
For the record,

700
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,320
what happened at the welcome party yesterday

701
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,830
is just for stage effect.

702
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,230
I'm still single.

703
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,040
Gao was right.

704
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,400
We students of applied technology need practices.

705
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,310
We may learn everything at a crucial time.

706
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,190
Zhu Yun!

707
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,190
That was just a part of my performance.

708
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,630
What I did was just for the stage effect.

709
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,750
I don't like Li Xun.

710
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,360
I won't be with him.

711
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,840
Are you satisfied?

712
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,670
Really?

713
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,520
Look.

714
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,520
I just issued a statement on Renren.com.

715
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,080
Can you believe me now?

716
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,920
Sorry,

717
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,630
I shouldn't anger you.

718
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,710
Zhu Yun,

719
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,080
you liar!

720
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,480
Is this really Li Xun?

721
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,750
Does he also use this software?

722
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
He'd do anything to play tricks on me.

723
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,960
Dear teachers and students,

724
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
this is the broadcast station of Nanhu University.

725
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,110
I'm Yuan Xiaoyun.

726
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,480
Good afternoon, everyone.

727
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,110
This noon, I'll host

728
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,480
the column "Free Speaking" for you.

729
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,710
If you have something

730
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,000
or worries to say,

731
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,400
welcome to contribute to Weibo

732
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,440
or official account of our broadcast station.

733
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,670
Now, please listen to

734
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,000
a piece of music.

735
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,480
Zhu Yun.

736
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,920
Piggy.

737
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,360
Xiaoyun, I want to contribute.

738
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,360
Hello, everyone.

739
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,310
We receive a special contribution,

740
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,190
and the contributor is sitting next to me.

741
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,750
She is Zhu Yun from Class 1 of the Computer Science Department.

742
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,480
Something always

743
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,840
troubles her these days,

744
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,190
so she wants to issue a statement

745
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,480
through our broadcast station.

746
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,840
Hello, everyone.

747
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,080
I'm Zhu Yun from Class 1 of the Computer Science Department.

748
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,310
At yesterday's welcome party,

749
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,920
I performed a talk show on behalf of our class,

750
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,960
but something happened

751
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,480
at the end of my talk show

752
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,750
made you misunderstand

753
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,440
my relationship with Li Xun.

754
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,840
Here, I want to tell you that

755
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,000
Li Xun was just my guest performer,

756
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,480
and we don't have any personal relationship.

757
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,630
I hope you can understand it.

758
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,440
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

759
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,230
Thank you.

760
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,960
Zhu Yun's statement is useful.

761
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,360
On the way to have a students' union meeting,

762
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,480
some even chased and asked me

763
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,230
whether Li Xun of our class has become single or not.

764
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,670
Congratulations, Piggy.

765
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,000
You almost clarify the fact.

766
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,400
Almost? Become?

767
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,880
I don't care.

768
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,400
Anyway, I'm relieved.

769
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,590
Fang Shumiao,

770
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,400
if I hear "Piggy" again,

771
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,480
I'll beat the speakers,

772
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,000
especially you.

773
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,670
It's strange.

774
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,000
Besides good grades,

775
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,710
what are Li Xun's other advantages?

776
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,480
Why do good girls

777
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,670
all like him?

778
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,840
Just because of his unique hair style and personality?

779
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,230
Zhu Yun,

780
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,480
I agree with you about making fun of him on stage.

781
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,960
Look.

782
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,480
What, what happened?

783
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,670
You clarified the fact?

784
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,480
Did his golden hair fade?

♫Have you ever changed?♫

791
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,080
That's all for today.

792
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,080
Class is over!

793
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,630
Let's have a talk.

794
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,920
It's bad to talk here.

795
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
They bickered.

796
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,560
I want to talk about something important.

797
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,480
Let's talk outside.

798
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,000
No need. Just talk here.

799
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,080
I'll finish soon.

800

In front of so many classmates?

801
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,560
You...

802
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,080
Go ahead.

803
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,840
Why did you make that comment on my page?

804
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,590
What?

805
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,360
Forget it.

806
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,040
Can't you assist me

807
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,190
in clearly explaining that

808
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,880
I'm not your girlfriend?

809
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,590
Why?

810
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,000
Why?

811
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,750
Now that you're not my girlfriend,

812
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,750
why do I help you?

813
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,710
You're glad about being watched by so many classmates, right?

814
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,400
Yes.

815
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,590
Who is your guest performer?

816
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,040
Did you ask me about it?

817
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,710
Li Xun, why did you dye your hair black?

818
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,080
You did so due to my words?

819
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,190
If my words hurt you,

820
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,040
I'm sorry.

821
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,190
We can take this opportunity

822
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,560
to make this matter clear together.

823
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,270
You're touchy-feely but cute.

824
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,400
What else do you want to do?

825
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,080
Issue another statement?

826
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,790
Do you know the more you explain,

827
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,440
the more we'll be misunderstood?

828
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,080
You're doing so,

829
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,190
and I'm involved.

830
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,360

Li Xun.

833
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,040
You dyed your hair black?

834
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,750
It looks better.

835
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,040
You asked me

836
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,310
not be so eccentric.

837
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,190
Yes.

838
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,360
Does he look better?

839
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,750
Good.

840
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,520
I'm telling you for the last time.

841
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,920
I'm not your guest performer.

842
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,360
It's not my duty to help you.

♫Cruel truth is revealed in the blink of an eye♫

853
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,340
♫Who is acting vigorously with the face masked?♫

854
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,980
♫Sad truth is uncovered in a trice♫

855
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,860
♫Presumptuously shout and laugh at me♫

856
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,380
♫Cruel truth is good or bad?♫

857
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,300
♫Who mourns for the silent solemnity with soul?♫

858
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,860
♫The definitions of love and hate have been blurred♫

859
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,840
Thank you.

860
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,960
Thanks you all.

861
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,560
We're Light Red Band!

862
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,000
How is our song?

863
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,790
I can't understand.

864
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,520
Would you like to invest in our band?

865
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,960
What will I get?

866
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,190
If you invest in our band,

867
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,710
you'll be our boss

868
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,310
and have the shares of our band.

869
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,750
The shares of your band?

870
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,480
When our band makes profits,

871
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,270
the profits will be allocated to you at the agreed rate.

872
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,590
OK.

873
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,710
Really?

874
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,670
Of course.

875
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,230
Do I need to pay a deposit today?

876
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
It's a deal.

877
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,960
Mr. Li,

878
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,400
feel free to request any song that you want to listen to!

879
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
We'll only work for you today.

880
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,310
Why are you here?

881
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,560
I don't want to go on listening.

882
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,040
Do our songs sound so bad?

883
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,590
Don't get me wrong.

884
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,590
I'll definitely invest in your band.

885
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,790
I just didn't want to waste time inside.

886
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,670
Listening to our songs is a waste of time.

887
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,560
Isn't your current behavior a waste of time?

888
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,310
Please respect

889
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,960
the fund source of your Light Red Band.

890
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,880
You earn so much money by doing this?

891
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,190
You shouldn't go to university.

892
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,590
If I were you, I would have dropped out.

893
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:05,150
Anyway, you neither attend self-study

894
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,270
nor do homework.

895
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,880
I neither do homework nor attend self-study

896
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,080
because they're

897
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,400
very easy for me.

898
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,750
I don't want to do anything meaningless.

899
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,190
I've established a practice base.

900
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,560
You can join it.

901
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,670
I specially applied for establishing it to our department.

902
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,190
You can gain credits and absent yourself from morning self-study.

903
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,590
It's good for you.

904
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,590
That's why you

905
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,840
dyed your hair black?

906
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,590
I need to slightly respect Mr. Lin.

907
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,150
Gosh,

908
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,750
it's amazing.

909
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,920
Li Xun is going to be a good boy.

910
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,880
I thought

911
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,750
you did so due to Zhu Yun.

912
00:43:59,480 --> 00:43:59,960
♫I pass by the world♫
Your base

913
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,630
♫I pass by the world♫
has seriously affected our interest group.

914
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,080
This classroom is for our base.

915
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,360
You'd better dismiss your interest group.

916
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,400
♫And pass through the night♫
You are nobody.

917
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
♫And pass through the night♫
Don't look down upon us.

918
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,310
Do you dare make a bet?

919
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,630
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
If Gao and I get better C language scores

920
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,400
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
than you,

921
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,750
your practice base must be

922
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,310
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
incorporated into our interest group,

923
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:14,710
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
and you listen to us.

924
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,480
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
What if you lose?

925
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,860
♫It's the intuition of the dream♫

926
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,580
♫That breaks through the boundary♫

♫Stay with me from the hustle and bustle♫

933
