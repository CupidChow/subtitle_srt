Blue Crown's project is also yours.

26
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,510
You have the right to give it away.

27

Are you a waste?

31
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,880
You'll die if you pick it up?

I think although

Zhang Xiaobei has gone a bit far in this matter,

35
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,670
Li Xun's handling method is not wrong.

36
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,510
Zhang Xiaobei is backed by

37
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,230
a large enterprise that cooperates with the school.

38
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,280
What can you do?

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,790
Give up Blue Crown's project?

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,000
Then why should we give up?

41
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,670
If you don't want to give up,

42
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,000
just accept the reality.

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,000
You and Li Xun are really like birds of a feather.

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,910
I'm much more realistic than him.

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,670
If I meet Zhang Xiaobei,

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,510
I would collude with her.

47
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,560
I would pretend to cooperate with her first.

48
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,510
After I get what I want,

49
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,840
I'll squeeze her out.

50

In this world,

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,400

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,720
Even if it's a small sum of money,

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,840
some will struggle for it.

That guy is afraid of nothing.

57
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,190
He becomes a coward suddenly.

58
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,280
But he still puts on airs.

59
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,070
Why are you so angry?

60
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,910
You're not angry for this, right?

61
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,000
You feel sorry for Li Xun?

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,440
For him?

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,750
Since ancient times, infatuated women

64
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,040
are always hurt by ruthless men.

65
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,160
Have you ever thought about

66
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,750
why Li Xun agreed so simply?

67
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,670
He is afraid of offending Zhang Xiaobei.

68
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,560
He fears.

69
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,640
Do you think Li Xun is that kind of person?

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,230
He is different from us.

71
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
He always knows his goal.

72
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,870
So he

73
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,760
never mourns spring or feels sad for autumn.

74
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,550
He will give up things that are not worthwhile.

76

we don't understand,

77
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,200
that must be because his way

78
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,870
is more efficient and better.

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,360
What's wrong with my schedule?

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,480
Piggy. Piggy.

173
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,880
I'm so jealous of you.

174
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,590
What happened to me?

175
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,950
But Li Xun was too brave.

176
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,710
I think Li Xun treats you differently.

177
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,950
I don't think so.

178
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,590
He must be afraid of trouble.

179
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,830
He's afraid Zhang Xiaobei will find something to torture you again,

180
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,120
thus delaying the project progress.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,910
He shouldn't have hacked the website.

182
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,880
Li Xun is writing inspection in the department now.

183
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,910
Miss,

184
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,520
understand it yourself.

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,430
I won't say anything more.

186
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,880
Or I will

187
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,400
feel more jealous.

188
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,000
Fang Shumiao.

189
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,480
You know what?

190
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,830
We are now tortured by Zhang Xiaobei.

191
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,120
But the poorest one

192
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,480
is Li Xun.

193
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,550
The project he has worked hard on

194
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,040
is occupied by others.

195
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Now Zhang Xiaobei is the project leader

196
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,590
and Han Jiakang is the team leader.

197
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,670
And Li Xun

198
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,400
has no trace left.

199
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,190
Zhang Xiaobei

200
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,190
even robs the position of the project leader?

201
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah.

202
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,710
When the project is signed finally,

203
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,400
what last position will Li Xun be ranked?

204
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,950
Let me figure it out.

205
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,430
How many people have come from the School of Graduate?

206
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,670
Who does Zhang Xiaobei think she is?

207
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,070
She came here to show off her authority.

208
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,280
Yeah. Why should we just listen to her?

209
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,310
Isn't Li Xun very resourceful?

210
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,190
Yeah.

211
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,480
Why didn't he respond?

212
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,790
I think Li Xun will have a way.

213
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,190
You man

214
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,310
just like the last bidding,

215
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,640
he must leave a way out?

216
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,280
The brain circuit of genius is different from ours.

217
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,120
This kind of enduring hardships and humiliation

218
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,480
and then defeating enemy

219
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,480
sounds very exciting.

220
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,160
I'll have a drumstick.

221
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,310
What's up, senior?

222
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,190
Can you send me

223
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,040
a copy of the written project description for bidding?

224
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,790
Senior.

225
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,400
You are now the team leader.

226
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,480
It's not difficult to write a project description, right?

227
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,710
Didn't you also participate in the bidding?

228
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,880
Does Zhang Xiaobei want it?

229
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,550
I won't send it unless you tell me.

230
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,790
It's Zhang Xiaobei.

231
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,950
She's going to give an interview

232
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,640
about...

233
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,480
About our project.

234
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,000
Did Li Xun know it?

235
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,360
Why?

236
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,190
She doesn't even know what the project is.

237
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,480
She doesn't know

238
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,430
the BIOS.

239
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,520
Why does all the credit go to her?

240
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,590
This project is Li Xun's.

241
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,400
Who knows who Li Xun is?

242
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,120
What do you mean?

243
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Zhang Xiaobei is backed by Xinchuang.

244
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,240
She is young,

245
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,430
but she can be a project director of one of the top 500 enterprises.

246
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,360
She's worth an interview.

247
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,590
What about Li Ji?

248
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,760
He is just a college student.

249
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,070
No one knows him once getting outside school.

250
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,910
Who cares how great he is?

251
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,040
Who cares who he is?

252
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,070
Who cares how much he pays for

253
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:29,950
and how many nights he stayed for this project?

254
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,430
Who cares

255
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,120
if this project is robbed by others?

256
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,190
You didn't participate in the bidding of Blue Crown

257
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,710
from start to finish, right?

258
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,190
As for Li Xun's matter,

259
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,160
I care.

260
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,670
You are back?

261
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,670
You have a week left

262
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,830
for the green part.

263

[Completion Schedule of Blue Crown Group's Project]

264
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,040
This part hasn't been started yet?

265
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,760
This is your task.

266
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,280
What if I don't come back?

267
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,120
You're so sure I'll be back?

268
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,790
Do you dare?

269
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,710
Say what you want.

270
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,000
Li Xun.

271
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,240
You'll find a way out, right?

272
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,520
Zhang Xiaobei bullied you like that.

273
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,710
You won't be unresponsive.

274
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,670
You must do something as you did in the last bidding.

275
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,240
Are you ready to fight back?

276
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,710
What do you mean?

277
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,190
Just tell me what you're thinking about.

278
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,400
Finish the Blue Crown's project as soon as possible

279
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,550
to get rid of trouble.

280
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,240
Is it a good idea?

281
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,910
Zhu Yun, do you know?

282
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,200
At the very beginning,

283
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,680
everything only

284
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,550
goes as it really is.

285
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,310
The later on it is, the further it goes.

286
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,630
But it is still worth our efforts.

287
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,110
We work hard

288
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,960
just to keep it from going further

289
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,040
Am I right?

290
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,480
You're right about everything.

291
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,350
You can complain.

292
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,520
Don't think about a solution.

293
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,520
If you want to quit,

294
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,630
never come back again.

295
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,870
The formalities have been completed?

296
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,870
I've given them to the teaching secretary.

297
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,480
I'm free finally.

298
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,720
Base, Blue Crown's project, Zhang Xiaobei,

299
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,920
goodbye.

300
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,000
From today on, I'm finally free.

301
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,310
You're in such a hurry?

302
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,110
People should have self-knowledge.

303
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,070
Since the first professional class,

304
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,480
I knew

305
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,310
I can't rely on computers to earn a living.

306
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,760
To me,

307
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,310
I work in the base because I want to earn credit

308
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,150
and leave a good impression in the department.

309
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,630
Then you've got your wish.

310
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,960
Li Xun gave you the highest score.

311
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,000
So

312
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,550
I actively leave fast

313
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,720
to stop holding you back.

[Zhang Xiaobei: The navigation bar's color is not right.]
I've changed the navigation bar's color

316
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,150
[Zhang Xiaobei: The navigation bar's color is not right.]
for five times.

317
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,520
[Zhang Xiaobei: The navigation bar's color is not right.]
Damned Zhang Xiaobei!

318
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,440
Actually, Zhang Xiaobei knows nothing.

319
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,550
You can still muddle through.

320
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,760
She may be too picky

321
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,110
about the website's appearance.

322
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,550
Zhu Yun, come here.

323
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,680
She has no public morality.

324
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,920
I just thought again.

325
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,680
I don't think our fonts look good now.

326
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,550
I would like the one that is popular this year.

327
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,870
The one in metallic quicksand gold.

328
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,520
But our background is white.

329
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,720
Gold and white too close, which will be blur.

330
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,040
Then change the background.

331
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,790
It's not that simple.

332
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,760
At the early stage,

333
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,440
we've made many plug-ins.

334
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,110
To change the background, we need to overwrite the previous plug-ins.

335
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,310
Change it.

336
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,680
But it will affect the whole project.

337
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,310
If the previous plug-ins need to be changed,

338
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,680
a lot of data will be wrong.

339
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,960
Everyone has to follow suit.

340
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,870
These should be

341
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,150
what you think about.

342
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
Keep improving when doing things.

343
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,440
If you just make ordinary things

344
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,760
from the beginning,

345
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,920
in the end,

346
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,440
a slightest mistake may cause a big failure.

347
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,680
That's it.

348
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,110
Please draw a picture for me tonight.

349
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,870
I would like to have a look first.

350
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,760
Today?

351
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,200
Is it difficult to draw a picture?

352
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,240
Okay.

353
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,070
I'm so angry.

354
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Calm down.

355
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,110
Remember her license plate number.

356
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,350
Stab her tire.

357
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,760
It makes sense.

358
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,610
[Zhang Xiaobei]

359
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,390
Stick it for me.

360
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,760
Hello, Miss Zhang.

361
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,870
Zhu Yun.

362
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,760
As for the navigation bar...

363
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,830
This is a good idea.

364
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,350
So annoying.

365
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,110
Within only a few days,

366
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,590
I've already drawn five drafts of the design.

367
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,350
I change the font and navigation bar color

368
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,920
again and again.

369
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,240
She is so annoying.

370
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,240
Li Xun.

371
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,280
Why don't you assign me other projects?

372
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,480
As long as you can save me,

373
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,760
I can do anything.

374
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,390
No other projects.

375
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,870
Stay honestly.

376
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,590
Zhu Yun.

377
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,240
Are you listening, Zhu Yun?

378
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,440
I am here.

379
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,350
What else is wrong?

380
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,630
Just tell me and I will change it.

381
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,000
Well, I think

382
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,790
the first draft is better.

383
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,110
What's your opinion?

384
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,240
Just say it's good

385
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,070
when I design the first draft!

386
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,790
Now it's the fifth draft. You say the first draft is good!

387
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,590
Why did you ask me to change it again and again?

388
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,440
Turn off the mute mode and curse her is you have the guts.

389
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,070
Zhu Yun.

390
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,520
Please finish

391
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,310
the design drawing today.

392
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,550
Didn't you say to use the first edition?

393
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,590
The first version's basic framework can be used.

394
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,390
But I want the fonts of the second edition.

395
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,070
I think the border

396
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,790
of the fourth edition is the best.

397
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,790
Well,

398
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,760
just mix them together.

399
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,280
This should not be difficult, right?

400
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,240
It isn't hard?

401
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,390
Do it yourself if so!

402
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,760
Miss Zhang.

403
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,920
Blue Crown called me today.

404
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,790
Why didn't they call me?

405
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,870
They intend to come

406
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,920
to learn the progress on Monday.

407
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,200
Zhu Yun.

408
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,480
How long will it take to change it?

409
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,830
At least three days.

410
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,280
Let's keep it first.

411
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,520
Then I will follow the current one?

412
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,760
Okay.

413
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,040
Thanks.

414
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,280
Don't forget to help me.

415
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,830
You are so realistic.

416
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,070
Mr. Chen.

417
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,550
Compared with those payment designs,

418
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,960
and product list design,

419
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,070
actually our biggest

420
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,390
innovation is this one.

421
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,310
You can have a try.

422
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,520
How is it?

423
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,630
Is it interesting?

424
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,240
This is called micro interaction

425
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,390
or micro motion effect.

426
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,590
[Multi-person conversation (3 persons) Zhu Yun: My God. She has talked about the micro interaction for so long. She really only knows whether the website looks good or not.]
It is hot now in foreign websites.

427
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,720
[Multi-person conversation (3 persons) Zhu Yun: My God. She has talked about the micro interaction for so long. She really only knows whether the website looks good or not.]
My God.

428

[Multi-person conversation (3 persons) Zhu Yun: My God. She has talked about the micro interaction for so long. She really only knows whether the website looks good or not.]
She has talked about the micro interaction for so long.

429
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,150
[Multi-person conversation (3 persons) Zhu Yun: My God. She has talked about the micro interaction for so long. She really only knows whether the website looks good or not.]
She really only knows whether the website looks good or not.

430
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,870
Even the small mouse,

431
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,110
pop-up box

432
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,200
and product drawings

433
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,390
are very interesting.

434
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,070
It's simple and easy to use.

435
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,590
I promise

436
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,790
every user who enters

437
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,870
will like it.

438
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,960
And recently I did some market research.

439
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,070
Our website now

440
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,440
is the first large-scale one with the use of thus design.

441
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,110
As for some follow-up

442
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,790
issues in system updating and maintenance,

443
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,870
you can ask your men

444
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,680
to contact Han Jiakang directly.

445
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,550
We will be responsible to the end.

446
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
Okay. I think it's good.

447
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,200
I have something else to talk with Mr. Chen.

448
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,070
You go back first.

449
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,310
All right, Miss Zhang.

450
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,040
We can leave now.

451
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,110
Do you have any additional suggestions?

452
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,110
No for the time being.

453
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,150
It's all her credit again.

454
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,960
The project has been completed.

455
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
It's my treat tonight.

456
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,070
Let's go.

457
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,240
It's Team Leader Li's treat.

I have new projects.

00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,680
We can't finish my topic.

467
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,590
She won't let me graduate if I can't finis it.

468
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,390
I see.

469
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,070
I have been a graduate student for three years.

470
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,590
My senior has studied for four years.

471
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,110
Since the first year of graduate school,

472
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,630
we have been working on projects for Zhang Xiaobei.

473
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,150
My senior can't finish his paper at all

474
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,200
because Zhang Xiaobei doesn't give him the data.

475
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,310
She prevents him deliberately

476
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,870
from graduating.

477
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,870
My senior works for her

478
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
for a whole year

479
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,790
and earns only 800 yuan.

480
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,830
It was because he asked her for payment.

481
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,720
Well, if you don't want to do it, don't do it.

482
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,240
It's not that easy.

483
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,760
She's from Xinchuang

484
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,790
and has a good relationship with the school.

485
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,680
We students

486
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,390
don't dare to offend her.

On the day of explaining,

491
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,920
we didn't have anything.

492
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,960
It wasn't until that day did we know what project was.

493

the person in charge of Blue Crown after we left.

495

I can vouch for it with my head.

♫What hides behind the deep fear♫

508
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,120
♫Love and hate are reversed♫

509
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,720
♫Forgotten stories Days covered with dust♫

510

♫Time is waiting for me like amber♫

♫The reflected world makes a knot in the heart♫

512
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,960
♫How could love be inexplicable♫

513
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,320
♫Cruel truth is revealed in the blink of an eye♫

♫Sad truth is uncovered in a trice♫
everything only

We work hard

528
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:37,000
♫The definitions of love and hate have been blurred♫
just to keep it from going further.

529
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,390
It's, it's really okay?

530
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,480
It is OK.

531
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,630
Leave us alone.

532
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,520
Don't worry.

533
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,310
Sounds good.

534
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,790
Amazing.

535
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,760
Be careful.

536
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,720
Wang,

537
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,830
well,

538
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,440
can I borrow your car?

539
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,070
What?

540
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,040
I didn't allow you

541
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,960
to sing here,

542
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,920
so you want to blackmail my cart?

543
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,310
Not at all.

544
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,310
Then I will drive that goods away.

545
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,480
I'll send the cart back to you later.

546
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,480
Goods?

547
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,390
What goods?

548
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,870
Ren Di.

549
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,790
You sing well.

550
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,430
You're gonna strangle me.

551
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,720
Why are you drunken like this?

552
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,520
You ordered Island Iced Tea.

553
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,920
I just ordered one cup.

554
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,760
She had five cups.

555
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,550
Let's go back to the dorm.

556
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,350
But it's 2:00 a.m. now.

557
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,960
Or go to my place.

558
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,110
You lead the way.

559
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,440
Okay, I'll push it.

560
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,070
I pull the cart, you hold her.

561
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,040
Okay.

562
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,040
Li Xun, what are you doing?

563
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,310
Pulling a cart.

564
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,000
Are you a cow? Why do you pull a cart?

565
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,630
Shut up.

566
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,480
What a strong wind.

567
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,150
What a strong wind!

568
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,520
Are you sober?

569
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,310
Come down and walk on your own if you're sober.

God, come on.

612
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,200
Drink some water.

613
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,280
Are you feeling better?

614
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Where am I now?

615
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,240
This is my studio.

616
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,630
Where's Li Xun?

617
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,720
Li Xun is in his room.

618
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,680
He has his own room?

619
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,590
Yeah.

620
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,790
Usually he stays at the base.

621
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,240
Sometimes he comes here if it's late.

622
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,150
He, he's still sleeping at the base?

623
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,150
No, he sleeps here.

624
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,440
I forgot to tell you.

625
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,590
He's my investor.

626
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,760
You were curious

627
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
about our relationship, right?

628
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,000
That's what it means.

629
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
He's the investor I brought in.

630
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,520
You know what?

631
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,480
In my place,

632
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,230
Li Xun has a suite.

633
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,750
I have only one bed here.

634
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,000
So later, if you need to go to the bathroom,

635
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,550
go out,

636
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,400
go out of this door

637
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
and turn right to the end.

638
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,040
Okay?

639
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,230
Then I'm going to bed.

640
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,320
Here.

641
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,710
Here's the water.

642
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,270
Get some sleep.

643
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,670
So heavy.

644
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,590
Put your legs down.

645
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,670
Get up.

646
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,480
Let go.

647
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,750
Let go.

648
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,190
This way, this way.

649
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,230
Wipe yourself with it and throw it away.

650
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,190
This is not Ren Di's room?

651
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,630
Get out.

652
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,520
What are you doing?

653
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,880
Can I help you?

654
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,920
No.

655
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,750
Let me have a look.

656
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,590
It's none of your business.

657
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,070
Go to sleep.

658
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,480
Okay.

659
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,590
I shut up.

660
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,320
I'm leaving.

661
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,880
It's weird.

662
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,920
The project is completed.

663
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,800
What does he write?

664
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,920
Blue.

665
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,920
Blue Crown.

666
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,000
What project are you working on?

667
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,920
You want to hide it from us? Tell us.

668
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,400
Lower your voice. Tell me.

669
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,040
Shut up. What are you doing?

670
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,480
Shut up.

671
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,190
Blue Crown, right?

672
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,150
Shut up. Shut up.

673
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,190
Shut up.

674
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,270
Tell me, tell me.

675
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,230
Shut up. Shut up.

676
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,150
Shut up. You shut up first.

677
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,440
Why do you look like a maniac after drinking a little wine?

678
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,040
Don't change the subject.

679
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,750
What is it?

680
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,840
Why do you talk all day long?

681
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,070
You are inquiring from morning till night.

682
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,630
What on earth is it?

683
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,710
Are you sober now?

684
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,630
I'm so sober

685
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,750
that I can immediately make a set of college entrance examination paper.

686
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:25,840
OK.

687
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,270
Check it yourself.

688
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:35,880
The main functions of this system...

689
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,960
Keep quite.

690
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,270
I can watch it myself.

691
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,750
I can understand your codes now.

692
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,920
I won't be confused by it.

693
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Just tell me.

694
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,670
What are you doing this for?

695
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,630
For sale.

696
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,840
For sale?

697
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,150
Blue Crown's website is out of date.

698
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,110
We can't make money from it.

699
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,590
Why didn't

700
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,840
you tell them if so?

701
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,590
If I told them,

702
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,840
what would I earn?

703
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,550
There are so many shopping websites

704
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,670
and many large platforms now.

705
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,710
Blue Crown produces and sell products by itself.

706
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,400
Their website has no characteristics.

707
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,040
Why would customers access their website and buy goods?

708
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,920
They don't even know their advantages

709
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,230
but just follow the trend.

710
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,920
Is money so easy to earn?

711
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,750
What are you writing now?

712
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,110
Mobile Health App.

713
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,070
With the rise of smart phones,

714
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,800
applications are the trend.

715
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,040
So you lied to us?

716
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,800
Didn't you always say I should have two strings to my bow?

717
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,150
But you guessed it right.

718
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,320
There are only a few good projects.

719
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,710
If you don't fight for it, it'll be taken over by others.

720
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,710
She wanted me to give in to her?

721
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,800
Impossible.

722
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,040
What we did before is futile?

723
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,800
Then you could tell us.

724
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,360
We can make this app together.

725
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,360
There are many ways to solve things.

726
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,440
Now that I can do better,

727
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,550
and you can also use that project

728
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,230
to sort out the process

729
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,550
and increase experience,

730
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,480
there is no need to waste time.

731
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,190
When Zhang Xiaobei finds out that she has been fooled by me,

732
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,670
she will never let me go easily.

733
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,880
You don't care about us, right?

734
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,520
Of course I'm not worried.

735
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,400
But you're too annoying.

736
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,840
And you're meddlesome

737
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,710
and have wishful thinking,

738
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,750
which affects me.

739
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,920
When did I affect you?

740
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,440
Zhu Yun.

741
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,000
I'll explain this only once.

742
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,670
If you get angry again,

743
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,630
I...

744
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,750
I won't please you.

745
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,590
♫I pass by the world♫
Li Xun.

746
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,820
♫I pass by the world♫
You played a dirty move?

747
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,550
You were expelled from Linyang No. 8 Middle School.

748
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,820
♫And pass through the night♫
There is a punishment record in your archives.

749
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,520
If you apologize to me now,

750
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,440
it's not late.

751
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,260
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
There is no point in fighting against me.

I don't understand what you mean.
