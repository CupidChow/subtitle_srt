Take off you coat.

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,830
What's wrong?

Where is my lighter?

25

I'll look for it.

Excuse me.

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,070
Have you seen a small

golden lighter?

31
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,600
Lighter?

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,400
No.

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,280
This is my phone number.

34
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,670
Call me if you see the lighter.

35
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,470

Thank you.

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,440
Not at all.

38
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,880
I can't find it.

39
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,670
But I told them to call me

40
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,400
if they find it.

43
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,790
Perhaps I can find it.

44
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,790
Never mind.

45
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,510
Let's go.

46
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,790
Hello.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,350
You found it?

48
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,720
What are you doing?

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,840
It's not your fault.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,910
Sorry.

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,600
I shouldn't have selected volleyball class for you on my own.

52
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,120
I just wanted you to do more exercise.

53
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,880
You didn't expect that it almost killed me.

54
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,880
Ask what you want.

55
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,120
Does this lighter mean a lot to you?

56
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:08,670
Yes.

57
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,600
You don't smoke,

58
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,750
but you always take it with you.

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,200
Who gave it to you?

60
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,040
My dad left it.

61
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,840
He died in a car accident

62
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,230
when I was very young.

63
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,670
When I was in high school,

64
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,960
we were going to sell our house

65
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,520
and I found it under my wardrobe.

66
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,790
My mom said,

67
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,760
my dad was a truck driver.

68
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,080
He was a heavy smoker.

69
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,870
When I was just born,

70
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,990
he asked my mom to hide the lighter

71
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,110
somewhere he couldn't find,

72
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,600
so he couldn't smoke at home

73
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,080
when he wanted.

74
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,310
Later to make more money,

75
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,840
he engaged in long-distance transport.

76
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,910
However, he was killed on site

77
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,720
in a car accident.

78
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,670
That's why I always take it with me.

79
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,160
I think it is

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,990
god's arrangement that my dad left the lighter to me,

81
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,870
like an agreement between us.

82
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,600
Now that he was gone,

83
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,870
I should take care of my mom and sister for him.

84
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,840
But I failed.

85
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,430
My mom is gone.

86
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,350
My sister married a bastard,

87
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,080
leading a miserable life.

88
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,600
Sorry.

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,280
It's old.

90
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,910
Perhaps

91
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,400
my dad wants to smoke.

92
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,110
It caught a virus?

93
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,110
This is the game?

94
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,840
What is this?

95
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,310
Exercises for Fundamental Principles of Marxism.

96
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,110
C

97
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,280
Game over.

98
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,190
Don't be so brutal.

99
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,790
You designed this?

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,070
If you fail in the exam,

101
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,710
don't shift the blame on the base.

102
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,480
The question bank is here.

103
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,280
You designed it for me?

104
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,520
I just did it for practice.

105
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,590
I can design a dozen of such things.

106
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,040
Get over yourself.

107
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,280
The game ended as soon as it began.

108
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,520
How did you enter our university?

109
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,910
Good morning.

110
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,830
Good morning.

111
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,590
You stayed up late again?

112
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,430
There are still recipes?

113
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,070
Yes.

114
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,640
I added it last night.

115
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,910
I think sometimes compulsory recommendation of products

116
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,590
will have a negative effect.

117
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,480
So I added a function of introducing dietotherapy

118
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,520
to make our software

119
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,830
look more friendly.

120
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,000
Even if they don't buy at ordinary times,

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,040
they can also come and have a look.

122
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,280
I think it's a way to keep customers.

123
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,790
Pretty good.

124
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,640
What do you want to say?

125
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,120
Did you do it all by yourself?

126
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,830
Can you do it?

127
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,640
Blue Crown will check the finished product next Friday.

128
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,480
We can't make money until we pass it.

129
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,670
Look at the schedule

130
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,670
and new arrangements.

131
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,000
I also need to solve the problem of high concurrency?

132
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,640
I've almost finished it.

133
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,670
You optimize it again.

134
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,040
How long will it take?

135
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,480
Is this necessary?

136
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,590
You piled so many codes.

137
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,910
How many users can it withstand?

138
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,310
It will collapse if a large number of users log in.

139
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,160
Blue Crown doesn't have many users.

140
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,710
If you just kept

141
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,240
such an idea of few users,

142
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,950
you wouldn't think it would explode.

143
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,710
We don't focus on future.

144
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,160
According to our current design,

145
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,310
the program won't crash

146
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,430
until 200,000 users

147
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,520
simultaneously access the server.

148
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,000
Considering the current popularity of Blue Crown,

149
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,790
how can he find 200,000 users?

150
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,760
I don't think we should waste too much effort on it.

I always listen to you.

155
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,710
You've suffered when you didn't listen to me.

156

I know this is your project.

159

I don't have a say in it.

160
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,360
But I don't want to waste my effort,

161
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,550
my time and energy.

162
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,360
Whatever.

163
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,040
Enough.

164
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,710
Can you two stop for a while?

165
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,120
Li Xun.

166
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,910
You don't have to take a test, but others have to take it.

167
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,760
Gao,

168
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,640
go back and review first.

169
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,520
I'll help you finish it.

170

171
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,520
I will complete my task.

172
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,430
But that doesn't mean I agree with you.

173
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Review your knowledge.

174
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,040
Eat this.

175
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,160
You're not used to not having a lighter?

176
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,910
I'll get used to it.

177
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,160
Give me the lighter later.

178
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,190
I'll study it.

179
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,760
Don't be silly.

180
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,480
What if I can fix it?

181
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
You have a good appetite.

182
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,070
You use your brain so much every day.

183
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,360
Why are you not hungry?

184
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,190
With high efficiency and low energy consumption,

185
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,120
your structure is against the nature.

186
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,400
Can you behave like a lady?

187
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,160
Swallow your food before you talk.

188
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,520
You're a manic.

189
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,120
And you even say I'm uncivilized.

190
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,040
You've been more and more daring lately.

191
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,240
When will you go home?

192
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,910
I would finish the exam first. Maybe a few days later.

193
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,160
How about I go with you?

194
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,160
To where?

195
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,670
Go to hand in the application to Blue Crown.

196
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,520
No need.

197
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,360
After the exam, everyone will go back home.

198
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,910
The time for handover is tight.

199
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,310
You can't handle it alone.

200
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,430
It takes me only three hours to go home.

201
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,190
I'm not in a hurry.

202
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,910
More people, more power.

203
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,830
What power?

204
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,790
The power of carrying bags?

205
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,710
We are a team.

206
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,040
You can't just focus on lightening yourself.

207
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,830
You should pay attention to team building.

208
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,710
For instance,

209
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,190
you have to allocate the work between me and Gao,

210
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,590
especially Gao.

211
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,240
You have to let him show his ability.

212
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,880
Don't let morale drop.

213
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,710
The team will be good as long as everyone is good.

214
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,160
Zhu Yun.

215
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,910
I find

216
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,000
you really have a ability.

217
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,360
What?

218
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,190
Take care of everyone so well.

219
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,880
How about this?

220
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,790
I will call you Political Commissar Zhu.

221
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,240
I don't mind.

222
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,480
What am I responsible for?

223
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,950
Team building.

224
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,400
Make it specific.

225
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,280
Specifically,

226
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,310
you're responsible for worrying

227
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,550
and I'm responsible for getting everything done.

228
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,550
Understand?

229
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,790
Yeah.

230
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,240
Then what do I need to worry about?

231
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,160
First worry about your exam of the Fundamental Principles of Marxism.

232
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,160
♫The secret I've been hiding♫
Deal.

233
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,260
♫The secret I've been hiding♫
I'll stay with you after the exam.

234
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,500
♫I really want to be with you♫

235
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,160
Whatever.

236
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,540
♫At a moment in the autumn of a fairy tale♫

237
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,620
♫The knight and princess are destined to meet♫

238
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,820
♫Let me feel and guard♫

239
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,780
♫Your simple wish♫

240
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,660
♫At a moment in reversely flying days♫

241
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,820
♫I'm no longer afraid of the big world♫

242
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,520
Gao.

243
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,940
♫By my side or on my pillow♫

244
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,820
♫You say every good night♫

245
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,060
♫Happiness has never changed♫

246
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,190
Finally, the exam is over.

247
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,120
What do you want to eat today?

248
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,670
Team Leader Li said that it's his treat.

249
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,400
The base has business though it's opened less than half a year ago.

250
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,190
At the end of the year, will Group Leader Li

251
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,070
give us some encouragement?

252
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,790
He said that if the Blue Crown project is successfully passed,

253
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,520
everyone will have red envelopes for the Spring Festival.

254
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,400
Today is the team building.

255
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,280
Do you want it or not?

256
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,360
Political Commissar Zhu is reliable.

257
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,550
I finally figure it out.

258
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,430
Li Xun

259
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,790
listens to you.

260
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:37,910
Let's go.

261
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,590
What to eat?

262
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,710
I'm going home for the Spring Festival.

263
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,910
Go shopping with me tomorrow.

264
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,040
I have plans for tomorrow.

265
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,520
You are out of organization.

266
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,760
What are your arrangements?

267
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,640
I'm going to repair Li Xun's lighter tomorrow.

268
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,240
I knew it.

269
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,070
It still has something to do with Team Leader Li.

270
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,520
For him,

271
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,550
you can get up earlier than chickens

272
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,670
and sleep later than dogs.

273
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,960
You can do everything without complaint.

274
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,240
We are women,

275
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,150
can you stop pleasing him?

276
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,870
Don't talk nonsense.

277
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,760
I broke his lighter.

278
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
I have to fix it for him.

279
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,440
His lighter is quite old.

280
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,870
You can buy him a new one.

281
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,920
No.

282
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,070
His lighter

283
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,630
means something different to him.

284
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,550
I have to look for accessories

285
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,390
or find one with the same principle.

286
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,760
I need to know how to assemble it.

287
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,280
Zhu Yun,

288
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,790
Political Commissar,

289
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,310
this base is really something.

290
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,200
You two are like

291
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,830
opening a husband-and-wife shop.

292
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,720
I have come back.

293
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,830
I'll hold a painting exhibition in Shanghai.

294
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,960
Do come and see it.

295
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,310
Xiuzhu?

296
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,720
The holiday is coming.

297
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,280
Do you want to stay and work?

298
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,760
The application is going online.

299
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,240
Let's make final effort

300
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,040
to share our joys and sorrows.

301
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,440
My cousin will get married on Friday.

302
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,390
Isn't your cousin just married?

303
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,550
Another one.

304
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,870
What are you afraid of being late?

305
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,760
They don't need you to play the suona.

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,680
I've bought the ticket.

307
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,310
What about you?

308
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,150
I'm not a member of the base, okay?

309
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,150
Does it matter with me?

310
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,870
Then why didn't you say this when having dinner with us?

311
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,680
How about you, Gao?

312
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,200
I've decided to quit the base.

313
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,070
Is this a joke?

314
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,760
Is it funny?

315
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,350
Why?

316
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,200
No why.

317
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,240
I plan to take part in the competition next semester.

318
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,150
I have no energy.

319
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,390
In addition,

320
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,200
God Li is great.

321
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,390
Without burden from me,

322
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,960
he may be more efficient.

323
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,200
I knew you'd come.

324
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,870
Gao.

325
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,760
You really want to leave the base?

326
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,520
Am I so sensitive?

327
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,960
We've talked about

328
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,870
these over and over again.

329
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,520
Every time I got angry and wanted to leave,

330
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,830
you would come to persuade me.

331
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,920
You are really Li Xun's

332
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,480
great political commissar.

333
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,110
I dare not persuade you now.

334
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,630
Zhu Yun.

335
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,040
You know what?

336
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,630
I've been the first since I was young.

337
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,110
I had good academic performance

338
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,070
and I was a member of the basketball and football school teams.

339
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,110
Every year before, I could get

340
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,390
many award certificates home.

341
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,760
They were worthless for me before.

342
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,040
Until I came to college

343
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,000
and met Li Xun,

344
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,350
I then fully became

345
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,200
a tool person that sets off his aura.

346
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,760
As long as I'm by his side,

347
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,310
no one can see me.

348
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,590
But I don't mind at all.

349
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,440
I'm convinced.

350
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,520
He's great.

351
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,150
I want to learn from him.

352
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,070
Last time

353
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,830
I decided to quit the base.

354
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,520
It was the only time Li Xun came to me.

355
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,390
He was standing on the roof

356
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,720
and said…

357
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,000
Gao Jianhong,

358
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,760
do you want to do something

359
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,680
that really belongs to you?

360
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,240
I do.

361
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,390
I really want to. I dream about it.

362
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,240
Compared to this,

363
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,520
self-respect means nothing for me.

364
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,480
But until this time,

365
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,630
Li Xun gave

366
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,550
the software to Zhang Xiaobei because of you.

367
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,790
I just found out that

368
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,760
that stuff

369
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,200
doesn't belong to me.

370
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,200
It belongs to Li Xun.

371
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,000
Zhu Yun.

372
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,150
I want to do something

373
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,630
that really belongs to me.

374
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,110
Can you understand?

375
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,790
I know.

376
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,760
But I still want to apologize to you.

377
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,480
We are a team.

378
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,870
As for that app matter,

379
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,960
Li Xun and I didn't consider your feelings.

380
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,070
I'm sorry.

381
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,480
No need.

382
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,680
We are good friends.

383
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,720
We should help each other.

384
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,590
But since that time,

385
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,590
I have decided

386
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,960
to leave the base

387
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,390
once the Blue Crown's project is finished.

388
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,590
I didn't expect

389
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,240
this moment really comes.

390
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,830
I feel relieved instead.

391
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,830
At least when I do a project later,

392
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,680
my name Gao Jianhong

393
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,280
will be written in the first place.

394
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,310
The first place.

395
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,870
Come on. Pass the ball.

396
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,480
All is done?

397
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,350
Is there something missing on your page?

398
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,310
You didn't place the logo on it?

399
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,280
Where are the cut pictures?

400
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,200
I'll lead them in.

401
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,070
Tell me where the pictures are?

402
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,520
Those two from the Animation Academy didn't give them to me.

403
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,590
It's not too late to do it now.

404
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,960
I'll make whatever style you want.

405
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,830
Forget it.

406
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,520
Then you do it.

407
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,920
Can I do it?

408
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,920
How about I call senior again?

409
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,350
It's too late.

410
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,680
There will be a way in a few days.

411
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,440
Why did you turn it off?

412
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,550
Go.

413
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,110
Where are you going?

414
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,680
My childhood friend is holding a painting exhibition here these days.

415
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,480
He invited me.

416
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,760
Let's go to find inspiration by the way.

417
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,070
No.

418
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,200
Then go for a walk.

419
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,790
What if we can come up with a way?

420
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,960
My friend is great.

421
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,760
The last paper I translated for Liu Sisi

422
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,920
is about his painting.

423
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,070
I'm occupied.

424
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,630
Then let's go tomorrow.

425
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,200
Hello.

426
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,070
Hello?

427
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,440
Let's go.

428
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,520
Li Xun?

429
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,110
Where to go?

430
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,630
Art gallery.

431
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,920
For what?

432
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,870
See you at the school gate in half an hour.

433
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,440
Really?

434
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,830
Did you climb here?

435
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,070
You dress up?

436
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,280
You dress like this to see your friend's painting exhibition?

437
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,350
It's my childhood friend's painting exhibition,

438
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,790
but why are you dressed up like this?

439
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,310
It seems that your friend is not important for you.

440
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,310
Your Highness, you are afraid of coldness.

441
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,760
Would you like to take a carriage?

442
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,110
Wait for me. I'll get changed.

443
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,280
Come back.

444
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,280
Come back. Go.

445
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,070
You said you couldn't go yesterday.

446
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,350
Can you wait for me?

447
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,040
No.

448
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,790
You'll die if you wait for me?

449
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,240
Yes.

450
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,390
Hurry up.

Can you make way?

453
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,310
Wrong direction.

454
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,760
I told you to get out of the way, not to leave.

455
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,590
You told me to get out of the way.

456
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,790
Why am I still standing next to you?

457
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,150
You need me to see you.

458
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,240
Where to go?

459
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,040

Can you stop the surprise attack next time?

461
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,070
You should at least make a phone call

462
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,110
so I can get prepared.

463
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,520
This is a date anyway.

Why are you nervous today?

467
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,350
What are these paintings about?

468
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,390
I can't understand.

469
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,350
Too unfriendly to us.

470
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,960
This is the Museum of Modern Art.

00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,280
Our fate must be incompatible.

473
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,310
It's not good to be superstitious.

474
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,830
This is it.

475
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,550
What are you doing?

476
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,680
I'll take a photo for Xiuzhu.

477
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,760
Make way.

478
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,720
This is created by your friend?

479
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,240
Yes.

480
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,440
Then you can't take photo of it.

481
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,790
This is a carbon painting.

482
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Taking pictures is not good for it.

483
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,790
Then I won't turn on the flash.

484
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,870
Not even that.

You like this kind of painting?

490
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,350
It's good. It's very great.

491
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,070
What's great?

492
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,200
Do you understand?

493
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,590
Somewhat abstract.

494
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,240
Somewhat weird.

495
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,590
There is still some strength.

496
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,920
Where can you tell it?

497
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,680
You asked me to do homework for Liu Sisi.

498
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,520
I just studied his paintings for a while.

499
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,350
But I've known him since childhood.

500
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,240
I used to play with him when I was young.

501
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,920
I didn't think he was so powerful.

502
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,000
Later he went to study in France.

503
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,760
He went home for the Spring Festival and held an exhibition.

504
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,150
He's not so older than us.

505
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,440
It's totally different from you.

506
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,760
What kind of man is he?

507
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,390
The media said he was a talented painter.

508
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,200
Who isn't a genius?

509
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,440
I was the No.1 in the college entrance examination.

510
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,920
But

511
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,960
the college entrance examination is a watershed.

00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,310
From the moment it ends,

513
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,790
people can't do less and less things well

depending on their own.

515
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,480
You want to die?

516
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,310
Do you want to die?

517
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,150
Do you remember this sentence?

518
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,070
Do you want to die?

519
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,240
Do you want to die?

520
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Who said this truth?

521
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,000
Do you want to die?

522
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,440
You come back. Come back.

523
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,280
Come on.

524
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,070
Come on, don't you like it?

525
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,550
Come on. Enjoy it.

526
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,240
No.

527
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,870
Keep enjoying it.

528
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,960
Come on, come on.

529
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,520
Look.

530
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,070
Come back.

531
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
Keep looking at it.

532
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,590
Come and see.

533
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,550
Come closer. Come closer.

534
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,040
Come on.

535
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,390
What should I look at?

536
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,760
Look at it earnestly.

537
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,550
"Lin Xun (jagged)".

538
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,350
Look at it carefully.

-Come on. -"Lin Xun (jagged)".

540

You get inside.

541
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,830
I'll tell you when the taxi comes.

542
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,760
And what about you?

543
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,350
I'm waiting for a taxi here.

544
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,680
I'm wearing thicker clothes than you.

545
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,480
Be good. Just go.

546
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,390
Go.

That's the price of wearing so little.

It won't kill me.

00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,720
Take more pills for the first time when you get a cold.

You don't understand this common sense?

583
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,760
Which planet has such a common sense?

584
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,590
I've checked the water temperature.

Aren't you responsible for getting everything done?

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,760
You even laughed at my thick clothes.

Let me see who takes care of you during the Spring Festival.

593
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,110
Hello.

594
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,070
Yun.

595
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,240
Hello, mom.

596
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,920
Have you finished the exam?

597
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,070
Yeah.

598
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,150
Xiuzhu has returned home, you know?

599
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,150
I know.

600
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,440
Then go home early if you have nothing to do.

601
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,000
You haven't seen each other in years.

602
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,680
You can ask him

603
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,150
things about studying abroad

604
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,310
by the way.

605
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:52,830
Well, mom,

606
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,480
I have something else to do in my school.

607
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,680
I want to stay two more days.

608
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,680
What's up?

609
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,480
It's Fang Shumiao.

610
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,200
She is our monitor

611
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,480
and the student union has assigned some tasks for her.

612
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,350
I need help to her.

613
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,390
Am I right, Fang Shumiao?

614
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,680
Yes.

615
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,280
Mom.

616
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,230
That's it.

617
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,480
Isn't the school out? What else to do?

618
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,000
Well, there are Party classes during the winter vacation.

619
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,070
I have to help.

620
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,710
Helping organize the Party classes

621
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,800
is a good thing.

622
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,750
It can pave the way for becoming a regular member in the future.

623
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,440
When will you finish?

624
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,590
Weekend at most.

625
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,230
I'll get everything done after the weekend.

626
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,520
There are still several days left.

627
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,800
Anyway, after you get things done,

628
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,960
just go home.

629
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,320
Don't wander around the school.

630
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,520
Then I may stay two more days.

631
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,000
Anyway, Xiuzhu's painting exhibition

632
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,070
is held in Shanghai.

633
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,190
I'll go back after I see it.

634
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,400
Done.

635
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,360
You'll just go home a few days later.

636
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,550
So happy?

637
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,710
I never lied since I was a kid.

638
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,920
Every time I lied,

639
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,270
my mom would catch me.

640
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,440
I don't think

641
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,710
I know how to tell a lie.

642
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,110
Then tell your mom the truth.

643
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,360
Working more days in the base

644
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,750
is not a bad thing.

645
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,920
She hates the base.

646
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,960
How dare I tell her?

647
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,480
Oh, I see.

648
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,070
Your mom is afraid that you will be in love with someone.

649
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,000
Have pity on our mom.

650
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,360
What she is afraid of has come true.

651
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,880
Fang Shumiao, you are really talking nonsense.

652
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
Zhu Yun!

653
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,000
I just packed it!

654
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,750
It's 15 minutes.

655
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,630
You drive to school tomorrow

656
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,230
and get Yun back.

657
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,550
What are you up to?

658
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,840
Didn't you just say she'd be back two days late

659
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,750
The more I think about it, the more I feel wrong.

660
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,110
She's never been away so long.

661
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,480
But now she is hesitating to come back.

662
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
I'm worried that

663
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,960
it may be because of that boy at the base.

664
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,520
You've thought too much.

665
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,230
Not at all.

666
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,190
She also said that she would go to attend Xiuzhu's painting exhibition in two days.

667
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,150
The exhibition is over today.

668
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,480
Xiuzhu is back.

669
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,110
Okay, I'll go.

670
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,920
It's my turn.

671
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,880
What do you want?

672
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,750
It's not good to warm yourself too much.

673
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,000
Comfortable.

674
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,630
You slept right here last night?

675
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,670
Eat while the food is still warm.

676
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,000
I have finished the picture.

677
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,800
Take a look.

678
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:16,670
Redo it.

679
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,070
Hard color, and ugly composition.

680
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
You saw the painting exhibition in vain.

681
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,070
You found no inspiration

682
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,040
but just focused on having fun?

683
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,320
Can you be a quiet patient?

684
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,440
What matters is good performance, not the picture.

685
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,440
You talk about performance every day.

686
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,150
Can't you make it more beautiful?

687
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,750
Do it yourself if you don't like it.

688
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,270
Okay, pose it.

689
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,230
You talk big.

690
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,960
Can you make it?

691
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,840
Is it serious again?

692
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,320
Why don't we go to the hospital?

693
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,230
Mind your business.

694
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:15,670
Don't worry.

695
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,590
Li Xun.

696
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,920
When are you going home?

697
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,920
No plan yet.

698
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,670
You won't go home for the Spring Festival?

699
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,150
Will Sister Li Lan come here?

700
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,520
Why do you have so many questions?

701
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,400
I'll be back in a minute.

702
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,150
Where are you going?

703
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,070
Buy medicine for you.

704
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,190
No need.

705
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,270
You must need it.

706
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,880
If you can't say anything

707
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,000
to Blue Crown by then, what would you do?

708
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,520
You're with me.

709
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,590
Wait. I'll be right back.

710
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,630
Mom.

711
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,840
Yun.

712
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,480
Have you finished your school work?

713
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,710
It will be over in two days.

714
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,920
You've seen the art exhibition.

715
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,070
I haven't had time…

716
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,440
It doesn't matter.

717
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,040
This night,

718
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,230
Aunt Jiang and Xiuzhu come to our house

719
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,190
to have a dinner.

720
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,480
Night?

721
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,040
Tonight?

722
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,550
Yes, tonight.

723
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,880
Your Aunt Jiang said

724
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,550
she hasn't seen you for years.

725
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,320
She misses you!

726
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,670
Let's make it tomorrow.

727
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,000
It must be too late today.

728
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,520
I didn't buy any tickets yet.

729
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,880
I must be home by tomorrow evening.

730
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,360
Just today.

731
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,000
Your dad just went to have a meeting near your school.

732
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,750
After the meeting,

733
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,710
he will drive you back.

734
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,230
Pack your bag.

735
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,800
He should be there soon.

736
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,630
Uncle.

737
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,360
Thank you.

738
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,400
You are

739
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:19,590
sick?

740
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,000
Don't worry.

741
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,400
I just have a cold.

742
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,040
Zhu Yun will be back soon.

743
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,960
Your base is very good.

744
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,710
Pretty good.

745
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,110
The school is over.

746
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,000
No one

747
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,190
except you stays here?

748
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,320
You're even sick.

749
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,070
It's hard for you.

750
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,520
I have no way out.

751
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,190
The project won't stop waiting for me to celebrate the Spring Festival.

752
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,590
Yeah.

753
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,960
Li Xun.

754
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,590
There's something urgent at home.

755
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,480
Yun.

756
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:55,840
Dad.

757
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,520
You came here so soon?

758
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,920
I'm anxious to go home.

759
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,800
So I came here early.

760
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,550
Well,

761
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,040
you have to go back to the dormitory later

762
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,000
to pack your stuff, right?

763
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,150
How about this?

764
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,920
I'll drive over there.

765
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,880
Then you don't have to carry your luggage.

766
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,360
Okay.

767
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,440
Uncle.

768
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,840
Drink more water.

769
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,000
Bye.

770
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:21,670
Bye-bye.

771
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,040
There's something urgent at home.

772
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,150
I have to go back.

773
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:35,840
Okay.

774
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,040
Anyway, there's nothing else to do.

775
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,630
Go home for the Spring Festival.

776
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,150
I didn't help you. I'm sorry.

777
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,070
Not really.

778
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,550
Your ugly picture

779
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,110
can be used.

780
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,480
Bye then.

781
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,480
Take this medicine

782
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,480
according to the instructions. Don't eat indiscriminately.

783
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,480
Let me know as soon as there is any news from Blue Crown.

784
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,840
Then I'm leaving.

785
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,000
Li Xun.

786
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,960
Go for it.

787
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,360
Zhu Yun.

788
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,190
Tell me when you get home.

789
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,520
Okay.

790
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,550
♫I pass by the world♫
Li Xun, was that you?

791
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,960
♫And pass through the night♫
How do you know where my house is?

792
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,070
I have been here before.

793
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,340
Then wait for me.

794
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,540
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
Why are you standing there?

795
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:20,920
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
Come and take a seat.

This is
