[Episode 6]

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,910
Ren Di.

22
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,800
You're shopping?

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,990
You were seldom so free.

24
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,830
It is weekend, and I didn't join the base.

25
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,880
So I'm here for shopping.

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,750
You're also shopping?

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,880
Together?

28
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,350
I'm waiting for someone.

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,400
You have an appointment?

30
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,070
I'm leaving.

31
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,670
You're leaving?

32
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,440
Do you think Zhu Yun has changed?

33
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,040
She has changed?

34
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,190
She was even tired of working

35
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,350
as the class rep in the past,

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
but she was bold

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,190
to make fun of you through a talk show.

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,320
She also dares to scold me.

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,160
You're also different.

40
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,160
You only concentrated on

41
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,600
achieving your goal in the past,

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,600
but you competed with them by betting some days ago..

43
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,440
Li Xun,

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,670
what's wrong?

45
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,670
You take to her? Or that's an accident?

46
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,320
I have a plan.

47
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,470
Any accident

48
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,950
impossibly occurs during this plan.

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,670
Understand?

50
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,350
I see.

51
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,470
Let's go.

52
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,400
The house I rented is right ahead.

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,600
Go.

54
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,070
Thanks.

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,040
Fang Shumiao,

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,400
how many members does your project group have?

57
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,750
Wu Mengxing and I.

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
I'll add your name.

59
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,320
I'm leaving.

60
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,350
Li Xun,

61
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,400
will Ren Di usually come to work for the project?

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,040
No.

63
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,560
Why do you add her name?

64
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,040
I want her to gain some credits.

65
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,350
I don't want those who won't work to join my group.

66
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,230
Let's talk about it after you make an achievement.

67
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,350
It's demanding to transfer to another school.

68
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,870
The school even requires students to know art.

69
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,910
[About us]
The website of our university

70
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,200
[About us]
is so bad.

71
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,470
[About us]
It's not smooth at all.

72
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Because it contains too many pictures?

73
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,550
You're finally back.

74
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,600
I've watched all the episodes of "Game of Thrones",

75
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,790
washed all my clothes

76
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,280
and even taken out the trash twice.

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm so bored.

78
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,520
You can join the base.

79
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,200
Many classmates join the base,

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,310
but few of them actually work for the projects.

81
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,720
What's wrong with you? Who offended you?

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,310
Ren Di,

83
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,230
given your absence from base activities,

84
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,600
even if you join my project group,

85
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,790
you won't gain credits.

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,640
You're crazy

87
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,200
about working as a manager?

88
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,310
You do nothing. Why do you join my group?

89
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,430
Profit by our toil?

90
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,400
I've always concealed your absence from morning self-study

91
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,760
and all-night staying-out,

92
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,110
but you didn't even thank me.

93
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,430
Did I ask you to do so?

94
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,280
If I were not the monitor,

95
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,670
I wouldn't have done so.

96
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,350
I didn't vote for you

97
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,790
in the monitor election,

98
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,600
so I don't need to listen to you.

99
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,960
You're unreasonable.

100
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,640
You might as well drop out and become a day student.

101
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,470
Anyway, you seldom attend classes and come back our dorm.

102
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,600
You waste resources!

103
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,760
Don't be angry.

104
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,400
Bad girl.

105
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,760
She is ungrateful.

106
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,280
You've long known her temper.

107
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,280
She's more unreasonable and ungrateful than Li Xun.

108
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,840
They're really a perfect match.

109
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,960
What do you mean?

110
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,790
She's with Li Xun.

111
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,430
She always came to the base for Li Xun late at night.

112
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,200
Li Xun is indifferent to everyone,

113
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,960
but he

114
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,640
always

115
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,040
listens to her

116
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,960
and stays with her all night.

117
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,550
What can a man and a woman do together?

118
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,040
They're both adults.

119
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,840
It's common for them.

120
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,960
When I went shopping today,

121
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,040
I also encountered them.

122
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,200
They always play such tricks.

123
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,430
I thought she is crazy about punk and indifferent to everything,

124
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,840
but she actually also cares about the credits offered by the base.

125
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,760
Are Ren Di and Li Xun

126
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,640
really together?

127
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,550
They're both cold.

128
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,160
They may hurt each other if they're together.

129
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,640
You don't believe my words.

130
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,790
I won't talk about it with you.

131
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
Are you moving? So many things.

132
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,200
I won't live here.

133
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
You'll move to another dorm?

134
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,840
Don't mind Fang Shumiao's words.

135
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,520
She didn't mean to hurt you.

136
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,200
She was just straightforward.

137
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,550
Don't be impulsive.

138
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,960
Do you always think

139
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,760
you're Fang Shumiao's assistant?

140
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,990
I won't move to another dorm.

141
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,990
That's good.

142
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,720
Why do you move so many things?

143
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,230
I've dropped out.

144
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,550
In my junior year of senior high school, my father had promised me that

145
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,280
I can do what I want to do,

146
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,990
such as playing the guitar and forming a band,

147
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,790
and live as I like,

148
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,470
as long as I can be admitted to a university.

149
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,310
You've come here

150
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,430
but suddenly dropped out.

151
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,430
You're different.

152
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,160
Everyone is different.

153
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,110
Fang Shumiao was right.

154
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,720
I did waste resources.

155
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,990
I shouldn't waste my four years.

156
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,640
Will I see you again?

157
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,110
What?

158
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,600
I'm not dead.

159
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,430
I've rented a house

160
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,400
as a studio nearby.

161
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,350
Go to visit it when you're free.

162
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,670
Ren Di,

163
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,720
take care.

164
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,310
Now you've lived with Li Xun.

165
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,840
You have to protect yourself.

166
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,230
I'm serious.

167
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,870
Fang Shumiao told it to you?

168
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,550
I guess it.

169
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,110
How did you guess it?

that's why she stays in the base.

you can do anything you want.

340
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,240
You can play.

341
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,480
The Internet is very smooth here.

342
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,870
You can play all games here.

343
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,200
But why did I get up at 6:00 a.m.

344
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,350
for playing a game here?

345
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,630
Come on. Do her a favor.

346
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,070
Do homework for her.

347
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,070
Do it casually.

348
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,870
Casually?

349
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,520
You can't.

350
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,720
Junior,

351
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,390
translate an art paper for me.

352
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,520
Senior,

353
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,680
which one do you want to translate?

354
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,630
Just this.

355
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,870
This is not an art paper

356
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,070
but is an individual resume.

357
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,680
It doesn't matter,

358
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,070
as long as I can hand it in as our homework.

359
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,520
OK.

360
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,830
This painter looks pure.

361
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,870
Thank you, Junior.

362
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,570
[Xiuzhu  Zhu Yun: You go viral.]
You go viral.

363
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,480
You've finished?

364
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,310
Anything else?

365
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,920
No wonder you're the class rep.

366
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,240
You finished homework so soon.

367
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:52,920
I'm not here

368
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,760
for doing homework for others.

369
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,920
You just did her a favor.

370
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,920
Don't forget that you invited me here.

371
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,920
Do you forget that you invited me?

372
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,680
Don't pretend to forget it.

373
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,240
I see.

374
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,960
I see?

375
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,590
Everyone, everyone.

376
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,240
Look. Look. Look

377
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,960
Look.

378
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,150
I have something to announce.

379
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,870
Come here, Zhu Yun.

380
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,590
What do you want to do?

381
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,070
Come here.

382
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,550
I announce,

383
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
this is the princess I invited here.

384
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,960
I'll treat you to dinner

385
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,110
to welcome her tonight.

386
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,440
Thank you. No need.

387
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,920
It's necessary.

388
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,480
After all, you were invited here.

389
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,150
Everyone can be wronged, except Your Highness.

390
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,680
I must have offended all your families in previous life.

Do you have a good time?

428
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,440
You sing here?

429
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
Yeah, we've been singing here.

430
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,590
He is studying here.

431
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,390
They don't have anything to eat.

432

-Go fetch some. -OK.

433
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,440
Hey, stop that.

434
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,350
Li Xun is busy flirting.

435
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,550
He has no time to supervise you.

436
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,200
I don't do this for him.

437
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,040
What's more,

438
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,760
we didn't join the base

439
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,630
just for credits.

440
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,110
Are you abusing me?

441
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,310
What are you doing?

442
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,040
I designed all the web pages

443
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,000
of Blue Crown.

444
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,110
What do you think of them?

445
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,390
Aren't these determined by Li Xun, are they?

446
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,720
He just talked about it roughly,

447
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,150
and I was responsible for all the practical operations.

448
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,280
I wrote all the codes.

449
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,070
They exhausted me,

450
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,870
but I have a sense of achievement.

451
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,520
Aren't we going to learn flash next week, are we?

452
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,550
But you've applied it.

453
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,000
So I said students of our major

454
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,240
need to take part in practices.

455
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,960
If Gao is an employee,

456
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,440
his employer will definitely be happy.

457
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,920
It's my project.

458
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Of course I work hard for it.

459
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,790
What's more,

460
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
we joined the base for mutual learning.

461
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,870
No one is the boss.

462
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,280
So I'll do this, too?

463
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,350
Impossible.

464
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,390
You just joined us.

465
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,520
You definitely won't do any core project.

466
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,440
Yeah. Don't be anxious.

467
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,520
Li Xun just speaks bitingly,

468
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,630
but we can really learn something in the base.

469
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,310
I know this,

470
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,280
but I've regretted it now.

471
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,350
We also stay in the base. Don't regret it.

472
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,720
So good.

473
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,110
Block her later.

474
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,960
Understand?

475
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,390
Coming. Coming. Come on.

476
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,240
Excuse me.

477
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,110
-Don't go. -Don't go.

478
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,680
Tell us your phone number, girl.

479
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,870
What do you want to do? I'll call the police.

480
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,520
Another girl.

481
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,110
Why did you go out of the Gents?

482
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,110
What did you do in the Gents?

483
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,790
Go away!

484
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,390
Are you a man or woman?

485
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,590
Let me check it.

486
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,240
What do you want to do? Go away!

487
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,590
Go away!

488
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,070
I, I can go by myself.

489
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,760
Li Xun,

490
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,280
I'm sending Wu back.

491
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,920
Don't help me.

492
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,110
Don't help me.

493
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,960
You can't let it be.

494
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,390
I'm going to buy medicines.

495
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,310
You're dismissed?

496
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,520
Yeah.

497
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,440
We can sing somewhere else.

498
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,040
Were you sure you could defeat them?

499
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,000
You shouldn't have taken actions.

500
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,150
Don't you have self-knowledge?

501
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,440
But she is your friend.

502
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,240
I'm sorry. Thank you.

503
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,310
It's my fault.

504
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,960
It doesn't matter. It's not your fault.

505
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,200

It's your duty to help your girlfriend with her homework.

00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,400
So it's unnecessary to waste time rewriting one.

668
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,750
Rewrite one.

669
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,920
Well, Li Xun,

670
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,400
you got this project,

671
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,960
but not only you're writing the program.

672
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,360
Now that we agreed to cooperation,

673
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,320
we have to make a decision after negotiation.

674
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,840
If only you have the say,

675
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,630
we can't work together any more.

676
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,480
Am I right?

677
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,440
OK, I listen to you.

678
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,590
I'll write it with you.

679
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,190
OK.

680
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,320
In my opinion,

681
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,840
this part of the logic is right,

682
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,670
and you just need to modify it and add some details.

683
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,840
I'm responsible for this part.

684
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,710
OK.

685
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,710
You write the following part.

686
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,880
No problem.

687
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,750
You come.

688
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,320
Morning.

689
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,550
Good morning.

690
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,400
Did you have breakfast?

691
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
Check this page again.

692
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,550
Sit with me.

693
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,920
I talked to you.

694
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,440
You, you can tell me how to do.

695
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,750
Weren't you deaf just now, were you?

696
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,110
You're leaving?

697
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,880
Yeah.

698
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,230
Did I allow you to leave?

699
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,880
It's half past ten.

700
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,230
If I don't go back now, I'll be locked out.

701
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,110
You can stay here all night.

702
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,190
You must finish this module tonight.

703
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,550
Can I write it in my dorm?

704
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
Won't you disconnect from the Internet in the dorm?

705
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,670
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

706
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,230
Take it easy.

707
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
We have to stay here in the following week.

708
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,630
Exploiter Li.

709
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,840
He exploits labor before he becomes a capitalist.

710
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,750
What we do is for the project.

711
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,230
What happened to you and Fang Shumiao?

712
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,800
Don't ask me about it.

713
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,190
Go to write codes.

714
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,270
Sour.

715
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,360
This orange is really sour.

716
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:20,880
Li Xun,

717
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,110
I bring you breakfast.

718
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,070
Have some.

719
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,400
These are all very delicious.

720
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,800
Have a taste.

721
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,230
You stayed up late again, right?

722
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,670
Then,

723
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,590
drink some coffee, OK?

724
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,800
Refresh yourself.

725
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,880
Sit still!

726
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,750
Stop watching.

727
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,880
Fang Shumiao.

728
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,440
Your program

729
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,190
starts 20 child processes

730
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,880
while running a user interface.

731
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,360
Do you know what you wrote?

732
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,710
You can tell me calmly

733
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,360
but not said in this manner.

734
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,400
If you can't stand it, you can leave!

735
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,550
Don't waste my time!

736
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,670
Li Xun, she just wrote wrong codes.

737
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,630
You went too far.

738
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,960
I was right.

739
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,590
You can only

740
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,440
play house in your interest group.

741
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,670
If you can't bear such pressure,

742
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,270
you're neither eligible for

743
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,670
nor capable of joining this base.

744
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,230
The same to you all.

745
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,880
Work hard in this base.

746
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,190
If you can't stand pressure, quit early.

747
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,440
Don't cry in front of me.

748
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,070
I don't want to coax a kid.

749
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:10,800
Shumiao.

750
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,320
Li Xun, you're self-righteous.

751
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,070
Shumiao,

752
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,960
even if Li Xun was angry,

753
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,190
he still went too far.

754
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,440
Forget it.

755
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,550
Will you quit it for me?

756
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,440
What do you mean?

757
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,840
You suffered nothing in the base.

758
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,270
Li Xun didn't scold you

759
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,590
but involved you in the core project instead.

760
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,960
Why don't you quit it?

761
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,150
Fang Shumiao,

762
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,320
speak your mind.

763
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,630
Don't be enigmatic.

764
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,880
No wonder you helped me actively.

765
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,230
It turns out that you had another aim.

766
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,670
Your words are too hurtful.

767
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,710
Didn't I help you before that?

768
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,960
But you profited at my expense this time!

769
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,710
You achieved your aim while helping me!

770
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,960
Why are you a princess invited

771
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,630
while we're anthomaniacs who actively join?

772
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,070
Fang Shumiao,

773
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:00,960
if you like Li Xun,

774
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,110
go tell him.

775
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,590
You should learn from Liu Sisi and Chen Minmin.

776
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,150
Don't get shirty with me!

777
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,360
Who likes Li Xun?

778
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,270
You know it.

779
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,440
Who told you?

780
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Gao?

781
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
You told Gao but didn't tell me.

782
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,630
Now I have nothing.

783
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,440
Why are you sadder than me?

784
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,190
Do you treat me as your friend?

785
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,070
Don't feel wronged. Don't feel wronged.

786
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,360
I don't blame you.

787
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,750
It's not my fault.

788
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,070
Why do you blame me?

789
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,440
Don't feel wronged. Don't feel wronged.

790
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,800
You are a talented

791
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,230
and pretty princess.

792
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,440
You are

793
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,880
a born talent.

794
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,270
It's not your fault,

795
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,710
but God gives you everything by force,

796
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,190
so others are always jealous of you.

797
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,440
Fang Shumiao.

798
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,880
Stop that. Stop that. Don't be angry.

799
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,070
After that, I've realized something.

800
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,800
I was too blind to like someone

801
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,710
as cold and arrogant as Li Xun.

802
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,230
From now on I solemnly declare that

803
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,960
I do not like him anymore.

804
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,750
If you like him, you can go after him.

805
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,150
I don't like him.

806
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,630
Really?

807
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,150
Anyone who likes him is out of mind.

808
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,270
Yes, that's true.

809
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,270
Are you not going to the base?

810
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,710
Of course I'm going.

811
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,840
I didn't scold him before because I went easy on him.

812
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,230
If he dares scold me again,

813
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,440
I'll teach him how to behave.

814
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,320
♫I pass by the world♫
Li Xun,

815
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,710
♫I pass by the world♫
we are a team.

816
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,670
I treat you like a brother and a comrade.

817
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,590
♫And pass through the night♫
You left me out on stage today

818
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,840
♫And pass through the night♫
to teach me a lesson and let everyone laugh at me.

819
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,520
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
You played me!

820
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,000
♫In the crowd in the dim light♫
So all you have to do is

821
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,590
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
listen to me.

822
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:59,000
♫You're over there with the fireworks♫
I quit.

823
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,880
♫It's the intuition of the dream♫

824
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,600
♫That breaks through the boundary♫

825
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,960
♫The first sight♫

826
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:18,560
♫Spreads and later it wins the world for me♫

827
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,480
♫The clock keeps ticking♫

828
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,160
♫I am leaning on your shoulder♫

829
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:36,200
♫We won't break up♫

830
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:41,320
♫Stay with me from the hustle and bustle♫

831
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,760
♫It's the fulcrum of your palm♫

832
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,800
♫That gives me the courage to move forward♫

833
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,760
♫Just like the flame in the night♫

834
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,440
