00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,300
=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 13=

2
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,480
What brings you here?

3
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,110
You act so recklessly.

4
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,570
Don't you know you'll suffer losses?

5
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,470
I couldn't hold back.

6
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,800
You're Lord Ma,
the Prefect of the Capital City.

7
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,150
You look so impressive.

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,760
I was present for everything tonight.

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,890
It was witnessed by everyone.

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,310
Why do you insist on debating the law
with Lady Xu?

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,590
Why don't you come with me

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,560
and explain to me properly

13
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,230
what is called the law?

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,080
Commander, please do not get mad.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,880
I...

16
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,430
I admit the mistake.

17
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,390
Since you admit the mistake,

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,840
then why not apologize to Lady Xu?

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,760
Today is my daughter's birthday.

20
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,990
I am asking for some respect
on behalf of her.

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,430
Harmony brings wealth to everyone.

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,950
I also don't want the birthday banquet

23
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,640
to end in a messy way.

24
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,200
Commander Pei, what do you think?

25
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,230
Your Highness, you're right.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,770
Let's proceed as you suggest.

27
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,710
OK.

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,150
If I've been less than attentive today,

29
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,800
I hope everyone will be understanding.

30
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,590
Everyone, keep eating and drinking,

31
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,840
enjoy yourselves with wine,

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,590
and have fun to the fullest.

33
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,860
(Violet Reverie)

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,710
Why can't you just stay out of trouble?

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,750
Why did you get involved in that mess?

36
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,080
I just wanted to see

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,590
if I can find a way to rescue my father.

38
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,910
You don't believe me?

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,290
It's not that I don't believe you.

40
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,120
I want to rely on myself.

41
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,070
Have you found someone
who can help you more?

42
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,190
I am not looking for someone.

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,470
I am looking for evidence.

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
Hongzhen Incense.

45
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,360
This belongs to Ma Chenggong,
the Prefect.

46
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,910
Do you know

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,310
who accused your father

48
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,940
of possessing Hongzhen Incense
privately?

49
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,190
I don't know.

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
It was Ma Chenggong.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,430
Three years ago, he just passed the exam
as the Top Scholar.

52
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,390
Three years later, he was
promoted to Prefect.

53
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,960
Such a short span of time.

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,680
His path of promotion

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,970
must inevitably be connected
to Hongzhen Incense.

56
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,680
That makes sense.

57
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,930
When you and I were in Yan City,

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,990
we joined forces to destroy a hideout
that secretly stored Hongzhen Incense.

59
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,240
As soon as I returned,

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,660
my father then met with misfortune.

61
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,950
It must be the mastermind
behind Hongzhen Incense

62
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,190
preparing to take revenge on me.

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,400
Don't worry.

64
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,590
With me here,

65
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,960
your family will be fine.

66
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,990
The night is already deep.

67
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,000
Commander Pei, go back and rest early.

68
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,800
Let me escort you back.

69
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,000
No need.

70
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,990
I don't want others to misunderstand.

71
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,390
What do you mean?

72
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,110
Commander,

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,370
the Princess admires you wholeheartedly.

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,830
She is pure and kind in nature.

75
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,480
You two are a perfect match.

76
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,390
Lady Xu, you should be well aware

77
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,880
I am not someone who will ever marry.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,800
So you don't have to play matchmaker.

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,360
Xu Wanning,

80
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,720
I invited you to attend my banquet

81
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,920
to watch you make a fool of yourself

82
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,470
and avenge the humiliation
from the poetry gathering.

83
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,950
I didn't expect you
to have such tactics.

84
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,000
Not only did you make me
a laughingstock,

85
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,390
you even took away Heng.

86
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,310
This is truly infuriating.

87
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,360
Your Highness, I've discovered
something strange.

88
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,800
Speak.

89
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,000
I heard that Commander Pei
has a foster daughter,

90
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,510
named Ruyi.

91
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,720
This girl

92
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,600
is about the same age
as Xu Wanning's son.

93
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,430
And they both came from Yan City.

94
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,670
I guess

95
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,920
Xu Wanning wants to use this method

96
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,120
to tie down Commander Pei.

97
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,270
Xu Wanning,

98
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,510
I think you really don't want
to live anymore.

99
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,830
How dare you compete with me for Heng!

100
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,480
Whoever dares to compete
with me for Heng

101
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,720
must die.

102
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,320
Here, have a shrimp.

103
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,120
You look just like a little shrimp.

104
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,510
Aunt Ning, come sit here.

105
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,390
You two sit together.

106
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,320
Hurry up.

107
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,070
Ruyi, it's been so long.
I really miss you.

108
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,000
It's only been three days.

109
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,160
Chang'an kept telling me he misses Ruyi.

110
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,120
I really had no choice.

111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,440
Yes.

112
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,560
Ruyi also said she misses Chang'an.

113
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,720
As a master,

114
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
I couldn't refuse.

115
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,350
Let's eat.

116
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,360
What's going on?

117
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,000
Aunt Ning, thank you
for taking me in back then

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,630
and for letting me
meet such a good master.

119
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,680
Only now can I live such a good life.

120
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,560
Mother, Master,

121
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,750
I don't know how
to express my gratitude.

122
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Bottoms up.

123
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Suit yourself.

124
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,310
Where did you learn that
at such a young age?

125
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,390
Yeah, where did you learn it from?

126
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,630
I learned it from my mother.

127
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,750
You've been troubled
about my grandfather lately,

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,190
drinking every day.

129
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,360
It pains me deeply.

130
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,200
You

131
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,350
drink every day?

132
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,630
Don't listen to the nonsense.

133
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,430
At most, it counts as a small drink.

134
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,920
I'm not talking nonsense.

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,240
Master, you have to persuade my mother.

136
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,000
Aunt Ning, you should also
persuade Master.

137
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,310
He has been troubled lately
for some unknown reason

138
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,720
and also drinks every day.

139
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,360
It pains me to see it.

140
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,960
You also drink every day?

141
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,480
I...

142
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,840
It doesn't even count as a drink.

143
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,120
Aunt Ning, when you have some free time,

144
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,750
come visit me and Master.

145
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,120
We both miss you very much.

146
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,390
You're talking nonsense.

147
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,750
I'm not talking nonsense.

148
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,360
Once, you got drunk,

149
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,480
I heard you calling Aunt Ning's name
in your dream.

150
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
Sit down and eat.

151
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,360
Alright.

152
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,390
I can't even finish it.

153
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,720
You can, Mother.

154
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,120
I promise Master
that I will take good care of you.

155
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,550
OK. You did a good job.

156
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,720
Eat it yourself, quickly.

157
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,360
Master, you eat too.

158
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
I'll take care of you for Aunt Ning.

159
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,590
Thank you.

160
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,670
- Mm.
- Go ahead.

161
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,710
By the way,

162
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,750
there's a lead on your father's matter.

163
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,930
But I don't want you to get involved.

164
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,200
Let me help you handle it.

165
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
Have you found out who it is?

166
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,790
There's no solid evidence yet.

167
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,320
It's more complicated than I thought.

168
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,080
Let's eat first.

169
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,800
Sachets.

170
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,810
Sachets.

171
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,510
Lord Ma.

172
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,630
Let's drink.

173
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,440
Both Commander Pei and Lord Ma
are here today.

174
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,270
You must have a good time.

175
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,600
You two, take good care of them.

176
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,160
Did you hear that?

177
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,040
Reward!

178
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,960
Thank you, Lord Ma.

179
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,110
Thank you.

180
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,630
Dance well.

181
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,320
Lady,

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
you are truly beautiful.

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Lord Ma.

184
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,390
Don't leave.

185
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,080
You'd better choose another lady.

186
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,390
This lady...

187
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,390
I have taken a liking to her.

188
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,240
Commander,

189
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,510
you like beauties, huh?

190
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,000
Who doesn't like beauties?

191
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,030
I didn't expect you to have this side.

192
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,960
I didn't expect

193
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,960
you can actually disguise.

194
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,270
I'm handling serious business.

195
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Let go of me.

196
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,910
I'm also handling serious business.

197
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,080
People all say

198
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,200
you are a cold-faced living Yama

199
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,480
who is ruthless and kills without mercy.

200
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,360
I think

201
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,360
those people don't understand you.

202
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,750
You have a cold face but a warm heart,

203
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
care for your subordinates,

204
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,360
and cherish and protect women.

205
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,870
Interesting, truly interesting.

206
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,440
Lord Ma, you understand me.

207
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,390
Come on.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,840
Let's drink.

209
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,120
Pour the wine, lady.

210
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,440
I heard that you were the first to learn

211
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,790
about Xu Weishan's smuggling
of forbidden medicines.

212
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,720
Originally, no one paid attention
to him.

213
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,910
But he provoked someone
he shouldn't have.

214
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,000
Wasn't he just looking for trouble?

215
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,630
Someone he shouldn't have provoked?

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,840
Who?

217
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,160
No, no.

218
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,080
Xu Weishan got what he deserved.

219
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,680
Commander,

220
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,910
you could just find any excuse
to throw him into prison.

221
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,790
Why trouble yourself over such a person
and such a trivial matter?

222
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,480
Lord Ma, you also know

223
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,280
His Majesty ordered me
to thoroughly investigate this matter.

224
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,080
I dare not casually find an excuse
to fool His Majesty.

225
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,980
If His Majesty were
to place the blame on me,

226
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,790
I could lose my head.

227
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,800
Otherwise,

228
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,480
I will speak to His Majesty

229
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,480
that you knew but did not report.

230
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,390
Commander, it was not that
I did not report.

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It was truly because...

232
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,480
Lord Ma,

233
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,270
how dare you!

234
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,780
You dare to take a forbidden medicine
without permission.

235
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Commander, spare my life.

236
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,190
Commander, please spare my life.

237
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,150
Where did you get it?

238
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,510
I...

239
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,120
I do not know.

240
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,030
Lord Ma, did you just say

241
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,240
I am ruthless and merciless,

242
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,240
and kill people without mercy?

243
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,960
Commander, I confess.

244
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,720
I was manipulated by someone

245
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,840
because I used Hongzhen Incense
in private.

246
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,060
As for who that mysterious person is,

247
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,600
I truly do not know.

248
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,270
I only did tasks for him,

249
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,090
and he gave me Hongzhen Incense
in return.

250
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,570
The forbidden medicines were hidden
among Xu Weishan's goods.

251
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,110
You did it?

252
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,290
Commander, please investigate clearly.

253
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,000
I wasn't the one who placed it.

254
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,720
I only helped him inspect the goods.

255
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,150
As for who put it among the goods,

256
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,440
I really don't know.

257
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,720
How do you usually meet him?

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,770
Seeing the picture
is like seeing the person.

259
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,870
Every time he assigns me a task,

260
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,280
he will...

261
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,360
He will draw half of a pattern for me.
