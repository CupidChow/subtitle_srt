=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 14=

2
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,520
I once saw that pattern

3
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,640
in the letter of my former mother-in-law

4
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,710
at the Marquis's Mansion.

5
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,640
I suppose he used this pattern

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,070
to give her orders

7
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,390
and secretly smuggle Hongzhen Incense.

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,870
You already know who it is, don't you?

9
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,000
Before, I only suspected.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,280
But I can be certain tonight.

11
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,560
This person is the uncle of His Majesty,

12
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,640
the father of the Princess,

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,230
Feng Zhengxin.

14
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,550
No wonder.

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,480
It's hard for ordinary people
to stir up such a great storm.

16
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,350
Feng Zhengxin

17
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,230
appears to be compassionate

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,230
but is actually sinister and cunning,

19
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,200
unfathomable.

20
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,950
Starting from today,

21
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,400
you should stay at home

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
and do not wander around.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,510
Leave your father's matter to me.

24
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,270
Commander,

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,040
can I go see my father?

26
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,470
I promised you

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,290
I would take good care of your father.

28
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,080
Father.

29
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,310
Wanning.

30
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,080
Wanning.

31
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,060
(Xu Residence)

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,030
Your Highness, it's late at night.

33
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,110
Why don't we go back

34
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
and look for Xu Wanning another day?

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
No.

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,440
I've been searching for Heng
for several days,

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,660
but I haven't seen him at all.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,870
I suspect

39
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,560
that he is together with Xu Wanning.

40
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,800
Your Highness,

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,220
sorry for not welcoming you earlier.

42
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,030
Wanning, no need for formalities.

43
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,030
I have come this time specifically

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,120
to apologize to you for the matter

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,750
at the birthday banquet.

46
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,800
No, no, no.

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,240
The one who should apologize is me.

48
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,470
I ruined your birthday banquet.

49
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,550
Your Highness,

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,230
the matter of the birthday banquet

51
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,630
is already in the past.

52
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,030
Heng,

53
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,280
I have no other intentions
in coming here this time.

54
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,560
I came especially to apologize
to Wanning.

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,360
But Heng,

56
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,480
why are you still with Wanning

57
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
so late?

58
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,430
It's like this.

59
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,260
During the day
when I was handling matters,

60
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,960
I just happened to run
into Commander Pei.

61
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,580
Commander Pei saw it was late at night,

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,160
so he conveniently escorted me back.

63
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,000
It was just a coincidence.

64
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,430
Was it an encounter?

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,150
Yes.

66
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,870
Since you no longer blame me,

67
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,680
I'd like to stay over
at your place tonight.

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
Is that OK?

69
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Sure.

70
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,520
Your Highness, please come with me.

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,000
Heng,

72
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,360
be extra careful on your way back.

73
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,870
Thank you for your concern.

74
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,520
Let's go.

75
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,580
(Xu Residence)

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,640
Go!

77
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,360
Your Highness, my home is humble.

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,320
I'm afraid you'll have to put up
with it tonight.

79
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
It's getting late.

80
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,480
Then you should rest early.

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,440
Wait a moment.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
There's nothing else.

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,430
It has been six years since we parted

84
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,630
in the Capital City back then.

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,390
We've had no more late-night talks.

86
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,600
Now that we finally have some free time,

87
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,630
I want to have a good chat with you.

88
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,510
Your Highness, you are willing,

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,860
I would naturally be delighted.

90
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,270
Wanning,

91
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,680
do you know why I have been alone

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,360
all these years?

93
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,680
I have been waiting for someone.

94
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,190
I'm afraid that after all my waiting,

95
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,870
it will end up being in vain.

96
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
I like Pei Heng.

97
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,430
I like him very much.

98
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,910
Oh.

99
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,120
Then why don't you just
confess your feelings to him?

100
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,240
Heng and I

101
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,830
grew up together since childhood.

102
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,240
Since I was young, I swore

103
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,900
that when I grew up, I would marry him.

104
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,040
When he was 18,

105
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,330
he was already a grand general
with great influence

106
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,020
and countless military achievements.

107
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,510
He could have had a bright future.

108
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,870
If it weren't for me,

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,150
he wouldn't have been plotted against
by the villains

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,390
and ended up disabled by accident.

111
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,800
So to speak,

112
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,870
Commander Pei was injured
because of you?

113
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,600
Back then,

114
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
I was young and ignorant,

115
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,630
and forced my father to go to the camp
to look for him.

116
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,000
But a battle was about to break out.

117
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,310
In order to protect me,

118
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,510
Heng...

119
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,080
Therefore,

120
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,240
all these years,

121
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,070
I have tried every possible way

122
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,950
to marry him to make up for my mistakes.

123
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,190
But Heng

124
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,190
only wants to be alone.

125
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,040
He doesn't want to implicate me.

126
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,240
Perhaps he is doing it for your sake.

127
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,510
Wanning,

128
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,870
you know Heng very well.

129
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,430
Not really.

130
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,240
He's in charge of my father's case.

131
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,070
When I was in Yan City,

132
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,190
Commander Pei also helped me.

133
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,920
We are both focused on business

134
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,040
and have little interaction in private.

135
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,430
If that's the case,

136
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
could you do me a favor?

137
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,670
Go ahead.

138
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,830
You help me test Heng,

139
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,800
and I help you rescue your father.

140
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,280
Sorry,

141
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,550
I can't help you.

142
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,200
You still say we're friends,

143
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,370
yet you won't even help me with this.

144
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,710
Could it be

145
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
that you have also fallen for Heng?

146
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,840
My Lady, the young master seems
to have a fever.

147
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,440
Your Highness,

148
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,630
my child has a fever.

149
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,720
I must hurry over.

150
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,440
You should rest early.

151
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,230
Come here.

152
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,110
Do you know

153
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,060
why I called you here?

154
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,920
I

155
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,280
don't know.

156
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,600
Who did you meet tonight?

157
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,680
I met...

158
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,740
I met...

159
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,710
Commander Pei.

160
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,710
What did you say?

161
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,150
I didn't say anything.

162
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,320
I didn't say anything.

163
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,050
You're lying.

164
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,490
I really did not...

165
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,030
Amitabha.

166
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,870
So terrible!

167
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,470
Who on earth is the killer?

168
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,820
He was hanged at the gate.

169
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,760
Hongmei,

170
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,660
put the person down
and see if he can be saved.

171
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,180
Stop! Move aside, move aside!

172
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,300
Go, go, go!

173
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,180
What are you doing?

174
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,490
Destroy the body and cover it up?

175
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,580
Someone, come here!

176
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,520
Take all the Xu Family members
to the government.

177
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,320
Seal off this place.

178
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,650
Wait!

179
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,340
May I ask what crime our family
has committed

180
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,700
that you want to take us all away?

181
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,340
The Prefect's body is hanging right
at your doorstep.

182
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,020
None of you can escape responsibility.

183
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,220
Someone!

184
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,780
Immediately take the people here

185
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,330
all to the government for interrogation.

186
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,300
- Take action.
- Wait.

187
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,140
Who dares?

188
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,330
Heng, you finally came.

189
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,770
They want to capture Wanning.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,010
Luckily, I was here.

191
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,860
Otherwise, they would have taken action.

192
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,540
Are you alright?

193
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,180
Commander Pei, Princess Anle,

194
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,130
I am merely acting impartially.

195
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,380
Then can you arrest people recklessly?

196
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,880
Doesn't that mean
I could just fight you directly?

197
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,660
Constable Yan,

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,480
may I ask on what basis you determined

199
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,860
that our family is under suspicion?

200
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,380
This is obvious.

201
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,580
The body is hanging right
at your doorstep.

202
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,700
Everyone in this residence last night

203
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,980
is implicated.

204
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,010
Since that is the case,

205
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,380
Princess Anle also stayed
at my home yesterday.

206
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,140
Are you going to take her away too?

207
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,380
What she said is correct.

208
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,300
Well...

209
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,380
Your Highness,

210
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,720
this is all a misunderstanding.

211
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,060
Last night you were here.

212
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,060
How would they

213
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,150
dare to kill someone
right under your nose

214
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,020
and even hang the body
at the gate afterwards?

215
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,250
I think someone must be framing them.

216
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,010
If that's the case,

217
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,060
then neither of us is a suspect, right?

218
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,300
Yes.

219
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,040
Someone! Quickly take the body down

220
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,400
and take it back to the government.

221
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,470
The rest of you, follow me
to investigate carefully.

222
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,390
Yes.

223
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,780
Your Highness,

224
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,020
many thanks for today.

225
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,700
Such a small matter
is not worth mentioning.

226
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,340
If there's nothing else,

227
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,860
then I'll head back first.

228
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,220
Heng,

229
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,120
why not send me back?

230
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,140
(I have no time to think
about romance now.)

231
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,440
(The Prefect has been killed.)

232
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,440
(This means the Prince
has already taken action.)

233
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,630
(I must hurry.)

234
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,260
Didn't you escort the Princess back?

235
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,990
A murder occurred in the Xu Family.

236
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,940
As the Commander of the Jinlin Guards,

237
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,180
I must investigate thoroughly here.

238
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,980
What else is there to investigate?

239
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,700
You and I both know clearly

240
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,740
that the mastermind is the Prince.

241
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,940
Handling a case requires evidence.

242
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,260
Precisely because it is him,

243
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,710
we need to be fully prepared

244
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,130
and find the key evidence

245
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,020
to strike a fatal blow.

246
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,590
Your identity makes it inconvenient.

247
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,580
I will find a way to get close to him.

248
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,900
You're walking into the lion's den.

249
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,120
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

250
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,580
As long as I can find evidence
to save my father,

251
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,900
I am willing to do anything.

252
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,340
But you don't need
to sacrifice yourself.

253
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,820
I can negotiate on your behalf.

254
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,540
He is targeting our family.

255
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,140
I must personally strike back.

256
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,030
Moreover, if you can sacrifice yourself,

257
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,380
why can't I?

258
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,780
Father.

259
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
Father, why are you doing this?

260
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,780
I still want to ask
why you are opposing me.

261
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,420
Father,

262
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,860
I have never opposed you.

263
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,420
Did you go to the Xu Family yesterday?

264
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,900
You are a princess.

265
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,600
How improper it is

266
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,990
to show your face in public all day!

267
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,980
Starting from today,

268
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,660
you will be confined in the Mansion.

269
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,220
Your Highness,

270
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,060
the Princess has been spoiled
since childhood.

271
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,500
I'm afraid she will...

272
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,420
It's because I spoiled her too much

273
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,460
that she ended up ruining my plan.

274
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,580
I went to great lengths
to kill the Prefect

275
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,740
and hang him at the gate
of the Xu Family.

276
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,940
If it weren't for her

277
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,180
proving Xu Wanning's innocence,

278
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,580
I would have dealt with Xu Wanning
long ago.

279
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,790
Things have come to this point.

280
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,160
Your Highness, calm your anger.

281
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,540
If it really doesn't work,

282
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,100
I will go and get rid of her right away.

283
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,740
This matter still requires
careful planning.

284
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,100
I'm afraid word has already gotten out

285
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,380
about us smuggling Hongzhen Incense.

286
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,620
We should act low-key.

287
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,780
Yes.

288
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,420
Your Highness,

289
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,490
Xu Wanning requests an audience
with the Princess.

290
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,980
Wonderful!

291
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,710
I, Xu Wanning, pay respects to you.

292
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,300
I just heard the sound of the zither,

293
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,400
resonant and powerful.

294
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,660
Just a few short notes,

295
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,500
it carries a sense of killing intent.

296
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,260
But when I came over,

297
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,380
I saw a graceful and elegant lady,

298
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,290
which greatly surprised me.

299
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,480
Your Highness, you flatter me.

300
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,500
I have taken the liberty to visit today

301
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,800
because the Princess stayed
at my house last night

302
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,860
and left behind a sachet.

303
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,020
I came specially today to return it.

304
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,300
Oh.

305
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,340
(Yanlan Pavilion)

306
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,980
Well, Xu Wanning,

307
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,620
I really underestimated you.

308
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,780
