=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 4=

2
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,880
It's you.

3
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,760
It's really you.

4
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,280
You help scum favor his mistress
over his wife.

5
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,880
You drove me to hang myself.

6
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,110
It is you.

7
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,030
Give me back my life.

8
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,110
Stay away, stay away.

9
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,270
Who are you?

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,040
I am the Madam of the Wang Family.

11
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,950
You caused my family to be ruined
and destroyed.

12
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,590
I will take your life.

13
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,040
No, don't come closer.

14
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,510
Master.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,150
It's you.

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,990
Ah?

17
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,590
You bullied me because my husband died,

18
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,310
cheated me out of my family fortune,

19
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,870
ruined my reputation,

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,870
and destroyed my family.

21
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,680
I will kill you.

22
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,200
You are Ms. Li from the East City.

23
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,350
How could it...

24
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,870
I was wrong.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,790
Master,

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,150
what are you doing?

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,520
Well,

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,040
what's going on here?

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,240
You...

30
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,750
Who exactly are you?

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,710
I don't know what's going on.

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,030
Someone has been asking me

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,310
to pass a message to you.

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,680
What?

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
Master,

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
I'll give you another chance.

37
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,710
Take a good look

38
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,840
at who is possessed by evil spirits.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,360
If you make a mistake again,

40
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,470
I will gouge out your eyes

41
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,680
and take your life.

42
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,590
I was wrong.

43
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,080
I failed to recognize the facts.

44
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,000
I found the wrong person.

45
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,750
Those evil spirits...

46
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,590
It's her.

47
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,520
I recognized her.

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,870
She is the worst evil spirit

49
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,840
who has disturbed the peace
of this residence.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Are you crazy?

51
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,990
Xu Wannning,

52
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,800
what exactly did you do to him?

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,950
I...

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Master, please take a good look.

55
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,900
How could the evil spirits
possibly be on Qingqing?

56
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,080
Isn't it on her?

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
Master,

58
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,630
you just said if a person is possessed
by evil spirits,

59
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,120
how should we drive out them?

60
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,120
The first lash drives away misfortune.

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,800
The second lash banishes ghosts.

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,360
The third lash expels demons.

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,640
Master,

64
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,240
are three whips enough?

65
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,430
Everyone in this residence

66
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,030
must whip her.

67
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,240
Otherwise, the evil spirits
can't be exorcised

68
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,190
and will harm everyone.

69
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,310
I remember Qingqing also said
that it must be whipped.

70
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,280
Then let's begin.

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,080
Don't come over. It's not me.

72
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,430
Marquis, please help me quickly!

73
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,270
Master.

74
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,630
Qingqing,

75
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,240
Yunfeng specially invited the Master
to drive out evil spirits,

76
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,710
just to help Ping's illness
recover faster

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,630
and get rid of the scar on your face.

78
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,750
Qingqing, just bear with it.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,360
This is all for the Cui Family.

80
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,280
The three lashes will be done quickly.

81
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,030
Master.

82
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,750
Stop!

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,240
There is no evil spirit.

84
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,590
It's all fake.

85
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,510
It's all fake?

86
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,360
Could it be

87
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,630
that it was all arranged by you?

88
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,310
How could that be possible?

89
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,040
Master, I remember you said before

90
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,120
we also have to whip her.

91
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,560
Right, Yunfeng?

92
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,640
Qingqing.

93
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,600
Stop that! Stop!

94
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
Alright.

95
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,300
All evil spirits were eliminated.

96
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,310
Three lashes are enough.

97
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,750
Exactly.

98
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,000
There are no more evil spirits.

99
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,630
No evil spirits anymore?

100
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,750
That's wonderful.

101
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,270
Qingqing, you have suffered.

102
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,310
All of this is for our own good.

103
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,870
It is all for the good
of the Cui Family.

104
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,430
By the way, there is good news.

105
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,040
A Master Physician has taken the notice.

106
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
Your face will recover soon.

107
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
Very good.

108
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,870
I am but a humble person,

109
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,240
indeed the Master Physician

110
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,310
whom you spoke of.

111
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,600
(I clearly have arranged someone.)

112
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,870
(How could it be him?)

113
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,920
We meet again.

114
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,600
I want to give you a gift.

115
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,840
Hurry up, go.

116
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Cui... Lord Cui,

117
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,600
you... you must save me.

118
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,120
It was you who arranged for me to act.

119
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,480
You... you have to speak up for me.

120
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,640
Stop making false accusations.

121
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,920
Your skills in Taoist methods
are lacking,

122
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,600
bluffing and bringing trouble
upon yourself.

123
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,710
Take him away quickly.

124
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,340
Marquis Cui!

125
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,000
Marquis Cui!

126
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,120
Madam, Lord,

127
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,190
you must stand up for me.

128
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,430
That woman is deep-minded

129
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,510
and deliberately scheming,

130
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,510
causing me to become a laughingstock
in front of everyone.

131
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,600
It doesn't matter if I embarrass myself.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But everything I did

133
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,630
was for Ping.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,950
Qingqing,

135
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,360
what did you do for Ping?

136
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Mother,

137
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,240
this is the Master Physician I found.

138
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,920
He can treat Ping

139
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,480
and also Qingqing's illness.

140
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,470
Really?

141
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,000
Quickly bring Ping over
for the physician to examine.

142
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,920
Yes.

143
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,000
Master Physician?

144
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,870
Why don't you check it for me first?

145
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,480
I am unable to
cure this young lady's illness.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,040
You can't?

147
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,390
Isn't this fraud?

148
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,790
Madam Cui,

149
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,270
is this the Master Physician you invited
at a high price?

150
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,110
Miss,

151
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,950
to cure illness,
one must first cure the heart.

152
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,390
Only when you heal your own heart

153
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,190
will there be a chance for your illness
to get better.

154
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,920
What does this mean?

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,310
It means

156
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,190
your heart is not clean.

157
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,270
Once your heart becomes clean,

158
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,480
the face will naturally get better.

159
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,160
Young Master Ping has arrived.

160
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,230
Ping.

161
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Come quickly.

162
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,360
Young Master Ping's illness
can be cured.

163
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,390
It's just that

164
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,040
I need a guiding herb.

165
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,450
Hongmei,

166
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,750
take Ping away to rest first.

167
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,760
Yes.

168
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,460
Ping, come on.

169
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,390
Master Physician,

170
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,800
just let me know what guiding herb
is needed.

171
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,480
Hongzhen Incense.

172
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,720
Hongzhen Incense
is a prohibited medicine.

173
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,910
How could our family possibly have it?

174
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,480
If that is the case,

175
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,360
Young Master Ping's illness,

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,030
I'm afraid...

177
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,870
Master Physician,

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,390
we are unable to obtain it.

179
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,790
But please try to think of a way.

180
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,360
No matter how much money it costs,

181
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,790
we are willing.

182
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,630
Mother,

183
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,360
I will take the Master Physician
to rest for a while.

184
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,550
Let him think carefully

185
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,030
and see if there is any other method.

186
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,040
Please.

187
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,320
Master Physician, please.

188
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,270
Commander Pei, you changed your identity
to enter the Mansion.

189
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,840
It was for Hongzhen Incense, wasn't it?

190
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,320
Cui Qingping is your son?

191
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,440
What do you mean?

192
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,670
If he really is your son,

193
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,840
his illness should have been cured
long ago.

194
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,150
The deadly disease known
as Corpse Blossom Rash

195
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,190
is difficult for anyone to cure.

196
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,870
How could a woman like me
have such great ability?

197
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,200
I am just curious

198
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,390
if you can really cure Ping's illness.

199
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,960
If it cannot be cured,

200
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,840
what will you do then?

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,390
Since I have taken down your notice,

202
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,270
I naturally have a countermeasure.

203
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,030
Then I shall watch closely

204
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,080
how

205
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,630
you will respond.

206
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,510
Lady Xu, rest assured.

207
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,440
You just do whatever you wish to do.

208
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,000
Leave the rest to me.

209
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,520
I will definitely not stand in your way

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,030
and ruin your plans.

211
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,120
Hongzhen Incense?

212
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,990
You placed it.

213
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,670
What do you think?

214
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,870
If it wasn't you,

215
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,840
then there must be someone else
in the Mansion.

216
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,600
It seems the fish has already
taken the bait.

217
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,080
I just found the right spot

218
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,150
and put down the bait.

219
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,600
If I want to know the truth,

220
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,080
I still need to cast a long line

221
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
to catch big fish.

222
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,030
These have nothing to do with me.

223
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,440
Since someone has already delivered it,

224
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,320
then Ping's illness...

225
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,080
Lady Xu, rest assured.

226
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,390
Three days later,

227
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,390
Ping's face will naturally be as good
as before.

228
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,550
Thank you, Commander Pei.

229
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,860
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

230
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,030
I am not very capable.

231
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,790
The scar on this young lady's face

232
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,150
might not be removed.

233
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,600
Madam, Lord,

234
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,750
you must stand up for me.

235
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,550
What Master Physician?

236
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,510
You are nothing but a charlatan.

237
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,670
Even Qingqing's face is like this,

238
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,670
wouldn't my son's face be even worse?

239
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,960
If that's the case,

240
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,630
I'll kill you first.

241
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,550
You're just a physician.

242
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,000
How could you have so much strength?

243
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,360
Who exactly are you?

244
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,910
I travel around the world

245
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,600
and always encounter some ruffians.

246
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,910
I need some basic martial skills
for protection.

247
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,160
Yunfeng,

248
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,550
the gauze on Ping's face has not yet
been removed.

249
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,200
Everything is still unknown.

250
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,670
If Ping's face is perfectly fine now,

251
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,080
wouldn't you have wronged Physician Pei?

252
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,840
Ping,

253
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,000
come here and let me see.

254
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,720
Yunfeng, you should apologize.

255
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,390
Apologize?

256
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
To whom?

257
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,480
Of course, to Physician Pei.

258
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,120
If your impulsive actions today

259
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,630
were to spread outside,

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,470
it may damage the reputation
of the Cui Family.

261
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,360
My son's face is fine,

262
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,080
but Qingqing still has scars
on her face.

263
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,840
I remember Physician Pei has long said,

264
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,910
due to an unclean heart,

265
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,030
her illness has not yet healed.

266
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,960
Now, her current situation

267
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,080
is the consequence of her own actions.

268
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,710
Apologize.

269
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Alright.

270
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,840
Show mercy where mercy is due.

271
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,670
Who exactly is your husband?

272
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,840
Do you still have any shame?

273
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,030
Physician Pei has the benevolent heart.

274
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,630
He naturally would not be angry.

275
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,670
Although the scars on Ping's face
have healed,

276
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,870
the illness has not yet been cured.

277
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,700
It still requires time for recuperation.

278
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,430
Alright.

279
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,270
Please stay in the residence
for a few more days.

280
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,030
First, help my grandson fully recover.

281
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,720
Second, give Qingqing a proper check-up.

282
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,100
I entrust this to you, Physician Pei.

283
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,560
Feng,

284
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,510
apologize quickly.

285
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,840
It was rude of me.

286
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,840
Please forgive me, Physician Pei.

287
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,000
No problem.

288
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,080
My Lady,

289
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,440
there is news about the midwife
who delivered you back then.

290
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,710
Quick, tell me.

291
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,320
She has always lived in a village
on the west side of the city.

292
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,080
She has still been making a living
by delivering babies.

293
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,750
But she acts very secretively.

294
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,550
I don't know what she's afraid of.

295
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,670
(I'll go find her right now
and get to the bottom of it.)

296
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,320
My Lord.

297
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,200
What is it?

298
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,350
She went out.

299
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,470
Got it.

300
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,350
You may step back.

301
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,230
Yes.

302
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,240
This woman has been going out
frequently lately.

303
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,000
I wonder if she's secretly meeting
some man again.

304
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,510
I had someone keep an eye on her

305
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,750
to catch her making a mistake.

306
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,670
Once I catch her,

307
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,510
I'll take the opportunity
to divorce her.

308
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,840
I'll go see right now

309
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,150
