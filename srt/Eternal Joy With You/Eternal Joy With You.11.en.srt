=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 11=

2
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,260
(Capital City)

3
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,110
Come on. Keep up.

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,870
Thank you for escorting us.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,280
We are deeply grateful.

6
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,590
Our paths diverge after entering the city.

7
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,950
Guess this is where we part.

8
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,000
I have little to do today.

9
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,440
I'll see you a bit further.

10
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,750
It'll put my mind at ease.

11
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,540
Mother,

12
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,510
let's go with Master a bit further.

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,560
Ruyi and I haven't finished talking yet.

14
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,040
Yes, Aunt Ning. Just a little further.

15
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,120
Sorry for the bother, Commander.

16
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,120
No bother at all.

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,120
This place is enormous.

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,000
Everything looks so new and exciting.

19
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,760
And lots of delicious food.

20
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,680
The air's filled with appetizing smells.

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,710
All right, you two little foodies.

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,310
I'll take you to Zuixiang Pavilion
for a big meal

23
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,920
to satisfy your cravings, okay?

24
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,070
Okay.

25
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,760
What plans do you have after returning home?

26
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,950
I plan to settle down
with Chang'an and Ruyi.

27
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,560
No longer considering

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,520
finding someone to grow old with?

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,310
I've suffered enough in marriage.

30
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't want to step into that trap again.

31
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,590
I'm better off by myself.

32
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,280
Enough about me.

33
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,710
Commander Pei, what about you?

34
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,630
Is there someone you fancy?

35
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,960
Same here.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Being single suits me.

37
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,430
All right then.

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,560
Now we're back,

39
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,590
guess this might be goodbye for a while.

40
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,560
Take care of yourself.

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,190
I am the master of Chang'an and Ruyi.

42
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,380
If we want to meet, we'll find a way.

43
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,590
Get in the carriage.

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,080
Princess, if Commander Pei knew

45
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,430
you had waited for so long

46
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,960
just to see him,

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,080
he'd be touched by your sincerity.

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
You and your smooth talk.

49
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,870
However,

50
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,310
I can't stop smiling thinking

51
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,560
about seeing Heng.

52
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,520
Princess, look.

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,910
Isn't that Commander Pei?

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,000
Greetings, Princess Anle.

55
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,630
Heng, it's been so long.

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,800
Princess Anle.

57
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,400
Wanning,

58
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,590
why are you traveling with Heng?

59
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,560
Commander Pei helped me with the divorce.

60
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,960
He took pity on our plight

61
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,820
and decided to see us home.

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,280
When you met Cui Yunfeng

63
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,150
back at the poetry gathering,

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,430
I had no idea he'd be that morally rotten.

65
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,430
Now that I think of it,

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,100
if it weren't for my involvement,

67
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,030
you'd never have...

68
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,050
Princess, you do me too much honor
with such words.

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,270
It was my fault
that your name was stained back then.

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,240
All this time I've carried this remorse

71
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,830
without offering a proper apology.

72
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,680
You were kind enough to introduce me to him,

73
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,920
but who could have guessed

74
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,160
the darkness hidden within his family?

75
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,600
I strayed into a dead end.

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,630
Fortunately, I have now turned back in time.

77
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,430
I'm blessed as it is.

78
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,750
Please don't concern yourself with me.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,800
You must haven't met in a long time.

80
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,750
There must still be a lot to talk about.

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,440
Princess,

82
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,800
I'll come by another day.

83
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,180
I won't keep you any longer today.

84
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,200
Mm.

85
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,600
I promised to see you home.

86
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,140
How could I leave you halfway?

87
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,950
Princess, please excuse me.

88
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,160
(Xu Residence)
I'm grateful, Commander Pei.

89
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,190
We're home now.

90
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,520
Come.

91
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,280
Say goodbye to your master.

92
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,190
Aunt Ning, I want to go with Master.

93
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,060
You have Chang'an with you,

94
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,160
but Master has no one.

95
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,830
I don't want him to be alone.

96
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,360
Besides, I want
to learn martial arts from Master.

97
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,040
Mother, Ruyi and I discussed this.

98
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,600
If I miss her, I'll go see her.

99
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,390
If she misses me, she'll come to me.

100
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
That way, we'll be able to meet,

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,680
and you'll be able to meet Master as well.

102
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,630
If that's the case,

103
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,560
I'll take Ruyi back.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,040
Lady Xu, please return home and rest.

105
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,800
Is this appropriate?

106
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,040
Let's go.

107
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,160
Be careful on the road.

108
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,780
(Xu Residence)

109
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,270
When did you plan this?

110
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,200
What?

111
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,300
(Commander's Mansion)

112
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,870
How lovely!

113
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,950
Master, is all this for me?

114
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,270
Do you like it?

115
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,800
If you don't like it,
I'll get you something else.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,920
I like it very much.

117
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,160
Apart from Chang'an and Aunt Ning,

118
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,040
no one has treated me as well as you, Master.

119
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,750
I never dreamed

120
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,240
I could live in a house this nice

121
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,090
or wear clothes this lovely.

122
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,270
Thank you, Master.

123
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,190
I'll be here for you.

124
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,480
Things will only get better.

125
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Mm.

126
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,830
Commander, His Majesty summons you.

127
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,270
It's been a long time.

128
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,720
Wish you well, Auntie

129
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,950
and my younger siblings.

130
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,160
With the trouble you've stirred,

131
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,390
how could we be fine?

132
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,000
Not only did you cause a scene,

133
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,360
but you also became the first woman
who cast off her husband.

134
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,190
It's completely

135
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,720
unprecedented.

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,560
How could you...?

137
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,360
I am the first to do so,

138
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,750
but I believe

139
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,240
more women will make the same choice.

140
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,480
If marriage isn't working out,

141
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,630
they should have the courage

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,390
to choose to live as they wish.

143
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,390
You sound completely ridiculous.

144
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,270
What you have done is utterly rebellious,

145
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,720
yet you want more people to follow suit.

146
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,390
For a woman, ignorance is virtue.

147
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,480
Your studies have made you foolish.

148
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,550
Get up.

149
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,550
I have a question for you, Auntie.

150
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,670
If Wanzhen were to marry a man

151
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,750
who treats her badly,

152
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,200
preferring his concubine over her

153
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,750
and trying to kill her,

154
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,550
what would you suggest she do?

155
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,550
How dare you curse your sister?

156
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,670
Let go of my mother.

157
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,200
Let go.

158
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,390
If you call it a curse,

159
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,550
then so be it.

160
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,920
Chang'an, let's go.

161
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,320
Your sister remains unbetrothed,

162
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,720
as does your brother.

163
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,590
A woman who cast off her husband
returning to her natal family

164
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,550
is both a laughingstock

165
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,960
and a shame for the Xu family.

166
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,870
How can your siblings hold up their heads?

167
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,910
Are you afraid I'll ruin their prospects?

168
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,510
Isn't that the truth?

169
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,960
I'm the legitimate eldest daughter
of the Xu Family.

170
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,270
Father told me

171
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,030
the Xu family would

172
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,150
welcome me back anytime.

173
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,360
If it displeases you,

174
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
feel free to tattle to Father.

175
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
After all these years,

176
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,720
I never imagined my sister would
act like a village shrew,

177
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,840
with no sense of propriety or shame.

178
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,510
Your child is watching.

179
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,630
Aren't you ashamed as a mother?

180
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,390
My mother entered

181
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,390
and knelt to greet you all,

182
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,240
showing her respect.

183
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,510
But you just kept blaming

184
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,240
and humiliating her,

185
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,840
showing neither respect nor courtesy.

186
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,120
So who truly lacks propriety and shame?

187
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,360
You impudent brat.

188
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,440
Sharp-tongued
and disrespectful to your elders.

189
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,510
Time you learned.

190
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,440
You fool!

191
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,680
Dad.

192
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,720
As an uncle,

193
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,080
laying hands on your nephew

194
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,240
is utterly improper.

195
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,960
He was disrespected to me first.

196
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,320
I heard everything.

197
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,390
You are at fault here.

198
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,000
Daddy.

199
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,920
My child.

200
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,320
You've endured a lot.

201
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,270
If I'd known

202
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,360
how vile Cui Yunfeng was,

203
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,720
I would've killed him

204
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,560
to defend your honor.

205
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,630
Dad, don't worry.

206
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,630
I've dealt with it all.

207
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,120
I'm troubled no more.

208
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,440
You may not be troubled,

209
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,630
but the Xu family will be in big trouble now.

210
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,840
Stop complaining.

211
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,080
Master,

212
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,390
I don't mind

213
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,600
Wanning's staying.

214
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,270
But you can't ignore Wanzhen and Qingyuan.

215
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,910
Wanning's reputation is ruined.

216
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,270
What if it affects their marriage prospects?

217
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,200
Nonsense!

218
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,270
My daughter suffered injustice.

219
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,000
The Xu family will naturally shield her.

220
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,790
In the future,
if Wanzhen and Qingyuan suffers,

221
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,270
we'll receive them just the same.

222
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,910
Moreover,

223
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,440
I proclaim seriously

224
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,470
that from now on,

225
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
whoever makes Wanning

226
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,390
and Chang'an suffer even the slightest

227
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,840
will face my wrath.

228
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,670
I'll protect them with my all.

229
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,320
Master Xu,

230
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,080
the authorities found

231
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,550
prohibited Hongzhen Incense

232
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,120
aboard your merchant vessels.

233
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,150
You're suspected of illegal trading.

234
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,870
We need you to come with us.

235
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,160
Officers.

236
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,910
It must be a misunderstanding.

237
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,320
Since I started doing business

238
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,320
I've always followed the law in my business

239
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,870
and never dealt with prohibited goods.

240
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,890
How could there be Hongzhen Incense?

241
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,960
That's right, Lord Pei.

242
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,240
Could there be a mistake?

243
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,030
The Jinlin Guards uphold justice fairly.

244
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,000
We don't arrest without solid evidence.

245
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,870
Wait.

246
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,990
Lord Pei,

247
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,790
my father's integrity is well known.

248
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,360
He would never do such a thing.

249
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,720
Don't worry.

250
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
If your father is innocent,

251
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,390
I'll definitely clear his name.

252
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,960
Things are complicated right now,

253
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,630
and I need some time.

254
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,800
Daddy,

255
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,470
go with them and try not to worry.

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,480
Our conscience is clear.

257
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,960
I believe the Jinlin Guards

258
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,750
will prove your innocence.

259
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,960
Mm.

260
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,560
Take him.

261
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,750
Mother.

262
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,510
Mother.

263
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,670
Lady Xu, actually,

264
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,030
Commander Pei worked hard

265
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,480
to protect your father.

266
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,720
Your father was facing immediate conviction,

267
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,480
but Commander staked his own future
to vouch for him.

268
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,210
He made a military pledge to His Majesty,

269
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,550
thus securing a month to investigate.

270
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,600
If he can't find crucial evidence
within a month,

271
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,360
not only will your father face grave danger,

272
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,440
but the Commander will be implicated too.

273
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,270
Xu Wanning,

274
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,240
you think
killing me will be the end of it?

275
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,550
You will pay for this!

276
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,870
Someone will come after you for me.

277
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,600
(I disrupted the Hongzhen Incense trade,)

278
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,630
(so the person behind it
wants to hurt my father.)
