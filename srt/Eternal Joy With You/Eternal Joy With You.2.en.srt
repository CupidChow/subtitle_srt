00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,300
=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 2=

2
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,430
Madam Xu,

3
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,960
in broad daylight,

4
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,750
what are you doing hiding here?

5
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,230
I...

6
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
In broad daylight,

7
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,840
why are you barging
into a lady's boudoir?

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,350
This is your room?

9
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,330
Men and women should keep a distance.

10
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,950
Please leave at once.

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,710
Answer me truthfully.

12
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,760
I might spare your life.

13
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,480
I've missed you so much.

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,520
Hurry up.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,790
Shh.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,510
Why so impatient?

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,310
Leaving your undergarments
in such a visible spot.

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,680
Come on.

19
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,910
Put it on.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,350
If I put it on now,

21
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,230
you'll ruin it later.

22
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,990
What's wrong?

23
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,680
Don't you like it?

24
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,550
You're so naughty.

25
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,680
(According to popular rumor,)

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,150
(Commander Pei of the Jinlin Guards,)

27
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,590
(ranked only second to His Majesty,)

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,100
(possesses unparalleled martial arts,)

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,840
(yet suffers from impotence.)

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,760
(Letting him witness this)

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,180
(might be agonizing,)

32
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,920
(perhaps it's better not
to let him hear it.)

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,560
(Madam Xu catching her husband
in an affair)

34
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,360
(must be agonizing for her.)

35
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,310
(Better to take her away quickly.)

36
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,240
Hey.

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,080
Let's go.

38
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,320
Speak.

39
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,550
What are you sneaking around
in someone else's room for?

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,430
I was just delivering some incense.

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,240
What about you?

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,880
Aren't you also in someone else's room?

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,080
Comman...

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,920
Young Master.

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,400
(He's deliberately hiding his identity.)

46
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,190
In broad daylight, you wear a mask,

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,710
hiding yourself from sight.

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,750
Could it be

49
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,430
that you two climbed over the wall
to steal something?

50
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,870
No need.

51
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,800
Commander.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,160
She runs, but the Mansion remains.

53
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,430
I'll go there to arrest her.

54
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,310
No need.

55
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,000
I want to see

56
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,470
what she can do

57
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,800
under my watch.

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,430
(Xu Wanning,)

59
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,910
(the most cunning woman in the capital.)

60
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,120
(Interesting.)

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,990
(Luckily, he didn't follow me again.)

62
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,870
(No matter what,)

63
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,890
(it's better not to meet)

64
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,360
(that cold-faced Yama again.)

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,200
My Lady,

66
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,120
the pharmacy delivered a batch
of Guiku Herb.

67
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,560
Have a few people make them
into sachets.

68
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,060
Each servant and maid in the courtyard

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,120
carries one with them.

70
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,280
Yes, My Lady.

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,380
The matter with the midwife
happened too long ago

72
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,410
and still needs some time.

73
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,990
It's getting chilly in late autumn,

74
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,800
please keep warm.

75
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,430
Thank you.

76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,850
- Go now.
- Alright.

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,710
That wretch

78
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,150
died in the first snow six years ago.

79
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
It's already late autumn.

80
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
I must hurry.

81
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,550
I must do it before the snow falls.

82
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,870
Did you place the incense
I asked you to put

83
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,720
in Xu Wanning's room?

84
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,430
I did it long ago.

85
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,160
But today, she seemed a bit unusual.

86
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
Early this morning,

87
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,440
she said she was going to the pharmacy.

88
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,400
It seems

89
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,660
it's starting to take effect.

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,950
Once she contracts Corpse Blossom Rash,

91
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,000
she won't be able to go out anymore.

92
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,600
By then,

93
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,920
I can see Ping every day.

94
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,670
By the way,

95
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,430
how has Ping been lately?

96
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,510
Has he mentioned me?

97
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,270
Apart from some restless sleep,

98
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,310
everything else is as usual.

99
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,500
I have some fine incense here,

100
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,990
which can calm the mind and aid sleep.

101
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,160
You take it to him to use.

102
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,560
Can a child use incense?

103
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,780
Wanning never lets him near such things.

104
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,040
She's just unwilling to spend it
on the child.

105
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,480
He is not her biological child.

106
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,160
It's always different in such cases.

107
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,230
Alright.

108
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,160
I'll use it for him when I return.

109
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,000
Is that OK?

110
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,920
(Guiku Herb can prevent
the Corpse Blossom Rash.)

111
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,670
(In this lifetime,)

112
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,870
(I won't let you succeed.)

113
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,100
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,270
My face!

115
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,870
Ping,

116
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,000
what's wrong?

117
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,830
What's wrong with your face?

118
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,320
(This scent...)

119
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,830
(Could it be that Cui Qingping used it?)

120
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,910
Ping.

121
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,040
Ping.

122
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
Let me see.

123
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,310
Your face.

124
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,360
Wanning,

125
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,680
as a mother,

126
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,390
how do you take care of your child?

127
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,190
How dare you! As a mother,

128
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,610
you failed in caring for the child.

129
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,330
And you still dare to hit your husband.

130
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,680
Have you no sense of propriety?

131
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,160
I repeatedly reminded him

132
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
that Ping is frail

133
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,630
and his room must not be scented.

134
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,960
What is this?

135
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,240
What kind of incense is this?

136
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,360
Feng,

137
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,680
what did you use?

138
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,630
Mother, this incense isn't mine.

139
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,720
Bai Qingqing insisted on it.

140
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,560
Enough.

141
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,920
This is not the time to blame anyone.

142
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,190
What matters now is Ping's condition.

143
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,800
Have you called for a doctor?

144
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,800
Ping just has some spots on his face.

145
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,600
A few doses of medicine should heal him.

146
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,880
Ping,

147
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,040
I will get your medicine, alright?

148
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,560
No, I don't need your help.

149
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,160
You're not my mother. Go away.

150
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,480
Ping.

151
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,870
I've worked tirelessly to raise you.

152
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,680
If I'm not your mother,

153
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,070
then who is?

154
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
Tell me.

155
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,350
Fine.

156
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,590
Since that's the case,

157
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,270
I'll be leaving, alright?

158
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,000
Wanning, don't take it to heart.
He's just a child.

159
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
He's sick and talking nonsense.

160
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,040
Wanning,

161
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,720
you are his mother.

162
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,360
Now that he is ill,

163
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,190
you can't just stand by

164
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,240
and do nothing.

165
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,360
I don't understand medicine.

166
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,480
He is sick.

167
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,780
We should leave it to the doctor.

168
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,750
I certainly won't stand idly by.

169
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,070
I'll go to the temple

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
and pray that Ping gets better soon.

171
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,310
(That's right.)

172
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,160
(It was the same in the previous life.)

173
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,800
(Ping fell ill.)

174
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,770
(We went to the temple
to draw divination lots,)

175
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,430
(but it turned out to be a trap
of usurping the nest.)

176
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,760
Master.

177
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,120
If you wish for your child's safety,

178
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,870
the person in blue can help you.

179
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,070
The person in blue can help us?

180
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,430
The person in blue?

181
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,160
Master, who is she?

182
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,240
This is

183
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,830
a lay disciple who practices
in the temple.

184
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,320
Since fate has brought you together,

185
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,800
why not let her stay at the mansion
for a few days,

186
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,370
copying scriptures and chanting prayers,

187
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,750
and bringing blessings to you?

188
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,910
Wanning,

189
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,190
this is heaven's will.

190
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,270
The person in Blue is right
before our eyes.

191
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,510
Miss,

192
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,630
the Master said you are the savior
of our family.

193
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
I beg you to save my child.

194
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,200
Thank you.

195
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,150
The divination lot seems to suggest

196
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,510
that our family must welcome a woman
into our home.

197
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,550
Only then can this calamity be averted.

198
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,750
Really?

199
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,710
Who?

200
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
It's her.

201
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,120
Miss, what is your name?

202
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,150
I am Bai Qingqing.

203
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
And you are?

204
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,960
I am the Madam of the Marquis's Mansion.

205
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,150
I am Xu Wanning.

206
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,390
This is my husband, Cui Yunfeng.

207
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,790
This is Lady Cui.

208
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,390
Greetings, Lady Cui.

209
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,720
Greetings, Marquis Cui.

210
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Madam.

211
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,120
Qingqing,

212
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,550
I have a request to make.

213
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,960
I would like you

214
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,480
to move into the Marquis's Mansion

215
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,240
and become my husband's

216
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,510
sworn sister.

217
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,960
Sworn sister?

218
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,110
Hmm.

219
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,030
My Lady,

220
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,100
if the Marquis were
to marry his sworn sister

221
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,550
to bring Miss Bai into the household,

222
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,790
I'm afraid it might invite gossip
from outsiders.

223
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,510
Hongmei,

224
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,790
Qingqing

225
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,510
is a noble lady who can assist Ping.

226
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,630
Does it really matter
what outsiders say?

227
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,030
Qingqing, don't overthink it.

228
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,840
Hongmei is only thinking of you.

229
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,870
After all, you're still a maiden.

230
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,240
Reputation is indeed important.

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,550
What are you suggesting, Madam?

232
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,720
How about this?

233
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,480
You swear before Buddha today,

234
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,910
promising to remain pure
as siblings for life

235
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,720
and never betray me. What do you think?

236
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,270
Wanning,

237
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,200
do I really need to swear?

238
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,480
Indeed, Wanning.

239
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,750
I don't think it's necessary.

240
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,800
Mother,

241
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,320
you have always been devoted to Buddha.

242
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
You understand this best.

243
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,910
This still requires an oath.

244
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,200
Wanning, how should I do?

245
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,750
As for it...

246
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,080
Yunfeng, you swear like this:

247
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,840
you will maintain a pure relationship

248
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,390
with Qingqing in this lifetime

249
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,390
and never cross the line.

250
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,140
Otherwise,

251
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,390
you will be struck by lightning
and meet a terrible end.

252
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,840
This is all for Ping's sake.

253
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,870
Hurry up, Yunfeng.

254
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,080
Buddha is watching.

255
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,000
I, Cui Yunfeng, hereby swear,

256
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,550
I will remain pure
with my sworn sister Bai Qingqing,

257
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,590
and never cross the line.

258
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,190
Otherwise, may I be struck by lightning,

259
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,130
and meet a terrible end.

260
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,320
Why is it suddenly raining?

261
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,200
Qingqing.

262
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,670
Thank you, Qingqing.

263
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,510
Please.

264
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,360
Well...

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,150
I swear,

266
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,440
I will remain a pure relationship
with the Marquis

267
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
and never cross the line.

268
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,380
If I do, may I be struck by lightning,

269
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
and meet a terrible end.

270
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,550
Since that's the case,

271
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,150
from today onward,

272
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,440
you are the Marquis's sister,

273
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,870
and thus my sister as well.

274
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,600
It happens to be raining today,

275
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,120
so let's stay here,

276
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,510
and pray for Ping' well-being.

277
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,000
Tomorrow we'll return
to the Marquis's Mansion.

278
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,080
How does that sound?

279
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,390
Thank you again, Qingqing.

280
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,270
(This time,)

281
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,790
(since you're here,)

282
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,390
(don't think of leaving so easily.)

283
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,870
Wanning.

284
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,560
Wanning.

285
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,780
(Guanyin Hall)

286
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,790
Don't touch me.

287
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,030
Wasn't I supposed to be a noble lady?

288
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,630
How did I become your sworn sister?

289
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,510
It's just a title, nothing more.

290
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,270
Once you enter the Mansion,

291
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,510
you can see Ping and me every day.

292
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,600
That's what truly matters.

293
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,910
Alright, don't be upset.

294
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,510
Then I'll serve you properly

295
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,710
right here in front of Buddha.

296
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,950
Buddha, please forgive me.

297
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,360
I dare not act recklessly.

298
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,480
I will never disrespect you again.

299
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,710
Buddha, please forgive me.

300
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,940
Buddha, please forgive me.

301
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,510
Yunfeng, are you alright?

302
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,440
Don't touch me.

303
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,720
Go, fetch me a pair of trousers.

304
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,040
Alright.

305
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
(What a scoundrel.)

306
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,250
(Let's see if you dare to meet her
in the temple.)

307
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,550
Buddha, please forgive us.

308
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,960
It's you.

309
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,480
I didn't expect you
to be so knowledgeable,

310
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,910
even having expertise
in such an obscure skill

311
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,790
as making cannons
with sulfur and bamboo tubes.

312
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,790
I am the Marquis's wife.

313
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,840
It's so late.

314
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,230
You don't belong here.

315
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,110
Shh.

316
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,870
Keep your voice down.

317
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,510
If someone outside hears you,

318
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,670
they might think
you're having an affair.

319
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,750
What are you doing here?

320
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,000
You are well-versed in medicine.

321
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,320
Now you're acting suspiciously.

322
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,120
Do you have forbidden medicine on you?

323
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,580
How could I possibly have something
like that?

324
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,440
I'll find out soon enough.

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,840
