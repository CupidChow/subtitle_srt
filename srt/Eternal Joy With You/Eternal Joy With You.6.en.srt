=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 6=

2
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,200
You're calling her mother?

3
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,200
Auntie is my mother, not you.

4
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,960
How could you claim someone else

5
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,250
as your mother before all the witnesses?

6
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,680
Could it be that the recent rumors

7
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,350
are true?

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Wanning,

9
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,640
it's just a child's angry words.

10
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,200
Don't take it seriously.

11
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,150
That's right.

12
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,680
It must be that Ping's spent much time

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,400
with Qingqing and developed

14
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,680
affection for her.

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,070
She's like a mother to him.

16
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,350
Madam Xu,

17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,710
please don't be angry.

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,120
I've grown closer to Ping lately,

19
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,770
and I can't bear to see him punished.

20
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,790
He just misspoke just now.

21
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,920
Please stop scolding Ping.

22
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,330
Ping,

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,070
go apologize to your mother.

24
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,000
- Go now.
- Mother, I don't want her.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
I don't want her.

26
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,750
Nonsense!

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,710
Who is your mother?

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,120
Enough.

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,710
The rumors are getting out of hand,

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,840
and there's been such a scene today.

31
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,950
If word gets out,

32
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,360
it'd not only tarnish the name of the Marquis

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,040
but also jeopardize mother's selection
for First-Rank Lady.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
To put an end to the rumors,

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,280
we must demolish them entirely.

36
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,430
How about this?

37
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,910
Since Ping is my child,

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,490
why not perform a test to prove it?

39
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,680
So that everyone will know

40
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,430
who Ping's mother truly is.

41
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,080
That will silence them.

42
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,710
And let Ping know

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,470
who his real mother is.

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,300
Wanning, there is no need for this.

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,430
Leave the rumors for me to handle.

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,800
Do you have a better solution?

47
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,560
Wanning,

48
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,360
forget about this blood-test idea.

49
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,280
I don't think that method is reliable.

50
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,240
What if something goes wrong?

51
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,870
Won't that invite even more ridicule?

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,630
I do have a solution.

53
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,240
Physician Pei.

54
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,630
Since you could cure Ping's illness,

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
surely you can solve this as well.

56
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
What method do you propose?

57
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,240
Just drip the blood of Madam Xu,

58
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,400
Young Master Ping, and Miss Qingqing

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,520
into water.

60
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,590
Whoever the real mother is,

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,400
her blood will merge with his.

62
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,710
In that way,

63
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,590
the truth will reveal itself.

64
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,910
Excellent. I'll go first.

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Qingqing?

66
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Don't you want

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,360
to clarify the rumors for the Marquis?

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,520
Ping.

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't want to. It hurts.

70
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,430
Enough.

71
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,150
A blood-test to prove the kinship?

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,560
If word gets out, it will be a laughingstock.

73
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,750
Xu Wannning,

74
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,190
could it be that you've
planned this all along?

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,310
Deliberately telling everyone
that Ping is not your child,

76
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,540
using it to abandon Ping

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,750
and elope with the physician?

78
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,120
I wondered why she's been so close

79
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,000
to the physician lately.

80
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,750
Turns out you had other intentions.

81
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,270
If you are afraid to do it, just admit it.

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,830
How dare you turn around and blame us?

83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,750
What's there for us to be afraid of?

84
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,390
You're the unfaithful one.

85
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,800
Just like before.

86
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,870
Marquis, perhaps you should look at this

87
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,870
before accusing others.

88
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,560
This was found in your study.

89
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
As for whose it is,

90
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,680
I believe Miss Qingqing

91
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,160
should be able to tell.

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,270
If any of you'd like more evidence,

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have more to show.

94
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,560
Very well.

95
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,190
What fine sworn siblings.

96
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,360
So you've been deceiving me all along.

97
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,390
One is the husband I trusted,

98
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,920
the other is the sister I treated
with kindness.

99
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,070
How could you do such things?

100
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,480
Wanning,

101
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,070
this is a misunderstanding.

102
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,070
Misunderstanding?

103
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,200
Mother,

104
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,390
the evidence is right here.

105
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,430
How could you say that?

106
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,270
That's enough.

107
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,870
It's normal for a man to have concubines.

108
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,320
Besides,

109
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,680
I am a Marquis.

110
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,190
Must I remain faithful to only you for life?

111
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,480
Cui Yunfeng,

112
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,120
you've finally admitted the truth.

113
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,240
Then tell me this.

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,750
Is Ping truly my child

115
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,270
or hers?

116
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,270
Ping is, of course, your child.

117
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,750
What does my affair with Qingqing

118
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,510
have to do with Ping?

119
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,510
You carried him and gave birth to him.

120
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,630
I gave birth to him?

121
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,310
What a coincidence.

122
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,240
Days ago, I ran into the midwife
who delivered my baby.

123
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,480
She said that the child had a birthmark.

124
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,360
Is the birthmark on Ping

125
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,920
even real?

126
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,160
Speak!

127
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,360
You bunch of liars.

128
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,870
Ping is not my child at all.

129
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,800
Tell me.

130
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,270
Where did you hide my child?

131
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
Wanning.

132
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,830
We kept this from you

133
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,560
for fear of hurting you.

134
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,830
Back when you gave birth,

135
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,750
the child was a stillborn.

136
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,310
We brought Ping here

137
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,040
because we didn't want you to be sad

138
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,190
and wanted you to recover quickly.

139
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,560
A stillborn?

140
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,240
Our family has never been unfair to you.

141
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,240
Now that you're being so unreasonable,

142
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,270
where does that leave our reputation?

143
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,750
Since mother has said so,

144
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,920
I believe you.

145
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,160
However,

146
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,510
if you want me not to drop it,

147
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,160
in this residence,

148
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,750
Ping can only have me as his mother.

149
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,080
Fine.

150
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,310
I will settle this as you wish.

151
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,920
I need to get some fresh air.

152
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,120
Madam Xu.

153
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,320
Cuiyun,

154
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,310
confine Bai Qingqing

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,430
and let her reflect on her actions.

156
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,670
Lady Cui,

157
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
I know my mistake.

158
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,480
I won't do this again.

159
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,680
Please, don't confine me.

160
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,600
Marquis.

161
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,500
You are to blame

162
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,680
for causing such trouble.

163
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,360
Mother wants you to reflect,

164
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,870
so reflect properly.

165
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,830
Take her away.

166
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,920
Thank you for your help, Commander.

167
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,310
While the test is a farce,

168
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,720
it did help you sound them out.

169
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,760
About the one you were looking for…

170
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,310
Just as you said.

171
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,800
I did some thinking.

172
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,790
The incense burner in Cui Qingping's room

173
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,240
belonged to Cuiyun, Lady Cui's maid.

174
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,270
You don't need to tell me that.

175
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
Indeed.

176
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,510
Madam Xu probably wouldn't believe

177
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,080
Lady Cui's words easily.

178
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,750
(Since they care so much about reputation,)

179
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,240
(I must put on a good show.)

180
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,100
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

181
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,390
Isn't that the Marquis's wife?

182
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,150
What's going on here?

183
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,550
Yes, it looks festive.

184
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,750
Madam, what happy occasion is this?

185
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
I, Xu Wanning, am beating this gong

186
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,270
not only to gather everyone here

187
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,360
for some excitement,

188
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,840
but also to tell you some stories
about the Cui Family.

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,670
Xu Wannning, what are you doing?

190
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,840
What stories?

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,840
Yunfeng,

192
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
our family is renowned and respected

193
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,840
throughout Yan City.

194
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,630
So I want to tell everyone

195
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,750
all the good deeds you've done
over the years.

196
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,750
Wanning,

197
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,670
are you going to drag the family
through the mud like this?

198
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,670
You forced me into this.

199
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,790
If my husband and mother-in-law are willing

200
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,440
to answer my question,

201
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,150
I won't need to tell stories here.

202
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,040
Fine.

203
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll tell you everything

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,390
you want to know.

205
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,600
Since Lady Cui has said so,

206
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,910
I still want to tell everyone

207
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,320
about the good news in our family.

208
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,240
- Xu Wannning.
- The good news is

209
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,240
that in three days,
it'll be Lady Cui's birthday,

210
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,320
and we want to invite everyone in the city

211
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,840
to come and celebrate with us.

212
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,910
Everyone, what do you say?

213
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,550
Great!

214
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,510
We will see you in three days.

215
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,160
Mother.

216
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,120
All right.

217
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,820
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

218
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,080
Where is my child?

219
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,910
You'd better tell me right now.

220
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
Wanning,

221
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,510
Mother just fainted.

222
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,630
I don't know either.

223
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,170
Are you sure you won't tell me?

224
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,910
I'll kill you.

225
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
Xu Wannning, you're crazy.

226
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,870
You drove me to it!

227
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,750
Stop it.

228
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,960
Mother, awake already?

229
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,440
Xu Wanning,

230
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,240
you certainly have your methods.

231
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,800
Fine.

232
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,390
I can tell you.

233
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,600
But I have no idea

234
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,380
whether that child is alive or dead.

235
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,020
Beat him!

236
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,390
Don't hold back!

237
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,790
Leaving a newly born baby in such a place,

238
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,870
you people are so heartless.

239
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,870
When the child was born,

240
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,840
he was barely alive.

241
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,840
The doctor examined him and said

242
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,100
he was likely dull-witted
and couldn't be raised.

243
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,030
How could our esteemed family

244
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,440
accept such a legitimate heir?

245
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,340
Mother then ordered someone to take him away.

246
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,530
According to that person,

247
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,030
he was abandoned here.

248
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,030
You'd better pray he's still alive.

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,030
If he didn't survive,

250
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,750
it has nothing to do with me.

251
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,000
Kids, could you come over here?

252
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,000
That child

253
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,510
died in the first snow six years ago.

254
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,750
It's snowing.

255
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,750
