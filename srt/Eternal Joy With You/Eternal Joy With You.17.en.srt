=Episode 17=

2
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,560
Hongmei, where is Chang'an?

3
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,920
My Lady, I heard
about what happened last night

4
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,150
and came here at dawn.

5
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,350
Young Master Chang'an is still sleeping.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,560
Then wait here for me.

7
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,400
All right.

8
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,070
Perfect timing.

9
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,510
I have found a way to free your father.

10
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
Really?

11
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,590
I've discovered the Prefect's death
is connected to the Prince.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
With that, we can clear your father's name.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,560
But we can't yet shake the Prince's power.

14
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,910
We still need more evidence.

15
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,520
Wanning.

16
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,460
I...

17
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,700
I want to talk to you.

18
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,020
It seems our thoughts are the same.

19
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,340
Our marriage was decreed by the Emperor.

20
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,370
It was the best makeshift solution.

21
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,460
Have you ever asked about my feelings?

22
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,580
This is the gentleman's agreement I've made.

23
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,500
From now on,

24
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,820
this will be the home for you and Chang'an.

25
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,020
In this home,

26
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,140
I will cherish

27
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,540
and respect you,

28
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,820
and never force you to do anything
against your will.

29
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,540
I only hope

30
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,820
you'll let me stay by your side.

31
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,220
Wanning,

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,700
I have feelings for you.

33
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,740
It's not that I don't have feelings for you.

34
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,940
Commander,

35
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,300
you've done so much for me,

36
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,780
and I know it well.

37
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,700
But for now,
I can't think about such things.

38
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,020
My father is still unjustly imprisoned.

39
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,740
All I wish for is his safety.

40
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,820
Still, rest assured.

41
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,250
As long as you need me,

42
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,620
I will always be by your side.

43
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,740
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

44
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,580
Simply having you near

45
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,820
makes me happy.

46
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,300
Then...

47
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,940
Would you like to freshen up a bit?

48
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,140
Let's go bring your father home.

49
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,780
Okay.

50
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,620
Come on.

51
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,300
Step aside. This is my wife.

52
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,100
Father.

53
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,340
We're here to take you home.

54
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,060
I can go home?

55
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,580
They released me?

56
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,660
Yes.

57
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,940
We've found proof

58
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,540
that you were framed

59
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,700
by the deceased prefect.

60
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,700
Thank you, Commander Pei

61
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,250
for clearing my name
and proving my innocence.

62
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,740
Please rise.

63
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,580
Father,

64
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,060
he's your son-in-law.

65
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,660
To clear your name,

66
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,920
he spared no effort,

67
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,820
worrying day and night.

68
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,740
But this is also his duty.

69
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,380
So, such formality isn't necessary.

70
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,300
Son-in-law?

71
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,060
That can't be.

72
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,100
Why not?

73
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,500
Right, dear?

74
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,140
I greet my father-in-law.

75
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,540
You honor me.

76
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,020
Father, let's go home.

77
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,140
Rest well,

78
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,740
and I'll explain everything later.

79
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,590
All right.

80
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,580
- Let's go.
- Please.

81
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,340
Come on.

82
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,780
I've sent my father home.

83
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,260
He wanted you to stay for dinner.

84
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,540
I have matters to attend to today.

85
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,900
Let me send you back first.

86
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,540
Thank you for today.

87
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,220
How formal you've become.

88
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,780
You weren't like this just now.

89
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,380
I just worried Father would be concerned.

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,980
Well,

91
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,660
I wonder how you want to thank me.

92
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,940
Stop it.

93
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,660
How will you thank me?

94
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,730
I...

95
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,580
All right.

96
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,620
I'm very pleased with this thanks.

97
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,900
Stop smiling.

98
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,180
Hmm.

99
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,660
Aunt Ning, we've finished writing.

100
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,340
(Xu Wanning, Pei Heng)

101
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,060
(Xu Wanning, Pei Heng)

102
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,620
What is this?

103
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,340
Is this how I taught you?

104
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,500
If you keep writing nonsense like this,

105
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,580
I won't teach you anymore.

106
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,980
Mother, we won't misbehave again.

107
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,380
Please teach us.

108
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,860
Aunt Ning, please don't be upset.

109
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,550
We'll write properly.

110
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,260
I don't believe you.

111
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,380
Anyway, I'm done teaching you.

112
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,300
I'm back.

113
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,900
- You're back.
- Master.

114
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,180
- Let me.
- Are you being good?

115
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,380
How's the investigation?

116
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,580
Still going.

117
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,500
Master, please appease Aunt Ning.

118
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,300
She's angry with us.

119
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,020
What happened?

120
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,020
We didn't write properly.

121
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,660
We'll do better next time.

122
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,540
Please help us.

123
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,420
Let me see what's written.

124
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,500
Children's scribbling. No need to look.

125
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,900
Go write now.

126
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,740
Go.

127
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,840
Right. I have a matter to discuss with you.

128
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,300
Chang'an and Ruyi are of the right age.

129
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,740
I think it's time for them to go to school.

130
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,660
Indeed.

131
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,860
Then,

132
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,860
let's send them to the Baima Academy.

133
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,820
All the capital's nobles

134
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,860
send their children there to study.

135
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,540
We should send Chang'an and Ruyi as well.

136
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,980
Baima Academy?

137
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,060
That's excellent.

138
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,820
Thank you for your help with this.

139
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,220
I'll handle it right away.

140
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,940
Right now?

141
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,780
Let me take a look.

142
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,060
(Xu Wanning, Pei Heng)

143
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,580
Children's scribbling. What's there to see?

144
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,260
You must be hungry. Freshen up a bit.

145
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,380
Time for dinner.

146
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,820
I saw it.

147
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,060
Tell me.

148
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,940
Was that gentleman's agreement I made

149
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,220
rather pointless?

150
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,260
Don't take children's scribbling seriously.

151
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
Of course I take it seriously.

152
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,580
We must commit fully to act properly, right?

153
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,220
Stop it. The children are watching.

154
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,060
Come on.

155
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,100
Practice well.

156
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,060
Chang'an, what's wrong?

157
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,420
Nothing.

158
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,380
Do you like this?

159
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,060
Did you pack all your writing materials?

160
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,200
Mm.

161
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,300
Today is your first day at the academy.

162
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,900
You must listen to the teacher

163
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,020
and treat your classmates well

164
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,020
with proper courtesy.

165
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,860
Understand?

166
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,760
Mm.

167
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,160
Got it, Aunt Ning.

168
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,340
Got it.

169
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:39,780
(Academy)

170
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,980
Be careful.

171
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,380
Mm.

172
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,020
Go ahead.

173
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,780
Bye-bye, Aunt Ning.

174
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,740
Keep in heart what I said.

175
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,860
Go on.

176
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Chang'an?

177
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,900
I took the children
to the academy this morning,

178
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,260
but they haven't returned home
since dismissal.

179
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,500
Don't worry. Let's look together.

180
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,520
Master.

181
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,420
Ruyi.

182
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,140
Why didn't you come home after class?

183
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,020
Where's Chang'an?

184
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,020
Chang'an was mocked,

185
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,740
so I got angry and wanted to fight them.

186
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,810
But Chang'an wouldn't let me.

187
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,650
Then he ran off to hide.

188
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,580
Where is he?

189
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,460
Over there?

190
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,220
Come on.

191
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,760
Chang'an, are you all right?

192
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,020
What happened?
Why didn't you come home?

193
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,300
Why did you get into a fight?

194
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,700
Did they bully you?

195
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,380
I'm asking you.

196
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,700
Speak.

197
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,260
Mother, I don't want
to go to school anymore.

198
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,940
Ruyi, what's going on?

199
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,660
The teacher asked Chang'an
to write about his father,

200
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,260
but Chang'an couldn't.

201
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,780
So the others mocked him

202
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,990
and teased him.

203
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,380
Chang'an,

204
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,980
I am your father.

205
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,580
But I heard you say

206
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,260
that you are a fake couple.

207
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,540
You are not my father.

208
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,740
Listen.

209
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,300
Your master and I...

210
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,940
Because of the decree,

211
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,030
- we are now...
- Chang'an.

212
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,700
You are my son.

213
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,660
We just quarreled that day.

214
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,900
Is that right?

215
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,820
Yes, dear.

216
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,740
We've already made up.

217
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,140
You're lying! Have you really made up?

218
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,380
Why don't you show us?

219
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,700
Get up first.

220
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,700
Do you believe now?

221
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,700
All right.

222
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,500
Now go home with your mother.

223
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,580
I have something to take care of.

224
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,540
What are you going to do?

225
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,340
Deal with those who bullied my son.

226
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,580
Let's go.

227
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,940
Happy now?

228
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,340
Come on.

229
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,980
I've invited you all today for tea

230
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,300
regarding my son Chang'an.

231
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,300
He studies at Baima Academy.

232
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,940
I've heard your children

233
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,660
attend as well.

234
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,500
I hope they can establish good fellowship

235
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,420
as classmates.

236
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,460
Lord Zhang,

237
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,300
I recall your son

238
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,540
called mine a street brat.

239
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,700
Did you teach him that?

240
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,700
No, no.

241
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,980
I wouldn't dare.

242
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,620
Best not.

243
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,820
Pour Lord Zhang more tea.

244
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,820
So he can go home and teach his boy

245
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,540
how to treat his peers.

246
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,700
Yes, yes.

247
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,740
Of course.

248
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,620
My son is ignorant.

249
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,540
I'll have him properly disciplined

250
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,660
to make sure he gets along well

251
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,940
with Chang'an.

252
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,260
I'm glad to hear it.

253
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,300
Otherwise, next time,

254
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,980
I'll handle it personally.

255
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,580
I don't hold back.

256
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,780
Yes, yes.

257
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,740
Understood.

258
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,180
Pei Heng!

259
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,260
This isn't over.

260
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,300
Though we fear you,

261
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,380
His Majesty

262
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,700
still keeps you in check.

263
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,480
Mother.

264
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,360
Aunt Ning.

265
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,230
You're home.

266
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,230
Wash your hands. It's time to eat.

267
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,380
Chang'an looks very happy today.

268
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,380
Getting along well with your classmates?

269
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,140
Father took care of everything.

270
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,660
Chang'an.

271
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,360
What?

272
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,500
Master said he is my father.

273
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,820
That's not appropriate to say.

274
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,460
By the way, Hongmei.

275
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,380
Where is Commander Pei?

276
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
I saw Mohan with medicine today.

277
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,540
It seems the Commander is injured.

278
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,820
You take care of them.

279
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,780
- Okay.
- Eat well.

280
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,780
Mm.

281
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,180
Lord Zhang is really too much.

282
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,100
He joined others to accuse you
before His Majesty,

283
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,140
causing you to be punished.

284
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,540
Clearly his son bullied Chang'an first.

285
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,460
It doesn't matter. Just a scratch.

286
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,180
As long as Chang'an can study in peace,

287
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,260
it's worth it.

288
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,580
Does it hurt?

289
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,340
How come you're here?

290
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,820
