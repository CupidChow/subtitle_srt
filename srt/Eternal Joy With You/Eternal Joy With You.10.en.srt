=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 10=

2
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,080
My Lady,

3
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,520
still not OK?

4
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,990
That's not right.

5
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,990
All wrong.

6
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,130
None of them taste like
what Mother made.

7
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,470
Mother...

8
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,270
My Lady.

9
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,190
Mother.

10
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,150
I heard in the past two days

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,400
Xu Wanning has been trying
to make Bird's Nest Porridge.

12
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,710
She will come to me.

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,120
No one can resist something
like Hongzhen Incense.

14
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,990
Mother.

15
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,550
Wanning.

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,400
Mother,

17
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,640
I have carefully considered

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,510
what you and Yunfeng told me yesterday.

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,350
I think, after all, we are one family.

20
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,150
The past should be left in the past.

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,680
Let's get along well from now on.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,150
Wanning,

23
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,000
I know you are someone
who sees the bigger picture.

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,320
Thank you.

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,400
Mother,

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,170
there's something else
I'd like to trouble you with.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
What is it?

28
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,480
I really liked the Bird's Nest Porridge

29
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,400
you made for me yesterday.

30
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,360
I have looked for many cooks

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,430
and tried many methods.

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,960
But they can't recreate your taste.

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,680
What exactly did you put in it?

34
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,000
To make Bird's Nest Porridge,

35
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,240
the heat control is the key.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,120
If you like to drink it,

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,840
I can make it for you again.

38
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,360
Wouldn't that be too much trouble
for you?

39
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,520
I usually make it for myself as well.

40
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,360
I'll send you a bowl
when the time comes.

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,710
Thank you, Mother.

42
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,520
Wanning.

43
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,470
Mother.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,470
What's wrong, Wanning?

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,470
Mother.

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
Do you want to drink it?

47
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,000
I do, Mother.

48
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,990
How about this?

49
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,710
First, hand over the house key

50
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,630
you took from me.

51
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,840
From now on, I'll make it for you
every day.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,840
Alright.

53
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,120
Here, Mother.

54
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,330
There is one more matter.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,000
Did Commander Pei come to our house

56
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,150
to investigate Hongzhen Incense?

57
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,360
If you don't tell me,

58
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,680
you won't get to drink this porridge.

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,310
I'll tell you, Mother.

60
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,590
He came here to investigate it.

61
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,750
And he said

62
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,030
you have Hongzhen Incense.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,150
Could you help me with something?

64
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,310
Many thanks to you, Commander Pei.

65
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,070
We will be counting
on your care and support

66
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,360
in the future.

67
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,510
Lady Xu, you are too polite.

68
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,400
Please.

69
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,560
Wanning,

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,950
you really have not let me down.

71
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
Since he wants to investigate us,

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,950
then let him be addicted
to Hongzhen Incense

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,800
and go to hell himself.

74
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,040
Mother.

75
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,360
Mother,

76
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,750
give me another bowl
of Bird's Nest Porridge.

77
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,430
Wanning,

78
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,160
I will give you something even better.

79
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,360
Alright.

80
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,160
It turns out

81
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,560
you place Hongzhen Incense here.

82
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,680
It is truly not easy

83
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,190
to let you hand it over.

84
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,360
You all...

85
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,830
You are actually deceiving me.

86
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,500
Do you know

87
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,670
the consequences of being addicted
to Hongzhen incense?

88
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,520
I know.

89
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,660
Every time I drink it,
I immediately spit it out.

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,690
There really is Hongzheng Incense
in here?

91
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,560
That's what I was thinking.

92
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,630
Since Lady Cui used Hongzhen Incense
on me,

93
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,460
then let's simply play along
with her plan

94
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,000
and lure her into handing it over.

95
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,990
Since you've made up your mind,

96
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,560
then go ahead and do it.

97
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,370
But your life is the most important.

98
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,070
Don't worry.

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,190
Now I have Ruyi and Chang'an.

100
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,830
I do value my own life.

101
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,510
Alright.

102
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,430
You really have made
a grand strategic move.

103
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,560
Even I was deceived.

104
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,630
But how did you know

105
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,270
that I would believe you were addicted
to Hongzhen Incense?

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,340
Once a person reaches the end
of their rope,

107
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,170
they become anxious

108
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,290
and anxiety can easily cause them
to lose composure.

109
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,390
However, you're indeed wise.

110
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,720
I had to put in a lot of effort
to make you believe.

111
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,360
Once you come into contact with it,
you will become addicted.

112
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,510
I clearly saw you drink it.

113
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,680
Every time you brought the porridge,

114
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,510
I had someone change it on the way.

115
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,390
Even if I took a sip,

116
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,780
I would spit it out immediately.

117
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,750
So that's how it is.

118
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,240
It was my mistake.

119
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,350
Feng!

120
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,910
Lady Cui,

121
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,560
the evidence is conclusive now.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,190
Do you have anything to say?

123
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,270
I have nothing to say.

124
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,950
You'd better truthfully reveal

125
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,680
all your dealings in Yan City,

126
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,920
especially where exactly the Incense

127
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,680
comes from.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,750
Everything was done by me alone.

129
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,270
It seems you don't intend to confess.

130
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,040
When you and the Marquis buried him
at a mass grave,

131
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,150
did you ever think
he might still be alive?

132
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,720
He did tell us

133
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,150
that you often associate
with a man in black.

134
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,120
Who is that person?

135
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,200
Now that things have come to this point,

136
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,600
I am at your disposal.

137
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,840
It's just that

138
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,960
Feng has nothing to do with this matter.

139
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,910
Please investigate it carefully.

140
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,160
Xu Wanning, Xu Wanning,

141
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,550
if something really happened
to my mother and me,

142
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,510
would you be able to get away?

143
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,240
I will naturally divorce you.

144
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,270
In your dream!

145
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,360
Even if I go to hell,

146
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,870
I will drag you to die
with the Cui Family.

147
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,740
You...!

148
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,270
I'm afraid you will disappoint.

149
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,340
His Majesty has issued a decree.

150
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,580
Xu Wanning, receive the decree.

151
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,200
(Imperial Edict of Divorce?)

152
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,840
(Commander Pei is really capable.)

153
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,840
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees,

154
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,300
Xu Wanning, the Madam
of the Marquis's Mansion,

155
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,030
virtuous and kind, diligent and frugal
in managing the household,

156
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,550
yet her husband

157
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,320
harbors malicious thoughts
and disgraces the family reputation,

158
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,320
is permitted to dismiss your husband
and seek a better match.

159
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,670
Dismiss?

160
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,870
It is not a mutual divorce.

161
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,750
Why a mutual divorce?

162
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,130
A woman dismissing her husband?
Is that possible?

163
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,950
His Majesty shares the same view
as the common people.

164
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,770
He feels that a woman dismissing
her husband is unprecedented.

165
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,790
That's why I went to great lengths

166
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,320
to get this for you.

167
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,270
Why are you helping me?

168
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,000
You've already suffered enough.

169
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,480
I hope this imperial decree

170
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,390
could make you live fearlessly of gossip

171
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,600
in the days to come

172
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,320
and conduct yourself with integrity.

173
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,870
You no longer belong to this family now.

174
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,120
Not only that,

175
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,360
you can also take away all the dowry
you brought back then.

176
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,630
If even a tiny bit is missing,

177
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,320
it will be borne by the Cui Family.

178
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,390
How about it?

179
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,750
Good.

180
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,910
It couldn't be any better.

181
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,280
Many thanks.

182
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,120
If you don't speak up,

183
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,510
then the entire family will suffer.

184
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,960
Feng,

185
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,240
you must live well.

186
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,630
Remember to avenge me.

187
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,790
Mother, mother!

188
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,710
Mother!

189
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Mother!

190
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,670
Cui Yunfeng is suspected
of killing Ma Si

191
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,080
and inhaling Hongzhen Incense.

192
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,200
Take him away.

193
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,470
Yes.

194
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
Mother.

195
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,670
Mother.

196
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,630
Commander.

197
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,460
Their business involving the Incense
have been completely shut down.

198
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,690
Only no information
about the man in black was found.

199
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
But a letter was found.

200
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,080
From the Capital City.

201
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,860
(To Lady Cui)

202
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,350
Capital City?

203
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,460
It seems the person
behind the Cui Family,

204
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,550
the mastermind behind Hongzhen Incense,

205
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,990
is likely connected to someone
of high status in the Capital City.

206
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,670
Xu Wanning,

207
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,000
I have ended up in such a situation now.

208
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,440
You should have gotten
what you wished for.

209
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,080
Indeed.

210
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,000
I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.

211
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,910
Today, my wish has finally come true.

212
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,720
I've never seen a woman
as ruthless and vicious as you.

213
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,480
Even as a ghost, I will not let you go.

214
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,870
Then I will wait for you
to become a ghost.

215
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,700
In fact, I have been a ghost before.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,630
When I was a ghost,

217
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,510
I saw the Cui Family
inherit the title of Marquis,

218
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,960
and Cui Qingping pass the imperial exam
in his youth

219
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,960
and be rewarded by the Emperor.

220
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,000
For a time,

221
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,000
how glorious and prestigious
the Cui Family was!

222
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,600
Everything was just as you wished.

223
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,670
You had everything you wanted.

224
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,630
Except me.

225
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,020
I diligently managed the household.

226
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,580
I helped my husband and raised the child
for more than ten years.

227
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,390
But later on

228
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,550
I actually discovered that Cui Qingping
was not my child.

229
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,360
My child had long since died.

230
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,120
When I was a ghost, I still saw

231
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,440
each of you was happy and fulfilled,

232
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,510
while

233
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,080
the people closest to me

234
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,510
left me one by one,

235
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,670
and eventually I would die too.

236
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,000
This was your original plan, right?

237
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,390
So...

238
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,150
I...

239
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,750
am Xu Wanning, who has turned
into a vengeful ghost,

240
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,270
here to claim your lives.

241
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,960
Each one of you

242
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,720
must pay the price for your actions.

243
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,790
You must be crazy!

244
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,630
You're crazy!

245
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,200
Cui Yunfeng,

246
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,440
I advise you,

247
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,670
if you don't want to be tortured
too badly,

248
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,730
to tell everything you know

249
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,440
about Hongzhen Incense

250
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,680
as soon as possible.

251
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,720
Or you can kill me right now.

252
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,910
Anyway, even if I die,
I will never tell you.

253
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,510
Then just wait here to die.

254
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,110
Xu Wanning,

255
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,270
do you think killing me will be the end?

256
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,670
You will face retribution.

257
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,750
Someone will deal with you on my behalf.

258
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:38,540
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

259
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,960
Please accept this kneel.

260
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,960
If it weren't for you rescuing Ping,

261
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,200
I'm afraid we would have been separated
from then on.

262
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,000
How is your son doing?

263
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,790
He was a bit frightened yesterday
and is still sleeping.

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,390
I plan to take him away from here.

265
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Get up.

266
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,270
From now on, you and I
have no further ties.

267
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,960
I hope you can live well with your son.

268
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
From this day forward,

269
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,250
we are separated by mountains and rivers

270
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,360
and we may never meet again.

271
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,390
There is one thing I feel you must know.

272
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,750
Cui Yunfeng once personally told me

273
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,270
back at the Begonia Poetry Gathering,

274
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,150
you accidentally inhaled the aphrodisiac
he had set up.

275
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,870
But by the time he arrived,

276
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,200
you had already...

277
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,560
Already what?

278
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,200
You had already lost your virginity.

279
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,030
That day, nothing happened between you.

280
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,740
Later, you married into the Cui Family

281
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,790
and you never consummated the marriage
in six years.

282
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,620
The reason was that he thought
you were dirty.

283
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,120
He would never touch a woman

284
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,960
who had been touched by another man.

285
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,880
I think you have the right
to know the truth,

286
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,270
so I came especially to tell you.

287
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,600
It's considered as repaying my guilt.

288
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,960
Take good care of yourself.

289
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,030
Got it.

290
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,340
- Thank you.
- Mm.

(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

292
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,680
What are you thinking about?

293
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,830
Nothing.

294
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,550
It's not important anymore.

295
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,680
It's all over anyway.

296
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,070
What plans do you have for the future?

297
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,200
