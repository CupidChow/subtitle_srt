2
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,380
(Xu Residence)

3
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,750
How beautiful.

4
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,280
Wanning,

5
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,390
after you become the consort,

6
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,390
don't forget

7
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,710
your younger siblings.

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,880
Isn't that right, Wanzhen?

9
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,470
You're reaching marrying age.

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,920
As her sister, find her a fine young noble

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
among the royal clans.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,320
And your younger brother.

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,480
Remember to help his career.

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,560
Mother, why won't you let me go with you?

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,870
Chang'an, I have no choice.

16
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,480
Trust me.

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,710
Once it's settled,

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,510
I'll come back to get you.

19
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,310
Be good and wait for me, all right?

20
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,640
- Mm.
- All right.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,790
Get in the sedan chair.

22
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,040
Or we'll be late.

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,510
Help her up! Hurry!

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,240
Mother.

25
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,350
Chang'an, stop making trouble.

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,870
Your mother is going to enjoy a good life.

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,040
You should stay here.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,350
Don't be a burden to her.

29
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,550
Come on.

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,100
Raise the sedan chair

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:52,100
(Happiness)

32
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,460
(Xu Residence)

33
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,860
(Prince's Mansion)

34
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,070
All set?

35
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,680
Princess, as you ordered.

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,120
The poison is in the tea.

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,360
One sip

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,190
and her intestines will rot.

39
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,100
(Happiness)

40
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,300
(Prince's Mansion)

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,150
Sorry for the simple arrangement.

42
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,360
It's really a bit humble.

43
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,960
I don't mind these things.

44
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,030
We're getting married.

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,750
Maybe it's time you stopped being so formal.

46
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,670
Commander?

47
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,960
Do you really want to marry him?

48
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,610
I...

49
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,400
If you do,

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
you wouldn't hesitate.

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
Pei Heng!

52
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,910
I show you respect for your service

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,430
to the Emperor,

54
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,120
yet you show no manners at all.

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,430
How dare you
snatch my woman at my wedding?

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
You've been kneeling for a day and a night.

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,000
Do you love her that much?

58
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,560
I ask for nothing else.

59
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,800
Only Xu Wanning.

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,150
I understand what troubles Your Majesty.

61
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,710
I will certainly do my utmost

62
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,430
to find evidence of the Prince's crimes

63
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,120
and eliminate the hidden threat.

64
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,470
If I fail,

65
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,310
take my life.

66
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,470
You'd stake your life
for a divorced woman

67
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,910
with a child? Is it worth it?

68
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,480
To others, she is just a divorcée.

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,750
But to me,

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,750
she is extremely precious.

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,360
Even if I am shattered to pieces,

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,310
I will still protect her.

73
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,190
I have the Emperor's decree of marriage.

74
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,630
To defy it is death on the spot.

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,600
Don't hide behind authority to threaten me.

76
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,910
Hyah!

77
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,230
Get them!

78
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,680
- Mother.
- Aunt Ning.

79
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,920
Chang'an, why are you here?

80
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,870
I thought you didn't want me anymore.

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
So I came find Master.

82
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
Didn't I tell you

83
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,240
I'd come back for you?

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,630
Mother, are you married to Master now?

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,040
Can I call him Father?

86
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,800
It's a little complicated.

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,800
I'll explain it to you later, okay?

88
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,510
Aunt Ning, I'll go check on Master.

89
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,110
All right.

90
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,360
Mm.

91
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,360
Be careful.

92
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,230
Mm.

93
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,870
Mother, I want to sleep with you tonight.

94
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,830
Don't leave me again.

95
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,080
Okay.

96
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,720
Let's eat something first.

97
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,870
Then go to sleep, all right?

98
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,760
Mm.

99
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,640
Okay.

100
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,150
Master.

101
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,350
What is it?

102
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,270
Master, today is your wedding day.

103
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,950
I'd like to toast you.

104
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,240
Children shouldn't drink alcohol.

105
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,000
To celebrate. Just one shot.

106
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,960
(Celebrate...)

107
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,160
(Will she be happy?)

108
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,830
You drank it all?

109
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,630
Master, I'm so sleepy.

110
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,560
I want to sleep with Aunt Ning.

111
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,190
I want to sleep with Aunt Ning.

112
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,000
So easily tipsy, huh?

113
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,000
Your acting is a bit too fake.

114
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,150
Master, stay with me for a while.

115
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,150
Just for a little while.

116
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
A little while.

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
Mm.

118
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,240
Go to sleep now.

119
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,840
