00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,300
=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 22=

2
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,550
What's the matter?

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,110
My Lady,

4
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,670
these are shops under the name
of the Commander.

5
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,280
A total of eight.

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,440
They're all located
on the most bustling Zhuque Street.

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,660
There are also estates
under the name of the Commander.

8
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,030
Two are in the Capital City.

9
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,690
The other two are outside the Capital.

10
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,100
Every year there is a great harvest.

11
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,150
The profits are very good.

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,750
There are also silver notes
under the Commander's name

13
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,430
as well as all the gold and silver
he has deposited over the years.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,940
A total of more than 70,000 taels.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,440
There are also houses
under his name

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,430
and various rare treasures
bestowed by His Majesty over the years.

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,590
Altogether more than 300 items
of all sizes.

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,070
And then? What are you going to do?

19
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
The Commander has transferred
all of his property

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,870
under your name.

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,140
The land deeds and house deeds
have also been changed to your name.

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,120
And these rare treasures.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,290
Contracts for gifting them
have also been written.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,640
The Commander now has nothing left.

25
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,560
Nothing left?

26
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,350
Why did he give all these things to me?

27
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,710
The Commander just asked me
to give them to you.

28
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,640
I don't want them. Take them back.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,340
I'm only responsible
for delivering them.

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,200
If it hasn't been delivered,

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,940
the Commander will definitely
not spare me.

32
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,120
If you don't want it,

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,350
return it to the Commander yourself.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,400
Mohan!

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,040
I...

36
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,540
(Xiangyue Restaurant)

37
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,270
Your Highness,

38
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,240
someone from the Mansion
came to let you go back.

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,430
Let's hurry back.

40
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,540
Let me be alone for a while.

41
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,280
Your Highness, if you return late,

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
the Prince might not spare you.

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Let's go.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,920
Be careful.

45
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,150
I heard

46
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,800
Prince Feng had an affair
with another man's wife.

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,470
Silver filled the woman's house.

48
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,150
Prince Feng appears to be a gentleman,

49
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,710
but unexpectedly,
he is also a romantic man.

50
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,590
Previously,

51
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,360
the Prince even forcibly married a woman
who had divorced her husband.

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,680
He is really not a good person.

53
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,590
Your Highness.

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,710
Have you met...

55
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,680
What did you just say?

56
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,120
She is the Princess.

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,800
The Princess...

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,940
What nonsense are you saying?

59
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,810
Say that to me again.

60
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,250
Your Highness, spare my life.

61
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,800
I also heard it from others.

62
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,360
This news has now spread
throughout all of the city.

63
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,910
Why don't you listen?

64
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,310
Go, go, go.

65
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,470
Your Highness.

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Do you know

67
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,030
the Prince spent 10,000 taels of gold

68
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,870
to build a residence for his beauty?

69
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,750
This residence must be made
entirely of gold.

70
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,470
He always met with that woman

71
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,240
when her husband was away.

72
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,220
This really is knowing a face
but not the heart.

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,360
It is said

74
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,870
he and that woman
were childhood sweethearts.

75
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,710
Alas.

76
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,280
What a pity.

77
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,000
They were a pair of lovers
fated to be apart.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,680
(Storytelling venue)

79
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,560
Later,

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,150
after this woman left him,

81
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,800
unexpectedly, the Prince
went to find her.

82
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,950
You must have also heard rumors
about my uncle recently,

83
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,600
saying he has embezzled and accepted
many taels of silver,

84
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,830
and he harbors ill intentions.

85
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,480
Anyway, there are all kinds of rumors.

86
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,750
These memorials

87
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,190
are all for me to handle this matter.

88
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,160
What do you think?

89
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,440
If that is the case,

90
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,530
I believe it would be better
to take this opportunity

91
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,310
to investigate the Prince
openly and justly

92
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,030
in the name
of investigating all officials.

93
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,720
Since such rumors exist,

94
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,830
they are not without basis.

95
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
It can also eliminate hidden threats
in the court.

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,190
You're using this rumor tactic

97
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,680
quite well.

98
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,830
Well? Has the Commander returned?

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,800
My Lady, I have already checked
three times.

100
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,490
The Commander was summoned
by His Majesty.

101
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,440
We have to wait a while.

102
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,580
I'll go take a look later.

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,640
Alright.

104
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,030
Commander.

105
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,120
The servant said you have been waiting
for me to come home.

106
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,080
Yes.

107
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,120
I came to return this.

108
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,720
Now you won't even accept these?

109
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,880
Commander Pei,

110
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,870
you and I owe each other nothing.

111
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,430
You don't need to feel burdened.

112
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,750
As for this matter,

113
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,630
I need some time.

114
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,240
I think

115
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,270
we should deal with the matter
at hand first.

116
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,920
The matter about Hongzhen Incense,

117
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,680
we must not allow this thing
to continue harming the people.

118
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,020
The rumors about the Prince
were spread by me.

119
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,190
His Majesty summoned you to the palace
for this matter as well, right?

120
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,070
I hope I didn't cause you any trouble.

121
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,750
As long as it's you who did it,

122
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,190
then it's not trouble.

123
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,750
Besides, you actually helped me a lot.

124
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,040
However, Feng Zhengxin will definitely
not let this go.

125
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,070
What do you plan to do next?

126
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,950
Just wait.

127
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,390
He will come looking for me.

128
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,720
Look at what you've done.

129
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,750
Who allowed you to let Cui Yunfeng go

130
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,000
to deal with Xu Wanning?

131
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,390
I just can't stand her.

132
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,560
I want her to be utterly disgraced.

133
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,040
Now she is fine.

134
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,870
But I am about to be utterly disgraced.

135
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,110
Father,

136
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,360
are those rumors outside true?

137
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,910
What?

138
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,070
You believe them too?

139
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,430
It's just...

140
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,830
It's just that gossip is terrifying.

141
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,390
Xu Wanning is dealing with us
in this way right now.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,840
Father,

143
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,630
we must quickly come up with a solution.

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,560
Your Highness, bad news!

145
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,000
His Majesty suddenly issued an order

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,290
to investigate all the officials.

147
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,450
Even our mansion will be guarded
by the Jinlin Guards.

148
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,200
If that's the case,

149
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm afraid we will be under control.

150
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,270
His Majesty must have believed
those rumors.

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,750
This Xu Wanning

152
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,800
is truly not simple.

153
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,920
Since it has come to this point,

154
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,630
then we shall find a way
to get rid of her.

155
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,520
Yes.

156
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,140
(Commander's Mansion)

157
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,070
My Lady, there is a letter for you.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,870
It has indeed arrived.

159
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,910
Hongmei,

160
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,920
get ready. We're going out.

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,100
My Lady, the Commander
is investigating cases outside.

162
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,600
Should we wait for him to come back...

163
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,150
No need.

164
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,790
If so, it might be too late.

165
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,030
Let's go first.

166
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,000
- Alright.
- Let's go.

167
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,870
Madam Pei, you're truly impressive.

168
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I once had genuine feelings for you.

169
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,600
Now you show me no mercy at all.

170
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,840
Have you ever shown mercy
to the Xu Family?

171
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,390
If others do not offend me,

172
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,300
I will not offend them.

173
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,360
Do you need me to explain one by one

174
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,390
what you have done to my family?

175
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,360
What exactly do you want?

176
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,150
Do you remember this?

177
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,440
When I was at the Marquis's Mansion,

178
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,360
I already suspected

179
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,720
why the Marquis dislikes
Cui Yunfeng so much.

180
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,030
I thought he despised Cui Yunfeng
for being mediocre and incompetent.

181
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,150
Later, I found this on Cui Yunfeng.

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,550
Then I understood the reason behind it.

183
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,510
What are you trying to say?

184
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,000
You and Lady Cui are old acquaintances.

185
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,630
You met when you were young

186
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,900
and you loved her at first sight.

187
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,840
This is your token of love.

188
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,790
But in the end,
you chose power and influence

189
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,460
and married the Princess's mother.

190
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,750
Lady Cui, in a fit of anger,
married into the Cui Family.

191
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,240
Who told you all these things?

192
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,310
No matter when, such matters

193
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,250
will always be talked about
with great interest.

194
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,480
I can find out just by asking.

195
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,030
But you probably don't know

196
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,390
when Lady Cui married
into the Cui Family,

197
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,790
she was already pregnant.

198
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,080
Therefore,

199
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,360
Cui Yunfeng is your son, right?

200
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,720
All of this is nothing more
than your speculation.

201
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,200
If it is only speculation,

202
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,910
the rumors will naturally disappear.

203
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,990
Your Highness, what are you afraid of?

204
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,630
You came to see me today.

205
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,990
Isn't it because you fear
this matter will be confirmed?

206
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Where is Cui Yunfeng?

207
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,560
What?

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,960
Have you started to care
about your own son?

209
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,630
Or

210
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,200
are you in a hurry to find him
and silence him?

211
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,240
What do you mean?

212
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,080
Even if there was youthful affection,

213
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,240
Lady Cui

214
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,670
was nothing more
than a pawn in your career.

215
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,500
Before Lady Cui passed away,

216
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,300
she only told you
about Cui Yunfeng's matter,

217
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,360
hoping you would save him.

218
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,710
But for the sake of your career
and reputation,

219
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,030
you ignored him completely.

220
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,510
But in the end,

221
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,600
Cui Yunfeng was rescued by the Princess.

222
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,670
Your Highness, don't be angry.

223
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,120
I can give you Cui Yunfeng.

224
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,910
But I need you
to trade something for it.

225
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,200
What do you want?

226
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,630
All of our family's property
that you took away.

227
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,120
Madam Pei, you're truly not simple.

228
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,600
Then this deal,

229
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,200
are you going to do it or not?

230
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,240
You know I originally didn't
want Cui Yunfeng to live.

231
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,240
What if I don't save him?

232
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,910
Then your career and future

233
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,240
would be even more worrying.

234
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,320
Some time ago, because of the rumors,

235
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,170
it must have given you
quite a headache, right?

236
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,870
If an illegitimate child appears...

237
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,670
This is all the property
of the Xu Family.

238
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,840
Where is Cui Yunfeng?

239
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,110
Hongmei.

240
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,440
Your Highness, rest assured.

241
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
He is doing well.

242
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,240
I won't disturb your reunion.

243
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,540
I shall take my leave first.

244
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,820
- Go.
- Yes.

245
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,280
Hongmei,

246
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,550
I think Feng Zhengxin is unlikely

247
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,750
to let us go so easily.

248
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,770
Take this with you.

249
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,440
Hurry to the Xu Family.
I'll go that way.

250
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,110
My Lady.

251
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,840
There's not much time left, hurry.

252
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,080
What if you're in danger?

253
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,870
Don't worry. Someone will come
to save me.

254
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,750
Quick, quick!

255
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,390
Your Highness.

256
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,480
Xu Wanning,

257
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,480
you pride yourself on being clever.

258
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,750
Don't you understand

259
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,510
no matter what,

260
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,670
you are doomed?

261
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,270
It seems you never intend

262
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,080
to let me return alive today.

263
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,510
Xu Wanning,

264
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,750
you let him inhale Hongzhen Incense?

265
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,660
Your Highness, you misunderstood me.

266
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,360
It was he who lacked self-control

267
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
and got addicted to Hongzhen Incense.

268
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,930
It has nothing to do with me.

269
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,750
Your Highness, if you feel sorry
for your son,

270
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,150
then give him some.

271
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,870
What did you say? Son?

272
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,120
Your Highness, you still don't know.

273
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,840
Cui Yunfeng is your biological brother,

274
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,550
the Prince's biological son.

275
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,590
Father,

276
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,870
didn't you say those rumors
were all false?

277
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,750
Xiaoxiao,

278
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,910
I'll explain some things
to you clearly later.

279
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
I see.

280
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,150
You have been cold and distant

281
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,440
toward my mother.

282
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,900
It's all because in your heart,

283
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,510
it's always been Cui Yunfeng's mother.

284
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,920
Xiaoxiao,

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,990
I will definitely make it up to you
in the future.

286
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,150
Make it up? How will you make it up?

287
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,200
Can you bring my mother back to life?

288
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,390
Now

289
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,790
the culprit behind the rumors
is still here.

290
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,750
The top priority is to deal
with Xu Wanning first.

291
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,750
Your Highness,

292
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,840
how can you bear to do this?

293
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,480
It seems the Princess is also going
to become a pawn in your career.

294
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,040
Your Highness,

295
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,030
he is trying to pin all the killing
on you.

296
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,030
Even so,

297
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,790
I must kill you first.

298
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,720
Most of the Prince's Hongzhen Incense
has been sealed off.

299
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,560
I just didn't expect

300
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,720
a large amount of his silver
has been used for training troops.

301
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,670
I will report to the Emperor.

302
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,200
Send someone to keep watch.

303
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,720
Once any anomaly is found,

304
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,100
take them down in one move.

305
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,230
Yes.

306
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,480
We enter the palace now?

307
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,390
Let's go home first.

308
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,960
If it weren't for you,

309
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,360
things wouldn't have developed
to this point today.

310
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,600
Give me incense! Incense!

311
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,670
Feng!

312
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,440
(I didn't expect to be saved by him.)

313
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,630
Feng...

314
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,870
Xiaoxiao, kill this woman for me.

315
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,630
Xu Wanning,

316
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,670
I have always treated you
as a good friend.

317
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,720
But you hurt me again and again.

318
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,590
So

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,790
even if I kill you today,

320
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,510
it would be to avenge myself.

321
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,790
It's not that I am harming you.

322
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,030
It is you who forced yourself
onto this path.

323
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,240
You forced me.

324
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,720
Six years ago at the poetry gathering,

325
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,320
you committed a disgraceful act

326
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,720
at my birthday banquet.

327
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,720
It also implicated me.

328
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,630
From that time on,

329
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,720
Heng gradually distanced himself
from me.

330
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,960
I've been waiting.

331
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,910
I just wanted to spend more time
with Heng.

332
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,320
But why

333
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,480
is it that after six years,
the one he likes is you?

334
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,670
Why does he want to marry you,
but not me?

335
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,550
So your resentment toward me

336
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,630
is all because of him.

337
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,590
Yes.

338
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,470
So

339
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,910
I have already killed someone.

340
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,270
I don't care to kill one more of you.

341
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,790
If you are dead,

342
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,670
how could Heng still like you?

343
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,110
How is it? Are you hurt?

344
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,830
I'm fine. Did you see the mark
I left for you?

345
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,630
I came late.

346
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,320
Feng Xiaoxiao,

347
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,480
do you really think I wouldn't kill you?

348
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,390
Commander Pei,

349
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,160
if you want to kill my daughter,

350
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,030
you must first get my consent.

351
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,560
Your Highness,

352
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,160
even if I kill you right now,

353
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,680
His Majesty would not object.

354
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,070
Are you threatening me?

355
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,550
You know clearly what you have done.

356
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,880
His Majesty is now aware

357
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,070
of your private stockpiling of troops.

358
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,590
Awesome, Commander Pei.

359
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,400
You found out so quickly.

360
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:01,110
It seems now I really can't
let you live.

361
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,300
Whether I can live or not,

362
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,070
I'm afraid it's not up to you.

363
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,960
If the two of us can leave here today,

364
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,030
then you still have a way to live.

365
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
If not,

366
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,030
then you have no way out but death.

367
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,200
