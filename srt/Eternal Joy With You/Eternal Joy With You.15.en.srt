00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,300
=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 15=

2
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,480
Well,

3
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,350
you dared to come here.

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,410
I'll ensure you never leave.

5
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,320
Forgive me, Your Highness.

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,750
I dirtied the Princess's sachet.

7
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,960
Allow me to clean it and return it later.

8
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,350
Ah, very well.

9
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,250
Have it your way.

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,120
(It seems I am of use to the Prince.)

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
(If that's so,)

12
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,560
(I'll play along.)

13
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,230
(I must find proof
that he killed the Prefect.)

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,560
(Only by bringing him down)

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
(can I free my father.)

16
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,640
Lady Xu is quite beautiful

17
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,200
and skilled at the zither, too.

18
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:34,910
Marvelous.

19
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,070
Your Highness,

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,920
Lady Xu has been married before.

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,760
Just a woman.

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,310
How could I possibly fall for her?

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,230
Marrying her serves another purpose.

24
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,790
You mean...?

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,280
The Xu family

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,870
is the capital's largest herb merchant,

27
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,150
with shops all over the country.

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,310
Taking her means gaining all those shops.

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,920
Discreet and useful, right?

30
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,350
Brilliant, Your Highness.

31
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,790
But this woman seems far from simple.

32
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,120
Exactly why

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,590
she should stay right under my eyes.

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,840
Someone dared to steal here.

35
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,520
Such audacity.

36
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,240
Search thoroughly.

37
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,730
Princess.

38
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,280
Especially outsiders who entered today.

39
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,240
Search them thoroughly.

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,240
Princess, you mean...?

41
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,120
Wanning, something has been stolen

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,770
I'm conducting a search.

43
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,560
You happened to visit today,

44
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,080
so you must be searched as well.

45
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,080
I have taken nothing from here.

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,590
Of course I believe you.

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,190
But if I don't have you searched,

48
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,190
how will the others respect my authority

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,400
in the household?

50
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,750
I'm afraid I have to do this.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,840
Search her.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
Yes.

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,680
Princess.

54
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,150
What's going on here?

55
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,150
Heng, what brings you here?

56
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,030
To see if the Princess returned safely.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,630
If that's the case,

58
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,520
come inside for tea.

59
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,590
All right.

60
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,280
Princess,

61
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,750
please dismiss these other people.

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,520
Don't let them get in the way.

63
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,630
All of you, leave.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,840
Yes.

65
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,700
(Xu Residence)

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,270
This is perfect.

67
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,150
This way,

68
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,870
I can proceed with my plan.

69
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,720
My Lady, the Prince requests your presence.

70
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,270
Hongmei, help me get dressed.

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,640
Yes.

72
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,920
I never imagined the Prince would invite me.

73
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,000
I feel greatly honored.

74
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,390
It truly delights me

75
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,800
to see you today.

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,560
Yesterday, I heard you play a tune.

77
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,870
It was like celestial music.

78
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,040
Pity it was only a few notes.

79
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,870
Might I hear a full piece today?

80
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,240
Hearing your words was like
meeting a kindred spirit.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,480
Today, I shall not play for a prince,

82
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,390
but for that kindred spirit.

83
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,310
A kindred spirit?

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,510
Good. Even better so.

85
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,040
Heng,

86
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,520
you must be tired.

87
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,420
I had them

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,780
prepare the osmanthus cake
you loved as a child.

89
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,960
Have a taste.

90
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,640
Here.

91
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,000
Your Highness.

92
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,430
I'm afraid this is improper.

93
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,660
It's a breach of etiquette.

94
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,240
Don't be so restrained around me.

95
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,990
I am but a commoner.

96
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,610
How could I be worthy?

97
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,600
If you were to become my consort,

98
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,260
would you still be so restrained?

99
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,160
I hear a touch

100
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,600
of sorrow in your music.

101
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,270
Is there something troubling you?

102
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,600
Your Highness is perceptive.

103
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,750
It's all because my father was imprisoned.

104
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,430
I have heard about that matter.

105
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,480
I only said that just now

106
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,950
to ease your mood.

107
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,950
I hope I did not offend you.

108
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,270
Your Highness jests.

109
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,750
How could that be an offense?

110
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,830
To me, it is the greatest of blessings.

111
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,600
Like something from a fairy tale.

112
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,000
I was a bit rude just now.

113
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,510
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

114
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,480
It's all right.

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,430
However, I truly can
ease the worries in your heart.

116
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,750
You might want to consider it.

117
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,510
Your Highness, thank you
for easing my sorrow.

118
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,430
I shall continue playing for you.

119
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,670
Thank you for escorting me.

120
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,360
I should thank you.

121
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,390
To hear such music

122
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,120
is my great fortune.

123
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,470
Let go.

124
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,350
What?

125
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,750
Afraid the Prince might see

126
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,600
and your hopes
of being his consort be ruined?

127
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,750
Exactly.

128
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,550
And I'd not want
to ruin your prospects either.

129
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,990
Are you jealous?

130
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,910
Did you come just to ask me this?

131
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,080
You saw today

132
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,080
how the Princess treated you.

133
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,630
If it weren't for me...

134
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,630
Thank you.

135
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,510
I know what you're trying to do.

136
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,280
But it's too dangerous.

137
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,480
Are you going to gamble your own happiness

138
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,240
and return to that mire?

139
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,630
Tell me,

140
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,150
how else can a commoner

141
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,200
stand against a prince?

142
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,080
I'm close to finding the evidence

143
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,680
of the Prince dealing Hongzhen Incense.

144
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,040
Just wait for me.

145
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,510
You're investigating the case,

146
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,670
but I'm saving my father.

147
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,670
I cannot just wait and do nothing.

148
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,630
Every delay endangers my father.

149
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,030
He's loved me dearly since I was little.

150
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,790
I can't possibly let him

151
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,510
remain in danger.

152
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,550
Wanning, you're home.

153
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,030
Come. Have a seat.

154
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,890
Sit down.

155
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,030
Wanning, you've worked yourself

156
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,150
to the bone lately.

157
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,080
I had the kitchen stew a chicken

158
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,160
to strengthen your health.

159
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,960
You are the eldest legitimate daughter.

160
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,120
You must take care of yourself.

161
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,390
In the future,

162
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,480
your younger siblings will rely on you.

163
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,390
Of course, I will help them

164
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,750
where I can.

165
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,080
No need to put it like that.

166
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,550
How could that be?

167
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,000
You'll be the Prince's consort,

168
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,320
and they will all look up to you.

169
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,200
What are you talking about?

170
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,910
Look, this was sent by the Prince today.

171
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,720
If you agree,

172
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,150
he'll send the betrothal gifts tomorrow.

173
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,670
(Gift List)

174
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,000
You've already been divorced

175
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,630
and with a child to care for.

176
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,550
To remarry at all is a blessing,

177
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,350
let alone

178
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,080
to a prince.

179
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,670
What is there to hesitate about?

180
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,570
Wanning,

181
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,240
even if not for yourself,

182
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,910
you must consider your younger siblings

183
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,150
and Chang'an.

184
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,910
Once he enters the Prince's household,

185
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,910
he'll surely be granted a title.

186
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,080
Even if you ignore all that,

187
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,910
just look at this generous gift list.

188
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,200
Aren't you tempted?

189
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,910
No need to look.

190
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,120
The Prince considers me worthy as a consort

191
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,390
is our family's greatest fortune.

192
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,930
Besides, with Father imprisoned,

193
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,630
becoming his consort

194
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,870
might give me a way to save him.

195
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,150
Oh dear.

196
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,440
There you go.

197
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,960
I thought you wouldn't agree.

198
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,280
Since that's settled,

199
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,150
I'll send word to the Prince tomorrow

200
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,030
to proceed.

201
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Thank you, Auntie.

202
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,110
All right.

203
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,510
Xiaoxiao, that's enough.

204
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,800
Father,

205
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,240
are you truly set on marrying Xu Wanning?

206
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,390
I know you've long been friends.

207
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,480
If she becomes my consort,

208
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,240
you can see each other every day.

209
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,320
Won't that be lovely?

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
In the past, we were close as sisters.

211
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,720
Now, if you marry her,

212
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,960
I will have to kneel and salute her.

213
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,320
How do you expect me to face her?

214
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,600
Do as propriety demands.

215
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,200
Do not break the rules

216
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,750
and cause me to lose face.

217
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,390
Lose face?

218
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,600
Father, would you still care about that?

219
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,910
If you marry that scheming woman,

220
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,790
you'll disgrace the entire family.

221
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,030
Enough.

222
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,670
Every word I said is true.

223
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,720
Back then, after she lost her virtue
at the poetry gathering,

224
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,360
her scandal spread far and wide.

225
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,150
Even my name was tarnished by it.

226
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,390
Now,

227
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,000
you disregard your own reputation
to marry her.

228
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,750
Have you ever cared
about my reputation?

229
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,600
If you cared for that,

230
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,670
you wouldn't have

231
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,270
stayed single all these years

232
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,340
- I...
- for that impotent Pei Heng.

233
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,960
You...

234
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,120
Remember this.

235
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,480
You're Princess Anle

236
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,720
only because you're my daughter.

237
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,270
If I want to remarry,

238
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,070
I do not need your approval.

239
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,670
Xu Wanning,

240
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,910
you ruined my reputation

241
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,000
at the poetry gathering.

242
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,120
Even Heng grew distant because of you.

243
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,600
Now, you've returned to the Capital City.

244
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,270
Not only have you grown close to Heng,

245
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,440
you even attempt to marry my father.

246
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,030
Then, don't blame me

247
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,320
for disregarding our past friendship.

248
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,750
My Lady,

249
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,270
do you really want to marry the Prince?

250
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,600
Why don't you ask whether the Prince
truly wants to marry me?

251
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,480
The Prince has sent
the betrothal letter and gift list.

252
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,930
How could that be false?

253
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,320
Then why do you think the Prince

254
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,670
wants to marry a divorcée?

255
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,600
Surely because he adores you.

256
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,080
The Prince's move is

257
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,390
to control me and drag the Xu family down

258
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,120
with him.

259
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,870
Our shops across the country

260
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,320
are perfect for him to use

261
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,790
for selling Hongzhen Incense.

262
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,270
Then you should not marry him.

263
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,480
The Prince is using an open scheme.

264
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,270
Today he tested me with my father's case,

265
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,240
and sent the betrothal gifts right after.

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,840
So,

267
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,600
even knowing it's a trap,

268
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,720
I must step right in.

269
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,710
My Lady.

270
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,480
Don't worry, Hongmei.

271
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,080
I'll deal with whatever comes.

272
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,750
He wants to keep me under his nose,

273
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,550
and I want to get close to him

274
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,910
to gather evidence of his crimes.

275
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,510
We'll see in the end who wins.
