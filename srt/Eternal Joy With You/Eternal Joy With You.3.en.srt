=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 3=

2
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,910
How dare you hit me?

3
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,070
You libertine!

4
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,910
Why wouldn't I dare?

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,710
Libertine?

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,820
I have no interest in you.

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,200
I don't care if you're the Commander,

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,640
or someone unrelated to me,

9
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,070
you must respect me.

10
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,640
You know me?

11
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,150
People say

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,840
you're the most scheming woman
who currys favor with the powerful.

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,230
Don't you know your reputation
precedes you?

14
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,040
I can't control what people say,

15
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,040
and I don't care.

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,000
But if you see me that way,

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,210
it means you're no different

18
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,590
from those petty people who gossip.

19
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,280
Do you believe I'll kill you right now?

20
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,920
I've already died once.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,920
I fear nothing.

22
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,350
The night is deep.

23
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,040
Commander, if there's nothing else,

24
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,990
you may leave.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,280
By the way, Commander Pei,

26
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,000
I hope we can go our separate ways

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,350
from now on.

28
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,790
If you don't trouble me,

29
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,430
I won't ruin your plans.

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,120
Commander, let me teach her a lesson.

31
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,150
She's far too arrogant.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,510
How dare she insult you like that?

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,480
And...

34
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,990
She even said you're incapable.

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,050
Little does she know
you've already recovered.

36
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,240
- I'll just...
- Just what?

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,200
Let's go back.

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,270
Commander.

39
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,780
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

40
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,870
The ground is slippery.

41
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,030
Lady Cui, please be careful.

42
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,910
You're so meticulous.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,470
You're truly endearing.

44
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,860
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

45
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,000
From now on, our family

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,520
will rely on your diligence.

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,150
You look like such a good person.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,680
Finally, someone can share my burdens.

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,470
I look forward to your guidance,
Wanning.

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
Hmm.

51
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,800
I'll make sure to guide you well.

52
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,500
Let's go.

53
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,380
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

54
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,000
(In the previous life,
you all trampled me like mud.)

55
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,630
(In this lifetime,)

56
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,750
(I'll return it exactly as it was.)

57
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,750
Young Master Ping is so seriously ill.

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,960
It must be due to someone's negligence.

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,750
Qingqing, what do you mean by that?

60
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't quite understand.

61
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,270
Forget it.

62
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,800
Since you think I can't take care
of Ping properly,

63
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
then let's do this.

64
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,470
Qingqing,

65
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,750
why not help me share this burden?

66
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,150
I believe you can take good care of him.

67
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,870
What do you think, Qingqing?

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,470
I'm willing to share this burden.

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,200
Mother,

70
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,150
see, Qingqing has agreed.

71
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,630
Please just agree to it.

72
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,870
What matters most now is Ping.

73
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,750
No matter who it is,

74
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,470
you must take good care of him.

75
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,550
Yes.

76
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,870
I'll go prepare the medicine.

77
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,320
Go ahead.

78
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,470
Bai Qingqing,

79
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,390
you looked so smug just now.

80
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,390
You can't wait for her
to find out right now

81
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,510
that Ping is your child.

82
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,160
Madam, I was wrong.

83
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,040
Enough, Mother.

84
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,800
Qingqing is new here.

85
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,360
Please don't blame her.

86
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,400
Forget it.

87
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,520
Bai Qingqing,

88
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,430
you must take good care
of my precious grandson.

89
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,430
If anything happens to him,

90
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,310
I will hold you accountable.

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,920
Yes, Madam.

92
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,920
My Lady, the fish has taken the bait

93
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,390
and is biting firmly.

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,160
It's a pity you're too kind-hearted.

95
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,480
You can't just ignore Cui Qingping.

96
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,920
Now our young master

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,480
can't even be found.

98
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,360
Still no news from the midwife?

99
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,310
We need to speed things up.

100
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,480
Let's go.

101
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,580
Deliver the medicine first.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Hmm.

103
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,120
You lowly servants!

104
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,360
Open your eyes and see clearly.

105
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm someone close to the Marquis.

106
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,680
How dare you ignore me!

107
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,840
Miss, I'm so sorry.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,990
I was in a hurry and accidentally
bumped into you.

109
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,160
I didn't mean to.

110
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,000
You insolent servants!

111
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,870
When I officially marry into the family,

112
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,070
I'll have you all sold off.

113
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,000
Wanning,

114
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,190
what brings you here?

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,600
Qingqing, you're quite authoritative.

116
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,280
The servants were being disrespectful.

117
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,190
I was just teaching them a lesson
for you.

118
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,950
Thank you so much.

119
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,870
You're welcome.

120
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,680
You two may leave now.

121
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,750
Yes.

122
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,440
This is the medicine
I specially prepared for Ping.

123
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,750
Its effect is remarkable.

124
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
What?

125
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,800
Lady Cui has specifically instructed

126
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,870
that no one

127
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,920
is allowed in here,

128
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,800
especially you.

129
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,270
Me?

130
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,520
Yes.

131
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,910
Fine.

132
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,310
In this case, I won't enter.

133
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,360
But make sure

134
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,800
you give this medicine to Ping.

135
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,920
Wanning, rest assured.

136
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,600
(Xu Wanning,)

137
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,000
(don't think I don't know
your intentions.)

138
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,210
(This medicine)

139
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,680
(is meant to harm my child.)

140
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,030
(Sure enough.)

141
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,270
(Evil minds always think the worst.)

142
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,590
Xu Wanning,

143
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,800
how dare you!

144
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,160
You dare to harm my precious grandson.

145
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,510
Mother, what do you mean by this?

146
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,390
Stop playing dumb.

147
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,870
What medicine did you give Ping?

148
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,390
He was unconscious for half a day.

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,160
Madam Xu insisted I give this medicine

150
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,630
to Young Master Ping.

151
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,190
But I didn't expect

152
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,310
this medicine would...

153
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,680
Qingqing,

154
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,940
are you so certain

155
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,560
that my medicine harmed Ping?

156
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,560
If you're falsely accusing me,

157
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,580
what crime should that be?

158
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,510
If it wasn't your medicine
that caused it,

159
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,390
I will kowtow my way to you

160
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,360
and apologize.

161
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,120
Fine.

162
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,270
Remember your words.

163
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,880
Hongmei,

164
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,240
has Young Master Ping arrived yet?

165
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,430
Young Master Ping is here.

166
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,640
My...

167
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,240
Young Master Ping,

168
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,630
why are you up?

169
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,830
Ping.

170
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,360
Grandmother.

171
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,720
Tell me,

172
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,390
was it her who made you
take the medicine?

173
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,520
Hmm.

174
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,920
Xu Wanning,

175
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,510
what else do you have to say?

176
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,040
Guards!

177
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,630
Prepare the punishment.

178
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,920
Who dares?

179
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,560
Mother,

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,440
you haven't even figured it out yet.

181
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,560
Don't rush it.

182
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,320
Ping,

183
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,750
what medicine did I give you?

184
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,290
Explain it clearly to everyone.

185
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,070
Mother told me to smell this often,

186
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,590
saying it would help with my illness.

187
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,830
Take a closer look

188
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,950
and see if Ping's condition
has improved.

189
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,180
Though this scented sachet

190
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,000
makes Ping drowsy,

191
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,120
it is indeed the best medicine
for the Rash.

192
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,750
It does no harm to the body.

193
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,990
Mother,

194
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,790
Ping is my child.

195
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,390
How could I ever harm him?

196
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,080
You all believe Qingqing's nonsense,

197
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,840
and throw accusations at me.

198
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,150
It truly breaks my heart.

199
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,440
Enough, stop putting on this act.

200
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,480
This medicine is meant
to harm Young Master Ping.

201
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,360
I kindly took you into the Mansion.

202
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Yet you have repeatedly disrespected me.

203
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,750
I held back from punishing you
out of respect for Yunfeng.

204
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,720
Do you think I am dead?

205
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,120
You...!

206
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,560
Forget it.

207
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,200
Since you are a guest here,

208
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,080
I won't argue with you further.

209
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,270
But Qingqing,

210
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,320
you must fulfill your promise.

211
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,390
Kowtow your way to me

212
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,790
and apologize.

213
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,470
You...!

214
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,750
If you refuse to kneel,

215
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,120
leave our at once.

216
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,630
I mean what I say.

217
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,960
I have disrespected you.

218
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,320
Please forgive me.

219
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,630
I have disrespected you.

220
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,870
Please forgive me.

221
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,790
(Bai Qingqing,)

222
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,940
(this is all what you owed me
in the previous life.)

223
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,200
(But this is far from enough.)

224
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,920
Get up.

225
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,240
But remember this well.

226
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,990
There is a clear distinction
between ranks.

227
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,270
Here,

228
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,750
I am the superior,

229
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,070
and you are the inferior.

230
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,160
Your face...

231
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,320
Your face...

232
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,960
In the previous life, you conspired
to ruin my beauty.

233
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,320
In this life,

234
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,480
it's your turn to taste my suffering.

235
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,670
Don't rush it.

236
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,320
This is just the beginning.

237
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,180
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

238
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,480
Yunfeng,

239
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,750
my face is about to be ruined.
What should I do?

240
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,560
It won't happen.

241
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,050
We've already offered a generous reward
for a physician.

242
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,240
There must be a renowned one

243
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,600
to cure you and Ping's illness.

244
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,630
It's all Xu Wanning's doing.

245
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,510
She harmed Ping and me.

246
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,150
Could she have discovered something?

247
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,120
I always feel like

248
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,790
she has changed a lot lately.

249
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,080
Impossible.

250
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,510
For so many years,

251
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,240
we've covered our tracks perfectly.

252
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,750
She couldn't possibly guess
Ping's true identity.

253
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,110
Yunfeng,

254
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,870
I have a plan

255
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,750
to vent this anger.

256
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,280
What is it?

257
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,960
Let's do this.

258
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,720
(Huichun Pharmacy)
The notice seeking a physician

259
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,150
has been posted for several days now.

260
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,320
The reward increases day by day.

261
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,150
But no one dares to take it.

262
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,110
Exactly.

263
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,830
Everyone knows the Corpse Blossom Rash
is nearly impossible to cure.

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,240
Who would risk their future

265
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,320
to take on such a task?

266
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,590
(Seeking a physician)
You might even get thrown out.

267
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,560
Look.

268
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,600
500 taels.

269
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,550
It's already 500 taels.

270
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,670
Yes.

271
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,680
Commander,

272
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,790
this is all the information

273
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,390
about Xu Wanning over the years

274
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,380
in the Marquis's Mansion.

275
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,630
OK.

276
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,300
(Notice)

277
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,160
Strange.

278
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,790
Madam Cui paid me to take the notice.

279
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,480
But someone else has already taken it.

280
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,670
What's going on here?

281
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,000
The Lord said

282
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,390
some unclean things have entered
the house recently.

283
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,270
He wants to invite a master
to perform a ritual

284
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,370
and dispel the bad energy.

285
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,120
Then we'd better

286
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,840
watch this play closely.

287
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,030
Master, please be gentle.

288
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,120
Our courtyard was just cleaned.

289
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,750
How dare you

290
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,390
be so rude to the Madam!

291
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,900
Darn it!

292
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,370
The Master is exorcising evil spirits.

293
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,490
Why are you causing trouble?

294
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,210
Exorcising evil spirits?

295
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,630
Yunfeng, do you mean

296
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,510
the Master said the evil spirits
are on me?

297
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,550
Wanning, I don't know either.

298
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,870
Master.

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,870
Heaven and earth hold righteous energy.

300
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,600
All things take shape in chaos.

301
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,360
Madam Cui harbors evil spirits
within her.

302
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,670
They must be expelled quickly.

303
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,000
Otherwise, the household will be
in turmoil

304
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,720
and her life may even be at risk.

305
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,200
Alas.

306
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,840
Household in turmoil, life at risk.

307
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,720
Is it that serious?

308
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,120
Then, Master,

309
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,510
how will you exorcise
these evil spirits?

310
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,510
Follow heaven's will,
and deliver three lashes.

311
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,080
The first lash drives away misfortune.

312
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,480
The second lash banishes ghosts.

313
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,120
The third lash expels demons.

314
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,550
Only then can the evil spirits
be exorcised.

315
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,960
(In this lifetime,)

316
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,870
(I won't let you bully me anymore.)

317
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,910
(You liar,)

318
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,480
(I've already uncovered
your true nature.)

319
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,750
Will three lashes be enough?

320
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,200
Everyone in the household

321
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,550
must whip you,

322
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,550
or the evil spirits can't be exorcised

323
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,150
and will harm everyone.

324
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,870
They

325
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
must all whip me?

326
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,320
Wait for me.

327
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,680
Hey.

328
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,240
What's happening?

329
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,610
The Cui Family is exorcising evil spirits.

330
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,480
I heard the evil spirits

331
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,200
possess the Madam, Xu Wanning.

332
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,550
You go and see the fun.

333
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,790
Commander.

334
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,720
You investigate the Hongzhen Incense.

335
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,480
I'll head to the Marquis's Mansion.

336
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,960
Understood.

337
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,700
(Fortunately, I've made arrangements
in advance)

338
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,120
(to let someone spread the word.)

339
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,440
(I want to see with my own eyes)

340
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,270
(the Madame of the Marquis's Mansion)

341
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,770
(will soon become the laughingstock
of the entire city.)

342
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Master,

343
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,320
must it be done?

344
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,840
Sure.

345
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,120
Absolutely.

346
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,600
Qingqing, do you also think so?

347
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,040
Wanning,

348
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
since the Master says the evil spirits
are on you,

349
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,870
then you must be whipped.

350
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,710
Madam Cui,

351
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,270
are you ready?

352
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,750
Master,

353
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,320
are you prepared?

354
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,080
