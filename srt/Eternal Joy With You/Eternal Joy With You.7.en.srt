2
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,040
Hey, kid,

3
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,560
let me take a look.

4
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,630
Come on.

5
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,960
Beat him.

6
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,920
Are you crazy? Get out.

7
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,760
Let me take a look.

8
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,790
Get out.

9
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,840
Are you looking for someone?

10
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,790
Yes.

11
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,310
Earlier, I noticed them

12
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,870
taking kids over there.

13
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,280
Go and take a look.

14
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,760
Thank you.

15
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,760
Come here.

16
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,230
Watch and learn.

♪Waiting for a fate

57
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
Does it hurt?

58
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,210
On the surface, slaves are traded here.

59
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,480
But secretly there are duels, gambling,

60
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,080
and trafficking of young children.

61
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,510
We intercepted the carriage
headed for the border

62
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,920
and were able to rescue him.

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
They are utterly heartless.

64
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,560
They won't get away with this.

65
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,430
Is that so?

66
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,310
Then let's see if you can leave today.

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,480
These children are bound to me
by death contracts.

68
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,190
You can't take him away.

69
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,350
Surround them.

70
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,560
Commander, they're all surrounded.

71
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,920
According to imperial law,

72
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,000
those who traffic and abuse children

73
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,680
shall be sentenced to hanging.

74
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,040
Take them away.

75
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,350
Aye.

76
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,430
Move.

77
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,270
In this world,

78
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,720
some people's lives are insignificant
as weeds.

79
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,000
Some stand high above others

80
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,800
and yet do evil without mercy.

81
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,910
Rest assured.

82
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,480
These children and slaves

83
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,160
will be cared for by the authorities.

84
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,680
Thank you today.

85
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,830
From this day on,

86
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,390
I will never let anyone hurt you again.

87
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,350
Hmm.

88
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,750
She saved me.

89
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,560
I want to take her with us, is that okay?

90
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
Of course.

91
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,800
By the way, where is Cui Yunfeng?

92
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,390
When I arrived, I saw he'd been knocked out.

93
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,750
So I threw him into the slave dueling pit.

94
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,950
Perhaps he's still alive.

95
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,270
- Let's go.
- He better be alive.

96
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,430
He mustn't die so easily.

97
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,120
From now on,

98
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,240
don't be afraid anymore.

99
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,360
I will never let anyone hurt you again.

100
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,200
Do you understand?

101
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,750
You can call me Aunt Ning, all right?

102
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,270
I'd decided what your name would be

103
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,000
a very long time ago.

104
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,710
Chang'an.

105
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,160
It means you'll have
eternal joy and peace.

106
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,670
All right?

107
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,160
And you're

108
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,520
Ruyi.

109
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,270
It means all your wishes will come true.

110
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,070
Thank you, Aunt Ning.

111
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,000
Since you've found your child,

112
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,630
you don't have to go back.

113
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,720
If you want to divorce,

114
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,960
I will help you.

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,750
No leads yet on the Hongzhen Incense.

116
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,720
You've helped me so much,

117
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,360
I must repay your kindness.

118
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,030
Besides,

119
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,310
I haven't settled my score

120
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,630
with that family yet.

121
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,360
Are you taking them back as well?

122
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,070
We have no other place to go.

123
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,390
Leaving them out there

124
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,750
isn't an option.

125
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,360
I have a separate manor.

126
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,200
If you trust me,

127
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,790
you can settle them there.

128
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,240
Rest assured.

129
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,750
I will send people to protect them.

130
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,210
That way, you can proceed without fear.

131
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,360
Now you have two soft spots,

132
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,960
if you take them back,

133
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,360
no one can guarantee their safety.

134
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,840
I see your point.

135
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,560
Commander Pei,

136
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,910
I trust you.

137
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,630
Then,

138
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,560
thank you so much.

139
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,480
I hope we both

140
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,150
get what we wish for.

141
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,790
When we arrived at the slave pit,

142
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,790
we found the Marquis

143
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,910
lying there, covered in injuries.

144
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Where is Xu Wanning?

145
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,840
I didn't see her.

146
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,320
Mother, were you looking for me?

147
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,320
Xu Wanning!

148
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,360
It was you who hurt Feng!

149
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,320
Mother, you must be joking.

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,510
How could a weak woman

151
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,720
like myself have the ability

152
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,960
to injure my husband?

153
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,870
This was not my doing.

154
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,360
On my way back,

155
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,870
I heard that Yunfeng was injured,

156
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,870
so I even went to bring the Master Physician.

157
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,550
Yunfeng is injured so badly.

158
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,390
Mother,

159
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,480
can you now understand the pain

160
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,720
of seeing your child hurt?

161
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,790
Then do you know

162
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,080
what the child you abandoned six years ago

163
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,670
looks like now?

164
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,480
Now that your child has been found,

165
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,120
you had better behave from now on.

166
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,750
Of course.

167
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,990
Lady Cui,

168
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,750
let me check the Marquis's injuries.

169
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,960
Please.

170
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,320
Lady Cui,

171
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,750
most of the injuries

172
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,840
are external wounds.

173
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,150
Days of rest will suffice.

174
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,790
However,

175
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,480
one part on the Marquis

176
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,630
is seriously injured.

177
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm afraid

178
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,240
he may no longer be able to be intimate.

179
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,560
What?

180
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,440
What?

181
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,750
Impotent?

182
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,470
No.

183
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,670
It can't be.

184
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,200
It must be that vixen Xu Wanning.

185
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,040
She…

186
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,870
Stop yelling.

187
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,910
You're still breathing.

188
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,320
I will find a doctor to cure you.

189
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,000
She is the one who ruined me.

190
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,910
How dare she bring me to this?

191
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,440
I must destroy her.

192
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,080
Back then, only her wealth

193
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,550
and the Princess's backing

194
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,510
made me accept her.

195
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,030
Now, out of respect for the Princess,

196
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,670
we can't simply cast her out.

197
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,910
Since you want to torment her,

198
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,670
we still need to come up with a plan.

199
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,150
For now, focus on getting better.

200
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,630
Bai Qingqing is locked up,

201
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,000
but Xu Wanning is unreliable.

202
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,630
It's better to have her take care of me.

203
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,550
Hmm.

204
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,320
Have you thought over

205
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
what we discussed earlier?

206
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,710
Just once.

207
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,390
Ma Si, don't even think about it.

208
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,120
Don't forget,

209
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,750
I am the Marquis's woman.

210
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,080
They have kept you locked up for days.

211
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,000
The Marquis has long forgotten you.

212
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,280
Moreover,

213
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,270
the Marquis is no longer capable now.

214
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,080
What happened to the Marquis?

215
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,510
The Marquis has become impotent.

216
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,790
Nonsense!

217
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,790
Still dare to run?

218
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,960
- Let me go!
- Shut up.

219
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,600
How dare you scream?

220
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,600
Looks like I get to enjoy
the finer things today.

221
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,630
Let go of me! Help!

222
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,240
Marquis, help me!

223
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,840
I asked Cuiyun, the servant of Lady Cui.

224
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,440
She said the Hongzhen Incense

225
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,630
was from Cui Yunfeng's study.

226
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,360
But she was only following orders

227
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,910
and didn't know what was inside.

228
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,670
Have you checked his study?

229
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,840
I searched it many times

230
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,910
but found nothing related to it.

231
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,440
What about you?

232
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,910
Did you find anything?

233
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,320
Do you know Lady Cui secludes herself
to chant Buddhist sutras

234
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,510
on the 1st and 15th monthly?

235
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,630
Yes, she does have that habit.

236
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,480
Do you think that's suspicious?
