2
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,240
Father.

3
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,070
Father.

4
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,120
Father!

5
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,790
Father, I know my mistake.

6
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,400
Father!

7
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,480
I know my mistake.

8
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,600
I know my mistake.

9
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,610
From now on, I will listen
to everything you say.

10
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,560
Father.

11
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,070
Father.

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,790
Father.

13
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,220
What are you thinking about?

14
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,240
The Prince suddenly committed suicide
at this time.

15
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,430
I find it a bit strange.

16
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,590
It's not strange that he died.

17
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,550
But the timing of his death
was just right.

18
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,860
You also think there's something
suspicious about this.

19
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,280
After all, we didn't see the scene.

20
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Do you think

21
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,800
that Feng Zhengxin would die so easily?

22
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,870
Anyway, I don't believe it.

23
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,590
What you hear may be false,

24
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,750
but what you see is true.

25
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,290
Tomorrow, there will be a funeral.

26
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,390
Many people will definitely go
to attend the funeral.

27
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,870
I'm thinking

28
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,960
we could take this opportunity
to go and find out the truth.

29
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,460
(Memorial)

30
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,660
(Memorial Tablet of Prince Chong Feng Zhengxin)

31
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,270
Your Highness,

32
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,170
please accept my condolences.

33
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,040
Do you come here

34
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,950
to laugh at me?

35
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,720
That is not the case.

36
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
You misunderstand us.

37
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,310
Xu Wanning,

38
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,750
do you know

39
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,870
what I hate the most right now
is seeing you

40
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,680
with that smug, self-satisfied look.

41
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,720
You brought Pei Heng here today,

42
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,240
just to tell me

43
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,830
that you are a winner

44
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,480
and to see how miserable I've become
because of you.

45
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,270
Because of me?

46
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,430
Xu Wanning,

47
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,390
everything I had was taken away by you.

48
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,560
My lover, my family.

49
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,590
Why?

50
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,360
You are a scheming and flirtatious woman.

51
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,920
You always oppose me in everything.

52
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,160
Everything I had was ruined by you. Why?

53
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,510
Because I can tell truth from lies;

54
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,830
I can distinguish good from evil;

55
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,870
I understand human nature;

56
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,440
I have never asked anything from others;

57
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,240
I only trust myself;

58
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,830
I don't believe in fate;

59
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,950
Everything I want, I fight for myself;

60
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,870
I will take responsibility

61
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,750
for the mistakes I made myself.

62
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,750
You bandit, bandit!

63
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,240
You shameless person!

64
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,520
Your Highness,

65
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,040
ask yourself honestly.

66
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,990
Which of your family members
or loved ones

67
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,390
have I taken away?

68
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,950
You reap

69
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,190
what you sow.

70
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,950
Now you have tasted this bitter fruit.

71
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,040
Shouldn't you reflect

72
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,600
on what you have done?

73
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,360
Madman! You bunch of madmen!

74
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,830
Someone! Drive them out!

75
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,680
I'd like to see who dares.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,480
If you don't take action today,

77
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,680
it will be you who die.

78
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,830
Do it!

79
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,910
Xiaoxiao, what are you doing?

80
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,910
Brother.

81
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
Xiaoxiao,

82
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,240
my uncle's spirit in heaven

83
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,040
also hopes to walk the final journey
in peace.

84
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,510
Many thanks to you for being here.

85
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,080
The time has come.

86
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,800
Let's get started.

87
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:52,660
(Virtue and Diligence)

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,900
What a pity.

89
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:13,060
(Memorial Tablet of Prince Chong Feng Zhengxin)

90
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,000
The incense is fine.

91
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,270
Your Majesty.

92
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,320
Ash.

93
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,670
The ash is poisonous.

94
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,720
Xu Wanning, oh Xu Wanning,

95
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,270
you've finally fallen into my hands.

96
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,950
Yu've ruined my plans time and again.

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,430
Let's see how I torment you today.

98
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,920
Uncle,

99
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,720
you… let her go.

100
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,150
Your Majesty.

101
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,480
All of your people have been
under my control.

102
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,490
What right do you have
to negotiate terms with me?

103
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,040
Nephew, it's a pity I didn't die, huh?

104
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,430
I thought you had met with disaster

105
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,870
and I felt very sad.

106
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,870
Felt very sad?

107
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,040
Your act is quite convincing.

108
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,040
I don't know why my brother chose you
to be the Emperor.

109
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,890
You have no talent
for governing the country.

110
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,750
You are timid and cowardly by nature,

111
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,220
clinging to life and afraid of death.

112
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,190
Otherwise,

113
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,390
let me take your place
and firmly hold this realm.

114
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,600
What do you think?

115
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,120
Uncle, you intend to kill me?

116
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,240
Kill you?

117
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,200
Kill you.

118
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,550
Little nephew,

119
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,200
have you forgotten
this throne rightfully belongs to me?

120
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,630
It was your father who snatched it
from my hands.

121
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,390
For this very moment,

122
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,080
I have waited for 30 years.

123
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,720
30 years.

124
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,550
Today, this funeral

125
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,870
is prepared for all of you.

126
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,240
I will kill you.

127
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,960
Kill every single one of you.

128
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,790
Make you accompany me in death
for these 30 years.

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,180
Jinlin Guards, where are you?

130
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,080
How is that possible?

131
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,670
The trap I set is flawless.

132
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,390
How could you possibly know?

133
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,720
The trap you set is flawless.

134
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,870
But Hongzhen Incense betrayed you.

135
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,790
(Hongzhen Incense?)

136
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,870
When it reaches a certain concentration,

137
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,770
it can make a person unconscious
for three days,

138
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,030
without a trace of life.

139
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,720
But it comes alive when it meets fire.

140
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,840
You added oiled paper into this brazier.

141
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,480
The flames will disperse
the concentration of the Incense.

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,120
So when the time comes,

143
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,510
you will wake up.

144
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,550
But all the guests present
will slowly be poisoned,

145
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,630
and gradually die.

146
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,390
Killing two birds with one stone.

147
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,550
What a clever scheme!

148
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,720
It was you who tampered with this room

149
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,030
and saved everyone's lives.

150
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,360
That's right.

151
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,270
I applied medicine here in advance.

152
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,730
So everyone is not actually poisoned.

153
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,330
They just fell asleep for a short while.

154
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,390
Now they should be about to wake up.

155
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,910
Xu Wanning, it's you again.

156
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,750
Father.

157
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,120
I'll fight you to the end.

158
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,320
Do you know that the Emperor
you've been protecting all along

159
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,550
is actually the one
who most wants you dead?

160
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,670
You are disabled because...

161
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,960
Uncle, go to the underworld

162
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,480
and accompany my father.

163
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,550
He must miss you very much.

164
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,240
Father!

165
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,030
Father!

166
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,750
It's fake.

167
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,080
It's all fake.

168
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,240
Master.

169
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,690
Master.

170
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,320
What's wrong, Ruyi?

171
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,910
Master, Aunt Ning and Chang'an have left.

172
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,870
They are gone.

173
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,150
What?

174
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,960
They really left.
