=Episode 18=

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,070
Xu Wanning.

3
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,030
Who are you?

4
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,990
- Let go of me.
- Move.

5
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,000
Let go of me.

6
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,870
Move.

7
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,150
Does it still hurt?

8
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,120
It doesn't hurt when you're here.

9
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,560
Thank you, Commander Pei.

10
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,040
Chang'an came back in a good mood.

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,040
No one gave him a hard time anymore.

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
We are family.

13
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,000
This is what I should do.

14
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,430
All right. Rest and recover.

15
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,480
I should go.

16
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,280
I can't open this door.

17
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,590
Chang'an, Ruyi.

18
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,430
What are you doing at the door?

19
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,070
Open it, quickly.

20
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,190
The key is missing, Mother.

21
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,870
Just sleep here for the night.

22
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,430
You are husband and wife anyway.

23
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,800
Hey, you two.

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,240
Where are you going? Come back.

25
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,280
Wait till I get out.

26
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,400
Come back, Chang'an.

27
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,590
With your skills,

28
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,240
opening this should be easy, right?

29
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,840
Normally, yes.

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,680
I could break it easily.

31
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,470
But now, I…

32
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,430
We can get out here.

33
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,840
Careful.

34
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,560
Commander, are you all right?

35
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,020
Get up.

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,960
How is it? You okay?

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,560
I'm fine. Are you?

38
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,680
I'm fine.

39
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,750
- Actually, maybe not.
- What's wrong?

40
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,630
Your wound must not catch the wind.

41
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,630
I'll close the window.

42
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,870
Huh?

43
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,310
All right, how is it?

44
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,710
Seems fine now.

45
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,430
Good, as long as it's fine.

46
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,280
Maybe

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,190
we shouldn't fuss anymore.

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,360
Let's just

49
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,680
make do for tonight.

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,120
(Just one night won't matter.)

51
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,080
(Anyway, he's...)

52
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,750
Who are you? Let me go.

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Where are you taking me?

54
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
Where are you taking me?

55
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Princess?

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,040
You saved me?

57
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,830
Thank you, Princess.

58
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,120
I didn't go through all that trouble
to save you

59
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,190
just for a few kowtows.

60
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,830
What do you want me to do?

61
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,270
I'll do anything.

62
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,190
I will.

63
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,680
No need to go that far.

64
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,120
Remember your ex-wife,

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,480
Xu Wanning?

66
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,630
That wretch.

67
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,190
I could tear her to pieces.

68
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,270
Very good.

69
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,870
Remember this hatred.

70
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,360
I'll give you a chance for revenge.

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,640
(Xu Wanning,)

72
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
(you humiliated me and Father,)

73
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,430
(and stole Heng's heart.)

74
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,720
(You're so scheming and devious.)

75
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,750
(I will make sure you fail.)

76
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,960
What are you doing?

77
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,790
A mosquito.

78
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,270
Yes. A mosquito.

79
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,630
At this time of year?

80
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,430
Oh, here it is.

81
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,000
My friend,

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,120
I believe this is our first meeting.

83
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,430
I have some spice business to do with you.

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,390
That's why I asked you here.

85
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,880
Master Xu,

86
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,310
try this incense.

87
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,040
Wonderful.

88
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,080
Ruyi,

89
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,560
do you think Mother accepts Master now?

90
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,560
Maybe one night isn't enough.

91
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,680
We need to give them more time together.

92
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,310
True.

93
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,360
We'll need another plan.

94
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,000
You two scheming again?

95
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,390
Mother, you're up.

96
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,270
Wasn't the door locked?

97
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,680
Yes, Aunt Ning, I locked it tight.

98
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,560
You think those little tricks

99
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,160
can stop me?

100
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,160
Master, I need to learn from you properly.

101
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,560
Once I've learned, I'll lock it better.

102
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,870
- You...
- Ruyi means we were wrong.

103
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,240
How should I punish you?

104
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,430
It's my failing as their master.

105
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,720
Let me handle it.

106
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,360
You two, come over here.

107
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,750
What were you thinking?

108
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,840
You shouldn't do this again.

109
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,750
Go chop firewood as your punishment.

110
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,160
Yes.

111
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,030
That's it?

112
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,670
They're just kids.

113
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,270
A small lesson is enough.

114
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,960
Didn't sleep well?

115
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,720
Did I wake you?

116
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,790
No, I slept perfectly.

117
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,080
Better than ever, actually.

118
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,120
I'll go chop some firewood too.

119
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,030
Commander.

120
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,390
Your wound can't get wet.

121
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,320
I brought the finest healing ointment.

122
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,550
Let me help you with it.

123
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,750
Just sit still.

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
I'd better do it myself.

125
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,270
It's fine. Just sit. I'll do it.

126
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,390
Wanning.

127
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,670
Though we have a gentleman's agreement,

128
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,120
you can't keep testing me like this.

129
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,510
I'm not testing you.

130
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,870
Right, the ointment stings a bit.

131
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,360
I'll be gentler.

132
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,200
No.

133
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,200
I mean...

134
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,080
I...

135
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,440
I'm a man after all.

136
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,870
But I heard you are...

137
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,040
Isn't it?

138
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,080
So you think so too?

139
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,910
That's what everyone says.

140
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,870
Xu Wanning, you know pharmacology.

141
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,320
Don't you have your own judgment?

142
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,200
I do know a bit,

143
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,910
but I can't judge

144
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,840
that kind of thing.

145
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,510
Well,

146
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,150
men seem to care about that a lot.

147
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,720
But I think

148
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,150
integrity matters more than anything.

149
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,480
To me, those other things

150
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,360
don't matter.

151
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,080
So don't belittle yourself.

152
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,240
It's all right.

153
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Seems you've misunderstood me deeply.

154
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,680
Why not

155
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,440
find out for yourself today?

156
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,440
No way.

157
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,480
But they say...

158
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,240
You believe whatever they say?

159
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,840
Commander.

160
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,510
Commander, Madam.

161
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,000
Someone from the Xu family sent word,

162
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,440
asking you both to come.

163
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,150
What happened, Auntie? What's going on?

164
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,840
Wanning, you're finally home.

165
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,790
You know what?

166
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,960
They have blocked the door all morning,

167
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,910
saying they're taking our shop.

168
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
What?

169
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440
Where's Father?

170
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,150
Ever since Master came back,

171
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,910
he's been nowhere to be seen all day long.

172
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,150
Where is Xu Weishan?

173
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,550
Don't think that hiding
will get you out of this.

174
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,550
He promised
to give me this shop as collateral.

175
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,630
If I can't get the deed today,

176
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,790
I'm not leaving.

177
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,240
Mister Wang, what are you talking about?

178
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
My father would never promise that.

179
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
That I do not know.

180
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,480
He said it's urgent

181
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,720
and took fifty thousand taels from me.

182
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,360
Hand over the deed

183
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,480
or give my money back now.

184
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,150
Don't waste my time.

185
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,550
Do you know who you're talking to?

186
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,790
How dare you?

187
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,670
Pei...

188
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,510
Commander Pei.

189
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Please judge clearly.

190
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,480
This is written by Xu Weishan himself.

191
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,000
It's indeed my father's handwriting.

192
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,240
Right now my father is missing.

193
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
When we find him,

194
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,030
we will definitely sort this out.

195
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm aware of this matter.

196
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,790
Get up and go back for now.

197
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,590
Yes, sir.

198
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,200
How did Master owe so much money?

199
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,790
What should we do?

200
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,320
Auntie, we must

201
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,030
find Father first.

202
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,320
Commander,

203
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,150
someone said they saw Master Xu
at the pleasure quarter.

204
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,390
What?

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,260
Could he be taking a concubine

206
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,910
and spending everything?

207
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,030
Auntie, calm down.

208
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,200
Look,

209
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,320
we'll go and see for ourselves.

210
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,510
Let's go.

211
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,910
Where's my incense?

212
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,200
I paid for it.

213
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,320
Where is my incense?

214
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,030
I paid.

215
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,230
Where is it?

216
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,000
Here it is.

217
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,510
Commander, he's here.

218
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,160
Father.

219
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,390
What are you doing?

220
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,960
Don't take my incense.

221
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,840
Hongzhen Incense.

222
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,720
Father's clearly

223
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,630
addicted to Hongzhen Incense.

224
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,600
What's going on?

225
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,750
- Commander.
- You're keeping prohibited drugs here?

226
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,030
Commander, I'm innocent.

227
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,840
He always came alone

228
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,030
and never let anyone in.

229
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,630
He only tipped a little.

230
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,000
We know nothing about this.

231
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,000
Who's been meeting him?

232
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,160
I...

233
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,790
I only accidentally saw once.

234
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,790
That person was

235
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
one of the Prince's men.

236
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,440
Leave us.

237
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
It really is the Prince.

238
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,750
Everyone, see? Was I wrong?

239
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,200
Xu Wanning is unfaithful.

240
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,510
She divorced me, her husband.

241
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,270
Just so she could be with this man.

242
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,080
Look, everyone, look closely.

243
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,240
She climbed up

244
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,480
to the Marquis family before,

245
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,200
and now she's latched onto the Commander.

246
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,630
Don't forget a few days ago,

247
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,320
even the Prince almost married her.

248
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,670
Quite a talent, isn't she?

249
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,200
Could it be the Xu's shop

250
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,750
sells aphrodisiacs?

251
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,280
My friend,

252
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,600
you've got it right.

253
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,870
I married her back then

254
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,270
because of those aphrodisiacs.

255
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,790
One foolish step, a lifetime of regret.
