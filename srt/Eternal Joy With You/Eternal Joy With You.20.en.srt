00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,300
=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 20=

2
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,320
My Lady, it's been a long time
since I've seen you cook.

3
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,380
It's rare to have some leisure lately.

4
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,420
My father's condition has improved.

5
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,740
Chang'an and Ruyi make good progress
in their studies.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,590
The Commander has been
working hard recently.

7
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,540
I'll make some flower pastries.

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,640
They all love to eat them.

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,190
Aunt Ning.

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,500
Aunt Ning, something's wrong.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,900
Chang'an, he... he...

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,460
- What's wrong with him?
- He's gone.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,500
What?

14
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,740
What's going on?

15
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,760
After school today,

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,900
the tutor suddenly called me.

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,820
Chang'an was waiting for me
at the gate.

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,100
But when I went out, I didn't see him.

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,540
I only found this.

20
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,660
Chang'an's jade pendant.

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,820
Ruyi, it's OK.

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,700
Chang'an must have gotten lost
because he was too playful.

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,540
It's OK.

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,240
You rest here first.

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,580
Wait for us to come back, alright?

26
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,280
Mm, OK.

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,780
It's fine. Hurry up.

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,260
Hongmei, I'm feeling really anxious.

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,620
I think something must have happened
to Chang'an.

30
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,770
Come with me to look for him.

31
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,670
- Alright.
- Let's go.

32
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,580
(Commander's Mansion)

33
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,500
A strip of cloth from Chang'an.

34
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,540
My Lady, what does this letter say?

35
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,900
This letter asks me

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,960
to go alone immediately
to the West Garden on Changle Street.

37
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,540
Chang'an is there.

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,180
That place is an abandoned residence.

39
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,020
Who would tie Chang'an up there?

40
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,140
This handwriting is all too familiar.

41
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,980
I just didn't expect

42
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,380
he could go this far.

43
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,420
Hongmei, I must go there immediately.

44
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,100
You wait here.

45
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,420
My Lady, why not wait the Commander
and go with him?

46
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,940
No, I'm afraid there's not enough time.

47
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,620
You wait here for the Commander.

48
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,900
Once he returns,

49
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,300
ask him go to the west immediately.

50
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,940
Understood?

51
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,020
Alright, I understand.

52
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,880
I'll go first.

53
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,920
My Lady, be careful.

54
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,980
Commander Pei,

55
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,020
the Prince invites you to gather
at Xiangyue Restaurant tonight.

56
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,020
You tell the Prince

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,480
that I will keep the appointment.

58
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,840
Yes.

59
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,740
I will be respectfully waiting
for you there.

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,220
Commander, this is a Hongmen Banquet.

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,790
Asking you to go there at this time,

62
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,960
he must harbor bad intentions.

63
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,220
Since it's unclear,

64
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,700
then let's play along.

65
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,660
Go to the Xiangyue Restaurant.

66
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,660
Yes.

67
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,220
Let's go.

68
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,620
Come out.

69
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,320
Since you ask me to be here,

70
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,900
let's be honest with each other.

71
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,980
Wanning,

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,180
I hope you've been well.

73
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,220
Greetings, Your Highness.

74
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,020
I don't know why you arranged

75
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,060
to meet here.

76
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,340
Heng.

77
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,020
Long time no see.

78
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,100
Where is Chang'an? I want to see him.

79
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,540
Wanning, don't worry.

80
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,300
Chang'an.

81
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,140
He's just asleep.

82
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,340
Chang'an.

83
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,380
Cui Yunfeng,

84
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,340
looks like that beating was too light.

85
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,100
You haven't learned your lesson at all.

86
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,500
Let me remind you.

87
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,480
You and I have nothing to do
with each other.

88
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,660
We have no connection anymore.

89
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,340
Wanning, you are too ruthless.

90
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,340
Why are you bringing up that beating?

91
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,740
If it weren't for you
forcing me into a corner,

92
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,720
I wouldn't have resorted
to this last measure.

93
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,220
What exactly are you trying to do?

94
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,860
Wanning,

95
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,180
I just want to reconcile with you.

96
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,820
Look at you, me,

97
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,740
and Chang'an,

98
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,100
how wonderful it is for the three of us

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,660
to be together as a family.

100
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,260
You and I have long been divorced.

101
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,740
I advise you to return the child to me
as soon as possible

102
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,790
and leave the Capital City.

103
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,580
I can choose not to pursue this matter.

104
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,860
Otherwise,

105
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,660
it's not something that can be resolved
with just one beating.

106
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,380
Mother.

107
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,100
Father.

108
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,700
I want my father.

109
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,500
Wanning,

110
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,700
why must you be so heartless?

111
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,780
Listen.

112
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,660
The child is calling me father.

113
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,780
Father.

114
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
Father.

115
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,060
I am his father.

116
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,060
Wanning,

117
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,100
I know it was my fault before.

118
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,220
I will definitely mend my ways

119
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,260
and treat you well.

120
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,620
Come back with me.

121
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,660
Let go, let go.

122
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,810
Today, it was not my father
who invited you here.

123
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,900
It was me.

124
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,820
I still have matters to attend to today.

125
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,780
I will drink with you another day.

126
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,540
It's all my fault.

127
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,860
Why not change your clothes first,

128
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,180
and then attend to the matters
afterward?

129
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,180
No wonder Xu Wanning used this trick

130
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,220
to flirt with the Marquis
at the poetry gathering.

131
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,260
Turns out it's so effective.

132
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,620
If I had known earlier,

133
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,300
you would have been mine long ago.

134
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,820
I would surely treat you gently.

135
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,580
Aphrodisiac?

136
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,420
Shame on you!

137
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,740
Wanning,

138
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,080
isn't this exactly the same
as the poetry gathering six years ago?

139
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,140
We can continue our past fate.

140
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,340
Cui Yunfeng,

141
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,140
stop putting on an act.

142
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,300
At the poetry gathering six years ago,

143
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,220
my clothes were soaked by someone,

144
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,300
so I went to change clothes.

145
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,870
Unfortunately, I was affected
by the aphrodisiac in the room.

146
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,820
The person who lit the incense was you.

147
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,180
But the person back then was not you.

148
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,100
- How do you know?
- Don't come over.

149
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,980
Heng,

150
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,220
do you truly despise me so much?

151
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,340
It doesn't matter.

152
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,580
Six years ago, I missed you.

153
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,860
Today, I will not miss you again.

154
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,660
(Six years ago)

155
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,540
(The aphrodisiac has already been lit.)

156
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,580
(All present are young ladies
from noble families.)

157
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,380
(Let's see who can become my wife)

158
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,140
(and help me rise to success.)

159
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,780
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

160
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,260
(I have to find a place to clean up.)

161
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,620
No problem. I'll go take care of it.

162
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,580
Alright.

163
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,380
Here. Zhao.

164
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,820
Marquis Cui, you've also come
to the Capital City.

165
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,740
It's been a long time.

166
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,140
Come on, let's have another drink.

167
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,100
Zhao, let's talk another day.

168
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Marquis Cui, no way.

169
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,180
It's been a long time.

170
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,300
Another drink, another drink.

171
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,620
Let's have another drink.

172
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,220
Alright, then let's have another drink.

173
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,620
Darn it! I actually missed the timing.

174
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,140
She is the daughter of a merchant.

175
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,520
She seems to be acquainted
with the Princess,

176
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,140
so she arrived at this gathering.

177
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,060
Forget it.

178
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,330
Although she's not as good
as those noble ladies,

179
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,100
she is quite wealthy.

180
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,540
It's not bad.

181
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,660
Who are you?

182
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,780
What are you going to do?

183
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,580
Wanning.

184
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,420
What on earth is going on?

185
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,420
Your Highness,

186
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,190
I am Cui Yunfeng
from the Marquis's Mansion.

187
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,020
I lost control
because of the aphrodisiac.

188
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,980
So Lady Xu and I...

189
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,900
No matter what,

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,660
I am willing to marry Lady Xu
as my wife.

191
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,060
Aphrodisiac?

192
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,860
Wanning,

193
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,580
is what he said true?

194
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,620
You stand up first.

195
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,020
Your Highness.

196
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,420
In that case, I bestow marriage
upon you.

197
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,340
Wanning is my good friend.

198
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,460
You must treat her well in the future.

199
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,100
Yes, Your Highness.

200
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,900
Six years ago you deceived me.

201
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,820
That person was not you at all.

202
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,260
So you knew it wasn't me.

203
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,100
Bai Qingqing told me that not long ago.

204
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,220
You are so vicious.

205
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,100
In order to get our family's wealth,

206
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,220
you took advantage of the situation
and married me.

207
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,940
In six years after we got married,

208
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,060
we never consummated our marriage.

209
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,940
Wanning,

210
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,620
at that time,

211
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,420
I knew that you had been touched
by another man,

212
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,900
so I was unwilling to touch you again.

213
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,380
Rest assured. I will definitely
treat you well from now on.

214
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,420
Wanning.

215
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,420
Are you alright?

216
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,420
Chang'an.

217
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,620
Mother.

218
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,280
Commander.

219
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,320
Commander, spare my life.

220
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,220
I didn't touch her,

221
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,620
even a single finger of hers.

222
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,380
Then why did you slander her just now?

223
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,980
Spare my life, Commander.

224
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,450
Six years ago,
it was someone else who touched her.

225
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,660
It has nothing to do with me.

226
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,320
I haven't touched her
in these six years.

227
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,940
Not even once.

228
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,260
(So to speak,)

229
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,320
(could it be that Chang'an is...)

230
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,540
You kidnapped the child

231
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,780
and found a place like this.

232
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,880
This was definitely not done
by you alone.

233
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,780
Speak.

234
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,620
It's...

235
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,260
Someone wants to silence him.

236
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,580
Xu Wanning,

237
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,780
you've ruined my plan again.

238
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,860
In that case,

239
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,580
I'll have to deal with you first.

240
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,220
