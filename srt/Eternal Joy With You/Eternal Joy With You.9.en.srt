00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,300
=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 9=

2
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,750
Xu Wanning,

3
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,200
are you here to laugh at me?

4
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,490
The water in this dungeon is cold,
isn't it?

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,150
Now you are experiencing
this bone-chilling pain.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,050
I have experienced it too.

7
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,430
Now you should know

8
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,200
what kind of person Cui Yunfeng is.

9
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,460
But you ended up in this situation

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,430
because of your own choices.

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,300
If I die here,

12
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,480
it's my retribution.

13
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,970
You can die here.

14
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,400
But what about your child?

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,370
Cui Yunfeng will eventually
face retribution.

16
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,410
But can you bear to let your child

17
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,940
live alone and helpless in this world

18
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,990
without a father or mother,

19
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,510
suffering endless torment and hardship?

20
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,800
Looking at you right now,

21
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,950
I can't help but think of myself.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,510
Have you once placed all your hopes

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,040
on Cui Yunfeng?

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,560
But look at the state

25
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,040
you're in now.

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,890
Cui Yunfeng and I fell in love
at first sight.

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,800
I knew my family background and status

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,020
were not worthy of this Young Master.

29
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,200
But Cui Yunfeng swore to marry me.

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,760
What I waited for was the news
that after the Begonia Poetry Gathering,

31
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,480
he was going to marry you.

32
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,400
At that time, I was already pregnant.

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,870
He brought our child into the residence.

34
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,120
I had also once fantasized

35
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,950
that one day I could become
the Madam of the Mansion.

36
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,840
So I targeted you in every way

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,960
and did quite a few bad things.

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,270
Xu Wanning,

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
if you could save me out today,

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,280
I will surely repay you
by working like an ox or a horse.

41
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,590
No one can save you,

42
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,560
except yourself.

43
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,940
On the night Ma Si died,

44
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,750
the Madam was with me the whole time.

45
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,040
So it's impossible that she killed him.

46
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,760
But if Ma Si found out I was missing,

47
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,050
the first thing he would do
is go look for Cui Yunfeng.

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,240
Bai Qingqing, you actually helped her.

49
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,870
Can't I?

50
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,630
Bai Qingqing, don't speak nonsense.

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,750
I treated you so well before.

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,290
But you actually accuse me falsely now.

53
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,080
Treat me well?

54
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,910
In your eyes, there has only
ever been yourself.

55
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,080
If you like something,
you hold it in your hands.

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,190
If you don't like it anymore,
you just throw it away.

57
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,430
I am not your plaything.

58
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,780
Shut up.

59
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,190
Today I must speak out.

60
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,520
I admit that everything I have today
is the result of my own actions.

61
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,120
But today I just want everyone to know

62
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,750
what kind of terrible hell
the Mansion is.

63
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,800
First, they swapped Wanning's child,

64
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,070
and later they let me enter the Mansion.

65
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,080
The Marquis watched as I was bullied
by Ma Si,

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,400
yet he kicked me away.

67
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,680
And now,

68
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,290
he might actually be the real murderer.

69
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,600
Feng.

70
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,720
This is the court.

71
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,040
Honorable sirs,

72
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,740
what Bai Qingqing just said
about my son being the murderer

73
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,530
is all nonsense.

74
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,470
If my son is the murderer,

75
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,370
please present the evidence.

76
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,070
If you cannot,

77
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,190
then Feng and I will take our leave.

78
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,620
Wait.

79
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,720
Commander, do you have anything else
to say?

80
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,960
Ma Si's death indeed requires
further investigation.

81
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,880
But the matter
of you bribing Magistrate Liu

82
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,740
is backed by solid evidence.

83
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,020
Or do you need me

84
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,600
to present the evidence right now

85
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,070
for everyone to take a look?

86
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,820
Guards!

87
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,860
Give Marquis Cui 20 heavy blows.

88
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,750
Throw Lady Cui into prison.

89
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,740
Further action will be taken afterwards.

90
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,460
- Mother.
- Feng.

91
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,780
- Let me go.
- Feng.

92
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,740
- Go.
- Let me go.

93
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,590
Be honest.

94
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:48,420
(County Government in Yan City)

95
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,260
Thank you.

96
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,820
No need.

97
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,580
Don't go back to the Mansion
for now.

98
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,980
Find a place to stay.

99
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,780
I know what you want.

100
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,220
Cui Qingping.

101
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,120
When the time is right,

102
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,140
I will send him to you.

103
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,330
Then thank you, Wanning.

104
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,850
Xu Wanning, I will not let you go.

105
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,180
You should know they killed Ma Si

106
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,860
and picked up my earring to frame me.

107
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,700
You even have the evidence, don't you?

108
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,190
But you haven't convicted them.

109
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,430
You've seen right through it.

110
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,140
Tomorrow they will be released.

111
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,460
It seems you intend
to play the long game.

112
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,620
Following the lead from Lin for now,

113
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,550
we have already found
a lot of Hongzhen Incense,

114
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,080
but Lady Cui is too cunning.

115
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,660
These Hongzhen Incense

116
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,910
still cannot prove
the Cui Family is guilty.

117
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,580
If we lock them up,

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,200
then this line will be cut off.

119
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,500
But now your identity
has already been exposed.

120
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,310
If you return to the Mansion again,

121
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,330
it would be inappropriate.

122
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,700
With my current identity,

123
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,620
if I want to stay in the Mansion,

124
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,220
who would dare stop me?

125
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,300
True.

126
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,750
Commander Pei,

127
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,340
you are only second to His Majesty.

128
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,640
Mother.

129
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,770
Aunt Ning.

130
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,620
How have you two been lately?

131
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,220
Have you been obedient?

132
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,140
Mother, rest assured.

133
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,860
We listen to Master very well.

134
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,100
Master?

135
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,060
Now I am their Master.

136
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,100
After all, I teach them calligraphy

137
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,030
as well as martial arts.

138
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,300
I am worthy of being called Master.

139
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,780
I have been practicing calligraphy
as you instructed.

140
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,980
Look, isn't my writing much better?

141
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,300
Your calligraphy has improved so much.

142
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,780
What about you, Ruyi?

143
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,040
What have you been doing lately?

144
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,800
Aunt Ning, I've been learning
martial arts from Master,

145
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,390
so I can fight bad people in the future.

146
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,540
That's amazing!

147
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,940
Then you learn well from Master

148
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,370
and beat bad guys in the future, OK?

149
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,970
I heard that you like eating fish
the most.

150
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,080
This is my best fish dish.

151
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,240
I made it especially for you.

152
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,230
Thank you for taking care of them
for me.

153
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,150
Full of sincerity.

154
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,190
Have a taste.

155
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,370
Master, do you like Aunt Ning?

156
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,760
It's so hot.

157
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,900
Ruyi, why are you talking nonsense?

158
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,620
I have evidence.

159
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,340
Every time we eat, he smiles
as long as you are there.

160
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,420
When you're not around,
Master seems to have never smiled.

161
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,140
Indeed.

162
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,420
When Ruyi says it like that,

163
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,580
I also feel that Master likes you,
Mother.

164
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,140
Have I ever said,

165
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,680
"Do not speak while eating;

166
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,160
do not talk while in bed"?

167
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,940
Don't take a child's words seriously.

168
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,940
A child words.

169
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,620
Here, Ruyi.

170
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,820
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

171
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,170
Fortunately, Pei Heng did not
find any evidence.

172
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,640
However,

173
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,900
he actually dares to treat our family
like this.

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,240
It is all because of Xu Wanning.

175
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,390
I have long suspected the two of them.

176
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,070
He hid his identity here.

177
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,660
Could it be just for that vile woman?

178
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,340
Everyone says the Commander
is cruel and tyrannical

179
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,700
and keeps away from women
because he is incapable of intimacy.

180
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,100
Now,

181
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,130
how could he hide in my place
for the sake of a woman?

182
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,560
Could it be that the frequent problems
with Hongzhen Incense

183
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,700
are related to him?

184
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,020
Fortunately,

185
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,050
he probably won't be coming back.

186
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,120
Yunfeng, who won't be coming back?

187
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,060
Xu Wanning, you actually have the nerve
to come back.

188
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,820
You and Mother sent me to the court,

189
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,460
slandering me as a murderer.

190
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,500
If none of you are ashamed,

191
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,820
why should I be afraid?

192
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,260
Xu Wanning,

193
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,580
when did you get to know Commander Pei?

194
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,380
Why don't you ask him yourself?

195
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,460
What do you want to ask me?

196
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,500
Nothing.

197
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,980
I wonder what important matter
brought you here.

198
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,220
It's nothing important.

199
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,420
Since I treated
the young master's illness,

200
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,420
I must take full responsibility.

201
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,380
Moreover, with me here,

202
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,900
the Marquis's injury

203
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,380
can recover a bit faster.

204
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,780
Commander Pei, you're truly kind-hearted.

205
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,140
Thank you very much.

206
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,530
But how could we dare trouble you?

207
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,780
It doesn't matter.

208
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,900
I've gotten used to living here.

209
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,780
I'm afraid I have to stay
for a while longer.

210
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,990
I won't be disturbing you, will I?

211
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,540
Not at all.

212
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,420
Commander Pei, please feel free to stay.

213
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,880
May I be so bold as to ask a question?

214
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,820
Previously, you hid your identity here.

215
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,010
What was the reason?

216
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,220
I think it was fun. Is it OK?

217
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,780
It was fun?

218
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,820
Feng.

219
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,660
Tea.

220
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,940
Remove bones.

221
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,340
OK.

222
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,380
Please.

223
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,430
I haven't finished it.

224
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,500
You're so weak.

225
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,140
Use more strength.

226
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,380
Feng.

227
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,540
Commander Pei,

228
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,660
my son is the Marquis

229
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,780
and I am still the Madam of the Mansion.

230
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,620
You torment us like this.

231
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,440
Are you not afraid
His Majesty will find out?

232
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,620
You may as well go
and inform His Majesty.

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,480
Let's see if His Majesty believes you

234
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,820
or believes me.

235
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,020
What exactly will it take for you
to let us go?

236
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,740
Perhaps you should go and beg Lady Xu.

237
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,630
I may think about it.

238
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,790
It's impossible.

239
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,860
Impossible!

240
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,260
Then there's nothing I can do.

241
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,090
Mother,

242
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
what brings you here?

243
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,500
Who gave this to you?

244
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,500
I took this from you.

245
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,090
Do you know

246
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,060
this thing could cost you your life?

247
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,900
Give it to me.

248
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,060
I know it could cost my life.

249
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
But only this way

250
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,260
in such an illusion

251
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,660
I feel like a man.

252
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,460
Mother,

253
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,280
I used to listen to everything you said.

254
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,900
But starting today,

255
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
I will not listen.

256
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,740
I will not listen anymore.

257
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,260
- Give it to me.
- Get lost.

258
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,540
Don't touch me.

259
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,860
Feng.

260
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,620
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

261
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,700
Wanning,

262
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,460
these are the things you love to eat.

263
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,780
I made them all myself.

264
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,900
Eat more.

265
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,780
Mother,

266
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,620
what are you doing?

267
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,740
I'm not quite used
to you being like this.

268
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,380
Mother,

269
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,820
what are you doing?

270
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,820
Wanning,

271
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,700
I beg you to let us go.

272
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,700
Feng.

273
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,420
Mother, Yunfeng, what exactly
do you want me to do?

274
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,980
We were in the wrong before.

275
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,980
But if you could give us a chance,

276
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,820
from now on, you will be in charge
of this household.

277
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,340
Feng and I

278
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,700
will all listen to you.

279
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,100
Wanning,

280
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,180
previously, I wronged you.

281
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,260
I was heartless.

282
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,740
Please forgive me.

283
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,820
Before, I was wholeheartedly devoted
to the family.

284
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,580
But you actually swapped my child.

285
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,620
If not for this,

286
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,220
how did we end up in such a situation?

287
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,100
Wanning, the child has been found now.

288
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,700
Let's live a good life together.

289
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,580
Alright, Wanning?

290
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,140
At present, the reputation of our family
is beyond repair.

291
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,220
But we still have to carry on
with our lives.

292
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,980
For the sake of all these years
of affection,

293
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,700
I beg you to have Commander Pei spare us.

294
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,180
Since you have said so,

295
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,660
I will think about it carefully.
