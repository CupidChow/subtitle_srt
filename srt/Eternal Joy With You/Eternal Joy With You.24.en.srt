00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,300
=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 24=

2
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,950
Commander,

3
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,310
you are so flustered.

4
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,670
Where are you going?

5
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,920
To find Wanning and Chang'an.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
No need to find them.

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,670
My daughter has already left.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,840
Left?

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,110
Why?

10
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,200
I don't know either.

11
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,750
What unresolved issues do you have?

12
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,760
My daughter said she wants
to leave for a while,

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,280
to search for some kind of answer.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,120
(Turns out she has never let go.)

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,310
(Indeed.)

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,180
(It was I who wronged her,
deceived her, and lied to her.)

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,400
(If it were me,)

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,140
(I wouldn't be able to let go either.)

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,120
Commander Pei,

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,840
we are here to say goodbye.

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,710
My illness has already been cured.

22
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,350
Our house has also been reclaimed by you.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,280
We have disturbed you
for quite some time.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,430
It's time to go back.

25
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,590
If you see Wanning in the future,

26
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,990
please pass on a message for me.

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,610
The Xu Family's gates will always
be open for her.

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,990
We're waiting for her to come back.

29
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,500
That's right.

30
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,710
The gates will always be open for her.

31
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,950
We're waiting for her.

32
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,790
Pei Heng,

33
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,800
do you still remember
when we were little,

34
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,630
we often played and chatted here?

35
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,870
I remember.

36
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,360
At that time you said

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,780
you want to become a good emperor
who serves the nation and the people.

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,870
I said I want to become a good general

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,130
who protects the family
and defends the nation.

40
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,590
Yes.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,360
Those were such wonderful times.

42
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,060
Carefree and without worries.

43
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,870
Full of ambition.

44
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,630
Pei Heng, you...

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,360
What are you doing?

46
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,270
Your Majesty,

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,220
I wish to resign from my post.

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,520
Please grant permission.

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Resign from office?

50
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,710
It is because of Xu Wanning?

51
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,630
I heard she ran away from home.

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,240
Pei Heng,

53
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,910
there are millions of women
in the world.

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,400
I will choose someone
more suitable for you.

55
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,310
You can have as many as you want.

56
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,960
Xu Wanning once married to someone else.

57
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,800
She was never a match for you.

58
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
Your Majesty,

59
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,330
the millions of women in the world
have nothing to do with me.

60
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,750
I only love her.

61
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,800
I did not resign for her.

62
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
It was for myself.

63
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,030
Yourself?

64
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,150
You want to become the great general
admired by all.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,840
Pei Heng,

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,710
what do you want?

67
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,150
I can grant you anything.

68
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,030
As long as you stay by my side.

69
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,470
I have already been

70
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,910
a great general.

71
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,750
Now

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,360
I just want to be myself again.

73
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,120
You are blaming me?

74
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,120
Blaming that your injury back then
had something to do with me.

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,710
Pei Heng,

76
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,520
I didn't mean it back then.

77
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,620
At that time, I just ascended the throne
and my position was unstable.

78
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,590
I did want to use you to help me
get rid of my uncle.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But I did not expect him
to be so malicious

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,630
and use Xiaoxiao's life
to set up a trap,

81
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,150
- only then did I...
- Your Majesty,

82
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,560
it's all in the past.

83
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,600
I just feel

84
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,950
the nation is safe and sound,

85
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,850
and the people are prosperous now.

86
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,240
I can appropriately set aside my duty

87
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,390
to protect the home
and defend the nation.

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,950
If in the future,

89
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,310
you still need me.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,780
I will certainly go
through fire and water,

91
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,270
without hesitation.

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,400
Forget it.

93
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,310
Go ahead.

94
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,510
Go be a flying bird,

95
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,390
free and unrestrained.

96
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,320
These past years,

97
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,270
thank you, Your Majesty.

98
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
Your Highness.

99
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,800
Benefactor, you have mistaken me
for someone else.

100
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,070
Amitabha.

101
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,040
Master, where exactly

102
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,830
did Aunt Ning and Chang'an go?

103
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,670
I don't know.

104
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,470
Perhaps far away at the edge of the sky,

105
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
perhaps right before our eyes.

106
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,630
I want to see her and Chang'an
immediately.

107
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,480
I miss them so much.

108
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
So do I.

109
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,480
I miss them so much.

110
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,800
So sorrowful, again and again,

111
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,630
yet there's no need to weep
over marriage;

112
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,270
may I find one true heart,

113
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,110
and stay together until our hair
turns white.

114
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,920
If there was no fate in a past life,

115
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,630
let us tie it anew

116
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,270
in the next life.

117
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,560
You once said you would never
betray me in this life.

118
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,720
So why have you abandoned me now?

119
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,500
Ladies,

120
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,750
you've been crying for so long.

121
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,190
Are you going to jump or not?

122
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,700
If you're going to jump, then hurry up.

123
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,390
Ladies,

124
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,040
I don't know what has happened.

125
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,630
Why not tell me about it?

126
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,920
Perhaps I can help you.

127
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,400
No.

128
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,110
Darling,

129
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,310
let's meet again in the next life.

130
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,720
Why are you here?

131
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,990
I heard there is Lady Xu nearby

132
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,750
who can identify heartless men.

133
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,200
I guessed it must be you.

134
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,870
Aunt Ning, Aunt Ning.

135
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,960
We finally found you.

136
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,350
Ruyi.

137
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,120
We met at Shilian Lane in Qingshui Town.

138
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,910
He and I agreed to elope together.

139
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,750
But he never showed up,

140
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,390
which led to my disgrace.

141
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,390
I borrowed a lot of silver
for him to buy a house.

142
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,670
But in the end, I lost both the money
and the person.

143
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,870
I was tricked into marriage
by his sweet talk.

144
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,320
And when I woke up the next day,

145
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,000
he had disappeared with the dowry.

146
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,960
These men

147
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,840
are truly more outrageous than the last.

148
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,720
Do you want to find them?

149
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,560
Yes, I do.

150
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,320
Tell me

151
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,550
how old he is

152
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,390
and how tall he is.

153
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,910
Xiao is just 20 years old.

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,240
Li is eight feet tall.

155
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
What does he look like?

156
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,440
Sun has a pair of peach blossom eyes.

157
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,510
He is very good-looking.

158
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,360
Xiao's eyes are also beautiful.

159
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,390
But what I love most is his voice.

160
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,930
Enchanting and pleasant to hear.

161
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,320
Especially when he calls me darling.

162
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,920
Does he have any distinctive marks?

163
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,510
Li has a birthmark next to his ear.

164
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,120
Sun also has one next to his ear.

165
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,360
It is in the shape of a heart.

166
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,320
This...

167
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,320
My husband has the same one.

168
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,960
Peach blossom eyes.

169
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,120
Heart-shaped birthmark.

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,360
- Xiao.
- Li. - Sun.

171
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,840
The gentleman you speak of
is actually the same person.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,200
Ah!

173
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,390
He deceived so many women
at the same time.

174
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
He's truly despicable.

175
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,800
This is simple.

176
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,280
Leave it to me.

177
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
He is a professional.

178
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,510
Let's wait for a while.

179
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,360
You're really fast.

180
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,200
I do things for my wife.

181
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,240
I can't fall behind.

182
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,840
Who is your wife?

183
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,550
Xiao, that day you did not show up.

184
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,080
Was it because something delayed you?

185
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,360
Tell me, do you still love me?

186
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,510
Say something.

187
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,360
Li, did you take the silver I gave you

188
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,550
to look for a house?

189
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,720
It's OK if you didn't find it.

190
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,940
As long as you still love me.

191
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,480
You've already married me.

192
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,510
You must love me.

193
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,840
Isn't that right? Tell me quickly.

194
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,910
Say that you love me.

195
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,320
Hurry up and speak, say it.

196
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,560
There really are a lot of people
who can't be woken up.

197
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,390
Who are you?

198
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,000
What does my behavior have
to do with you?

199
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,280
Who are you talking to?

200
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,440
What right do you have to hit me?

201
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,080
I'm hitting you.

202
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,000
This kind of man lies on the bed
saying he wants to elope with you.

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,550
Finally, he disappears without a trace.

204
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,970
Other than lusting after your body,

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,280
what else does he want from you?

206
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,440
He talks about buying a house,

207
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,840
but runs off with the silver.

208
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,200
Apart from loving your money,

209
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,990
what else does he love about you?

210
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,790
He married you.

211
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,000
Does he want to live a life with you?

212
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,750
He wants to live off your dowry.

213
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,750
Wake up!

214
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,370
A hypocrite who deceives for money,
lust, and marriage like him,

215
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,630
apart from loving himself,

216
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,470
loves no one.

217
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,000
For such a culprit who hurt you,

218
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,200
not only do you not punish him,

219
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,910
you even degrade yourselves like this.

220
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,840
This really is eye-opening.

221
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,650
Love yourself before loving others.

222
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,790
We women can risk everything for love.

223
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,200
But look at the person in front of you.
Is he worth it?

224
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,360
He deceives you like this.

225
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,550
Can you tolerate it?

226
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,390
No.

227
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Then since you can't,

228
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,650
what are you standing there for?

229
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,750
Hit him!

230
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Liar!

231
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,870
Scumbag, liar!

232
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,790
Scumbag, I'll beat you to death!

233
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,660
Liar!

234
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,270
You heartless man!

235
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,320
You scumbag!

236
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,840
Give me back my silver!

237
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,910
Stop hitting!

238
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,050
Return my silver.

239
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,580
Great!

240
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,630
That's what you get for two-timing.

241
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,870
You're quite savvy now.

242
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,180
Three-timing.

243
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,840
I learned it from you.

244
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,870
Give me back my money.

245
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,710
Stinking man!

246
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,360
I beat you to death.

247
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,200
Chang'an.

248
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,840
Chang'an, look who's here.

249
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,440
Master.

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,750
Chang'an, I miss you so much.

251
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,440
Ruyi, me too.

252
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,650
Look, once you left,

253
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,000
you made us suffer so much.

254
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,390
Even Chang'an has to cook now.

255
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,200
So what?

256
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,030
How can this be called suffering?

257
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,870
This is called early training,

258
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,360
so as not to wrong some girl
in the future, right?

259
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,790
As his mother, you're too ruthless.

260
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,630
You think you've done well as a father?

261
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,360
So you admit I'm his father now.

262
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,200
Chang'an, has the meal been prepared?

263
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,040
I am hungry.

264
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,270
I am hungry too.

265
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,000
And me.

266
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,270
Ah? You all want me to cook?

267
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,240
No, don't!
