14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,840
Yue!

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,720
Yue!

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,680
Yue.

17
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,080
Yue.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,640
Yue.

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,600
Back off, back off!

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,680
Mr. Jifeng, what should we do now?

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,850
Take her back first.

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,240
Quickly call the doctor over.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,840
Yes.

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,280
Qin Jifeng.

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,640
What did you do to Yue?

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,700
What did you do to Yue?

27
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,760
- Let her go.
- There's nothing to see.

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,760
Liang Jiahao.

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,080
She just jumped out of the window.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,360
Stop the fuss!

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,440
Take Mr. Jiahao back to the mansion.

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,080
Yes.

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,960
Let's go, Mr. Jiahao.

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,940
(Governor's Mansion)

35
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,050
What exactly happened?

36
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,170
When I arrived,

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,160
she jumped out of the window,

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,400
hit her head,

39
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,680
and passed out.

40
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,030
Did she jump off herself?

41
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,520
Yes, she jumped as soon as I arrived

42
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,880
Qin Jifeng.

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,810
What do you want to do?

44
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,000
Haven't you caused enough trouble?

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,760
Yue.

46
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,020
Yue.

47
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,760
You're awake.

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,880
Jiahao.

49
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,320
I...

50
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,510
How are you?

51
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,390
Mr. Liang.

52
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,320
Mrs. Liang.

53
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,640
Why are you all here?

54
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,920
Who...

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,160
Who are you?

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,640
Yue, are you feeling unwell somewhere?

57
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,560
I...

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,280
I seem to...

59
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,640
I seem to have forgotten a lot of things.

60
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,490
What do you

61
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,810
still remember?

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,990
I remember

63
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,000
I received the news of my father's death.

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,840
Then I bought the earliest ticket back.

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,160
And then...

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,040
And then I can't remember anymore.

67
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
Where's my dad?

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,440
Did something really happen to my dad?

69
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,600
- Yue.
- I need to find him.

70
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,990
If you can't remember, don't think about it.

71
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,360
It's okay. I'm here.

72
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,080
- This...
- Don't think about it.

73
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,800
This is amnesia.

74
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,900
What should we do now?

75
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,640
Miss Ouyang indeed seems to have amnesia.

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
It might be due to severe mental trauma

77
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,200
and also a brain injury.

78
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,600
Didn't you like roses?

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,280
When did you start planting daisies?

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,240
Roses have thorns.

81
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,000
Not everyone can grow them.

82
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,480
Unlike daisies,

83
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,600
which are innocent and elegant.

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,680
Suitable for home and family.

85
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,500
Don't you agree, brother?

86
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,680
What did you call me?

87
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,650
You are my fiancé's brother.

88
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,560
I should call you brother.

89
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,960
You really don't remember anything?

90
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,000
What should I remember?

91
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
What should you remember?

92
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,800
You should remember who killed Master Ouyang.

93
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,960
And now you're going to marry his son.

94
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

95
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,280
Yue,

96
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,720
you remember everything,

97
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,200
right?

98
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,760
I am your brother's fiancée.

99
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,720
Manners, please, brother.

100
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,230
Master,

101
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,840
do you suspect that Miss Ouyang
is pretending to have amnesia?

102
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,640
Listen,

103
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,440
help me arrange a meeting with an old friend.

104
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,470
Yes.

105
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,660
I'll do it.

106
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,030
- Yue.
- Yue.

107
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,480
You just recovered.

108
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,880
Drink more soup.

109
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,320
Thank you.

110
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,080
Jiahao,

111
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,790
there's a bit of dirt here.

112
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,910
Yue,

113
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,570
from now on,

114
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,760
you have to help me take care of Jiahao more.

115
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,440
He's been spoiled by me.

116
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
He never grows up.

117
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,940
Ma'am, you're too kind.

118
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,340
Jiahao and I will soon be married.

119
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,170
I will take good care of him.

120
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,630
By the way, Yue,

121
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,460
your uncle's plaque

122
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,000
hasn't been placed in your family's
ancestral hall.

123
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,240
Now you're the only one left in the family.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,280
It's up to you if his plaque should

125
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,280
be placed in the ancestral hall.

126
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,890
Jiahao has told me everything about my uncle.

127
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
After all, he is my uncle.

128
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,750
Bring him back to the ancestral hall someday.

129
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,520
Yue is really magnanimous.

130
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,880
You have a kind heart.

131
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,120
Once you become a family,

132
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,100
no one will bully you anymore.

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,880
Our Jiahao

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,940
will not let you suffer any grievances.

135
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,820
You two brothers

136
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,160
help me handle some matters
at the company this afternoon.

137
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,520
Yes, Father.

138
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes, Father.

139
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,680
Yue can stay at home.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,480
I have an appointment with an acquaintance.

141
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
His family is also in the shipping business.

142
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,840
If you want to revive the company,
you can use some connections.

143
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,770
Thank you for your efforts, Mr. Liang.

144
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,000
Let's eat.

145
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,640
Mr. Liang said that your family
is also in the shipping business.

146
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,860
He asked me to seek your advice.

147
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,000
Miss Ouyang,

148
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,960
long time no see.

149
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,480
Why?

150
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,420
Miss Ouyang,

151
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,080
are you very afraid of me?

152
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,040
You must be joking, sir.

153
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,880
It's our first meeting.

154
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,080
How could I be afraid?

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,880
The first time?

156
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,000
I couldn't forget you, Miss Ouyang.

157
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,910
Your body is so soft and smooth.

158
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,130
Your hair carries a fragrance.

159
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,080
I already told you I don't know you.

160
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,900
This is the Governor's Mansion.

161
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,140
Please show some respect, sir.

162
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,400
Don't know me?

163
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,440
Then let's relive it.

164
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,760
Maybe you'll remember me.

165
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,730
Let go of me.

166
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,160
I already told you I don't know you.

167
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,930
Let go of me!

168
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,710
Liang Jiahao.

169
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,590
Jiahao, save me! Jiahao, save me.

170
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,920
Today, I was able to come here.

171
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,520
You should know what that means.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,610
- Come on.
- Jiahao.

173
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,760
Let her go.

174
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,680
It's you again.

175
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,870
I'll kill you!

176
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,120
You can't kill me. I...

177
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,930
I not only remember you,

178
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,520
but also want to kill you.

179
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,960
Yue!

180
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,600
Yue!

181
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,840
