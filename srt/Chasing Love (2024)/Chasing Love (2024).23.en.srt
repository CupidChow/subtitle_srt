(My dear father Liang Zongyue)

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,350
Jiahao.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,480
Dad, it's going to explode. Let's go

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,400
Take Jiahao away.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,240
Quickly.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,400
Yes.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
- Dad!
- Mr. Jiahao.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,120
- Dad!
- Go.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,960
Dad!

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,200
Dad!

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,400
You haven't closed your eyes for days.

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,890
Your dad is gone.

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,040
You have to support this family.

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
Jiahao.

28
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,920
I only have you now.

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Mom,

30
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,440
I know what to do.

31
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
From now on,

32
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,320
I'll be the Governor of Hongcheng.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,240
Pass the order.

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,110
Seal off Hongcheng.

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,330
Arrest Ouyang Yue and Qin Jifeng.

36
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,820
(Hongcheng Hotel)

37
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,920
I just gathered and told the directors

38
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,970
that Liang Zongyue smuggled arms

39
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,790
and set up the company.

40
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,680
Now everyone in Hongcheng knows

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,120
that Fortune Trading Company is innocent.

42
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,720
Qin Jifeng.

43
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,800
Thank you.

44
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,080
Soon you will be able to revive the company

45
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,360
and fulfill your dad's last wish.

46
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,040
Then we can find a good day

47
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,840
to properly arrange his funeral.

48
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,210
Boss,

49
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,440
Liang Jiahao raided the gang hall

50
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,820
and captured the brothers.

51
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,040
I barely escaped.

52
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,920
What do we do now?

53
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,020
Yue,

54
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,840
I can't leave the brothers behind.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,200
I have to get them out.

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,600
Wait for me.

57
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,760
Okay.

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,520
Qin Jifeng.

59
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,560
Be careful.

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,240
Keep her safe.

61
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,520
Okay.

62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,360
Miss Ouyang.

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,600
Don't worry.

64
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,920
Boss will be fine.

65
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,140
He will be back soon.

66
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,360
It's okay.

67
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,020
Chen Qi.

68
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,800
Don't worry.

69
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,280
I won't kill him.

70
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,880
I'll spare his life to send a message.

71
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,960
One good news.

72
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,240
One bad news.

73
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,040
The bad news is that Qin Jifeng escaped.

74
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,280
The good news is

75
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,680
we can get married tomorrow

76
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,880
in the church.

77
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,860
This flower

78
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,450
is so beautiful.

79
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Smile.

80
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,760
I want you to smile!

81
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,000
Jiahao.

82
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,880
Jiahao, don't do this.

83
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,840
Don't do this, Jiahao.

84
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,200
Do what?

85
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,480
The old Liang Jiahao

86
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,880
was like a dog following you around.

87
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,480
He was devoted to you.

88
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,360
Did you ever cherish him?

89
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,560
It was you.

90
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,200
It was you who trampled on his love.

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,600
Now I pick it up

92
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,880
and place it in your hands.

93
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,440
But you find it dirty,

94
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,840
don't you?

95
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,640
Don't you?

96
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,400
No.

It doesn't matter anymore.
