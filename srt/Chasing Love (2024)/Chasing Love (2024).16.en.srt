14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,840
Master, have some tea.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,540
Jifeng,

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,470
why did you do this today?

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,900
Father,

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
everything I said was true

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,720
and it was all from my heart.

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,800
The marriage with the Ouyang family

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,920
was meant for your eldest son.

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,000
But since I got separated from you
when I was young,

23
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,160
this marriage fell upon my brother.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,040
But now that I have returned,

25
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,200
Father,

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,200
shouldn't you reconsider this marriage?

27
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,360
Jiahao and I are childhood sweethearts.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,450
He is my fiancé.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
As for you,

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,480
I don't know you at all.

31
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,400
Jifeng,

32
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,080
it's not that I'm being unfair.

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,080
Although this marriage agreement

34
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,280
was indeed set for my eldest son,

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,680
as things stand now,

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,760
you have already missed the chance.

37
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Moreover, Jiahao and Yue
are fond of each other.

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,240
As the big brother,

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,920
why not

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,520
let them be together?

41
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,760
Alright, Father.

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,840
I apologize for what I did today.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,680
I shouldn't have been so reckless

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,640
and embarrassed you.

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,880
But ever since I returned,

46
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,200
I've been idle at home every day.

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,860
I can't help you with anything,

48
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
so I felt anxious

49
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,590
and lost my composure.

50
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,440
I know my brother grew up by your side

51
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,480
and helped you with military affairs.

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,680
He has a deep bond with you.

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,080
There are many things
I can't get involved in.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,160
You have great ambitions.

55
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,880
That's right.

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,160
It's all my fault
for not considering everything thoroughly.

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,800
In that case,

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
Jiahao, split half of your military affairs
with your big brother.

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,720
Let him get familiar with it
as soon as possible.

60
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,120
Our family

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,490
will eventually rely on you two brothers.

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,400
We must live in harmony.

63
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,140
Only by working together can it last long.

64
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,210
Thank you, Father.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,720
From now on, my brother and I
will definitely live in harmony.

66
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,120
Understood, Dad.

67
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,560
Good.

68
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,870
Very good.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
The Boss has done so much for you.

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,600
Why don't you appreciate it at all?

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,960
Who do you think found the doctor
when you were in a coma?

72
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,160
Why do you think he insists
on sending you away this time?

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,200
He clearly knew I was pretending.

74
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,880
But he didn't expose me.

75
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,330
What exactly does he want to do?

76
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,880
Why are you here?

77
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,240
I...

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,320
Don't you have anything to say to me?

79
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,280
I've said everything I needed to say.

80
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,650
Don't you want to know

81
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,680
why I didn't expose your fake amnesia?

82
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,910
My mouth hurts so much.

83
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,000
No one even cooked an egg for me.

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,690
No one cares about me.

85
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,360
Did you arrange that free clinic back then?

86
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,160
What exactly do you want to do?

87
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,840
Tell me first.

88
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,490
Why did you take such a big risk to come back?

89
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,460
What do you want to do?

90
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,720
What do I want to do?

91
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,840
Of course, I came back

92
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,150
to be the Governor's daughter-in-law
that everyone envies.

93
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,400
There's no one else here.

94
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,850
Why do you say that?

95
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,000
You can tell the truth.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,600
You're not a vain person.

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,160
I am telling the truth.

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,760
Who doesn't crave for wealth and power?

99
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,600
Otherwise, why would you try so hard
to get into this family?

100
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,440
I...

101
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,040
There are many things I can't explain
to you right now.

102
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,600
Then don't explain them.

103
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,720
I never really understood you.

104
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,620
Qin Jifeng.

105
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,080
Such conversations will never happen again.

106
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Mrs. Liang.

107
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,480
Yue, you're awake.

108
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,720
The wedding dress we ordered
has been delivered to the tailor shop.

109
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,340
Let's go have some morning tea first.

110
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,160
Then we can try on the wedding dress.

111
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,280
Sure.

112
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,120
Is there no one at home today?

113
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,090
Mr. Liang

114
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,920
took Jiahao and Jifeng out
early in the morning.

115
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,480
Today, it's just the two of us. Let's go.

116
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,400
Alright.

117
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,680
Mrs. Liang.

118
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,830
My necklace suddenly broke.

119
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,910
Look, I can't fasten it.

120
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,160
What should I do?

121
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,130
I need to go upstairs and pick another one.

122
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,500
It's okay.

123
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,160
I'll buy you a new one when we go out later.

124
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,280
No, Mrs. Liang.

125
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,120
I specifically chose this necklace
for the wedding dress.

126
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,890
It goes with the earrings and everything.

127
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
Now everything is messed up.

128
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,640
I need to find a new set to match.

129
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,400
How about this?

130
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,000
Pinxiangzhai is not far.

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,540
You go and have some tea first.

132
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,620
After trying on the wedding dress,
we can go to the opera house.

133
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,920
Alright.

134
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,400
I'll go first.

135
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,060
Come quickly.

136
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,900
Okay.

137
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,380

138
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,260

139
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,550
