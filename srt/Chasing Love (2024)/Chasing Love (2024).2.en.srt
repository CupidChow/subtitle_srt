=Episode 2=

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,400
Boss,

15
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,920
are you okay?

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,160
You scared me to death yesterday.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,040
I was afraid I would miss it.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,680
It's nothing serious.

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,240
How is Miss Ouyang doing?

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,800
We sent a telegram to bring her back

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,760
and staged the show saving her life.

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,120
Can our revenge plan

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,240
be realized?

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,280
She was taken away by Liang Jiahao.

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,280
What?

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,800
Then all our efforts were in vain.

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,320
I saved her life.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,720
She will come to me.

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,680
Liang Jiahao wants to marry her.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,920
It's not that easy.

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,600
Mr. Liang,

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,840
the man with Miss Ouyang that day
was Qin Jifeng.

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,040
He betrayed the Hong Gang
and is being hunted.

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,200
How about I send someone to get rid of him?

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,360
Why bother doing it yourself?

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,800
Yue would be unhappy.

37
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,440
Find a way

38
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,160
to tip the Hong Gang of his whereabouts.

39
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,440
Understand?

40
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,640
Yes.

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,080
Red House has introduced a few new cakes.

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,480
I specially invited all the pastry chefs over

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,960
and had them make their best pastries.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,960
Try them.

45
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,080
See whose you like.

46
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,160
No need to go to such trouble.

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,520
It's no trouble.

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,680
As long as you like it.

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,280
Miss Ouyang,

50
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,160
this is delivered.

51
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,640
The man said it's for you.

52
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,360
For me?

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,840
Not at all.

54
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,720
Come on.

55
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
Is everything alright?

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,360
Yes.

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,320
Take it away.

58
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,160
Yes.

59
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,880
Jiahao,

60
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,640
what happens to the traitors

61
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,920
of the Hong Gang?

62
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,960
The Hong Gang and I

63
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,280
usually don't have much interaction.

64
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,320
However, the rules of these gangs

65
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
are more or less the same.

66
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,080
Betraying the gang

67
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,480
can result in broken limbs

68
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,640
or even a bitter death on the streets.

69
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,360
Don't go out

70
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,000
tonight.

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,080
You betrayed Master Shanhai.

72
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,280
Today you will die bitterly.

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,360
What are you doing here?

74
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
Didn't you ask me to come?

75
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm just returning what belongs to you.

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,800
Didn't you want to repay a favor?

77
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,400
From now on,

78
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,680
you will be my bodyguard.

79
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,880
I hope you keep your promise

80
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,120
and repay the favor properly.

81
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,000
Be careful.

82
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
Jiahao?

83
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,680
It's raining so heavily outside.

84
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,480
Why did you go out?

85
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,240
Jiahao,

86
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,080
Qin Jifeng offended my uncle

87
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,440
and the Hong Gang to save me.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,240
I couldn't just ignore him.

89
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,680
Yue,

90
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,000
your clothes.

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,480
Go back to your room
and change into clean clothes first.

92
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,240
But he...

93
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,440
Don't worry.

94
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,040
I'll take care of the bandaging.

95
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,190
Alright.

96
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,520
Lieutenant Li.

97
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,480
Yes.

98
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,480
Bandage him.

99
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,600
Mr. Liang.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,580
You didn't die

101
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,640
for betraying the Hong Gang.

102
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,680
That's something.

103
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,840
Why don't you

104
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,120
work for me at my mansion?

105
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,880
I'm Miss Ouyang's bodyguard.

106
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,080
I only protect Miss Ouyang.
