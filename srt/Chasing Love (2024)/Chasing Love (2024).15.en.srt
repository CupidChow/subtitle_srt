14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,200
Where are we going?

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,120
This isn't the way to the tailor shop.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,760
This is the way to the dock.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,560
Who are you?

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,720
What do you want to do?

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,560
Let me out of the car.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,880
Miss Ouyang,

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,200
Boss instructed us to get you out safely.

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,800
Don't worry.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,000
Boss has arranged everything you wanted.

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,800
Today, the Governor's Mansion is hosting
an Engagement Banquet.

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,360
The security is the most relaxed.

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,000
No one will come after us.

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,840
It was you.

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,880
I don't want to leave.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,920
Let me out.

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,120
Miss Ouyang,

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,000
Boss is concerned about your safety.

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,840
He will come to meet you
after he finishes his business.

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,920
Please cooperate.

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,520
Congratulations, Mrs. Liang.

35
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,760
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

36
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,940
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.

37
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,080
Wanhua.

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,750
Excuse me.

39
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,000
- Master.
- What time is it?

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,160
Why hasn't it started yet?

41
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,880
Jiahao is waiting for Yue.

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,640
Jiahao.

43
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,190
Jiahao.

44
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,960
Dad.

45
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,710
Where is Yue?

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,600
Yue went to pick up her dress.

47
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,060
It's been several hours already.

48
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,090
Then hurry up and call to ask.

49
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,510
(At this time, the ship should have sailed.)

50
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,640
Is Miss Ouyang still there?

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,520
What? Yue never went over?

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,800
Where did you hide Yue?

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,080
You can't even keep an eye on your bride.

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,360
Now you're asking me where she is?

55
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,190
You know exactly what you're planning.

56
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,000
It seems today's engagement won't happen.

57
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,420
Go on with this tantrum.

58
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,830
I'm going back to sleep.

59
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,250
Don't go.

60
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,210
If anything happens to Yue,

61
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,080
I'll take your life.

62
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,310
What are you shouting for?

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,820
We have guests.

64
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,960
Aren't you ashamed?

65
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,910
Father, Yue is missing.

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,440
Could she be in danger?

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,840
Son, don't worry.

68
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,040
Everyone in Hongcheng knows

69
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,040
she'll be the Governor's daughter-in-law.

70
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,080
Who would dare to harm her?

71
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,440
Master, should we send men to look for her?

72
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,710
- Lieutenant Li.
- Yes.

73
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,440
Give the order to seal off Hongcheng.

74
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,420
We must find Yue no matter what.

75
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,580
Yes.

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,120
Why aren't you going?

77
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,730
Yue, where did you go?

78
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,160
I called the tailor shop.

79
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,240
They said you didn't go there.

80
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,280
I was worried about you.

81
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,580
I was halfway there.

82
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,390
Then I remembered there was a dress
at home.

83
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,690
It was my mother's engagement gown.

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,680
On such an important day,

85
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,150
I thought it would be more appropriate
to wear it.

86
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,610
Mr. and Mrs. Liang.

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,680
I went home to get a dress.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
Sorry for worrying everyone.

89
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,760
Today is a very important day for me.

90
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,060
I won't let anyone ruin it.

91
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,640
It's good that you're okay.

92
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,560
Yes, glad that you're okay.

93
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,040
Go get ready.

94
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,140
The banquet is about to start.

95
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,350
Jiahao,

96
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,220
I'll go upstairs to touch up my makeup.

97
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,140
I'll be down in a moment.

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,440
Go ahead.

99
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,750
Go on.

100
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,010
Miss Ouyang, Boss is doing this
for your good.

101
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,160
Just listen to him.

102
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
Stop the car.

103
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,600
Why would Qin Jifeng help me?

104
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,040
That's simply laughable.

105
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,120
Stop the car now.

106
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,640
The Boss has done so much for you.

107
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
How can you not appreciate it at all?

108
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,520
Who do you think found the doctor
when you were unconscious?

109
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,440
Why do you think he insists
on sending you away this time?

110
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,560
- Miss Ouyang.
- Let go.

111
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,400
Miss Ouyang.

112
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,560
- Hangs off.
- Stop the car.

113
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,000
Brother, what advice do you have?

114
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,160
Why didn't you leave?

115
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,600
I don't understand what you mean.

116
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,200
Today is my engagement day.

117
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,840
Why should I leave?

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you don't leave now,

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,520
there will be no way out in the future.

120
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,340
Be careful what you're doing.

121
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,560
After today,

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,840
I will be Jiahao's wife.

123
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,960
Wife.

124
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,000
Are you really going to marry someone
you don't like?

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,280
Then let me say it again.

126
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,310
The bond between Jiahao and me

127
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,820
is far beyond what you can imagine.

128
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,530
Congratulations.

129
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,720
You're lying.

130
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,520

Liang Jiahao, let me tell you.

145
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm the eldest son of this house.

146
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,720

147
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,320
Everything here is mine.

148
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,400
You're the one competing with me.

150
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,280
Much appreciated.

151
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,840
We should look out for each other.

152
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,380
Yes.

Jiahao, Jiahao, stop fighting. Jiahao.

154
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,560

- Jifeng, Jiahao?

156
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,480
Jiahao, stop fighting.

157
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,130

They're Governor Liang's sons.

159

- Keep it down. You talk too much.
