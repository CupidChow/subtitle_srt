(Arms Contract)

16
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,240
So this is what you wanted.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,520
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,400
I should be the one asking you that.

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,040
Give it back to me.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,840
You pretended to have amnesia
and stayed in the mansion

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,960
just to find this, huh?

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,960
This is evidence
of Liang Zongyue smuggling arms.

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,120
Either give it back to me

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,160
or

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,880
kill me right now.

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,400
Father, you could have asked someone
to get the document.

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,720
Why did you come back specially?

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,120
Do you

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,640
even have a brain?

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,120
Can we trust arms smuggling

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,480
to others?

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,900
We're going to negotiate with Mr. Smith

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,640
and you left the contract at home.

34
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,500
How can I trust you with the business?

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,050
It won't happen again.

36
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,320
Let go of me.

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,120
Let go.

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,320
What can you do if you get the document?

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,600
The Governor has absolute power in Hongcheng.

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,320
Where can you go to accuse him?

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,360
How will you avenge?

42
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,480
That's my business.

43
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,600
Stay out of it.

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,760
Let go of me.

45
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,720
Meet me in the greenhouse tonight.

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,600
I'll give you an answer.

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,560
Alright, sir.

48
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,000
Father.

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,720
Jifeng.

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
What are you doing here?

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,120
Mr. Smith called.

52
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,280
He said he wants to discuss
the contract with you today.

53
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,840
When you left this morning,

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,380
I noticed you didn't take the contract.

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,880
(File) I was going to send it to you.

56
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,400
Do you know Smith?

57
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,520
I met him before when I worked
for Ouyang Shanhai.

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,680
We had a few drinks before.

59
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,880
So I know him.

60
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,320
Since you know him,

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,200
why didn't you mention him before?

62
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,800
Do you appear in the study room

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,280
because you want to help?

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,480
Do you have another motive?

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,470
So,

66
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,520
you know

67
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,320
what kind of business we are doing.

68
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,600
Father,

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
you handed over half
of the military affairs to me.

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,480
Naturally, I know something.

71
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,520
If you don't say,

72
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,760
I won't ask.

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,520
If you trust me,

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
I will do my best.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,480
There will be no mistakes.

76
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,000
Good.

77
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,880
Come with us

78
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,680
to the negotiation.

79
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,400
Yes.

80
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,440
Meet me in the greenhouse tonight.

81
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,320

116
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,440
We will move out together.

Father has agreed to hold our wedding
on the tenth of next month.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,890
I've thought it over.

119
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,880
Whether it's the Governor's Mansion

120
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,280
or the Ouyang Mansion,

121
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,080
they are gone.

We

123
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,960
need to have a future that belongs to us,

124
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,840
a home that belongs to us.

125

it doesn't matter.

Jiahao,

127
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,320
you've done so much for me.

128
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm afraid I can't repay you.

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,400
Silly,

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,040
we'll be husband and wife.
You don't owe anything.

131
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,770
As I told you,

132
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,160
as long as you like it,

133
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,240
I will do it.

134
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,370
Yue, you finally came.

135
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,610
What exactly do you want to say?

136
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,080
Don't you want to know

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,640
why I went through so much trouble
to return to the Liang Family?

138
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,020
I'll tell you now.

00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,240
I also want to destroy the arms

142
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,480
