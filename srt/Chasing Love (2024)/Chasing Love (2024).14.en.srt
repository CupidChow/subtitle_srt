Father,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,380
this person tried to rape Yue.

22
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,720
Yue did it to protect our reputation.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,960
It's all my fault.

24
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,720
I shouldn't have let him in

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,220

26
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,160

Come.

00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,160
should die.

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,680

Not interested

75
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,320
Liu Xiaoneng came to the house today.

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,640
Liu Xiaoneng?

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,080
Yes.

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,760

- Dead.

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,240
Dead?

80
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,600
He tried to insult Yue.

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,840
Yue shot and killed him.

82
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,940
What?

83
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,310
Yes.

84
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,200
Weren't you supposed to protect her?

85
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,800

What right do you have to say this?

87
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,560
Yue forgot

88
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,520
what have you done.

89
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,440
But I remember it clearly.

90
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,360
Stay out of Yue's life

91
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,960
from now on.

92
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,380
Master,

93
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,570
Mr. Liu's funeral has been properly arranged.

94
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,010
Master,

95
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,450
has Miss Ouyang really lost her memory?

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,900
She is a pampered rich girl.

97
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,470
Faced with someone trying to insult her,

98
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,280
she was able to remain calm

99
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,480
and didn't give herself away.

100
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,670
Either she is very scheming

101
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,600
or she has truly lost her memory.

102
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,600
But Miss Ouyang killed Mr. Liu.

103
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,590
Father,

104
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,630
even if you suspect Yue,

105
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,840
you shouldn't test her like this.

106
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,700
It's too dangerous.

107
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,320
What's with the shouting?

108
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,280
Are you questioning me?

109
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,910
Yue was seriously injured.

110
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,990
The doctor also said she lost her memory.

111
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,360
You shouldn't doubt her anymore.

112
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,520
How can you be sure

113
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,240
she isn't lying to you?

114
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,280
I guarantee with my life

115
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,680
that Yue would never lie to me.

116
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,740
Forget it.

117
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,730
Hold the Engagement Banquet tomorrow.

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,680
So everyone can be at ease.

119
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,800
Thank you, Father.

120
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,920
(I need to quickly send Yue away.)

121
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,520
(There is still time.)

122
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,500
Yue's father was not killed
by Ouyang Shanhai at all.

123
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,850
It was you.

124
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,400
It was me.

125
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,930
Quickly marry her.

126
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,290
What I want is the shipping rights
of Fortune Trading Company.

127
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,920
Yue.

128
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,870
What are you doing here?

129
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,750
Jifeng.

130
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,680
Your act

131
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,120
should be over by now, right?

132
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,010
I'll kill you.

133
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,040
I made an appointment with an acquaintance.

134
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,360
- His family is also in the shipping business.
- Jiahao, save me.

135
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,470
- Jiahao!
- Today, I was able to come here.

136
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,080
You should know what that means.

137
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,400
Come on.

138
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,600
Jiahao!

139
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,420
Yue.

140
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,050
Today is your big day.

141
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,780
Why aren't you happy?

142
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,760
Brother, why do you say that?

143
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm marrying my childhood sweetheart,

144
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,080
the Governor's son who has loved me
since childhood.

145
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,080
I couldn't be happier.

146
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,100
Yue, are you ready?

147
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,080
The guests have arrived.

148
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,240
We...

149
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,070
Why are you here?

150
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,810
This is also my home.

151
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,480
Do I need to report to you where I go?

152
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,920
Yue.

153
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,720
You look beautiful today.

154
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,950
This dress looks especially nice.

155
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,520
Today is our engagement day.

156
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,560
I ordered this dress a long time ago.

157
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,460
It won't disgrace your house.

158
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,480
Let's go.

159
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,480
You...

160
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,520
That's enough.

161
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,920
Do you think by dirtying Yue's dress,

162
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,000
we won't be able to get engaged?

163
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,160
I didn't do it on purpose.

164
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,520
This wine seems to be expired.

165
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,520
Smell it.

166
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,360
Childish.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
Forget it. There's no time
to wash the dress now.

168
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,200
I have another dress ready
at the tailor shop.

169
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,510
Let's go get it.

170
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,600
It won't delay the engagement.

171
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,640
I'll go with you.

172
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,320
Mr. Jiahao,

I'll go get it myself.

177
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,880
I'll be back soon.

This isn't the way to the tailor shop.
