14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,240
Mr. Liang.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,120
You didn't die

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,440
for betraying the Hong Gang.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,320
That's something.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,520
Why don't you

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,800
work for me at my mansion?

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,720
I'm Miss Ouyang's bodyguard.

21
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,720
I only protect Miss Ouyang.

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,770
You're quite heavy-handed, Mr. Liang.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
But you're very gentle with Miss Ouyang.

24
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,880
Though you're unhappy about it,

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,300
you don't dare to say a harsh word.

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,120
Who do you think you are

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,600
to say such things?

28
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,480
Mr. Liang is broad-minded

29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,480
to give you a job in the Governor's Mansion.

30
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,840
Don't be ungrateful.

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,880
Lieutenant Li,

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,440
don't hurt him.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,040
Even if he's a dog,

34
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,880
he's a dog that saved Yue.

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Rest assured, Mr. Liang.

36
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,480
Your house rules are courteous.

37
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,910
I will thank him properly.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
Stop.

39
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,470
Jiahao,

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,120
I have something to tell you.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,120
Jiahao.

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
Jiahao.

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,560
Don't be angry.

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,720
I know I shouldn't have
brought a stranger back.

45
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,840
But I have my own plans.

46
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,350
Don't be angry.

47
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,720
Yue, I'm worried about you.

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,320
You've been back for a short time
and don't know how evil people can be.

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,440
Qin Jifeng has been through
life-and-death situations.

50
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,320
He has a very deep mind

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,960
and an aggressive manner.

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,640
He's definitely not a reliable person.

53
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,640
I know.

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,360
I don't completely trust him either.

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,440
But he is a useful person.

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,360
To deal with my uncle
and take back the company,

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,800
I need someone like him by my side.

58
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,400
I can also help you.

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,440
All my troops can help you.

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,000
I know, Jiahao.

61
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,440
Whenever I'm in danger,
you'll always be there.

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,800
But you have to trust me.

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,320
I want to take back the company legally

64
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,240
and make a name in Hongcheng.

65
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,040
Of course, I trust you.

66
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,200
As long as you need me,

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,800
I will be there.

68
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,800
Good morning, Miss Ouyang.

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
Why are you here?

70
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,360
I'm your bodyguard.

71
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,600
Starting today,

72
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,320
I'll wait for you here every morning.

73
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,560
Mr. Qin,

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,920
can you not follow me so closely?

75
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Keep a safe distance.

76
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,040
More than five steps away.

77
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,920
My safe distance

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
is this close.

79
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,600
Huan'er, bring me a coat.

80
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,720
Butler Liu dismissed all the servants
this morning.

81
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,160
Now, I'm the only one here.

82
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,120
Here's your coat.

83
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,440
I can't believe you're so considerate.

84
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,800
Let's go, Huan'er.

85
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
Be quick and efficient.

86
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,160
- Clear all these dead plants for me.
- Yes.

87
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,520
We can't afford to keep
these flowers and plants now.

88
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,400
Stop.

89
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,400
Butler Liu.

90
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,560
This greenhouse was a gift from my father.

91
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,040
Whether to clear it or not

92
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,920
is not for you to decide.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,840
Miss Ouyang,

94
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,210
you can't blame me for this.

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Your father has passed away.

96
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,800
We have to be frugal in everything.

97
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,680
I'm doing this for your good.

98
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,840
Why don't you dismiss yourself too?

99
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,360
I came to the house at a young age.

100
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Your father hired me.

101
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,080
Miss Ouyang, you probably don't
have the authority to dismiss me.

102
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,160
Butler Liu.

103
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, you...

104
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,360
Miss Ouyang is still standing.

105
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,200
How can you sit down?

106
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,280
What are you going to do?

107
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
Mr. Qin.

108
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,400
Aren't you going to teach me shooting today?

109
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,760
Why not do it now?

110
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,620
As you command,

111
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Miss Ouyang.

112
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,240
I'm telling you.

113
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,440
Don't do anything stupid.

114
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,970
You can't act recklessly.

115
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,800
- Miss Ouyang.
- Don't do this.

116
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,640
Do you want to give it a try?

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,840
It's scary.

118
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,200
Alright, why not?

119
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
Miss Ouyang.

120
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,720
Miss Ouyang.

121
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,850
Spare me, Miss Ouyang.

122
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,600
Miss Ouyang, I was wrong.

123
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,080
Spare me.

124
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,360
Please spare me, Miss Ouyang.

125
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,480
Grip tightly with both hands.

126
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,560
- Feet wider than shoulder-width apart.
- I dare not, Miss Ouyang.

127
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,400
Slightly bend your elbows and knees, and aim.

128
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,400
Spare me.

129
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,320
Shoot.

130
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,760
Yue, good marksmanship.

131
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,320
Jiahao?

132
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
Don't you have military duties today?

133
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,200
Why are you here?

134
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,400
I postponed my duties

135
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,360
to take you out for a walk.

136
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,160
The car is waiting outside.

137
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,600
It's a private date.

138
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,320
You don't need to follow.

139
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,120
Having an outsider around
is always inconvenient.

140
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,120
I had a great time today.

141
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you for accompanying me.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,320
But the company...

143
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,000
I know.

144
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,160
You have your own plans.

145
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,960
I won't act recklessly.

146
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,200
Thank you.

147
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,440
Luckily, you are here.

148
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,520
Rest early.

149
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,560
I'll head back first.

150
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,400
Okay.

151
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,200
- Drive safe.
- Rest early.

152
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,910
Qin Jifeng.

153
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,890
What are you doing?

154
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,220
I saw that the flowers in that corner
were still alive today.

155
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,760
So I moved them out,

156
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,000
watered them,

157
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,110
and let them bask in the sun.

158
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,680
My dad said

159
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,950
a daughter is a rose planted
by her father in a previous life.

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,320
Now that he's gone,

161
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,320
these flowers can't be saved either.

162
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,730
Then I'll save them for you.

163
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,200
Flowers will bloom again after they wither.

164
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,080
Your father once said

165
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,520
that as long as there is hope,

166
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,920
we should persevere.

167
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,600
Everything will get better.

168
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,440
As long as there is hope,
we should persevere.

169
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,440
I've always forgotten to ask you.

170
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,960
Were you that little beggar back then?

171
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,840
You filthy little beggar.

172
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,960
- How dare you steal at such a young age?
- That year,

173
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,080
- I'll beat you.
- I was eight years old.

174
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,920
Let go.

175
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,160
Mr. Ouyang.

176
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,720
Boy, are you okay?

177
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,520
If not desperate,

178
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,560
who would want to be a thief?

179
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,400
Yes.

180
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,480
Everyone faces difficulties.

181
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,120
As long as there is hope,

182
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,520
we must persevere.

183
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,120
- Everything will get better.
- Miss Ouyang.

184
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,240
Dad.

185
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,120
Yue.

186
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,160
Big brother, are you hungry?

187
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,320
Here, eat this.

188
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,460
Eat if you're hungry, boy.

189
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,960
Mr. Ouyang, I'm sorry.

190
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,320
Here's your pocket watch.

191
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,680
You can keep

192
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,820
this pocket watch.

193
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,300
If you have any difficulties in the future,

194
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,460
come to me at Fortune Trading Company.

195
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,790
Thank you, Mr. Ouyang.

196
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,640
So later,

197
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,400
why didn't you come to my dad?

198
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,440
And why did you join my uncle's Hong Gang?

199
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,810
I have

200
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,640
never gone to school

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,240
and I have no skills.

202
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,480
All I have left are my fists and feet.

203
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,410
Except for the Hong Gang,
where else could I go?

204
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,520
It's not too late now.

205
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,120
As long as there is hope,

206
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,000
everything will get better.

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,920
Isn't that right?

208
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,240
Mr. Liang,

209
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,520
I can deliver

210
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,160
Miss Ouyang's bag tomorrow.

211
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,320
Why do you have to come personally?

212
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,790
It's okay. I'll deliver it.

213
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,110
Wait here for me.

214
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes.

215
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,820
Regarding your dad's death,

216
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,560
I will definitely help you to the end.

217
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,640
Yue, your bag.

218
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,700
Miss Ouyang is asleep.

219
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,930
Don't wake her up.
