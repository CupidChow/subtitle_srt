How dare you come back?

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,320
Didn't I tell you already

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm Miss Ouyang's bodyguard?

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,960
I only take orders from her.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,320
Jiahao, he...

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,160
Mr. Liang.

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,450
Mr. Liang.

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,160
Your parents have both returned.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,120
Madam said you should go back.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,480
Then you go back first.

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,480
Miss Ouyang,

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,040
you must be hungry after a busy night.

26
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,510
This is the most famous wonton in Hongcheng.

27
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,100
Would you like to sit down and try it?

28
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,540
- Sure.
- Come.

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
Sit.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,230
Alright, sit down.

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,520
Mr. Tang.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,440
Here I am.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,520
Let me. I'll cook

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,840
What are you doing?

35
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,160
When I was little, I had no food or money.

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,120
So I often came here hoping
to eat the leftovers.

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,760
Later, Mr. Tang found me pitiful

38
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,680
and asked me to help him make
and sell wontons,

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,680
and greet the customers.

40
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,760
Mr. Tang, have you been busy lately?

41
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,920
It's alright.

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,890
You two can eat first.

43
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,600
- I'll cook another bowl for you.
- Okay, no problem.

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,440
I can do it myself.

45
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,400
Alright.

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,040
Here you go.

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,200
It's okay. I'll do it.

48
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,100
You've never eaten wontons
in a place like this before, have you?

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,000
Who says I haven't?

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,880
Be careful, it's hot.

51
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,760
This soup is a bit bland.

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,200
Then let me adjust it for you

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,480
with my secret recipe, okay?

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,480
Sure.

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,360
Just a little bit of this.

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,840
Shrimps enhance the flavor.

57
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,280
- Do you eat scallions?
- No, I don't.

58
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,440
Then let's add some coriander.

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,440
Okay.

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,760
Add some vinegar too.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,400
I'll make one for you as well.

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
This.

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,160
Do French people eat such spicy food?

64
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,960
When I was abroad, I found
foreigners loved spicy food.

65
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
They eat spicy food.

66
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,040
Look, I also added this much.

67
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,540
(Governor's Mansion)

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
Go and check with the kitchen.

69
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,230
See if the tonic stew is ready.

70
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,720
Be quick about it.

71
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,080
(Chen Wanhua, the Governor's wife)
The Master will be down for dinner soon.

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
- Understood.
- Understood.

73
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,000
Jiahao.

74
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,170
- Mom.
- You're back.

75
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,840
How does this new cheongsam look?

76
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,680
Is it pretty?

77
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,390
Do you think your father will like it?

78
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,440
By the way,

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,120
how is your marriage with Yue going?

80
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,760
Yesterday, your father said

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,840
we should propose soon and hold a wedding.

82
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,920
I think this will make your father proud.

83
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
Mom,

84
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,640
I don't need to use marriage
to prove myself to Father.

85
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,400
I'm marrying Yue
because I genuinely like her.

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,460
I've liked her since childhood.

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,160
Silly boy, isn't that the same thing?

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,760
I'm doing this for our own good.

89
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,890
What if

90
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,440
we encounter that kind of woman again?

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,400
You know...

92
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,560
What kind of woman?

93
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,800
Master.

94
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,520
Master, you're awake.

95
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,120
Dad.

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,520
I heard that while I was away,

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,880
you spent all your time with Ouyang Yue

98
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,040
and neglected your military duties.

99
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,720
Dad,

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,960
Ouyang Shanhai wants to harm Yue.

101
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,800
Shut up.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,520
Useless thing.

103
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,920
Your mind is filled with nothing but women.

104
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,560
If you weren't my only son,

105
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,920
I would have strangled you long ago.

106
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,300
Starting tomorrow,

107
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,560
you must report to the military every day.

108
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,480
Do something worthwhile.

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,440
Yes, Father.

110
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,800
Master, calm down.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,160
Jiahao is still young

112
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,440
and a bit too playful.

113
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,240
Jiahao, quickly apologize to your father.

114
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
And you,

115
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,400
always dressing so flamboyantly.

116
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,920
This is the Governor's Mansion,

117
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,840
not the Paramount.

118
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,640
Don't mention that woman again.

119
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,760
Master, I also made some tonic.

120
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,480
Why not have some first?

121
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,380
Give it to him.

122
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,560
Let him nourish his brain well.

123
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,880
Miss Ouyang,

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,080
are you satisfied with the greenhouse
I arranged for you?

125
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,360
My bodyguard is not only good
at making wontons,

126
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,000
but also quite skilled as a gardener.

127
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,660
I think this greenhouse

128
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,480
will be restored to its original state soon.

129
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,040
Miss Ouyang, you are indeed clever.

130
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,840
Newly bought flowers are always faster
than replanting.

131
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,760
Qin Jifeng, you...

132
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,960
Qin Jifeng,

133
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,080
do you often bandage others?

134
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,400
First time. Dare you?

135
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,280
You know how to remove bullets?

136
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,640
First time.

137
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,600
Dare you?

138
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,290
Lieutenant Li,

139
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,040
what's the matter?

140
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,800
Miss Ouyang, Mr. Liang is here.

141
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,220
He is waiting for you in the dining room.

142
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,120
I see. I'll be right there.

143
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:11,810
Report.

144
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,210
Yue,

145
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,220
these are all dishes you used to like.

146
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,220
I also had a bottle of red wine brought here

147
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,600
from the winery.

148
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,560
Eat more.

149
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,040
A lot has happened recently.

150
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,320
You've lost quite a bit of weight.

151
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,120
What are you doing?

152
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,940
Miss Ouyang was drugged before.

153
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,160
I need to check it.

154
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,480
Do you mean

155
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,680
I would harm Yue?

156
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,310
Jiahao,

157
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,680
Qin Jifeng is doing it for my sake.

158
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,000
Would he do it for your sake?

159
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
Yue,

160
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,920
I don't want to spoil your mood,

161
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,080
but since someone

162
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,600
is eager to perform,

163
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,600
I must set up the stage for him.

164
