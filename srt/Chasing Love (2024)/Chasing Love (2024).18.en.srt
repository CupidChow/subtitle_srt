14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,600
Jiahao.

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,360
Mom.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,680
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,040
Close the door.

18
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,480
Come here.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,520
Jiahao.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,440
There's something

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,520
I should have told you long ago.

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,200
Do you know how Qin Jifeng's mother died?

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,960
She was killed by your father

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
with his own hands.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,440
Back then,

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,800
what exactly happened?

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,000
Fifteen years ago,

28
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,240
my mom discovered
that Liang Zongyue was smuggling arms

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
and tried to report him.

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,060
Later, Liang Zongyue found it out.

31
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,070
My mom had to take me away.

32
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,660
Life afterwards was extremely destitute.

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,600
I remember one day,

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,840
my mom fell seriously ill.

35
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,280
We had no money for treatment.

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,840
I had to go out and steal things
in exchange for money

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,730
to buy her medicine.

38
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,860
Later, I was caught.

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,280
I met Master Ouyang,

40
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,760
and you.

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,600
Yue.

42
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,520
It's true I want to repay your favor.

43
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,680
I didn't lie to you.

44
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,200
Then what happened next?

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,320
Later, I took the medicine home.

46
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
I thought my mom would be fine.

47
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,520
But I never expected

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,120
that I would see Liang Zongyue
killing my mom.

49
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,940
(Qin Baoyu, Qin Jifeng's mother) Shoot.

50
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,100
(Liang Zongyue, Officer in Hongcheng)

51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,240
Baoyu,

52
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,380
as long as you hand over the evidence
of arms smuggling to me,

53
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,040
we can take the child and go home together.

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,640
I can pretend nothing ever happened.

55
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,640
I will not go with you.

56
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,520
Jifeng does not have a father like you.

57
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,080
But we are husband and wife!

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,640
I love you so much.

59
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,440
Why?

60
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,200
Why do you do this to me?

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,280
My husband

62
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,240
should be a man of integrity

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,320
and a soldier who protects the people.

64
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,240
He should never be a despicable traitor

65
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,120
who harms the country for power.

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,320
Stop this, Zongyue.

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,280
Your hands

68
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,210
are stained with the blood of innocent lives.

69
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,160
Baoyu.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,840
Baoyu.

71
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,800
Mom.

72
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,360
Mom.

73
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,680
Live on.

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,560
Mom.

75
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,640
Do not hate your dad.

76
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,760
Mom.

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Mom.

78
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,230
Mom.

79
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,700
Mom.

80
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,120
It's okay.

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,000
It's all over.

82
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm related to Liang Zongyue by blood,

83
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,280
but I've never considered him my father.

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,080
I tried every possible way to get close to him

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,560
and gain his trust

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,830
only to expose his true face,

87
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,530
destroy the arms,

88
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,730
and avenge my mom

89
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,960
and the innocent souls who died
due to the arms.

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,870
Yue,

91
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,120
I shouldn't have lied to you,

93
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,040
nor should I have kept it from you.

94
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,360
And I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

95
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,960
Since you and I have the same goal,

96
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,600
why did you stop me from taking the contract?

97
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,000
Why did you stop me
from exposing his true face?

98
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,070
Because the evidence we have now

99
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,690
is not enough to threaten him.

100
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Even if we take down Liang Zongyue,

101
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,330
there will be countless warlords like him

102
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,990
who put the people in misery

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,960
and continue their unlawful acts.

104
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,680
Yue,

105
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,040
what we need to destroy

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,040
is the entire arms smuggling network
in Hongcheng.

107
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,400
Although our strength is small,

108
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,600
we can bring light to more people,

109
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,880
and encourage them to fight for the light.

110
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,480
Qin Jifeng,

111
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,000
is what you said true?

112
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,680
Yue,

113
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,360
trust me one last time,

114
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,200
okay?

115
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,280
I will trust you one last time.

116
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,200
I hope you won't disappoint me again.

117
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,800
But Jiahao...

118
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,360
He's innocent.

119
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Your father

120
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,080
didn't want me to tell you about this,

121
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,600
but your half-brother

122
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,160
has already threatened your position.

123
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,280
I cannot sit idly by.

124
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,150
If he knows about the blood feud on him,

125
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,560
will he do nothing?

126
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,310
Mom,

127
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,880
if you still want peaceful days at home,

128
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,400
then do nothing.

129
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,040
Jiahao,

130
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,080
what are you talking about?

131
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,680
I'm doing this for your good.

132
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,370
Do you want to watch your father

133
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,200
hand over his power to him?

134
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,600
Mom,

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,040
the power of the Governor

136
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,600
is not important to me.

137
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,080
I just want Yue to be safe and sound.

138
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,650
By the way,

139
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,300
I found an apartment outside.

140
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
After getting married,

141
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,560
I will move out with Yue.

142
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,600
Why is your mind filled with romance?

143
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,360
If I can't even protect the girl I love,

144
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,250
all of this is meaningless to me.

145
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,710
Jiahao,

146
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,360
you're the only relative

147
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,090
I have in this world.

148
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,110
I know you like Yue.

149
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,160
I'll definitely

150
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,360
fulfill your wish to be with Yue.
