Chen Qi,

I'll leave the arsenal to you.

69
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,040
I still have other matters to attend to.

70
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,430
Alright.

71
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,160

75
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,400

77
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,980
- I beg you to let him go.
- Yue.

78
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,600
Don't beg him.

79
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,760
Today, I'll make sure you die here.

80
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,160
Mr. Jifeng, there's trouble at the warehouse.

81
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,520
The Governor has taken the men there.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
Go to the warehouse.

83
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,560
Take him away for me.

84
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,870
I'll go with him.

85
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,360
Alright.

86
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,920
Take both of them away.

87
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

88
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,600
Go.

89
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,480
Get them out!

90
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,440
Move quickly.

91
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,960
As many as you can.

92
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,920
Don't come in.

93
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,510
It's going to explode inside.

94
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,600
Come here.

95
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,960
Marshal, the fire is too big.

96
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,560
We can only save this much.

97
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,760
No matter how big the fire is,
you go in.

98
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,510
Or I'll shoot you dead.

99
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,200
Marshal,

100
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,320
this place is full of ammunition.

101
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,760
It could explode at any time.

102
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,360
We should leave first.

103
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,800
You get in there now!

104
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,160
Anyone who retreats

105
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,360
will be shot.

106
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,440
Yes.

107
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,040
Quick.

108
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,920
When I find out who set the fire,

109
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,300
I'll skin him alive.

110
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,520
Dad,

111
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,760
it's okay. I brought the man here.

112
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,760
Qin Jifeng was investigating the arsenal

113
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,240
and tried to destroy it

114
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,690
and you too.

115
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,960
Didn't you come back to me

116
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
for wealth and honor?

117
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,640
Wealth and honor?

118
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,760
Obtained at the expense of innocent lives?

119
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,840
Don't you find it laughable?

120
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,860
But you are my son!

121
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,600
I never considered you my father.

122
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,600
I have no father.

123
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,160
Liang Zongyue,

124
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,760
You killed my mom with your own hands,

125
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,000
smuggled arms,

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,920
incited riots and harmed civilians.

127
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,160
Do you think I would collude with you?

128
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,640
Even if your blood runs through my veins,

129
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,640
I am not like you.

130
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,040
Fine.

131
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,440
- Very well.
- Liang Zongyue!

132
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,920
You never lost your memory.

133
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,560
You killed my father.

134
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,870
I can never forgive you.

135
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,840
You should have behaved

136
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,600
and handed over the company to me.

137
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,960
Even if you faked the amnesia,

138
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,120
for the sake of your relationship with Jiahao,

139
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,920
I could have spared you.

140
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,760
But you are just like your father,

141
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,040
headstrong.

142
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,030
Dad.

143
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,910
Take him away.

144
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,920
- Dad, Dad!
- Let's go, Mr. Jiahao.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
Don't kill Yue.

146
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,800
- It was you all...
- Dad.

147
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
who forced me.

148
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,000
