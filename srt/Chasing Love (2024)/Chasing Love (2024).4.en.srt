14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,280
Good morning, Miss Ouyang.

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,120
Good morning.

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,730
There's a meeting at the company today.

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,580
I need to go out.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,320
Alright, the car is ready.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,520
Thank you.

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,220
Jiahao?

21
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,070
Yue.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,920
My informant at the company

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,190
said Ouyang Shanhai has been in contact
with several board members.

24
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,050
There might be some action.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,320
How about

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,800
we arrest all those old men at the company?

27
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,960
The board members are all my uncles.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,920
We can't act recklessly.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,790
If I don't get evidence of my uncle's
harmful actions against the company,

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,520
they won't trust me to take over the company.

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,800
Miss Ouyang,

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,760
I know Ouyang Shanhai has a ledger.

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,440
It records the secret accounts
of his smuggling business.

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,000
Maybe we can get close to someone
around Ouyang Shanhai

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,000
and obtain the ledger.

36
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,000
Really?

37
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,960
Ouyang Shanhai has a mistress.

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,400
She's the top performer
at the Paramount Ballroom.

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,320
Her stage name is Red Peony.

40
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,920
But

41
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,650
it's not easy to get close to her.

42
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,840
I know how to approach Red Peony.

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,120
Tonight, I'll go to the Paramount.

44
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,210
- I'll go...
- I'll go with you.

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,680
A place like the Paramount

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,360
is full of mixed crowds.

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,760
It's better if I go with you.

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,440
I'll feel more at ease.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Boss,

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,160
I got what you asked for.

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,710
Red Peony's indenture.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,200
Find an opportunity

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
to distract Liang Jiahao.

54
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,800
Our plan must be foolproof.

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,040
Yes.

56
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,280
Go ahead.

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,320
Jiahao, let's go.

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,600
Why is it you?

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,520
Just now, Lieutenant Li reported

60
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,840
that the dock workers are rioting.

61
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,600
Mr. Liang has rushed over.

62
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,320
What a coincidence.

63
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,180
You're going to the Paramount.

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,730
Let me go with you instead.

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,360
Alright.

66
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,160
Please wait a moment.

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,040
The ball at the Paramount is
on the fifth of every month.

68
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,240
This is our best chance to get close to her.

72

will get to drink with me.

73
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,170
Alright.

74
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,120
How about it, Bodyguard Qin?

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,480

is with you, isn't she?

154
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,720
Paramount is full of Master Shanhai's people.

155
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,960
With one word, I can have her tied up.

156
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,360
Then we'll see if you talk.

157
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,280
I'm with Master Shanhai.

158
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,200
How dare you hurt me?

159
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,960
I don't want to hurt you.

160
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,900
