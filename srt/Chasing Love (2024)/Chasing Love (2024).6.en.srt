00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,400
Miss Ouyang.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,760
(Ledger) I got evidence from Red Peony.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,080
But...

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,960
What?

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,000
It seems Ouyang Shanhai
is about to take action.

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,400
He is now rushing to the company
to hold a board meeting.

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,840
He might take over the company ahead of time.

21
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,990
I'm waiting for you at the Moonlight Hotel.

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,440
You must come.

23
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,640
Ouyang Shanhai is not yet qualified
to take over the company.

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
Yue.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
What are you doing here?

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,900
Mr. Zheng, Mr. Li,

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,950
you're all senior members of the company.

28
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
And you watched me grow up.

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,000
I beg you to support me.

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,920
Yue, what...

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,240
Zhang, quickly help her up.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,040
Yue, what are you doing?

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,680
Get up quickly.

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,960
How did you get hurt?

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,520
To seize the company,

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,080
my uncle shot at me at the mourning hall.

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,000
Later

38
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,760
at the Paramount,

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,760
he asked a man to disgrace me.

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
I was almost...

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,720
Ouyang Yue!

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,660
She is your niece.

43
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,880
How could you do it?

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,120
She is making things up.

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Which respectable girl
would make up such things?

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,120
Uncle,

47
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,680
if you truly care about the company,

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,040
I will not compete with you.

49
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,760
But you are using the company for smuggling

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,920
to line your own pockets.

51
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,170
For the sake of my father

52
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,080
and all the board members,

53
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,280
I cannot stand by and do nothing.

54
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,920
Every penny Ouyang Shanhai embezzled

55
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,840
is recorded in this ledger.

56
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,000
You can all check it one by one.

57
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,520
It has his seal on it.

58
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,790
It can't be faked.

59
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,300

This ledger is real.

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,600
Don't move.

63
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,560
Uncle,

64
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,970
at this point,

65
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,640
do you want to silence everyone?

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,260
Ouyang Shanhai,

67
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,410
we know you are the leader of the Hong Gang,

68
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,240
but there's no place for you

69
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,480
to act tough here.

70
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,050
Security,

71
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,600
throw Ouyang Shanhai out of the company.

72
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,440
Wait a minute.

73
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,620
I'll leave on my own.

74
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,320
Gentlemen,

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,200
when my father was alive, he often said

76
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,220
that Fortune Trading Company

77
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,920
does not profit from national crises,

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,760
nor does it engage in unscrupulous business.

79
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,240
We must be honest
and have a clear conscience.

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,560
I hope to inherit my father's will

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
and manage the company with integrity.

82
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,710
Miss Ouyang, please take over the company.

83
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,300
Miss Ouyang, please take over the company.

Sooner or later, I will make each one of you

die a horrible death.

104
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,000
you're well informed.

105
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,520
I was just kicked out of the company

106
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
and you've graced me with your presence.

107
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,640
Are you here to get rid of me?

108
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,640
I don't think you would kill me.

109
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,200
My brother has written a letter to you.

110
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,080
If anything happens to me...

111
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,240
You wouldn't want to get into trouble, right?

114

We are in the same boat.

115
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,880
Soon,

116
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,100
I'll make Ouyang Yue disappear
from Hongcheng.

117
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,080
Miss Ouyang, it's so late.

118
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,960
What are we doing here?

119
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,560
I have an appointment with Jiahao.

120
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,460
You can wait here.

121
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,360
I'll go in by myself.

122
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,840
Alright.

123
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,840
Jiahao.

124
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,760
Yue, you finally came.

125
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,960
Sorry, I'm late.

126
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,240
It's okay.

127
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,680
It's good that you're here.

128
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,760
I prepared...

129
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
Jiahao,

130
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,360
today my uncle suddenly convened
a board meeting.

131
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,960
He wanted to inherit the company.

132
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,960
I didn't have time to inform you.

133
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,680
So I rushed over with his ledger
of smuggling arms.

134
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,140
I drove him out of the company.

135
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,680
You went to the company

136
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,440
and drove out Ouyang Shanhai?

137
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,060
Do you know how dangerous that was?

138
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,320
You should have told me.

139
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,520
Then I could bring men to go with you.

140
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,520
Together, we could deal with that old guy.

141
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,280
Jiahao, to take back the company,

142
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,840
I can only rely on myself.

143
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,630
I understand.

144
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,440
Jiahao, I know you're worried about me.

145
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,080
- But to take back the company...
- I understand.

146
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,360
Yue,

147
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,080
you're a capable person.

148
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,920
You don't need my help.

149
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,330
That's not what I meant. I...

150
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,480
It's getting late.

151
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,960
Let me take you back.

152
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,550
What are you doing here?

153
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,820
Jiahao, he went to the company with me today.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,840
He helped me...

155
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,160
Didn't I tell you I don't want
to see you again?

156
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,930
How dare you come back?

157
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,120
Didn't I tell you already

158
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,920
I'm Miss Ouyang's bodyguard?

159
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,800
I only take orders from her.

160
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,480
Jiahao...
