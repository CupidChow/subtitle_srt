=Episode 11=

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,800
Jiahao,

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,320
what are you doing here?

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,360
How can you come to my office
without permission?

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,180
(...storage and sale of arms...)

18
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,560
Dad,

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,680
was Yue's father

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,040
really killed by Ouyang Shanhai?

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,440
Is this something you should ask about?

22
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,000
What exactly is in this letter?

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,120
Why did you go to such great lengths to

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,520
find the letter at Ouyang Shanhai's place?

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,560
And why did you burn it?

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,600
You imbecile.

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,480
How dare you interrogate me?

28
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,000
Dad,

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,120
Ouyang Shanhai didn't kill Yue's father.

30
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,960
It was you.

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,600
It was me.

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,640
What will you do?

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,840
It was unwise of him

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,160
to sabotage my business.

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,240
Anyone who stands in my way

36
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,360
must die.

37
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,680
But he was Yue's biological father.

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,200
How will I face Yue in the future?

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yue.

40
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,750
Yue, Yue!

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,480
Since childhood, you've followed her
like a dog.

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,520
How could I

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,240
have such a useless son like you?

44
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,960
Liang Jiahao, listen to me carefully.

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,320
Marry her quickly.

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,110
I want the shipping rights
of Fortune Trading Company.

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,120
If she is as stupid as her father,

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,680
I will make her disappear.

49
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,200
Yue, when did you come?

50
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,920
Yue.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440
Where are you going, Yue?

52
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,590
Yue.

53
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,600
Dad!

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,680
Yue.

55
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,960
Mom,

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,200
please tell me what I should do.

57
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,840
Yue, what's wrong?

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,720
Liang Zongyue killed my father.

59
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,400
He and Ouyang Shanhai are
smuggling arms together.

60
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,160
Qin Jifeng,

61
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,640
help me get revenge.

62
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,090
Yue,

63
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,280
why did you come here?

64
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,550
You killed my father.

65
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,720
I want you to pay with your life.

66
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Yue, don't be impulsive.

67
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,400
Just you?

68
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,710
Jifeng,

69
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,950
your show

70
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,280
should be over by now, right?

71
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,730
Dad.

72
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,920
You...

73
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,200
- You're...
- That's right.

74
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,160
I'm your son.

75
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,160
Then where is your mother?

76
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,420
I got separated

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,440
from my mother many years ago.

78
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,300
Separated?

79
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,800
So you never saw her again?

80
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,630
No news at all.

81
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
So you went through all this trouble

82
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,960
just to get close to me

83
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,400
and reunite with me?

84
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,400
As I said,

85
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,440
I just want to reclaim
what is rightfully mine.

86
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,560
It's not that easy to be my son.

87
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,990
I can share your burdens.

88
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,560
Let's hear it.

89
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,230
What you want is nothing
but Fortune Trading Company.

90
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,880
So you want Liang Jiahao
to marry Miss Ouyang.

91
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Now that Mr. Ouyang is dead,

92
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,520
Miss Ouyang is your prospective
daughter-in-law.

93
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,890
It seems like a sure thing.

94
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,480
But...

95
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,880
What?

96
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,280
It's uncertain if your obedient son

97
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,840
has the ability to marry Miss Ouyang.

98
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,800
There's also Ouyang Shanhai,

99
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,520
who is uncontrollable

100
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,720
and often tries to overstep his bounds.

101
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,360
If I can help you get rid of Ouyang Shanhai,

102
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,320
gain Miss Ouyang's trust,

103
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,440
and ensure the control
of Fortune Trading Company

104
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,480
never slips away,

105
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,720
do you think I qualify to be your son?

106
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,240
Alright, Jifeng,

107
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,560
then I'll wait and see.

108
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,400
I will prove to you, Father,

109
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,080
that I

110
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,320
am the legitimate son of the Governor.

111
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,560
I will kill you!

112
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,510
If you dare to hurt her,

113
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,600
I will take your life.

114
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,470
Liang Jiahao,

115
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,360
get out of here.

116
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,600
Whoever dares to hurt Yue,

117
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,700
I will kill them.

118
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,580
Yue.

119
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,320
Yue.

120
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,400
Yue. Yue.

121
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,480
Yue.

122
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,140
Today,

123
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,020
I will eradicate the problem completely.

124
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,390
Dad.

125
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,920
Dad.

126
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,870
If you want Yue's life,

127
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,870
then take my life along with it.

128
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,650
Liang Jiahao.

129
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,560
Do you really think I can't bear to kill you?

130
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,520
Get out.

131
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,980
I don't

132
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,090
