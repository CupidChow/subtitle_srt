00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,450
What else can I do in this place?

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,300
Let go of me.

00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,140
You perv!

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,420
Qin Jifeng, help me!

00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,420
Miss Ouyang.

Who are you?

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,990
Spare me, man.

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,740
Sir, sir, sir. I'm sorry.

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,460
It's up to her if you can be spared.

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,060
My job is to take your life.

Are you alright?

00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
I'll take you to the hospital.

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,060

46
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,140
Begin the ceremony.

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,910
(Qin Jifeng,)
Wait.

48
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,320
(discipline enforcer of the Hong Gang)
Wait.

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,860
(Ouyang Yue, Fortune Trading Company)

50
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,020
Miss Ouyang?

51
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,420
What is she doing here?

52
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,580
Master Zhongtian just passed away

53
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,780
in a shipwreck.

54
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,900
She must have returned to seize the company.

55

Master Shanhai is the boss of the Hong Gang.

56
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,780
Yet she comes alone.

57
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,420
I think she has a death wish.

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,060
(Ouyang Yue, you finally came.)

59
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,460
(My dear father Ouyang Zhongtian)

60
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,620
Dad,

61
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,580
your daughter has returned late.

62
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,500
I'm the daughter of the Ouyang family

63
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,140
and the sole heir of Fortune Trading Company.

64
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,500
I'll organize

65
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,340
my father's funeral.

66
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,660
Miss Ouyang.

67
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,900
Before your father passed away,

68
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,460
he entrusted the company to your uncle.

69
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,420
Butler Liu,

70
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,540
do you have any proof of that?

71
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,580
Proof?

72
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,980
Do you think

73
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,380
I became the boss of the Hong Gang

74
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,020
by winning people over with virtue?

75
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,900
(The old man shows his true colors.)

76
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,220
Get her!

77
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,220
Don't come closer!

78
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,460
Chen Qi.

79
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,460
Shoot here in a moment.

80
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,220
Go ahead.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,440
(Chen Qi, Qin Jifeng's subordinate)
Miss Ouyang, do you know how to fire a gun?

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,780
(Chen Qi, Qin Jifeng's subordinate)
Be careful. Don't shoot yourself.

83
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,220
If you have the guts, shoot!

84
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,780
Kill her!

85
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,500
Don't come closer!

86
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,580
Traitor!

87
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,140
Kill them all together!

88
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,580
Get them!

89
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,620
Stop!

90
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,460
Quick, go after them!

91
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,380
Hurry!

92
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,940

93
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,700
Who are you?

94
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,380
Why did you save me?

95
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,300
Miss Ouyang,

96
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,420
are you going to repay kindness with enmity?

97
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,100
Shoot!

98
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,780
Do I have to teach you?

99
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,060
Next time you shoot, remember

100
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,280
to check if there are bullets inside.

101
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
What's wrong with you?

102
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,100
What?

103
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,060
Are you really afraid that I'll hurt you?

104
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,180
If you're not afraid,

105
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,100
why should I be?

106
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,860
Sit still.

107
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,460
I'll remove the bullet for you.

109
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,420
First time.

110
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,260

Not at all.

132
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,940
To repay a favor.

133
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,580
