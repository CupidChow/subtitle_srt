14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,920
I need to set up this stage for him.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,760
Bring him up.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,040
Lieutenant Li.

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,760
He's your man, right?

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,480
We found these at his place.

19
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,420
(Personal File Registration Form)

20
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,350
Explain this.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,240
You sent the telegram to call Yue back.

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,440
You also secretly instructed Chen Qi

23
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,160
to follow and investigate Yue.

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,640
What exactly are you planning?

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Qin Jifeng, you...

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,120
Don't wanna speak?

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,120
Looks like you don't recognize him.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,840
Fine.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,000
- Lieutenant Li.
- Yes.

30
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,640
Let him go.

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,480
Chen Qi is a member of the Hong Gang.

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,160
It's not your place

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,080
to kill him.

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,880
No problem.

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,360
You don't need to explain to me.

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,800
But you must give Yue an explanation.

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
Yue,

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,960
in my opinion,

39
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,000
he is just like Ouyang Shanhai.

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,520
Both are after Fortune Trading Company.

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,440
Qin Jifeng,

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,360
do you have anything to say to me?

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,640
I'm sorry,

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,320
Miss Ouyang.

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,720
Do you really think he would harm you?

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,080
- He wants to protect you.
- Chen Qi.

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,480
Nonsense.

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,400
How dare you act in front of me?
Are you trying to get killed?

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,160
Yue.

50
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,320
Dad.

51
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,900
Why are you here?

52
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,210
Mr. Liang.

53
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,630
Yue.

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,920
I've heard about your father's tragedy.

55
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,700
You must take care of yourself.

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,890
As long as I'm here,

57
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,780
no matter what happens,

58
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,820
you can always come to me.

59
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,350
Yue,

60
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,140
Mr. Liang and I came today

61
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,220
to see how you're holding up,

62
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,540
and by the way,

63
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,700
discuss your marriage with Jiahao.

64
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,180
Mom,

65
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,780
Yue is still in mourning.

66
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,780
There's no rush for our wedding.

67
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,420
Silly boy, what are you saying?

68
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,790
When it comes to the wedding date,

69
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,340
the sooner, the better.

70
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,880
Master, what do you think?

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,260
There's no rush.

72
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,620
Once everything is settled,

73
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,020
we can discuss the wedding.

74
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,860
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

75
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,780
Who is this?

76
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,820
Dad,

77
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,180
he's from the Hong Gang.

78
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,790
He was lurking around Yue
with ill intentions.

79
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,320
I was just about to get rid of him.

80
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,360
Take him away and execute him.

81
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,820
Wait a moment.

82
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,180
He's my bodyguard.

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,890
Please spare his life.

84
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,780
Jiahao,

85
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,380
listen to Yue.

86
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,700
Jiahao.

87
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,020
Throw him out.

88
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,860
Keep him away from the Ouyang Mansion.

89
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,740
Chen Qi.

90
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,420
Boss, I'm sorry.

91
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,260
It's okay.

92
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,710
Take a look. Fresh fruits.

93
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,190
Fresh vegetables.

94
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,640
Come and take a look.

95
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,640
Fresh.

96
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,860
Miss, would you like some flowers?

97
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,990
Come, take a look.

98
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,060
Please have a look.

99
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,260
We have lilies here.

100
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,340
I think lilies suit you very well.

101
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,260
Take a look.

102
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,170
Mr. Qin,

103
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,510
my master wants to see you.

104
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,360
Master, Qin Jifeng is here.

105
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,780
Come in.

106
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,380
Qin Jifeng,

107
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,700
you've plotted such a grand scheme.

108
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,570
It can't be just to get close to Yue, right?

109
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,740
What exactly do you want?

110
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,420
I don't want anything.

111
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,220
I just want to take back
what is rightfully mine.

112
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,120
Rightfully yours?

113
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,390
That's quite a claim.

114
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,380
What makes you think you can do it?

115
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,620
This.

116
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,600
You are...

117
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,020
Yue.

118
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,940
Jiahao.

119
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,860
These are the most precious roses
in the city.

120
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,010
I got them for you.

121
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,500
Thank you.

122
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,780
What's wrong?

123
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,820
Is it still about the Hong Gang?

124
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,260
Stay away from those people in the future.

125
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,700
They all have ulterior motives.

126
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,220
Don't worry about your uncle.

127
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,040
I've had men watching him all the time.

128
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,140
Look at these roses.

129
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,980
Young Master,

130
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,340
your father has a message for you.

131
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,440
He needs you back at the mansion.

132
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,860
Now?

133
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,180
I'll be right back.

134
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,840
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

135
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,380
You're back so...

136
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,320
Boss.

137
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,500
Why are we coming to see Miss...

138
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,860
Yue!

139
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,740
It's Ouyang Shanhai's car. Chen Qi.

140
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,540
Gather the men and meet me at the gang hall.

141
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,420
- Hurry.
- Yes.

142
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,180
Sit down.

143
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,660
Uncle.

144
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,780
What does this mean?

145
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,660
In broad daylight,

146
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,020
you kidnapped your niece.

147
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,980
You're just like your headstrong father.

148
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,500
You kicked me out of the family

149
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,740
and expelled me from the company.

150
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,580
I am cornered.

151
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,790
So,

152
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,020
it was really you who killed my father.

153
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,690
Why?

154
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,360
He was your big brother.

155
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,630
Big brother?

156
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,540
When did he ever treat me like a brother?

157
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,380
In his eyes,

158
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,190
I was just a useless piece of junk,

159
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,620
a rogue who disgraced the family.

160
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,580
With him in the way,

161
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,740
when would it ever be my time to shine?

162
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,220
So you killed him.

163
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,820
Now you want to kill me too.

164
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,680
Before you die, you have to do me
a small favor.

165
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,220
Dream on.
