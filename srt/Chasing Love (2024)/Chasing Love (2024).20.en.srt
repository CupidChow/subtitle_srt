14
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,600
Let's

15
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,680
leave together.

16
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,280
Sleep well.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,800
By the way, Miss Ouyang,

18
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,920
are you satisfied with the photos
we developed last time?

19
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,440
Last time?

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,200
Sir,

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,160
you must have mistaken me for someone else.

22
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,040
It's the first time I've seen you.

23
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,240
That's impossible.

24
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,470
Yue wouldn't lie to me.

25
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,930
Impossible.

26
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,040
Impossible.

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,230
Jiahao.

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,800
Yue, you're awake.

29
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,120
Why are you here?

30
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,160
Where's Mrs. Liang?

31
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,240
Mom said

32
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,480
you were drunk

33
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
and asked me to take care of you.

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,440
I...

35
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,120
When Mom left,

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,960
she locked the door.

37
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,480
I probably can't get out.

38
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,440
Well...

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,840
Don't worry.

40
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,600
I'm

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
agile.

42
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,200
I'll climb out the window later.

43
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,570
You

44
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,600
just sleep here tonight.

45
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,320
I have a lot of business documents to review.

46
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,240
I'll go organize the documents.

47
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,040
You've drunk a lot.

48
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Rest well.

49
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,760
I'll organize the documents.

50
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,600
Jiahao.

51
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,780
What's up?

52
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,320
Don't stay up too late.

53
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,640
Get some rest early.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,840
Got it.

55
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
It's about time for them to wake up.

56
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,720
Xiaoting,

57
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,760
go wait at Miss Ouyang's door.

58
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,990
Jiahao is inside.

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,610
See if they need anything.

60
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,760
Yes.

61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,520
Mrs. Liang.

62
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,280
You're here.

63
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,160
Come and have breakfast.

64
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,560
Come, sit here.

65
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,790
By the way,

66
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,390
I've ordered the flowers for the wedding.

67
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,240
Do you want to go check them for me?

68
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,840
I have to go out this afternoon.

69
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,520
Sure.

70
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,360
I've found a clue.

71
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,800
I extracted the general transport route
from Smith.

72
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
And Liang Zongyue

73
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,280
drives alone to Xincun Village every month

74
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,240
without any followers.

75
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,720
I think the arsenal must be there.

76
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,760
Xincun Village.

77
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,100
It's very close to the dock
of Fortune Trading Company.

78
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,190
It used to be an abandoned factory.

79
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,320
The arms are likely hidden there.

80
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,280
Yes.

81
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,560
Recently, Liang Zongyue asked me
to run some errands.

82
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,760
I'll take this opportunity
to find the exact address.

83
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,600
Let's meet at the greenhouse tonight

84
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,240
and discuss the next steps.

85
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,920
Alright.

86
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,600
Do you

87
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,880
want to say something?

88
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,200
Last night,

89
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,560
Liang Jiahao stayed in your room all night.

90
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,840
I was drunk.

91
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,000
Jiahao came to take care of me.

92
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,160
What do you mean by asking this?

93
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,280
Did he do anything to you?

94
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,430
Jiahao helped me organize
the business documents

95
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,800
and rested on the sofa.

96
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,130
He's a gentleman.

97
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,240
He wouldn't do anything to me.

98
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,960
A gentleman?

99
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,720
Well,

100
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,520
the person seems to have gone far away.

101
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,550
Let me hold you a little longer.

102
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,400
