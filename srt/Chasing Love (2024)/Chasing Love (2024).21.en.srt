14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,390
You're back.

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,240
Yes, I just came back from the flower shop.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
You've been out for so long.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,920
Aren't you tired?

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,800
The flower shopkeeper

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,680
showed me a few new types of flowers.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,240
But I prefer the original ones.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,920
When did your memory come back?

22
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,150
Or

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,800
did you never forget?

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,280
Jiahao,

25
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,080
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,870
I don't want an apology.

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
I must avenge my father and my company.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,240
I never intended to hurt you.

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,330
So you deceived and used me.

30
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,660
It's all my fault.

31
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,610
It's my fault.

32
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,000
You can hate me and blame me.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,040
I have nothing to say.

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,840
Have you ever cared about me?

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,320
Since we were children,

36
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,110
have you ever thought of me for a moment?

37
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,010
Jiahao, Yue,

38
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,610
are you two okay?

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,720
It's so late at night.

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,520
What's going on?

41
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,850
Nothing.

42
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,680
The flowers for the wedding were not right.

43
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,720
Yue is throwing a tantrum with me.

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
I see, just a couple's quarrel.

45
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,560
Yue,

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,520
don't blame Jiahao.

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
He's just a bit careless.

48
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,460
Next time, I'll go with you to choose.

49
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,720
And you,

50
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,640
the wedding is such an important event.

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
How could you get the flowers wrong?

52
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,030
It's all my fault.

53
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,600
I'll go back to my room to rest now.

54
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,480
Why

55
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,720
are you still helping me?

56
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,080
The wedding is in a few days.

57
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,000
See if there's anything else the house needs.

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,440
Tell the servants.

59
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,600
By the way,

60
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,920
you'll marry me at the Ouyang Mansion.

61
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,120
I'll have the mansion decorated.

62
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,080
You should also go and take a look soon.

63
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,600
Jiahao,

64
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,120
I will not marry you.

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
You will.

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,520
Today at 3:15 PM,

67
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,120
at the corner of the flower shop
on 58 Sfield Road,

68
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,520
you met Qin Jifeng alone.

69
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Qin Jifeng said

70
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,320
he had discovered Smith's
arms smuggling route.

71
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,480
and deduced that the warehouse
is near Xincun Village.

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,400
You and he have agreed to meet

73
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,560
tomorrow afternoon

74
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,190
in the greenhouse at the Ouyang Mansion

75
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,360
to discuss the next steps.

76
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,520
You plan to destroy the arsenal,

77
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,640
my father,

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,440
and my entire family.

79
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,640
Jiahao.

80
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,560
Imagine,

81
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,600
if my father knew about this,

82
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,880
could Qin Jifeng still survive?

83
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,360
Jiahao,

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,920
smuggling arms harms the common people.

85
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,440
You shouldn't do this.

86
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,200
What do the common people have to do with me?

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,920
I only want you.

88
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,720
Jiahao.

89
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,480
Liang Jiahao, you are crazy.

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,710
Crazy?

91
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,050
Who drove me crazy?

92
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,140
Who?

93
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,880
The wedding will proceed as planned.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,920
I will have men send Qin Jifeng away.

Yue,

128
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,440
I found the arsenal

129
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,480
I've made up my mind.

130
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,600
First, set up the explosives

131
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,720
to blow up the arsenal,

132
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,080
capture Smith,

133
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,520
and then contact the journalists

134
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,280
to expose all of Liang Zongyue's crimes.

135
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,160
This way,

136
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,960
the entire Hongcheng will know

137
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,320
that Fortune Trading Company is innocent.

I don't want revenge anymore.

142
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,920
Neither do I want to investigate
the arsenal anymore.

143
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080

144
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,600
Let's give up.

145
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,360

146
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,120
What are you talking about?

147
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,520
She said she doesn't want revenge anymore.

148
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,680
Come here.

149
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Yue, did he force you?

150
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,840
It's not his fault.

151
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm really tired.

152
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I can't even save myself.

153
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,840
How can I save the people

154
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
or protect Hongcheng?

155
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,120
No, Yue.

156
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,800
You're not that kind of person.

157
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,120
You said it yourself

158
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,640
that your father founded the company

159
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,880
to save the country from peril.

160
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,520
You want to fulfill his last wish
more than I do, don't you?

161
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,320
You've said enough.

162
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,480
Let her go.

163
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,720
- Qin Jifeng.
- Ouyang Yue.

Jiahao.

165
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,640
You promised me you'd let him go.

166
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,240
I will marry you.

167
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,040
Please let him go.

168
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,160
The day after tomorrow is the wedding.

169
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,920
I know you miss home.

170
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,760
These days, you can stay here.

171
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,640
After we get married,

172
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,560
we'll move to the apartment.
