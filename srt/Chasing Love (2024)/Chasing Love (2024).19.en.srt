Sir,

Do you know?

78
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,400
The first time Jiahao said
he wanted to marry you,

79
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,480
he was only seven years old.

80
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,240
He told me after he came back

81
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,880
from your birthday party,

82
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,440
"Mom,

83
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,520
I want to marry Yue.

84
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,500
I'll marry no one but her in this life."

85
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,600
Isn't that funny?

86
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,480
Drink.

87
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,920
Drink.

88
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,160
Yue,

89
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,280
I envy you.

90
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,280
You're really lucky

91
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,680
to have met a man who is wholeheartedly

92
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,800
and sincerely devoted to you.

93
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,800
That is a blessing for a woman.

94
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,120
Jiahao truly loves me sincerely.

95
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,600
I have always known this.

96
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,400
You and I are both women,

97
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,080
so you will understand

98
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,480

100
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,080
everything I do is worth it.

101
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,040
Drink.

102
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,840
Yue.

103
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,080
My mother-in-law gave me this

104
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,920
when I married Mr. Liang.

105
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,640
I can't accept this.

106
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,840
Take it.

107
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,720
I just hope you and Jiahao can be happy

108
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,320

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,880
Why did you call me over so late?

113
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,680
Yue is drunk.

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,480
Take good care of her.

116
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,440
Mom, what are you doing?

117
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,880
You two will consummate the marriage tonight

118
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,740
to avoid any complications.

119
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,520
This is as far as I can help you.

120
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,560
Mom, open the door.

121
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,760
