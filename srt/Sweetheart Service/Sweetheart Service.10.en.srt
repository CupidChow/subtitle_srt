00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,352
Yooha?

10
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,062
Minwoo,

11
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,439
do you have a moment?

12
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,483
What is it?

13
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,736
I’d like to talk face-to-face.

14
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,365
I’m outside your office.

15
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,242
Outside?

16
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,326
Yes.

17
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,749
Okay. I’ll be right out.

18
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,891
Yooha!

19
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,481
Minwoo,

20
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,780
I don’t think I can do the boyfriend-for-hire service anymore.

21
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,491
What?

22
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,745
I found a client with better terms.

23
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,291
So...

24
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,548
I’m quitting.

25
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,974
Thank you

26
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,853
for everything.

27
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,525
Oh, and...

28
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,742
What’s this?

29
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,163
Compensation for

30
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,458
your laptop and bag.

31
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,593
Yooha! There you are~

32
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,932
Minwoo, I’ll head out first.

33
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,810
Shall we go?

34
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,776
Yooha

35
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,940
Yooha

36
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,569
Did the food suit your taste?

37
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,488
Yes,

38
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,116
it was really good.

39
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,119
I’m glad.

40
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,835
Is there a bug on the table?

41
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,546
Oh, no!

42
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,468
I’m not boring you, am I?

43
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,595
No,

44
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,513
of course not.

45
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,480
I’ll take care of the bar issues.

46
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,733
You don’t have to worry.

47
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,986
Thank you so much...

48
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:08,951
I’ll also provide enough support to hire staff for operations.

49
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,048
Suyeon...

50
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,262
why are you helping me this much?

51
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,352
Why?

52
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,065
Because I like you.

53
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,029
But as you probably know,

54
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,490
nothing in life comes for free.

55
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,785
If I’m helping this much,

56
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,953
you should give me

57
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,623
a little more of your heart, too.

58
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,883
Okay, I will.

59
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,149
You’ve sorted things out with Minwoo, right?

60
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,618
Yes.

61
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,248
It’s over.

62
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,337
That’s good.

63
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,721
From now on,

64
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,807
I’ll be the one by your side.

65
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,347
One Tequila Sunrise and one Godfather, please.

66
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,057
Ah, yes. Got it.

67
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:10,980
'CEO Ha Suyeon'
'Why aren’t you answering my calls?'
'Did you get off work?'
'Are you free this Saturday?'

68
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,330
Mr... Son Yooha

69
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,750
Minwoo

70
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,793
How...

71
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,714
How could you do this to me?

72
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,925
Minwoo, you’re drunk. Go home.

73
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,011
Ha Suyeon—

74
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:48,017
Did she offer that much money?

75
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,021
I really thought...

76
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,524
I could trust you...

77
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,571
Uh... Minwoo, are you okay?

78
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,908
Hey, come on, snap out of it.

79
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,743
I...

80
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,205
still need you...

81
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,932
Minwoo...

82
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,893
Minwoo...

83
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,472
Mr. Minwoo

84
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,395
Mr. Minwoo

85
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,489
Who are you...?

86
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:30,160
Oh! I’m Yooha’s friend, Bae Jaemin.

87
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,246
Where’s Yooha?

88
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,124
He’s probably with Suyeon right now.

89
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,085
Do you know where they went?

90
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,507
Mr. Minwoo,

91
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,884
Taeha—

92
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,512
Yooha’s brother

93
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,265
—he’s gone missing.

94
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,391
The boss?

95
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,309
Yes.

96
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,979
No one’s seen him for days. But,

97
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,357
the night before he disappeared,

98
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,323
I saw Suyeon. She was here.

99
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,574
Ha Suyeon...

100
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,203
It could be a coincidence,

101
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,288
but

102
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,207
it’s just... I can’t stop thinking about it.

103
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,086
I need to find her.

104
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,590
Wait!

105
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,679
Yooha wanted to protect everything—

106
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,349
his brother, the bar,

107
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,644
and you, Minwoo.
