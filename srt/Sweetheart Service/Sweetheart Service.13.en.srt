00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:50,759
Removing dust.
Removing dust.

9
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,722
Master, there is too much trash.

10
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,612
Master, there is too much trash.

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,531
Removing dust.

12
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:20,538
Master, there is too much trash.
Master, there is too much trash.

13
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,762
Master, there is too much trash.

14
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,766
Master, there is too much trash.

15
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:51,110
Master, you just sighed.

16
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:57,116
Stress levels detected. Playing calming music.

17
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,360
Master, there is too much trash.

18
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,531
Master, there is too much trash.

19
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,061
- Is something wrong?
- Where is Yooha?

20
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:07,896
Yooha...

21
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,524
why do you ask?

22
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,111
I have something to say to Yooha.

23
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,489
Why not just call?

24
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,325
I... um...

25
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:21,910
It’s just...

26
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,373
He’s doing a nude modeling gig.

27
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,710
It should’ve started by now.

28
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,420
Thank you.

29
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,047
Ah...

30
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,843
You met Taeha, right?

31
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:41,930
Yes.

32
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,808
He’ll come back, won’t he?

33
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,883
Taeha.

34
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,240
Taeha, are you okay?

35
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:53,418
Without Yooha... I don’t know how to live anymore.

36
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,023
I really...

37
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,859
don’t know.

38
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,031
Then...

39
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,410
I’ll show you how.

40
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,640
Sorry.

41
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,062
I’m really sorry, I just...

42
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,319
Taeha.

43
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,066
- I’ll head in first.
- Okay.

44
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,122
Here... I want you to have this.

45
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,060
This is... me?

46
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,271
Don’t laugh.

47
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,532
I’m sorry.

48
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:21,459
I hurt you with my thoughtlessness.

49
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,010
I’m sorry too.

50
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,683
I shouldn’t have ended it so abruptly...

51
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,858
You were too much for me.

52
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,946
Just being near you was overwhelming.

53
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,908
I think I broke.

54
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,832
But even so...

55
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,087
being with you made me happy.

56
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,094
You break me...

57
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,805
but I don’t mind being

58
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,934
broken like that.

59
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,528
I want to trust you now.

60
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,948
And I want to

61
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,204
keep seeing your smile.

62
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,209
Even so...

63
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:46,669
could we?

64
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,358
Are you...

65
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,320
acting right now?

66
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,752
Taeha! Are you okay?

67
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,089
Oh... Sorry. My hand slipped.

68
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,842
Taeha, just stay still.

69
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,178
I’ll clean it up.

70
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,023
Sorry.

71
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,236
I feel like I’ve just been a burden lately.

72
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:48,827
Come on, people make mistakes!

73
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,380
I’ve broken tons of dishes while washing them too.

74
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:24,280
This is Son Yooha, and I’ll be presenting DooRhythm, where real excitement begins.

75
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,865
I’ll begin the presentation now.

76
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,786
Finding someone who truly matches you is harder than it seems.

77
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,330
In relationships, we often start with too much information...

78
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,167
We already know so many things before anything begins.

79
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,422
Age, job, appearance, gender—

80
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,008
And beyond that, so many more details...

81
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,385
This is how our app, DooRhythm, works...

82
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,887
It guides you to a meeting place,

83
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:51,432
and from there, connections begin to form.

84
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,393
Everyone deserves a chance to meet someone.

85
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,313
Shall we begin?

86
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,694
DooRhythm combines personal traits and internal data

87
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,738
to lead people to genuine encounters,

88
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,156
and ultimately,

89
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:13,120
we believe it will grow into a platform that helps discover real relationships.

90
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,498
That concludes my presentation.

91
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,750
Thank you.

92
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,894
Yooha, that was incredible.

93
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,229
Better than I expected.

94
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,148
Thank you.

95
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,152
Now, let’s get serious—

96
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,655
how about making this into a real business with us?

97
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,115
I’d love to!

98
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,431
Dating a coworker wasn’t part of the plan...

99
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,566
Then let’s sign a new contract.

100
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,009
You two—

101
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,520
You two... stop clinging to each other.

102
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,981
You really shouldn’t be doing that here...

103
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,401
Seriously, this is not the place.

104
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,403
Ugh... seriously...

105
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,909
Jaemin, you’re the best...

106
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,500
You should’ve seen his face when you weren’t around.

107
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,003
- I was just acting.
- What do you mean? I love Taeha so much.

108
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,421
Aren’t you two a thing?

109
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,548
Drop it.

110
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,842
He’s not even drinking.

111
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,595
Minwoo, I poured you a drink and you didn’t even touch it. Make him drink.

112
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:00,722
Minwoo, have a drink, will you?

113
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,309
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

114
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,520
Oh, it’s nothing...

115
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,773
Minwoo.

116
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,733
There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask.

117
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,860
What is it?

118
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,320
Would you like...

119
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,447
to be my boyfriend?

120
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,664
And what exactly...

121
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,166
do I gain from this deal?

122
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,507
You get me.

123
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,345
Come on, what are you guys doing over there?

124
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,097
Did you drink that much?

125
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,974
We can do that too, you know!

126
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,059
- Go ahead, try it.
- Yeah, go on.

127
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,187
- I’ll do the toast.
- Cheers!

128
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:51,148
I’ll say the toast, alright?

129
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:55,193
When I say “To our love,” everyone raise your glass, got it?

130
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,530
To our love!

131
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,116
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

132
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,411
Minwoo, smile. Come on, smile.

133
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,163
- This is hilarious.
- Come on, Minwoo, smile!

134
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,581
- I’ll smile after I drink.
- Not happy with the toast?

135
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,749
I’m just a little shy.

136
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,500
- Could’ve been better—“To our love!”
- That was so heartwarming.

137
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,502
- Ah!
- Ah!

138
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,421
I don’t eat flour.

139
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,633
That’s classic Jaemin, you know?

140
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,468
To our love!

141
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,670
Sweetheart Service

142
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,255
Sweetheart Service!

143
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:24,426
It was an honor to work with such amazing actors and staff.

144
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,344
Taeha, Yooha, Jaemin, Minwoo—

145
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:30,932
I can’t wait to see which character ends up being the audience’s favorite.

146
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,517
Much love to you all.

147
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,853
Please don’t forget to leave a comment. Thank you!
