00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,225
The weather's really nice today.

2
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,561
- Huh?
- Shooooom~

3
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,855
It's real…

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,524
Shooooom~

5
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,859
Mmm-mmm.

6
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,489
- Shooooom~
- Mmm~

7
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,783
- Hello?
- You were right. It’s really happening!

8
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,577
- Huh?
- It’s real!

9
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,497
- W-Wait, what do you mean it’s real?
- Shooooom~

10
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,874
It’s Minwoo!

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,293
Wait, tell me everything!

12
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,337
Shooooom~

13
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,135
Oh, got it.

14
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,847
Shooooom~

15
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,850
Hey!

16
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,645
Is it good?

Jung Minwoo~

25
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,494
Babe, are you okay?

26
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,122
What are you doing here?

27
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,584
I've got wind of something fun, thought I’d drop by.

28
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,843
Hello, I’m Minwoo’s boyfriend, Son Yooha.

29
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,054
Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,979
I had no idea you had such a handsome boyfriend.

31
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,230
Lucky you, Minwoo~

32
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,899
Director, don’t you have a meeting this afternoon?

33
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,111
Let’s go, Yooha. I’ll walk you out.

34
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,153
Oh?

35
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,781
Hurry.

36
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:37,866
Okay.

37
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,369
Take care~

38
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,174
Ugh…

39
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,261
Ugh…

40
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,524
Taeha, is something bothering you?

41
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,402
Huh?

42
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,115
Oh, Yooha’s been avoiding my calls lately…

43
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,700
I’m getting worried.

44
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,289
Yeah, Yooha…

45
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,750
He seems a little out of it these days…

46
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,057
- Jaemin.
- Ah!

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,812
- It's you, Taeha…
- Ah, sorry.

48
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm just wondering if you're able to contact Yooha.

49
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,943
He’s not answering me.

50
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,903
Uh…

51
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,489
Yeah.

52
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,368
He’s not taking my calls either.

53
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,585
He's probably just busy!

54
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,212
Yeah, that's it…

55
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,052
Ugh…

56
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,352
Did you see Minwoo’s boyfriend?

57
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,604
Yeah, I saw them.

58
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,773
Totally lovey-dovey.

59
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,526
- Whoa…
- I didn’t think he was that kind of guy…

60
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,737
They were all over each other…

61
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,157
Ugh, I can’t even show my face at work now.

62
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,672
Oh, I’m sorry, I wasn’t looking.

63
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,224
Jaemin.

64
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,105
Taeha?

65
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,736
Jaemin.

66
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,446
About Yooha…

67
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,364
You know something, don’t you?

68
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,870
Please, just tell me the truth.

69
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,581
I think you'd understand…

70
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,001
How I'm feeling better than anyone.

71
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,340
Taeha…

72
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,059
Yooha is doing…

73
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,732
a rental boyfriend service.

74
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,944
Rental boyfriend…?

75
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,699
Why?

76
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,787
He probably needed the money…

77
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,414
That’s probably why he started doing it.

78
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,418
Taeha…

79
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,925
I don’t think it was an easy choice for him.

80
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:30,056
I’m sure he thought about it a lot.

81
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,310
And there must be a reason he didn’t tell you.

82
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,439
Yeah.

83
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:40,900
Taeha.

84
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,489
If you can just wait a little longer, he might open up.

85
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:51,911
Yooha knows how much you care for him.

86
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,584
What are you guys doing?

87
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,253
- Yooha…
- Yooha.

88
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,130
Taeha?

89
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,465
Why are you home so late?

90
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,678
Taeha, come on. It’s not the first time.

91
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,596
Exactly.

92
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,849
And I always wait for you.

93
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,476
I told you not to.

94
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,853
Then you could have…

95
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,981
at least answered your phone.

96
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,944
Okay, sorry…

97
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,821
If you’re done, let’s head out.

98
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,990
Jaemin told me…

99
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,536
About that weird part-time job.

100
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,333
- That rental boyfriend thing…
- I’m sorry.

101
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:44,547
Pretending to be someone’s boyfriend just for some cash?

102
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,801
What if something happens to you?

103
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,510
Taeha…

104
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,056
Whatever I do, it’s my business, not yours.

105
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,018
You don't need to pay them any mind.

106
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,729
Not my business?

107
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,606
Yooha…

108
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,902
If something happens to you, of course it’s my business. I raised you!

109
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,447
You think I can just stand by and let you do whatever?

110
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,826
I don’t want to rely on you forever.

111
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,996
I can’t keep living like that.

112
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,584
Yooha…

113
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,670
I work because…

114
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,674
I want to be someone you can lean on when things get tough.

115
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,761
Have you ever thought about…

116
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,931
How I feel?

117
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,350
Even just a little?

118
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,521
I know.

119
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,903
I’ll always be thankful and sorry to you.

120
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,698
But sometimes…

121
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,205
It’s just too much for me.

122
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,336
I’m sorry, Taeha.

123
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,216
I knew I had to be honest with you someday.

124
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,761
After all…

125
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,769
We're still family.

126
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,528
Where are you going now?

127
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,157
I want to try standing on my own.

128
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,831
Ugh…

129
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,001
Can’t believe I’ve got nowhere to go…

130
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,838
Feels like I’ve wasted 24 years…

131
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,924
I said I’d be fine on my own…

132
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,302
That I could live…

133
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,721
Without my brother…

134
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,222
But was that…

135
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,309
Just a lie to myself?

136
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,688
Everyone else is achieving something…

137
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,608
Working hard…

138
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,986
And here I am…

139
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,490
Stucking in place.

140
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,120
No.

141
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,664
I’m not staying stuck.

142
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,217
- Alright then. Might as well make some money!
- [Strawberry Market / Rangi and Baby]
Is anyone available to feed the cat right now?

143
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,597
I'm available. Where's the location?

144
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,642
[PotatoFriend]
I’m available!! Where’s the location?

145
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,488
- Yes, Minwoo?
- Thanks for your work today.

146
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:43,160
I wanted to talk about your next task. Where are you now?

147
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:44,954
I’m…

148
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,040
On my way to feed a cat.

149
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,126
What do you mean?

150
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,670
Actually…

151
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,926
I had nowhere to go, so I took a night job.

152
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,470
So I’m now in front of the client’s place.

153
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,263
Wait…

154
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,225
So you’re going into a stranger’s house?

155
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,935
Yeah… kind of?

156
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,478
That’s too dangerous.

157
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,189
Tell me the address.

158
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:12,815
What?

159
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,024
Now.

160
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,485
Wait at the door.

161
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,028
Uh, okay!

162
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,532
Okay…

163
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,100
Minwoo…

164
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,604
Are you into baseball?

165
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,483
Just brought it in case…

166
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,193
Huh?

167
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,652
Let’s go in together.

168
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:00,946
Okay!

169
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,636
Where’s the cat supposed to be?

170
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,680
You’re so suspicious.

171
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,235
Oh!

172
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,583
- Yooha.
- Yes?

173
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,545
Go over there.

174
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,296
I’ll look for the food.

175
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,469
- Yooha.
- Yes?

176
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,972
I think it’s over here?

177
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,473
Huh? Uh… Minwoo?

178
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,180
Sweetheart Service

179
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,893
- Hello, I’m Son Yooha. And this is…
- Jung Minwoo.

180
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,854
We have quite a… well, strange relationship.

181
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,564
Strange?

182
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,441
Yeah.

183
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,069
You could say… we’re lovers?

184
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,280
More like… fake lovers.

185
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,451
Well, either way, don’t we look good together?

186
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,245
No way.

187
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,746
Why are you so sure?

188
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,083
I used to be…

189
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,710
And now?

190
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,295
I’m not so sure.

191
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,382
Why? What are you unsure about?

192
00:16:58,892 --> 00:16:59,852
What?

193
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,314
Are you getting fluttered?

194
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,734
I don’t know.

195
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,530
If you don’t, why don’t we figure it out together,
here at Sweetheart Service?

196
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,742
Help me out, will you?

197
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,077
- See you soon.
- Huh?

198
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,954
- Let’s meet again.
- See you in the next episode.
