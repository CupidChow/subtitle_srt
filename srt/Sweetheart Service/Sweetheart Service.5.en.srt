1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,044
- Yooha.
- Yes.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,380
I think it’s over here?

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,798
Huh? Uh... Minwoo?

4
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,879
There it is...

5
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,880
The cat.

6
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,673
Yeah...

7
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,385
Uh... but...

8
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,803
Uh...

9
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:54,888
Could you...

10
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,516
Oh!

11
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,935
Sorry.

12
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,527
A bat...

13
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,530
Uhh... where did I put the cat food...

14
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,664
Uhh... I need to find the cat food...

15
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,085
Is it not here? Huh? Oh!

16
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,796
Uhh... I’m off to find the cat food...

24
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,561
Is something wrong? Do you have something to say?

25
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,522
– Um... Minwoo.
– Yes?

26
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:33,820
I was wondering... could I stay over tonight?

27
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,948
Huh...?

28
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,080
I mean... even if this is a pretend relationship, you really don’t have to go that far.

29
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,670
What? Oh!

30
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,839
No, that’s not what I meant!

31
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,674
Uh, I mean...

32
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,844
That’s not what I meant.

33
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,607
I had a fight with my brother and left home.

34
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,401
I don’t have anywhere to go.

35
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,364
I thought I’d just stay up all night working, but...

36
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,121
I’m sorry for asking this.

37
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,500
I know I’ve been a bother…

38
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,337
broke your stuff,

39
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,925
took your expensive clothes...

40
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:39,969
Let’s go.

41
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,930
What?

42
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,681
Now that I think about it...

43
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:48,102
We need to talk about what you’ll be doing next time.

44
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,104
Yes!

45
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,775
Let’s go.

46
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,401
Yes, let’s go.

47
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,078
Thank you for having me~

48
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,255
What is that?

49
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,593
That’s Sebastian.

50
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,930
Is there a problem?

51
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,558
Uh... no, no. It’s fine.

52
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,812
Sebastian.

53
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,072
You can wash up now.

54
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,034
There’s a new toothbrush on the shelf.

55
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,286
Got it!

56
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,051
What should I give him...?

57
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:11,894
Hmm...

Missed Call

61
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,294
Where are you? Call me right now.

62
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,049
Yooha, please text me back.

63
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,550
Who are you with right now?

64
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,596
Minwoo.

65
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,770
Minwoo! I’m done!

66
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,816
Uh... c-clothes to change into...

67
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,237
Ah, thank you.

68
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,824
The... hair dryer... you can take it out and use it later.

69
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,993
Okay, um...

70
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,705
See you in a bit.

71
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,716
Haa...

72
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,147
Minwoo, you should wash up too.

73
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,333
Okay...

74
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,919
This place is so clean...

75
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,479
Uh, hi...?

76
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,639
Frozen lunchboxes?

77
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,690
Don’t have much of an appetite?

78
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:50,821
Oh!

79
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,782
Why are you looking through someone else’s fridge?

80
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,743
I was just... thirsty!

81
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,495
I’ll get you a glass.

82
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,246
Okay.

83
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,138
Then...

84
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,725
I thought you might not want to do the dishes.

85
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,560
I don’t really mind.

86
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:22,853
Then...

87
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,397
Should I use it then?

88
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,565
Do as you like.

89
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,442
Okay, then I won’t.

90
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:34,824
Minwoo.

91
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:38,202
Can I ask you something?

92
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,663
Sure.

93
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,252
Why did you ask me

94
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,505
to pretend to be your boyfriend?

95
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,927
I mean...

96
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,723
You're cool and seem to have everything...

97
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,309
So I was curious why you'd ask for that.

98
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,477
And, more than that—

99
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,980
Since I’ll be pretending to be your boyfriend,

100
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,233
I thought I should try to understand what you want better.

101
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,860
That’s all...

102
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,072
I just didn’t want to hear people tell me to get married.

103
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,455
Oh...

104
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,169
Uh, right...

105
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,295
Well...

106
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,839
Minwoo, um...

107
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,634
Do you have a graduation album or childhood photos?

108
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,136
I do...

109
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,804
But why?

110
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,807
If I’m going to keep pretending to be your boyfriend,

111
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,061
I think I need to know you better.

112
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,023
Can’t you show me, just once?

113
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,746
Minwoo, is this from your kindergarten days?

114
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,623
Which one is you here?

115
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,626
Is that your younger brother?

116
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,003
Oh... your cheeks are so cute.

117
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,464
You look just like...

118
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,882
a Chupa Chups lollipop.

119
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,176
Melon flavor.

120
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,596
Oh my gosh, you’re too cute...

121
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,559
You’re wearing hanbok here!

122
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,231
Oh my god! You were so cute!

123
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,194
You had so many expressions back then.

124
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,157
Minwoo...

125
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,368
How old were you here?

126
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,954
Can you stop looking now...?

127
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,626
Ah... sorry.

128
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,462
No, I mean...

129
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,297
You were just so cute, I mean—

130
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,759
You were really adorable as a kid.

131
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,428
Got it.

132
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,519
Yeah...

133
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,733
You’ll probably meet my family next.

134
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,197
Then I should be well prepared.

135
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,491
Yeah, they’re not easy.

136
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245
Minwoo.

137
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,496
Yes?

138
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,000
I want to know more about you.

139
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,049
Like what?

140
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,886
Hmm...

141
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,722
When’s your birthday?

142
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,098
September 15.

143
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,725
September 15...

144
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,727
Any allergies?

145
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,396
I don’t have any allergies,

146
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,982
but there are things I can’t eat.

147
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,233
Like what?

148
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,736
Beans.

149
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,488
And tomatoes.

150
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,742
– Beans and tomatoes.
– But I can eat ketchup.

151
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,665
Favorite color?

152
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,834
- Black.
- Black...

153
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,422
Minwoo... um, what were you like in school?

154
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,551
From elementary through college?

155
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,513
Not much different from now.

156
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,390
What about friends?

157
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,726
I didn’t have any.

158
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,697
If it’s uncomfortable, you don’t have to answer.

159
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,574
It’s fine.

160
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,575
Well...

161
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,121
Since I was a kid, I’ve always struggled with people.

162
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,665
And...

163
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,000
I’ve had a hard time trusting others.

164
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,797
Even now, the reason I became a developer

165
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,676
is because the language of 0s and 1s felt easier.

166
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,804
And to me, more fascinating.

167
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,935
That’s all there is.

168
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,853
That’s my life.

169
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,188
Simple, right?

170
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,740
It doesn’t seem simple.

171
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,660
How do I put this...

172
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,789
You seem like a real grown-up.

173
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,835
You’re an adult too.

174
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,422
Legally, yes.

175
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,968
But I don’t think I’m really grown-up yet.

176
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,012
What does that mean?

177
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,639
I’m not really sure either.

178
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:58,063
Maybe someone who doesn’t rely on others and can handle everything on their own?

179
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,815
Something like that, I guess?

180
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,527
That’s why...

181
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,864
I think you’re amazing, Minwoo.

182
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,991
So different from me.

183
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,125
You look tired. Go to sleep.

184
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,544
I’m not sleepy...

185
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,795
Come on, sleep.

186
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,006
You’re so mean...

187
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,310
Your home...

188
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,562
How should I say this...

189
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,190
It feels just like you.

190
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,780
Clean and perfect.

191
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,909
Well, it is my place.

192
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,953
But...

193
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,332
It feels kind of cold.

194
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,710
Are you cold?

195
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,718
No,

196
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,221
It just... feels that way.

197
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,641
Yooha.

198
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,269
Yooha...

199
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:48,757
I think... you're the amazing one.

200
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,828
Yooha.

201
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,998
Yooha...

202
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,208
Yooha?

203
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,502
Yooha...

204
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,712
Yooha...

205
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,964
Mr. Minwoo.

206
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,425
Good morning.

207
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,093
Here, drink this.

208
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,096
Thank you.

209
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,777
Minwoo...

210
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,737
What is this?!

211
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,197
Coffee.

212
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,531
Too bitter?

213
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,242
It’s salty...

214
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,577
Huh?

215
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,039
Maybe you’re just not awake yet.

216
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,123
No, I’m serious...

217
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,669
Oh...

218
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,923
Was that... salt?

219
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,786
Two, three!

220
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,997
Happy Pride Month!

221
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,208
Yeah! There’s no one right way to love, no manual either.

222
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:32,337
To all of you shining in your own unique colors—you’re truly amazing.

223
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,173
Whoever you are, whoever you love—

224
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:38,343
Please keep shining just as you are.
