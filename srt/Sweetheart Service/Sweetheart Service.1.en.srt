Thank you.

191
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,245
Hello.

192
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,955
I’m applicant no. 762 for Matchbox HR team

193
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,541
Son Yooha.

194
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,086
I majored in Business Administration at Korea University.

195
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,587
It's from last time at the painting studio.

196
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,130
Uh…

197
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,007
- The painting studio? You were painting?
- Through internships and competitions…
- You know I paint.

198
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,176
- What do you usually paint?
- I’ve developed leadership and teamwork skills.
- Croquis.

199
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,678
- He’s doing nude modeling?!
- Yes!

200
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,179
Nude model? Oh, seriously?

201
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,850
Especially…

202
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,644
Through brand marketing…

203
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,062
I’ve gained various…

204
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,355
- Hands-on experiences…
- Nude model?

205
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,023
Really?

206
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,442
With that as my foundation…

207
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,153
If I could officially join…

208
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,237
[Sighs]

209
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,323
Your company…

210
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,332
That's enough.

211
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,835
Next person, please.

212
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,087
Hello.

213
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,132
I’m applicant no. 763 for the HR team, Kim Youngwoong.

214
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,260
With a deep understanding of people and organizations…

215
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,095
I want to create a positive company culture…

216
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,347
And contribute to talent development.

217
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,142
During university, through various team projects…

218
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,937
I learned the importance of smooth communication and collaboration with members.

219
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,771
Through this…

220
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,138
Keep next Saturday open.

221
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:30,768
I’m setting up a dinner with Director Choi’s daughter.

222
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,020
[Sighs]

223
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,110
How was the blind date?

224
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,781
How much did your mom tell you?

225
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,620
Your mom was lamenting to mine again.

226
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,122
The eldest grandson shouldn’t be like this.

227
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,917
The Confucian girl’s here.

228
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,920
You’ll seriously regret it later, you know?

229
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,797
Not my business.

230
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,674
Mind your own.

231
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,885
I’m doing very well, actually.

232
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,681
Probably?

233
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,938
But serious question here.

234
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,816
Have you ever felt lonely?

235
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,823
Not really.

236
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,078
- Where are you going?
- Bathroom.

237
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,663
[Exhales]

238
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,382
Hey.

239
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,050
By the way, did you hear about Minwoo?

240
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,844
Jung Minwoo?

241
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,470
Why?

242
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,599
He's single and doesn’t date, right?

243
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,100
Yeah.

244
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,394
I think he doesn’t like women.

245
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,313
Is that so?

246
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,275
I think he just doesn’t like people in general.

247
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,903
Well, he’s always eating alone and stuff.

248
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:09,450
But he seems pretty close with CEO Sooyeon, right?

249
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,619
Were they college classmates or something?

250
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,536
Hey.

251
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,456
What if they’re secretly dating?

252
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,749
Oh, come on.

253
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,375
What nonsense.

254
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,127
The CEO has a boyfriend.

255
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:20,919
Ah, right.

256
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,112
"I think he doesn’t like women"

257
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,822
"Is that so?"

258
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,534
"I think he just doesn’t like people in general"

259
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,208
Would you like another drink?

260
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,670
Same one, please.

261
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,594
You’re drinking a lot today.

262
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,303
Huh?

263
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,348
Ah, yeah.

264
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,997
Why do people get married?

265
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,420
Why must they insist on living with someone

266
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,797
When it’s obvious that they're not even compatible?

267
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,425
Dating, marriage, whatever.

268
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,929
That whole process is so inefficient.

269
00:16:55,931 --> 00:17:01,478
It’s easier to just work like a machine without hurting others.

270
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,985
Drinks are simple.

271
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,696
Like water or soda.

272
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,115
You just drink them as they are.

273
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,285
No need to mix, clean and efficient.

274
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,428
But cocktails are different.

275
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,015
Different ingredients mix and blend.

276
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,269
Sometimes they clash, creating a story in each sip.

277
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,961
I think dating and marriage are similar.

278
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:13,175
When people who don’t seem to match collide, mix and blend…

279
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,720
They create a unique flavor just for themselves.

280
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,140
Isn’t that process too complicated?

281
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,400
Sometimes it’s too bitter.

282
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,236
Sometimes it's too sweet.

283
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,864
But when you find the perfect combination, you cannot forget that taste.

284
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,832
But yeah.

285
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,585
Sometimes I also wish I could live like a machine.

286
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,879
Because…

287
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,549
I have a family to care for.

288
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,052
So love and romance feel like luxuries to me.

289
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,848
Getting close to someone and opening up…

290
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:04,643
Sometimes feels like an unbearable burden.

291
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,437
So…

292
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,649
For now, I tell myself that focusing on work is the only right thing to do.

293
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,526
I live on convincing myself of that.

294
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,077
Welcome.

295
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,203
Taeha!

296
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,220
Is that the person…

297
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,597
From that blind date…?

298
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,836
Sweetheart Service
