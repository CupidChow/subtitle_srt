Take Five

8
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,229
It’s definitely because of Yooha…

9
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,327
Um…

10
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,414
Taeha!

11
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,335
How about...

12
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,005
taking the day off and getting some fresh air?

13
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,675
I think it might be good to clear your head.

14
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,177
Now?

15
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,472
It's almost opening time.

16
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,598
It’s...

17
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,643
usually slow today anyway.

18
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,520
What?

19
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,241
Wow...

20
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,373
- I smell something.
- Really?

21
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,458
Wow...

22
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,730
How about this?

23
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,024
Ah... okay, sure.

24
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,069
- Oh, that looks great.
- Does it suit me?

25
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,445
Then I’ll...

26
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,203
That's cute, then...

27
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,375
Oh... wow.

28
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,214
You have to smile, you have to smile.

29
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,800
This time, I’ll come down.

30
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,144
No, not that one. That’s too heavy. Use this one.

31
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,941
I told you that wouldn’t work.

32
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,525
Let me give it a try.

33
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,069
Ugh, I’m anxious.

34
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,661
Well, at least I lifted it.

35
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,869
What am I even doing here?

36
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,232
I want to go home…

37
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,781
He really gives his all... no matter what it is...

38
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,876
Uh…

39
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,588
Isn’t that a bit too detailed right there?

40
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,676
Art needs specificity.

41
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,460
How was it?

42
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,172
I wanted to go home…

43
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,344
You should’ve seen your face!

44
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,888
I had the hardest time not laughing.

45
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,393
I'm hungry... Let's go grab something to eat!

46
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,063
Aren’t you working on something else today?

47
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:37,855
Yeah.

48
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,649
Well… nothing else today.

49
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,400
This was it.

50
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,404
Yooha...

51
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,074
Why do you live so… intensely?

52
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,327
Ah...

53
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,872
I mean... it just seems like you do a lot of jobs.

54
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,210
To make money.

55
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,089
So,

56
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,175
what do you want to do with the money?

57
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,392
Actually… it’s because of my brother.

58
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,563
He raised me.

59
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,357
Gave up everything because of me.

60
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,155
I’m so thankful, but also... sorry.

61
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,241
He's... too good for me.

62
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,330
He always said, “Because we’re family.”

63
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,917
So I thought, "We’re family,"

64
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,378
and I leaned on him.

65
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,089
But at some point,

66
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,884
I realized

67
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,970
he was sacrificing too much for me.

68
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,602
So yeah, I’m saving up to become independent.

69
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,190
To give back even just a little of the time and effort he gave me.

70
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,859
Even a little bit.

71
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,870
Actually,

72
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,374
we’re not related by blood.

73
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,297
I still remember it clearly.

74
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,592
It was freezing that day.

75
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,722
I had no home, nowhere to go...

76
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,060
but Taeha held my hand.

77
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,191
He was only a middle schooler...

78
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,612
Back then,

79
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,657
his hand was so cold.

80
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,117
But strangely,

81
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,038
I didn’t feel cold at all.

82
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,751
That night, we sat on a bench at Sunset Park

83
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,003
and watched the stars all night.

84
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,297
That place...

85
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,758
Do you still go there sometimes?

86
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,015
No.

87
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,935
I don’t really go anymore.

88
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,690
Back then, he was everything to me.

89
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,109
Now...

90
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,196
that memory just feels... heavy.

91
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:40,121
So yeah... I’m saving money to become independent!

92
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,748
Then...

93
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,501
what do you want to do after that?

94
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,628
After that...?

95
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,133
Let’s say you become independent.

96
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,887
Have you thought about what you want to do next?

97
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,766
Honestly,

98
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,269
I’ve never really thought about it.

99
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,899
All I ever thought about was not being a burden to him.

100
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,486
Then what are you good at?

101
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,073
Hmm... I'm good at everything, I think?

102
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,871
Oh! I did theater in college, and people said I was pretty good at acting.

103
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,583
Yeah, you are good.

104
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,335
Oh, really?

105
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,170
Thanks.

106
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,215
Anything you felt while working all those part-time jobs?

107
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,260
– There is one thing.
– What is it?

108
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,891
Making an app that connects people to one another.

109
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,436
Strawberry Market has a similar feature,

110
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,688
but it’s a bit complicated and inconvenient to use.

111
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,024
To make ours different from others,

112
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,984
it could be something that

113
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,820
helps people find their soulmate.

114
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,367
That’s actually pretty good.

115
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,787
Oh, it was just a random idea.

116
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,789
No, really. I think it’s solid.

117
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,500
Come on, don’t hype me up too much.

118
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,960
No, I mean it. I think it’s a real idea.

119
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,465
You should think about it seriously.

120
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,636
Then what should we name the app?

121
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,264
How about "Heartbeat Factory"? A place where love is made?

122
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,891
Heartbeat Factory.

123
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,769
Maybe something a bit more refined?

124
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,645
Refined...

125
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,189
Like… a Heartbeat Factory that prints out love? “Dugeun Factory!”

126
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,774
Or just “Dugeun”? Like thump-thump?

127
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,277
What about “1200g”?

128
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,822
What’s that?

129
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,617
In Korean, geun means 600 grams.

130
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,537
So *du-geun*—two geun—is 1200 grams. It sounds like a heartbeat, “dugeun dugeun,”

131
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,748
Calling it just “Dugeun” sounds nice,

132
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,834
but “1200g” gives it a bit more meaning, don’t you think?

133
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,300
– Thank you.
– For what?

134
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,052
Actually,

135
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,388
I've been feeling a little worn out lately.

136
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,101
I figured.

137
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,103
Sometimes...

138
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,564
you need to live for yourself too.

139
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,949
Thanks for spending time with me today, Taeha

140
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:11,123
No, thank you. I had a great time, thanks to you.

141
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,002
I’m glad to hear that.

142
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,224
Have I...

143
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,230
been too...

144
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,024
obsessed with Yooha?

145
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,569
Taeha.

146
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,073
No.

147
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,118
You just care about him a lot.

148
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,709
But maybe it became too much for him.

149
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:02,299
That doesn’t mean he hates you.

150
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,844
I just don’t want you to think so negatively.

151
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:10,724
I think Yooha is just trying to stand on his own now.

152
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,561
He did graduate, after all.

153
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,484
Still... it kind of hurts.

154
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:27,700
Now that I think about it, maybe I was the one relying on Yooha more.

155
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,786
Of course it hurts.

156
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,790
I’d feel the same way.

157
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,041
Yooha is...

158
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,338
someone really important to you.

159
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,136
I just...

160
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,641
hope you don’t only think about Yooha.

161
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:58,063
I hope you take care of yourself a bit more too.

162
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:07,823
Maybe you could... find someone else to lean on?

163
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,663
Hmm...

164
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,920
Will you be that person?

165
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:32,181
Why not? I like talking with you.

166
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,140
Well,

167
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,601
if you’re okay with someone like me.

168
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,899
You’re really kind.

169
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,109
Am I?

170
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,239
Then, Taeha...

171
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,410
if you ever need someone to talk to, come to me.

172
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,038
I’ll always listen.

173
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,921
Thanks, Jaemin.

174
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,561
I was just stopping by for a second... You didn’t have to walk me all the way.

175
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,731
I wanted to.

176
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,485
I’m okay now. Thanks to you.

177
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,741
Taeha...

178
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,306
You looked cold.

179
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,358
Well then!

180
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,944
Get home safe!

181
