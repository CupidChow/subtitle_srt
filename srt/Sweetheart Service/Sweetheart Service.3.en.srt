1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,805
Like I said before, it's just for a month,

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,102
and we’ll meet two or three times a week.

3
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,731
You just need to answer my messages reliably.

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,398
Okay.

5
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:34,367
As long as you do what I ask, it shouldn't be too difficult.

6
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,785
Got it.

7
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,745
Sir.

8
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,541
Excuse me.

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,333
Yes?

10
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,881
This and this.

11
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,716
And that one too, please.

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,259
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:03,229
By the way, how long are you going to keep calling me 'sir'?

14
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,232
Hmm...

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,322
Then what should I call you?

16
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,949
What do people usually say?

17
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,409
Hmm...

18
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,661
Honey?

19
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,079
Ugh...

20
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,956
Babe?

21
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:22,665
Ugh...

22
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:27,086
Or since your name is Minwoo... how about "MyMin"?

23
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,547
Are you okay?

24
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,509
Alright,

25
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:34,886
Let’s go with “Babe.”

26
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,555
Babe.

27
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,556
Babe.

28
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,142
And when we're alone, call me Mr. Minwoo.

29
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,520
I'll call you Mr. Yooha too.

30
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,605
Okay, babe.

31
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,817
In this kind of situation, say "Mr. Minwoo."

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,444
Okay, Mr. Minwoo.

33
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,909
JUNG Myeongcheol

00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,665

Sweetheart Service

Chapter 3: Cosmopolitan

40
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,952
All of these are for you, Yooha.

41
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,955
I can’t possibly accept this.

42
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,250
I’m giving them because you need them, so don’t feel pressured.

43
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,753
But I still need to compensate you.

44
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,548
This is all included in the contract.

45
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:55,884
Okay.

46
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,471
Two days later—

47
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,182
Are you free at 2 PM?

48
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,268
One moment.

49
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,355
Yes, I’m free.

50
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,481
Great.

51
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,944
That day, just pretend to be my boyfriend in front of my friends.

52
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,322
Can I ask...

53
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,825
what kind of friends?

54
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,870
That guy yesterday—your boyfriend...

55
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,456
no, I mean the bartender. Just do what you did then.

56
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,667
–He’s not actually my boyfriend...
–Thank you for waiting.

57
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,464
I guess it doesn’t matter...

58
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,471
Minwoo!

59
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,851
Minwoo.

60
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,938
Shall we go inside and take a look?

61
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,374
Wow...

62
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,417
Wow, it’s so beautiful.

63
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,962
Hey, Minwoo,

64
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,130
have you been to a place like this before?

65
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,257
Do I look like someone who would?

66
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,969
Minwoo.

67
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,095
Pick one.

68
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,055
Huh?

69
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,309
If we’re going to pretend to be a couple, shouldn’t we at least have a matching item?

70
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,395
Let’s pick something for each other.

71
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,022
I’ll pay for it.

72
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,275
Okay.

73
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,119
This one.

74
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,955
Oh no, that’s so cute!

75
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,877
Minwoo, how did you know I like cute things?

76
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,966
And you, Minwoo...

77
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,344
This one.

78
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,975
You want me to wear that?

79
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,436
Isn’t it super cute?

80
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,063
I think it’ll look perfect on you, Minwoo.

81
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,198
Tch...

82
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,599
Yooha!

83
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,186
Hello.

84
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,646
Oh, hey.

85
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,106
Hey, Jaemin! Come on in

86
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,903
You must be busy preparing for jobs too—thanks for helping out.

87
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,613
Oh, no problem.

88
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,531
Actually, I should be saying thank you, Taeha.

89
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,662
Oh right, I’ll get you an apron. Change and I’ll explain the work.

90
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,663
Okay.

91
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,637
Oh, looks good on you.

92
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,072
All set.

93
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,369
Are you feeling okay?

94
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,287
Huh?

95
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,581
Oh.

96
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:56,916
I'm fine?

97
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,838
Your face is red. Are you catching a cold or something?

98
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,842
Ah... oh, is that so?

99
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,723
I’m okay.

100
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:14,976
Alright.

101
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,019
Then shall I explain the space first?

102
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:17,770
Yes.

103
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,955
– Yes.
– Are you watching?

104
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,439
Yes, nice to meet you.

105
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,899
It took me about two hours to get here.

106
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,525
What would you like to drink?

107
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,410
Have you eaten?

108
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,204
I’m... dealing with a wisdom tooth coming in at the moment.

109
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,123
Ah...

110
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,963
Every time I come here...

111
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,394
You come here often, even though you seem busy...

112
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,332
I’m back.

113
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,292
Welcome.

114
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,296
Great job today, everyone.

115
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,467
Hey.

116
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,220
How’s the job? Is it going okay?

117
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,349
Yeah, it’s fine.

118
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,686
What kind of part-time job did you do today?

119
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:10,109
Um... I’ve taken on a steady gig as a fake boyfriend.

120
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,154
For who?

121
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,406
What kind of guy?

122
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,034
A man?

123
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,705
Hey, don’t tell Taeha, okay?

124
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,794
He's not a weird guy, right?

125
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,673
I don’t think he’s weird.

126
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,554
Oh, hey—are you good at acting cute?

127
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,560
Huh? Why are you asking that?

128
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,482
I have to act like I’m really his boyfriend in front of his friends.

129
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,817
I want to make a strong impression right away.

130
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,827
Ugh...

131
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,041
Hmph...

132
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,003
Aing~!

133
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,380
Don’t know~!

134
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,172
Huuuung~!

135
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,298
Ha!

136
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,857
Hey... thanks, and sorry too.

137
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,569
I’ll take care of it from here.

138
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,786
– Aing~! Don’t know~!
– Ugh, stop it.

139
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,037
Want me to help~?

140
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,290
Ha, seriously...

141
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,546
I thought you went abroad.

142
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,507
– We left from Jeju, toured around Europe,
– and I was hugging a toilet all day from seasickness.

143
00:11:56,507 --> 00:12:00,761
Seriously, he practically lived in the bathroom the whole time.

144
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,105
Oh? Hey, Minwoo! Long time no see. Didn’t expect you to show up.

145
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,524
It’s been so hard to see your face these days.

146
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,110
Who’s that next to you? A friend?

147
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:16,944
Ah—

148
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,321
He’s my boyfriend.

149
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,616
Say hi.

150
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,328
Hello, I’m Son Yooha.

151
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,747
Hello.

152
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,543
– Haha, have a seat, yes.
– Hello.

153
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,128
Make yourself comfortable.

154
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,033
Ah, this is cute. Where did you buy it?

155
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,080
Huh?

156
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,916
Hey, Minwoo, what is this?

157
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,001
Oh... did you always like this kind of stuff?

158
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,669
Why? It looks good on him...

159
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,465
Isn't it normal for couples to have at least one matching item?

160
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,175
Matching item?

161
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,885
Exactly.

162
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,180
Man, I’ve been so busy lately.

163
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,682
We’ve been preparing for our wedding.

164
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,729
But seriously, getting married… it's really not easy.

165
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,856
- It’s not something one person can do alone.
- Yeah, you’re right.

166
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,941
It’s tough.

167
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,819
Minwoo, shouldn’t you get married too?

168
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,783
Yeah, it’s about time you started thinking about it.

169
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,786
Guys like you staying single these days?

170
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,497
People start to look at you funny, you know?

171
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,792
Yesterday, your boyfriend...

172
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,918
I mean—

173
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,170
Just act like you did in front of the bartender.

174
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,550
Of course.

175
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,803
Minwoo and I are so happy together.

176
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,264
Minwoo, tell them.

177
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,849
About how you burned the onions while cooking yesterday.

178
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,768
– The onions.
– Yeah.

179
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,394
Right?

180
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,728
The onions...

181
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,522
Wait, are you two living together?

182
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,315
Cooking?

183
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,775
Minwoo cooks?

184
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,903
Of course! Minwoo is such a great cook

185
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,446
and so cute, too.

186
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,992
How long has it been since we’ve been this lovey-dovey?

187
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,201
Babe?

188
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,786
– Babe...
– Lovey-dovey?

189
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,330
So are you two getting married now?

190
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,790
Marriage?

191
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,166
We should, someday.

192
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,545
But honestly, we’re so happy even without it.

193
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,964
We’re just crazy about being together.

194
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,134
Right, babe?

195
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,307
Wow, Minwoo, you’ve really changed since dating.

196
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,017
– I’ve never seen you like this.
– You two look happy.

197
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,019
Hey, how’s your wedding prep going?

198
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,814
Oh gosh, he’s been obsessed with losing weight lately.

199
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,197
Yooha, great job today.

200
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,908
They’ll take care of spreading the rumor for us now.

201
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,994
That was a huge success.

202
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,464
You can go now.

203
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,183
If you ever need anything else, feel free to contact me anytime.

204
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,666
Taeha, time to go home.

205
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,460
Yeah, let me just finish this.

206
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,884
What’s that outfit?

207
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,969
Did you buy something new?

208
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,348
Oh, this? Someone just gave it to me.

209
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,724
Who?

210
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,061
Looks pretty nice...

211
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,896
Someone. A friend.

212
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,316
I’m going to the bathroom real quick.

213
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,185
