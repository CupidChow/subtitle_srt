1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,420
I need to find him.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,589
Ah, Wait!

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,304
Yooha wanted to protect everything—

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,765
his brother, the bar,

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,227
and you, Minwoo.

6
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:34,242
That night, I sat on a bench in Sunset Park and watched the stars until morning.

7
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,542
JUNG Myeongcheol
as Taeha

8
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,298
YOON Hyunkwon
as Jaemin

9
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,679
LEE Suyeon
as Suyeon

10
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,019
LEE Jaehyeop
as Minwoo

11
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:51,236
KIM Hyunseo
as Yooha

12
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:57,325
Sweetheart Service

13
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:03,289
Chapter 11
Tequila Sunrise

14
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,109
Yooha is waiting for you.

15
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,155
He's waiting?

16
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,658
Like without me,

17
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,869
he can't do anything?

18
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,416
He seems to be doing just fine.

19
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,168
He's managing the bar somehow.

20
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,547
Honestly, I’m kind of proud.

21
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,592
He really is my brother.

22
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,891
But what about you?

23
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,018
Why do you keep showing up and messing with him?

24
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,397
- Messing with him?
- Yooha wants independence.

25
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,900
And now's the perfect time.

26
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,278
He's doing well on his own.

27
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,988
So what are you doing?

28
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,656
Why won’t you just let him go?

29
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,035
Are you really doing this for Yooha?

30
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,622
Then what can you

31
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,041
actually do for him?

32
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,254
Do you even

33
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,298
like Yooha?

34
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,759
See?

35
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,636
You can't even answer.

36
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,305
Coward...

37
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,266
- Excuse me?
- You have a fiancée,

38
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,018
and you're still messing with my brother?

39
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,020
What?

40
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,397
- What...
- What gives you the right?

41
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,629
Taeha, you seem like a really honest person.

42
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,759
That's the first time

43
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,511
I've heard that.

44
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,933
Then let’s be honest with each other.

45
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,274
I...

46
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,485
I'm engaged to Minwoo.

47
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,783
It’s not public yet,

48
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,869
but the people close to us know.

49
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,914
We go way back—

50
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,874
it just sort of happened naturally.

51
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,806
But Yooha

52
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,435
keeps hanging around Minwoo.

53
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,064
He should be by my side...

54
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,486
but sometimes, I feel like he’s wavering because of Yooha.

55
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,700
That makes me anxious.

56
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,582
Don’t you feel the same way, Taeha?

57
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,628
Like Yooha shouldn’t leave your side either?

58
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,652
Did Suyeon tell you that?

59
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,489
- Trying to make excuses now?
- No. I just...

60
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,991
don’t understand.

61
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,577
You don’t understand?

62
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,707
Taeha,

63
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,129
do you really want to know how I feel about Yooha?

64
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,926
Isn’t it obvious?

65
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,638
You’ve got a fiancée, but you’re stringing Yooha along.

66
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,100
Do you believe everything Suyeon says?

67
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,311
- Don’t try to change the subject.
- Suyeon lied.

68
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,408
I like Yooha.

69
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,628
So? You think saying that solves everything?

70
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,382
Do you even realize what you’re doing?

71
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:09,971
You’re forcing your expectations on him. Have you thought about that?

72
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,685
Yooha’s stronger than you think.

73
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,109
He can live just fine without you...

74
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,738
And the one who can’t accept that...

75
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,158
is you, Taeha.

76
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,287
You don’t know anything.

77
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,213
Then...

78
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,592
I can't help you.

79
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,933
Then I’ll...

80
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,896
do what I can for Yooha.

81
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,144
I...

82
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,607
I want to stop.

83
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,951
Do you really understand what you’re saying right now?

84
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,079
Yooha, are you sure?

85
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,622
Yes.

86
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,584
What are you planning to do?

87
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:08,172
Your brother’s bar—he dedicated his whole life to it. It might go up for auction.

88
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,676
And you’re still going to walk away?

89
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,223
Yes.

90
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,475
I’ve made up my mind.

91
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,871
I’m not going to take this money.

92
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,874
What?

93
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,627
Yooha,

94
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,756
I gave you that money just to ease my own conscience.

95
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,052
You did what I wanted, so you should keep it.

96
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,722
Still...

97
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,349
But Yooha,

98
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,768
should I tell you one more thing?

99
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,898
You were completely fooled. By us.

100
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,067
What?

101
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,864
I was on your brother’s side all along.

102
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,287
Don’t be too shocked.

103
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,791
Honestly, I think I wanted to believe it myself.

104
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,046
That I could really make you mine.

105
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,176
But now I know.

106
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,263
I’ll never have you.

107
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,399
Come on. Let’s end this with a handshake.

108
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,570
It got a bit messy, but let’s be clean about it.

109
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,201
Yooha.

110
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,664
I hope you’ll be happy.

111
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,544
I hope you’ll be happy too, Suyeon.

112
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,756
I’ll be fine. I know how to live well.

113
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,260
See you around!

114
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,800
Ha Suyeon

115
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,981
Taeha, I told everything to Yooha.

116
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:17,027
Your little brother... he’s stronger than you think.

117
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,823
Maybe it’s time you started believing in him too.

118
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,583
Taeha.

119
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,010
Taeha… why did you do it?

120
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,516
The bar being in danger…

121
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,188
that was a lie, wasn’t it?

122
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:57,902
Took you long enough.

123
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,987
Why?

124
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,577
I thought you'd stay by my side.

125
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,830
But you didn’t.

126
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,084
You were doing fine...

127
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,213
even without me.

128
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,300
So you lied to me?

129
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,180
If I did nothing,

130
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,975
you would’ve left.

131
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,520
Why would I leave?

132
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,566
I always knew...

133
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,027
this was all just my selfishness.

134
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:42,905
Taeha.

135
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,366
Taeha.

136
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,325
It’s cold.

137
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,536
So let’s go back now.

138
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,791
Yooha...

139
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,752
wake up.

140
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,380
I lied to you.

141
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,590
I tried to trap you.

142
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,468
And still...

143
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,262
you’d forgive me?

144
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,349
Then what does that make me?

145
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,479
You're just...

146
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,066
my brother.

147
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,989
I was angry. I was so disappointed.

148
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,367
But we’re...

149
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,746
family.

150
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,588
So... I can't hate you.

151
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,934
Let’s go together,

152
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,395
Taeha.

153
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,406
Sweetheart Service

154
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,367
Did you enjoy watching Sweetheart Service?

155
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,120
Then you know what to do now.

156
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,208
Go ahead and hit that subscribe button on the STRONGBERRY channel.

157
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,294
If you don't... I might get upset!
