Master, you just sighed.

19
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,645
- Is something wrong?
- Where is Yooha?

20
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:08,897
Yooha...

21
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,525
why do you ask?

22
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,112
I have something to say to Yooha.

23
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,490
Why not just call?

24
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,326
I... um...

25
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:22,911
It’s just...

26
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,374
He’s doing a nude modeling gig.

27
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,711
It should’ve started by now.

28
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,421
Thank you.

29
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,048
Ah...

30
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,802
You met Taeha, right?

31
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,889
Yes.

32
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,768
He’ll come back, won’t he?

33
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,842
Taeha.

34
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,199
Taeha, are you okay?

35
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,377
Without Yooha... I don’t know how to live anymore.

36
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,982
I really...

37
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,818
don’t know.

38
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,990
Then...

39
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,369
I’ll show you how.

40
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,600
Sorry.

41
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,021
I’m really sorry, I just...

42
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,278
Taeha.

43
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,025
- I’ll head in first.
- Okay.

44
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,081
Here... I want you to have this.

45
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,020
This is... me?

46
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,230
Don’t laugh.

47
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,491
I’m sorry.

48
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,418
I hurt you with my thoughtlessness.

49
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,969
I’m sorry too.

50
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,643
I shouldn’t have ended it so abruptly...

51
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,817
You were too much for me.

52
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,905
Just being near you was overwhelming.

53
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,867
I think I broke.

54
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,792
But even so...

55
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,046
being with you made me happy.

56
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,053
You break me...

57
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,764
but I don’t mind being

58
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,893
broken like that.

59
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,487
I want to trust you now.

60
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,907
And I want to

61
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,163
keep seeing your smile.

62
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,168
Even so...

63
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,628
could we?

64
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,318
Are you...

65
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,279
acting right now?

66
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,922
