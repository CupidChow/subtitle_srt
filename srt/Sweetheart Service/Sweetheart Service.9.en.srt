00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,713

Taeha.

11
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:15,677
The last bus isn’t for a while… Do you mind if I wait here?

12
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,057
Huh?

13
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,226
Sure.

14
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,821
Jaemin.

15
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,365
Yeah?

16
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,409
Should I…

17
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,537
tell you a fun story?

18
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,081
What is it?

19
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,310
It was a cold winter day.

20
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,521
There was a boy, covered in bruises.

21
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,157
The boy was always alone.

22
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,743
He felt like…

23
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,954
…the whole world had abandoned him.

24
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,713
Then one day, an angel came and saved him.

25
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,510
All the angel did was smile a little

26
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,099
but that small smile melted all the cold in his heart and body.

27
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,393
It felt like being born again.

28
00:03:54,317 --> 00:04:01,407
But that angel had also been abandoned by God, locked away and in pain.

29
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,579
When the boy saw that, he made up his mind.

30
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,458
That he would never leave the angel alone.

31
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,877
That he would always protect them.

32
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,645
"This is the highest place in the world."

33
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,692
"If we’re here…

34
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,070
…no one can find us."

35
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:49,372
And so the two became a family and lived happily ever after.

36
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,891
Jaemin~

37
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,776
The last bus is about to leave.

38
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,451
Taeha…

39
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,414
I have to go now!

40
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,791
Okay. See you tomorrow.

41
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,147
We’re closed. Come back tomorrow.

42
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,183
JAEMIN

43
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,730
Hello?

44
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,941
Yooha, have you heard from Taeha?

45
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,609
Why?

46
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,194
What’s going on?

47
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:47,573
Taeha didn’t show up for work today.
I’ve been trying to call him but…

48
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,991
He’s not picking up.

49
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,035
So I was wondering if he called you.

50
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,204
What?

51
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:19,457
Jaemin.

52
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,918
Where does this one go?

53
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,878
That corner table!

54
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,527
Here’s your Long Island Iced Tea.

55
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,570
Enjoy!

56
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,780
Whoa!

57
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,383
You’ll have it done by today, right?

58
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,759
- Yes.
- Yes, I can.

59
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,927
Then…

60
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,012
you can go.

61
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,349
- Good work.
- Thanks for your work.

62
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,485
Jeong Minwoo

63
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,113
can we talk for a sec?

64
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,204
Is something wrong?

65
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,249
Actually…

66
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,502
Things have been kind of messy lately…

67
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,965
My ex…

68
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,261
he keeps calling me, showing up at my place.

69
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,555
It’s been kind of scary.

70
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,394
So I want to keep having Yooha play my boyfriend.

71
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,813
I’d like to keep hiring him for that.

72
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,361
Yooha…

73
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,655
he’s a good person.

74
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,411
It's because he's someone Minwoo introduced me to.

75
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,580
Otherwise I don’t want to find someone else.

76
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,291
Honestly, that guy…

77
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,459
he’s pretty great.

78
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,009
Oh, and one more thing.

79
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,219
The project we’re working on now

80
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,763
make sure it ends well.

81
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,433
The investors are counting on it.

82
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,519
What do you mean?

83
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,484
I trusted you with it, so don’t mess it up.

84
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,070
Alright?

85
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,494
Is the bar closed?

86
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,204
President?

87
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,671
Yooha, I’ll be back after taking out the trash.

88
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,425
Is something wrong?

89
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,385
Ah…

90
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,805
It’s just… you didn’t reply.

91
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,518
And I remembered your brother’s bar, so I came by.

92
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,188
But your brother’s not here?

93
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:15,901
No.

94
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,779
Are you okay?

95
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,790
Yooha…

96
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,127
It’s okay. You can talk to me.

97
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,593
My brother…

98
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,638
He disappeared.

99
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,351
He’s missing?

100
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,108
I don’t know…

101
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,904
Did you report it?

102
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,161
So

103
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,082
I’m running the bar for now.

104
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,170
But

105
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,842
a few days ago, I got a notice that

106
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,429
this building is going up for auction.

107
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,184
I…

108
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,231
can’t just let go of this place…

109
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,735
the bar my brother worked so hard to protect.

110
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,451
But… I don’t think there’s anything I can do.

111
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,750
Yooha

112
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,379
I’ll help you.

113
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:01,924
What?

114
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,593
I’ll support you financially.

115
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,263
Enough to stop the auction.

116
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,723
Even for operations.

117
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,103
But there’s one condition.

118
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,444
Let’s make a fake relationship contract. You and me.

119
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,994
Of course, the terms will be much better than Minwoo’s.

120
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,955
Are you really okay?

121
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,424
I think I’ll just stop working part-time for a while

122
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,303
and focus on the bar.

123
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,306
No, I mean you.

124
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,268
Are you *really* okay?

125
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,113
I don’t have another option.

126
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,079
I’m okay.
