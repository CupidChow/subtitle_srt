00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,744
Yooha

6
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,036
Wake up.

7
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,788
Mr. Minwoo

8
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,124
Did you sleep well?

9
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,377
Here, have some.

10
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,838
Thank you!

11
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,351
Minwoo

12
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,604
What is this?

13
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,688
Coffee.

14
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,190
Is it too bitter?

15
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:06,900
It’s salty...

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,609
Huh?

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,570
Maybe you’re still half asleep?

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,863
No, seriously...

19
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,573
Ah…

20
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,160
Maybe that was salt...

21
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,496
They say...

22
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,667
Coffee with sodium chloride is good for your health in the morning.

23
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,294
Sodium chloride?

24
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,046
Salt.

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,049
Oh, of course!

26
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,676
I love salt in the morning, too~!

27
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:37,347
Yeah, I read that in a weekly magazine I often read.

28
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:42,310
You even helped me sleep and now you’re giving me something healthy...

29
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,854
I’ll drink it gratefully.

30
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,961
Yes, Mother.

31
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,715
Phew...

32
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,052
Minwoo, I finished it all.

Chapter 6
Black Russian

40
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,816
Didn’t expect them to ask to meet first...

41
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,693
Sorry?

42
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:18,239
It’s more urgent than I thought. We need to get ready.

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,074
What is it?

44
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,703
My parents want to meet.

45
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,035
Minwoo, is that rumor true?

46
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,123
Yes.

47
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,337
That’s why I brought him.

48
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,424
My boyfriend.

49
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,344
Ha...

50
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:26,724
Your father and I can’t understand what you’re saying.

51
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,935
I'm not asking you to understand.

52
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,901
I...

53
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,864
truly care about Minwoo.

54
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,831
You think you really know our Minwoo?

55
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,252
I haven’t known him long,

56
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:59,549
but there’s something I’ve learned from being with him.

57
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,803
He’s kinder than

58
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,933
anyone I’ve ever met.

59
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,442
I can’t live without him...

60
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,117
Please let me have your precious son!

61
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,594
Excuse me...!

62
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,724
- Here, have another drink.
- Thank you.

63
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,294
No, no.

64
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,838
You have to hold the glass a bit lower.

65
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,966
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

66
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,387
- Cheers.
- Let’s toast.

67
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,853
Yooha, you can really hold your liquor!

68
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,439
A proper young man!

69
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,274
Yes, I can drink!

70
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,860
Great! One more!

71
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,114
- One more shot!
- All right, let’s go!

72
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,074
Cheers.

73
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,493
Phew...

74
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,123
Uh... um...

75
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,751
Shouldn’t we go after her?

76
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,128
Nah, nah.

77
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,505
Don’t worry. Let’s just enjoy ourselves tonight.

78
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,550
Let’s make it a fun and tasty night.

79
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,759
It’s fine.

80
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,927
Cheers.

81
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,679
- Come on, come on!
- Cheers!

82
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,058
Forget everything else, just have fun! Enjoy, enjoy—great!

83
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,105
Minwoo might not say it, but I think he really likes it.

84
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,817
- Well, that’s good for both of you.
- It is.

85
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,820
You two look great together, huh?

86
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,280
Really nice.

87
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,533
- Whew! Wow.
- Minwoo, give us a smile.

88
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,662
- Oh, that smile—it's part of your charm!
- Yes, yes, exactly!

89
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,872
Shall we have another round?

90
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,457
Oh, sounds good!

91
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,344
Drink some water.

92
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,223
Okay.

93
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:03,274
Don’t worry about my mother. That was expected.

94
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,400
Yeah.

95
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,781
But still, I was kind of disappointed.

96
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,379
Your boyfriend… is he doing well?

97
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,967
Boyfriend?

98
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,721
That bartender—he’s not your boyfriend?

99
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,390
Oh, no.

100
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,519
He’s my older brother.

101
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:40,853
Your brother?

102
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,106
Then the ring?

103
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,443
Oh, this? It’s a family ring.

104
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,444
Ah...

105
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,533
Oh… I see.

106
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,311
Those eyes…

107
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,567
Are you acting?

108
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,242
No.

109
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,832
What about you?

110
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,129
What do you think?

111
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,541
No...

112
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,169
Uh... well...

113
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,670
Just for tonight,

114
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,049
sleep on the couch.

115
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,065
I’m fine!

116
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,905
About telling Taeha about you…

117
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,491
I’m really sorry.

118
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:45,204
Taeha kept asking, and he looked so desperate...

119
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,251
It’s not like you did it on purpose.

120
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,672
Even if we tried to keep it a secret, it would’ve come out anyway.

121
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,803
You’re really not mad?

122
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,891
I said I’m fine.

123
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,477
- I’m fine.
- Okay, okay.

124
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,445
When are you coming back?

125
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,322
I will…

126
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,325
But not just yet.

127
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,703
Okay...

128
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,540
I’ll talk to Taeha for you.

129
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,379
Your parents—

130
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,673
Did you meet them okay?

131
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,884
Nothing happened?

132
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,136
Nothing?

133
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,222
“Please let me have your precious son.”

134
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,641
- One more drink.
- Whoa!

135
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,360
Sure~

136
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,946
Sure~?

137
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,158
Hmm...

138
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,536
Hmm?

139
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,747
So there was something.

140
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,749
Huh?

141
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,168
There really was.

142
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:15,878
What?

143
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,505
What happened?

144
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,256
I said nothing happened.

145
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,591
Come on, just tell me.

146
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,092
I said nothing happened.

147
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,386
But something did.

148
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,315
Ha...

149
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,945
What the hell did I just do...

150
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,533
Ah...

151
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,309
Um, Yooha.

152
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:13,811
Yes?

153
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,814
Are you free today?

154
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,483
Ah…

155
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,486
I have a part-time job today.

156
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,404
Oh...

157
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,447
Why? Is something going on?

158
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,993
No, I just... wanted to talk about what’s next...

159
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:38,919
Minwoo.

160
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,212
Then...

161
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,214
Would you like to go draw?

162
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,133
Draw?

163
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,344
You said we were going to draw...

164
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,970
This is cheating...
