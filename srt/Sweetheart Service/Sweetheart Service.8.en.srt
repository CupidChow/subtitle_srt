1
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,894
Minwoo, you must be busy these days. I hardly see you anymore.

2
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,563
Not especially.

3
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,149
Oh please.

4
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,360
That boyfriend I saw outside your office the other day — he was pretty cute.

5
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,155
What did you want to talk about?

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,906
Come on~

7
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,242
Since when can’t we talk about stuff like that?

8
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,244
Don’t be so stiff.

9
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,209
Seriously?

10
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,381
You always said you weren’t interested in dating.

11
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,469
I didn’t think you’d go this far.

12
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,848
Actually…

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,440
I don’t see what’s so funny.

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,734
That’s not like you at all, Jung Minwoo!

15
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,737
Seriously…

16
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,782
[Tae-woong]

17
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,709
Did you fight again?

18
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,755
I’m breaking up with him.

19
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,466
I don’t see a future with him.

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,347
We’ve been together over a year…

21
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,016
and he’s never even mentioned marriage.

22
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,062
He just wants to keep dating forever.

23
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,981
Ugh, so annoying.

24
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,446
But I’m ridiculous too, aren’t I?

25
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,826
Still hanging on even when it’s like this.

26
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,791
Ah…

27
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:07,043
Maybe I should try this fake boyfriend thing too.

28
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,003
So suddenly?

29
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,339
Think about it.

30
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,342
If my boyfriend sees me with another guy…

31
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,261
he’ll go crazy with jealousy.

32
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,347
Maybe he’ll just dump me on his own.

33
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,974
That’s so immature.

34
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,269
You just don’t get it. Love is immature.

35
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,440
Emotions are messy and pathetic…

36
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,111
but that’s what makes us human.

37
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,239
Give me his number.

38
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,283
What?

39
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,951
Yooha’s number.

40
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,744
I want to hire him too.

41
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,079
Are you serious?

42
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,788
Why?

43
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,540
You can and I can’t?

44
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,500
What’s wrong with you?

45
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,545
Are you his guardian or something?

46
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,965
Don’t worry, I’ll treat him nicely.

47
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,468
"I just wanted to earn some money."

48
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,946
Thanks, Minwoo.

49
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,242
What’s that childish furry thing?

50
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,078
Actually, it’s kind of cute.

51
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,966

Chapter 8
Earthquake

58
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,275
Minwoo even bought me this perfume…

59
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,812
Good morning.

60
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,188
Morning…

61
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,113
Well then, I’ll be off now.

62
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,418
Ugh…

63
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,670
Should I not have told her?

64
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:00,943
Hello.

65
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,823
Wow, hello!

66
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,667
Did Minwoo pick that outfit for you?

67
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,586
How did you know?

68
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,589
I know everything.

69
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,054
I bet he picked the perfume too.

70
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,263
Uh, yeah.

71
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,274
Actually, I asked Minwoo for your number.

72
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,236
I needed someone too — a fake boyfriend, that is.

73
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,073
I see.

74
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:53,788
You weren’t offended when he gave me your number, right?

75
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,833
I…

76
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,168
wasn’t offended.

77
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,130
I guess Minwoo trusted you, Director.

78
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,507
I don’t think so.

79
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,177
I think he trusted you more than me.

80
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,221
He believed in you.

81
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,978
Like I said over the phone…

82
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,940
just pretend to be my boyfriend in front of my ex.

83
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,278
He should be here in about an hour.

84
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,863
Okay.

85
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,615
Anything you want to order?

86
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,450
I’m fine with anything.

87
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,995
But your preferences matter too.

88
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,747
Even if it’s just pretense,

89
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,250
I hope we have a good time.

90
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,879
Then I’ll have an Americano.

91
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,840
Americano it is.

92
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,968
Hot or iced?

93
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,511
Iced, please.

94
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,762
Iced? Got it.

95
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,264
Okay.

96
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,724
What about you?

97
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,518
- I'll have the same one.
- Alright.

98
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,440
Shall we go?

99
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,653
Do you like Americanos?

100
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,656
Well… I just drink them.

101
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,700
- Because of the calories.
- Right, the calories.

102
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,994
Really?

103
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,121
Minwoo said that?

104
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,497
He really did.

105
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,124
No way…

106
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,543
Do you know what his nickname was in college?

107
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,879
Robot. He was called a robot.

108
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,963
Oh, really?

109
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,426
Yeah, he can be cold and blunt…

110
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,136
but once you get to know him…

111
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,472
he’s warmer than he seems.

112
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,727
You two seem close.

113
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:40,937
Ah…

114
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,147
Do we really?

115
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,196
I bet you’ve dated a lot.

116
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,491
Not really.

117
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,826
I don’t have money…

118
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,870
and I’ve been too busy saving up.

119
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,207
And… my brother is really strict.

120
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,001
You have a brother?

121
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,088
Sounds like he really cares about you.

122
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,468
Right?

123
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:17,139
But… I think it’s more than just caring.

124
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,478
What does he do?

125
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,147
He runs a cocktail bar.

126
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,067
Wow, that sounds cool.

127
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,445
Tell me where it is. I want to visit sometime.

128
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,450
Do you know Yeonnam-dong? There's a famous dim sum place.

129
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,911
It's on the third floor of the building next to it.

130
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,791
There’s a rose decoration on the railing — you can’t miss it.

131
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,693
Anyway, that’s what he said at the time…

132
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,278
- He was like…
- Hey! Ha Suyeon.

133
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,576
What are you doing here?

134
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,038
Can I help you?

135
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,291
Who’s this?

136
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,878
Is this your new boyfriend?

137
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,924
That’s right.

138
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,302
I’m Suyeon’s boyfriend.

139
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,556
That’s right.

140
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,016
So just go.

141
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,019
- Get lost.
- Hey! You can’t end things like this!

142
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,020
That’s enough.

143
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,023
I’m sure Suyeon has her reasons for this.

144
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,817
Or maybe…

145
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,155
Maybe you didn’t give her enough reason to trust you.

146
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,658
Move aside.

147
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,077
- I said stop it.
- Excuse me!

148
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,203
That’s enough!

149
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,537
Ugh, what now?

150
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,251
Jung Minwoo?

151
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,003
Minwoo?!

152
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,632
Huh?

153
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,343
Who’s this now?

154
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,136
Your boyfriend’s boyfriend?

155
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:19,970
Or…

156
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,222
Ha Suyeon’s…

157
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,099
second boyfriend?

158
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,433
Stop…

159
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,811
Or I’ll call the police.

160
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,978
Go ahead!!!

161
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,108
Call them! I dare you!

162
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,359
Hey—

163
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,069
I said stop!

164
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,262
You were amazing, Minwoo.

165
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,807
Stepping in like that for Yooha…

166
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,142
Director…

167
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,018
this isn’t the time for jokes.

168
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,813
I’m not joking. I mean it.

169
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,191
You were worried about Yooha, weren’t you?

170
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,573
Or… was it me you were worried about?

171
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,916
I’m sorry… for dragging you into this mess.

172
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,170
And thank you.

173
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,550
It’s okay. I just did what I had to.

174
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,720
Let’s go, Yooha.

175
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,181
Already?

176
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,933
I was hoping to hang out a little longer.

177
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,062
Ah…

178
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,564
Scary~

179
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,399
Got it.

180
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,903
See you again, Yooha.

181
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,155
Yes.

182
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,534
Goodbye.

183
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,642
They didn’t have tofu at the convenience store…
So I bought soy milk instead.

184
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,003
I’ll compensate you.

185
00:13:59,004 --> 00:13:59,922
Huh?

186
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,551
It was my fault.

187
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,430
I introduced you to Suyeon.

188
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,854
You don’t have to.

189
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,649
No, I need to make it right.

190
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,527
Do you think money solves everything, Minwoo?

191
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,153
That’s not what I meant…

192
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,367
We have a contract, and because of that…

193
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,913
I think that's my responsibility, too.

194
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,375
I acted inappropriately as the client.

195
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,799
So that’s all we are.

196
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,429
We're just a relationship based on a contract.

197
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,224
Nothing more, nothing less.

198
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,356
I never saw this as a real relationship.
But you…

199
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,109
Yooha, I—

200
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,569
Please stop.

201
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,282
I’m fine.

202
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,619
Just treat me according to the contract…

203
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,372
like how a client would.

Sweetheart Service

206
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,832
Hello, my name is Son Taeha.

207
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,127
I run a small bar, and I’m Yooha’s older brother.

208
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,336
And this young man?

209
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,171
Hello.

210
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,424
I’m Bae Jaemin.

211
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:53,929
I’m Yooha’s schoolmate, and now his closest friend.

212
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,433
I didn’t know it before, but Jaemin is actually really good with his hands.

213
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,436
He’s eager to work and very diligent.

214
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,271
Though he still makes a lot of mistakes.

215
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:06,442
But I think he’ll get better with time,
so I’m looking forward to seeing his growth.

216
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,611
There’s still a lot I need to learn.

217
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,322
And honestly, I’ve made so many mistakes.

218
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:16,368
Lately, Taeha’s been scolding me a lot too.

219
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,995
No, no, that’s…

220
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,582
It’s just because you get so down when you make mistakes.
I’m not actually that angry.

221
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,125
I have high hopes for him.

222
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,004
Honestly, everything he does looks so cool to me.

223
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,174
I want to be like him someday.

224
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,926
You’re doing well already. Don’t be so hard on yourself.

225
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,013
Hearing you say that really reassures me.

226
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,432
But I’ll work even harder.

227
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,100
Please watch me grow.

228
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,436
Yes, please keep an eye on our Jaemin.

229
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,937
- We’re counting on him.
- You too, Taeha.

230
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,564
- I also…
- I was speaking!

231
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,899
You too, Taeha. Watch me.

232
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,400
Bye~
