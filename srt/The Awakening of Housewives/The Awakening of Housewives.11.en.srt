[The Awakening of Housewives]

00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,500
[Episode 11]

3
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,160
Ms. Li,

4
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,010
why are you playing a romance movie?

5
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,880
We need

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,900
to rest sometimes.

7
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,910
Only then can we recharge

8
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
and fight on.

9
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,410
Just thinking about it pisses me off!

10
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,730
Wang Yan

11
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,810
gave the proposal to Jintai

12
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,610
without a company meeting.

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,210
Now Jintai has rejected it,

14
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,810
and we're left helpless.

15
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,810
Yeah.

16
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,170
It's hopeless.

17
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,570
Tomorrow is the partnership launch event.

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,770
Jintai never gives other companies

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,810
a second chance.

20
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,770
Everyone, don't give up.

21
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,970
As long as there's still a sliver of hope,

22
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,570
there's a chance to salvage the situation.

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,370
The problem lies in Wang Yan's proposal.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,210
Now, Mr. Zhao and I

25
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,970
will take full control of the proposal for Jintai.

26
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,770
Let's work hard together.

27
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,970
We must come up with a proposal

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,770
that satisfies Jintai.

29
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:35,970
We can do this!

30
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,030
-We can do this!
-We can do this!

31
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,330
We can do this!

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,700
We can do this!

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,960
What's wrong?

34
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,850
I always feel someone's watching me.

35
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,330
Don't be so paranoid.

36
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,570
Is it because things aren't going smoothly lately?

37
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,010
Bai won't answer my calls.

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,210
So Li Zhiqing has a chance now?

39
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,530
Even if I sabotage the project,

40
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,450
I'll never let her get it.

41
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,650
You've been busy all night.

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,320
Take a break and eat something.

43
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,730
Okay.

44
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,170
Anything else?

45
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,210
Nothing.

46
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,410
If there's nothing, you can go now.

47
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,050
Is anyone here?

48
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,170
You... You're still here?

49
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,250
I heard the company had a blackout,

50
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,690
so I came to check on you.

51
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,010
Come in. Jia is asleep.

52
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,010
I'll go check on her.

53
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:31,930
Tomorrow

54
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,330
is Jia's birthday.

55
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,690
Any progress

56
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,850
on the Jintai proposal?

57
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,140
I still feel it's not good enough.

58
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,490
I haven't found a better angle.

59
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,770
It's not easy to balance work

60
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,770
and your daughter.

61
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,210
Aren't women

62
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,370
all like this?

63
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,050
Back then,

64
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,530
Ms. Bai also faced her husband's infidelity.

65
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,970
She had to work and take care of her child at the same time.

66
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,620
Zhou Ran,

67
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,850
I have an idea.

68
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,770
Remember to show this to him later.

69
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,770
Ms. Bai,

70
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,970
apologies for the intrusion.

71
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,570
Dongqing has come up with a new proposal.

72
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,570
I hope you can take a look at it.

73
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,330
I'm busy with tonight's signing ceremony.

74
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,970
And you should know

75
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,570
Jintai never gives a second chance.

76
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,370
Wang Yan can't represent Dongqing.

77
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,810
I guess you've heard about

78
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,010
what happened to me before.

79
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,530
So,

80
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,690
as a woman,

81
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,010
I hope you can listen to me.

82
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,690
I have a meeting

83
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,570
in three minutes.

84
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,730
The core concept of our previous products

85
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,570
was loving others.

86
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,530
I think that's wrong.

87
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,970
Women should love themselves first.

88
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,370
When people hear terms like housewife

89
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,730
or career woman,

90
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,250
they unconsciously show bias.

91
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,730
But that's not the worst part.

92
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,570
The worst part is losing oneself.

93
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,970
That's why I believe, whether at home or in the workplace,

94
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,010
women should love themselves.

95
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,570
They all deserve to be loved.

96
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,890
Ms. Li,

97
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,970
are you free this after...

98
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,810
I'm free.

99
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,570
Hello, Miss.

100
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,930
Do you have an appointment?

101
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,730
I'm looking for someone.

102
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:08,930
Ms. Bai.

103
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,930
Ms. Bai.

104
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,130
I need to talk to you about something.

105
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,450
My name is Qian Xiaoxuan.

106
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,370
I used to work at Dongqing.

107
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,250
I heard Jintai is about to collaborate with Dongqing,

108
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,680
and the contract will be signed with Ms. Li Zhiqing.

109
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,130
I think

110
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,650
you should reconsider it.

111
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,890
Her affair with Zhao Ninghao

112
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,130
has caused a huge stir in the company.

113
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,850
Moreover,

114
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,730
she frequently steals employees' ideas

115
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,890
and claims them as her own.

116
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,330
If you sign a contract with someone like her,

117
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,730
wouldn't it affect Jintai's reputation?

118
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,690
I think you should

119
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,250
sign a contract with Mr. Wang.

120
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,530
The company will soon be his.

121
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,730
If Jintai collaborates with him,

122
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,570
he's willing to offer an additional 30% profit margin

123
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,970
beyond what Li Zhiqing proposed.

124
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,970
I'm sure you'll have a great partnership.

125
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,260
You...

126
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,360
Ms. Li,

127
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,330
you were right.

128
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,210
Qian Xiaoxuan,

129
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,450
you're really disgusting.

130
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,250
You faked your pregnancy and got exposed,

131
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,170
and now you're here spreading rumors about me.

132
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:27,970
Ms. Bai,

133
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,810
don't listen to her nonsense!

134
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,370
She's trying to mislead you!

135
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,610
Do you know

136
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,970
what I hate the most?

137
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,900
Being a bit hypocritical is nothing.

138
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,110
And being opportunistic is forgivable.

139
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,970
But what I hate the most

140
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,250
is a homewrecker.

141
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,730
Once,

142
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,830
there was a disgusting woman

143
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,530
who tried to ruin my marriage.

144
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,530
Guess how miserable her end was.

145
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,090
Ms. Bai.

146
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,880
Enough.

147
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,130
Just looking at you makes me sick.

148
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,170
Get lost.

149
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,150
Alright, I need to go back to the company.

150
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,050
Ms. Li,

151
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,850
for tonight's signing ceremony,

152
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,210
you should dress up nicely.

153
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,610
Certainly.

154
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,930
-Mom!
-Mom!

155
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,610
Thank you.

156
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,290
You're here.

157
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,930
You look great in this outfit.

158
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,810
It suits you well.

159
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,450
Ms. Bai, have you forgotten?

160
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,570
Last time you said this color suited me,

161
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,770
so I bought it right after I went back.

162
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,850
Looks like I have good taste.

163
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,570
Take your seat.

164
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,130
Please.

165
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:13,930
So,

166
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,970
are you ready?

167
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,130
Today

168
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,250
is our big day.

169
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,250
Thank you all, esteemed executives, for gracing us

170
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,690
with your presence

171
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,970
at Jintai's partnership gala.

172
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,410
As you all probably know,

173
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,330
Jintai and Dongqing

174
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,170
have weathered storms together for over 20 years.

175
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,810
So today

176
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,290
is a big day for Jintai,

177
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,210
and for Dongqing too.

178
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,610
A responsible enterprise

179
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,170
must always prioritize altruism.

180
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,170
After multiple rounds of communication and careful consideration,

181
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,450
Jintai has decided

182
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,770
to continue its partnership with Dongqing.

183
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,770
Despite

184
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,730
the hiccups over the past few months,

185
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,030
Dongqing remains Jintai's

186
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,810
most aligned partner.

187
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,530
In this cutthroat era,

188
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,530
we should not only learn to compete,

189
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,330
but also learn to collaborate.

190
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,250
Collaboration is the cornerstone of success.

191
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,370
It's the driving force that propels us forward.

192
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,450
As the ancients said,

193
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,050
a single thread can't make a cord.

194
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,570
Zhiqing!

195
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,750
Are you alright?

196
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,450
Jia has been kidnapped!

197
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,770
I have to go find her!

198
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,730
But you're about to go on stage.

199
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,450
I'm not signing it!

200
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,450
I'm going to find her!

201
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,130
But...

202
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,210
I'll go with her.

203
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,890
Send me a copy of the video!

204
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,330
The police have already launched a full-scale search.

205
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,490
That guy followed them into the neighborhood

206
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,290
and snatched Jia away.

207
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,330
He's so despicable.

208
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,450
Hello?

209
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,130
Where exactly is Jia?

210
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,090
Tell me.

211
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,570
How much money do you want?

212
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,850
Listen,

213
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,850
if you want your daughter to live,

214
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,370
call Ms. Bai immediately.

215
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,250
Tell her the proposal

216
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,290
is Wang Yan's idea,

217
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,090
you voluntarily give up,

218
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,170
and Wang Yan should sign the contract.

219
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,770
Do you understand?

220
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,050
Okay.

221
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,610
I'll call her right away.

222
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,970
I hope that in the future,

223
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,570
Jintai and Dongqing can continue to work together with sincerity,

224
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,770
explore new market opportunities,

225
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,280
and achieve even greater breakthroughs.

226
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,730
Next,

227
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,410
let's welcome the vice president of Dongqing,

228
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,050
who is also today's signing representative,

229
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,730
Ms. Li Zhiqing, to the stage.

230
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,010
Where is Zhiqing?

231
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,170
Ladies and gentlemen,

232
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,970
good evening.

233
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,050
My wife

234
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,250
has some urgent matters to attend to.

235
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,570
As the acting chairman of the company,

236
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,530
I will sign the contract with Jintai.

237
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,570
Hello? Hello?

238
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,330
I apologize, everyone!

239
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,290
It seems

240
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,770
we're having some technical issues.

241
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,730
We might need a bit of time to fix them.

242
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,970
We've prepared a fine selection of drinks for you all to enjoy.

243
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,570
Take a break.

244
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,410
Ms. Bai,

245
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,260
that proposal

246
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,700
is Wang Yan's idea.

247
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,690
I'm in the middle of something.

248
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,360
Sign the contract with him.

249
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,770
Stop lying to me.

250
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,570
There's no way he could come up with that proposal.

251
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,810
What's really going on?

252
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,250
Hello, Shen.

253
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,570
Check the video now.

254
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,730
You're from the Housing and Construction Bureau.

255
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,490
Help me find out

256
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,770
where this abandoned building is.

257
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,250
I've done what you asked.

258
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,130
What else do you want me to do to release Jia?

259
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,050
Very good.

260
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,170
As for

261
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,770
your daughter's location,

262
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,330
I'll send it to you in five minutes.

263
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,010
Little one, stop crying.

264
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,970
Your dad will come to pick you up soon.

265
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,370
Goodbye.

266
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:20,810
Hello?

267
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,880
Hello?

268
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,050
Talk to me!

269
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,410
Ms. Bai.

270
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,570
The equipment

271
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,050
has been fixed.

272
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,290
We can go on stage now.

273
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,650
I'm afraid Ms. Li

274
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,410
won't come back.

275
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,210
I didn't expect you to be so heartless.

276
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,610
That's your own daughter.

277
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,330
So,

278
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,410
you understand my determination in signing this contract, right?

279
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,770
I have the right to decide who I sign with.

280
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:09,970
So,

281
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,400
don't even think about it.

282
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,370
Ms. Bai.

283
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,970
You have a daughter too, don't you?
