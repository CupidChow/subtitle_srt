[The Awakening of Housewives]

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,490
[Episode 6]

3
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,950
What's going on?

4
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,390
Ms. Li!

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,270
Ms. Li came

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,860
and said she wanted to review the company's financial statements,

7
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,730
but somehow the door got locked

8
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,550
and now there's a fire.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,070
Who has the key to this room in your company?

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,510
No.

11
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,190
Mr. Wang, let's break the door down.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,200
Wait.

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,390
We've got to wait for the fire brigade.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,350
If things get worse,

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,670
who's gonna take the blame?

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,830
I'm the one

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,830
calling the shots here.

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,510
But Ms. Li is still trapped inside.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,430
Yes.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Yes.

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,060
Zhiqing!

22
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,250
Where exactly is Ms. Li?

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,620
I'm here.

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,630
Luckily,

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,470
I still have the company keys,

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,870
otherwise some people

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,150
might forget who's really in charge here.

28
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,950
Are you out of your mind, Li Zhiqing?

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,910
What on earth are you trying to do?

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,870
If it weren't for Mr. Zhao,

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,430
you might have just stood by

32
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,530
and watched me burn to death in there.

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,550
If it wasn't for this approach,

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,150
I probably wouldn't have been able to see you,

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,710
Mr. Wang.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,630
Perfect timing,

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,270
there are some things

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,590
I’ve been meaning to discuss with you.

39
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,840
Go to the meeting room.

40
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,470
Thank you.

41
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,920
It's been a long time since I've been back.

42
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,370
The layout here has changed.

43
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,270
Indeed.

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,110
The person in charge of the company changes,

45
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,180
the layout naturally follows suit.

46
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:16,800
Go ahead.

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,920
What did you want to talk to me about?

48
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,850
Have you really become so impatient with me now?

49
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,370
We've been sleeping

50
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,610
for so many years,

51
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,820
what do you think?

52
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,090
Speak up.

53
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:27,329
What is it?

54
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,290
If you don't say it, I'm leaving.

55
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm very busy.

56
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,160
I want to return to the company.

57
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,630
Are you daydreaming?

58
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,020
On what grounds do you think you can return to the company?

59
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,460
This company was built by my father from the ground up,

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,000
and I hold shares here.

61
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,600
Come on.

62
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,250
Look at everything here.

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,010
The portraits,

64
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,050
the lights,

65
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,930
and the chairs.

66
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,170
What here still has anything to do with you?

67
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,840
Besides, you've been out of the company for so long,

68
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,210
you're out of touch with society.

69
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,370
Your father is lying there, unconscious.

70
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,210
Now, I'm the one calling the shots in the company.

71
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,050
Do you really think I'd let you come back?

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,530
If you don't allow me to return to the company,

73
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,050
I won't agree to the divorce.

74
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,950
Is it up to you to decide whether we divorce or not?

75
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,990
How do you think it will play out in court?

76
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,130
Don't forget,

77
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,050
you're the one who cheated.

78
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,250
Who exactly cheated?

79
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,330
You know it very well yourself.

80
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,430
As for the court,

81
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,980
it operates on evidence.

82
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,250
Do you have any evidence?

83
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,650
You don't,

84
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,170
but I do.

85
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,470
Therefore,

86
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,330
come see me when you've made up your mind about the divorce next time.

87
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,210
I'm very busy.

88
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,780
Have you found anything?

89
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,140
Wang Yan has several identical contracts,

90
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,690
but the amounts in them don't match up.

91
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,130
Okay.

92
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,130
The evidence of his fraudulent accounting

93
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,610
is most likely in the safe,

94
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,290
but none of the passwords you sent me

95
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,050
worked to open it.

96
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,330
He's always been very cautious

97
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,410
and suspicious;

98
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,250
probably no one can guess the password.

99
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,450
So...

100
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,570
Since

101
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,010
we can't open the safe,

102
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,450
let's use this

103
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,310
to force him to bring the evidence out himself.

104
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,330
Are you wearing

105
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,450
that set I like today?

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,880
What do you think?

107
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,490
I can satisfy

108
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,850
all your demands.

109
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,380
Then I'm eager to try...

110
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,450
When can we

111
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,490
stop sneaking around like this?

112
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,090
Isn't sneaking around exciting?

113
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,730
Don't you relish sneaking around?

114
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,650
So when are you going to divorce her?

115
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,090
Only then can I rightfully

116
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,810
share your bed.

117
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,970
Don't worry.

118
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,810
She won't last much longer.

119
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,050
I'll keep tormenting her,

120
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,760
relentlessly.

121
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,690
She can't endure it.

122
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,690
What's wrong?

123
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,490
Go home tonight.

124
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,930
I've agreed to the divorce.

125
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,010
Li Zhiqing has asked to meet me at home tonight;

126
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,610
she's agreed to the divorce.

127
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,580
Don't bother looking.

128
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,590
There's no knife today.

129
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,690
How have you been considering

130
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,010
the divorce?

131
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,290
I've agreed.

132
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,690
Really?

133
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,410
I've thought it over,

134
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,530
One day as a couple, a lifetime of grace.

135
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,040
There's no need to end things unpleasantly.

136
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,370
Let's part on good terms.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,830
Come on,

138
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,210
let's have a farewell drink tonight.

139
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,290
Okay.

140
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,710
I agree to

141
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,090
the divorce,

142
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,570
but before I sign,

143
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,409
there are a few questions I want to ask you.

144
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,600
I hope you'll answer me honestly,

145
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,380
like a man.

146
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,280
Coincidentally,

147
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,530
I have some questions for you too.

148
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,780
You go first then.

149
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,810
Why are you dressed

150
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,310
so seductively today?

151
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,770
What are you trying to do?

152
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,010
You know what I'm trying to do, don't you?

153
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,290
Wearing so little—

154
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,330
isn't it obvious you want to sleep with me one last time?

155
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,330
Wang Yan,

156
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,170
when did you start to change your heart?

157
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,500
It doesn't matter.

158
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,250
My heart

159
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,730
has already returned to you.

160
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,450
Did you start cheating on me after we got married?

161
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,980
When did you start fooling around with Qian Xiaoxuan?

162
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,390
Shh.

163
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,060
It's this scent;

164
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,890
I can't resist it anymore.

165
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,740
When we're done,

166
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,409
we'll sign the agreement.

167
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,130
Wang Yan,

168
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,289
answer my question.

169
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,030
I knew you were testing me.

170
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:44,970
Fine.

171
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,130
I'll tell you the truth.

172
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,650
I've never loved you.

173
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,610
I just thought your family background was good,

174
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,930
and marrying you wouldn't be a loss.

175
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,170
Why not take the opportunity?

176
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,250
Do you really think

177
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,530
Qian Xiaoxuan is better than me?

178
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,370
Wait,

179
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,010
what do you have to compare with her?

180
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,290
She's younger, prettier, and gentler than you.

181
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,930
You're just a useless housewife,

182
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,090
and I'm the only one

183
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,290
who'd put up with a woman like you.

184
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,090
Wang Yan,

185
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,850
I was once young too.

186
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,170
I loved dancing

187
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,740
and hiking,

188
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,810
and I had dreams too.

189
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,380
It's for you

190
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,220
that I've become what I am now.

191
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,960
I gave up everything for you.

192
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,250
I bore your child

193
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,890
and took care of your mother.

194
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,850
I became a housewife for you.

195
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,890
For me?

196
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,210
Every time, it's the same excuse: "for me."

197
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,050
If it's for me, then get a divorce now.

198
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,610
If it's for me, then go die right now.

199
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,290
Wang Yan, how could you treat me like this?

200
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,820
Cheating,

201
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,210
framing me for infidelity,

202
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,850
transferring all my money,

203
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,890
and now trying to destroy the company my father built from scratch.

204
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,530
How have I wronged you?

205
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,160
How has my father wronged you?

206
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,770
I've been more than merciful to you!

207
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,690
You're just as hypocritical as your father.

208
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,170
You've always looked down on me,

209
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,570
treating me like a freeloading good-for-nothing,

210
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,370
yet you keep saying it's all for me.

211
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,010
And your father—

212
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,530
doesn't he relish acting like some almighty figure?

213
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,770
Lording over me,

214
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,490
looking down with pity,

215
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,510
expecting my

216
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,370
endless gratitude,

217
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,570
treating me like some obedient pet

218
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,010
groveling at his feet.

219
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,890
So

220
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,130
So, you want revenge on him?

221
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,170
You want to destroy the company he built from scratch?

222
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,130
Yes.

223
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,760
I do want revenge on him.

224
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,810
Not only do I want to take away his company,

225
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,770
but I also want him to disappear from my sight.

226
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,890
That's why I made him fall...

227
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,050
What did you say?

228
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,530
Falling from power

229
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,750
to the lowest point in life—

230
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,490
what else could it be?

231
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,090
You pushed him down, didn't you?

232
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,870
You pushed him down, didn't you?

233
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,650
Stop slandering me.

234
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,100
It was you!

235
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,680
Stop slandering me.

236
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,010
It was his own carelessness, it has nothing to do with me.

237
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,970
Wang Yan,

238
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,610
do you believe in retribution?

239
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,650
Retribution?

240
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,650
Where is it?

241
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,610
It will come.

242
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,010
Li Zhiqing,

243
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,650
all this talk of retribution

244
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,130
is just a lie

245
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,170
that losers tell themselves

246
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,580
to feel better.

247
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,440
[I know you've been cooking the books at the company.]
