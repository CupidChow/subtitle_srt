[The Awakening of Housewives]

2
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,530
[Episode 15]

3
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,650
Well, Ms. Li...

4
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,770
If there's nothing else,

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,810
I'll get back to work.

6
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,830
Get me the recent surveillance videos about goods delivery.

7
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:56,990
Ms. Li.

8
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,910
I'm sorry,

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,790
but this surveillance camera

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,830
broke down a few days ago

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,910
and hasn't been repaired yet.

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,780
There must be something wrong with that director.

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,470
This surveillance camera is broken at this time

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,030
so coincidentally.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,610
Moreover, just now, it seemed that

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,270
Mr. Xu

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,830
wanted to tell me something, too.

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,060
But he seemed quite wary of this director.

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,000
How about this?

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,080
I'll go investigate them.

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,550
This must be Wang Yan's plot.

22
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,640
He has used such despicable means.

23
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,660
It's obvious that he's trying to destroy me.

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,470
I've noticed that your state has been so bad lately.

25
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:31,740
You have to rest well.

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,640
So you're still keeping

27
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,660
this stone?

28
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,200
I remember that when we were in college,

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,229
you were the only junior fellow student in my club.

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,750
Once we had an activity at the beach.

31
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,910
I thought it looked quite good,

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,870
so I brought it back.

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,550
That activity

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,430
seemed quite enjoyable.

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,950
I think so, too.

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,840
[Dongqing goes to hell]

37
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,510
Let's go.

38
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,910
Ms. Li.

39
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,390
Things are out of control now, huh?

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,710
Do you know how many companies

41
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,830
want to terminate their contracts with us?

42
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,660
Ms. Bai called me just now.

43
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,790
She has said that if this issue isn't solved,

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,790
we'll have to pay compensation.

45
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,590
Do you know how much that would cost?

46
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,060
All the recalled products have been randomly inspected by a third-party agency,

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,790
and no issues were found.

48
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,750
What does that mean?

49
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,790
It means that

50
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,510
someone is trying to frame us.

51
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,310
As for who this despicable person is,

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,160
I will definitely find him.

53
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,280
It's useless to say these things now.

54
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,030
Aren't you the one who caused this trouble?

55
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,420
If we want to save the company,

56
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,590
shouldn't someone

57
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,180
apologize publicly,

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,750
take the blame and resign?

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,150
That's right.

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,310
If this matter can't be handled properly,

61
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,790
the best way to minimize the impact

62
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,590
is asking the person in charge

63
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,480
to apologize

64
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,510
and resign.

65
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,770
Stop drinking.

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,840
Is it helpful for you to be like this?

67
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,269
No, it's not.

68
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,630
But at least I can numb myself.

69
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,630
Stop harming your own health like this.

70
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,480
Isn't this exactly what Wang Yan wants to see?

71
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,320
Then what should I do?

72
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,240
I...

73
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,060
I've looked into it.

74
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,050
That person is Wang Yan's high school classmate.

75
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,530
There must be something fishy between them.

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,990
We can start with him in the investigation.

77
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,710
Let's investigate him!

78
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,630
Hello.

79
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,870
Make sure that the driver keeps his mouth shut.

80
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,870
If he dares to say a word,

81
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,990
I'll make him regret it.

82
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,440
Are you sure you heard it clearly?

83
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,310
Yes, I'm sure.

84
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,960
It looks like this driver

85
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,310
must know something.

86
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,870
Were you trying to tell me something that day?

87
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,030
Now

88
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,990
there's no one else here.

89
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,590
Nothing.

90
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,150
When they took action that day,

91
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,870
did you see it?

92
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,460
If you tell me the truth,

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,790
I can protect you.

94
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,690
But if you withhold information,

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,070
it won't be as simple as just getting fired.

96
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Make a choice yourself.

97
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,030
When I was drinking water that day,

98
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,090
I accidentally saw

99
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,110
the director putting something on the truck.

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,110
He also took

101
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,350
a sum of money from someone.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,470
I don't know what he put there.

103
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,550
I even recorded a video.

104
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,110
Okay.

105
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,390
I'm going to start a live stream

106
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,470
to clarify this matter.

107
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,909
Are you willing to appear on camera to testify?

108
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,500
So she took the bait?

109
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,620
She said she would start a live stream

110
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,100
and asked me to explain everything.

111
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,870
Okay.

112
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,650
Then while she's live streaming it,

113
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,930
you can insist that

114
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,200
she ordered her employees

115
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,990
to make these toxic products.

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,760
So it's done?

117
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,040
It's done.

118
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,520
When Li Zhiqing starts a live stream to explain it,

119
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,990
the person whom she has brought to testify

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,270
will turn against her in the end.

121
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,950
The effect of the show

122
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,150
will definitely be explosive.

123
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,640
By that time,

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,330
she'll be doomed completely.

125
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,909
No matter how she tries to salvage the situation,

126
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,710
it will be too late.

127
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,710
Don't be nervous later.

128
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,150
Just tell everyone the truth.

129
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,080
Okay.

130
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,140
How many people are there now?

131
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:02,870
It has just been opened.

132
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,070
There are already over 3,000 people now.

133
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,790
The number of people is still increasing.

134
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,310
Then let's begin.

135
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,150
Okay.

136
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,690
Hello, everyone.

137
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,360
I am the CEO of Dongqing,

138
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,310
Li Zhiqing.

139
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,030
I'm very sorry that

140
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,350
the recent incident involving Dongqing

141
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,230
has caused trouble for everyone.

142
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,590
However,

143
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,830
I have to personally clarify it here.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,950
We've inspected all the recalled products

145
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,950
and the returned goods.

146
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,990
The pass rate is all 100%.

147
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,049
These are two reports from the most authoritative

148
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,110
institutions in our country.

149
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,409
The facts prove that

150
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,309
someone has framed our Dongqing.

151
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,950
Our Dongqing has been established for nearly 20 years,

152
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,890
and we have never had any product issues.

153
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,470
Those so-called defective products

154
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,470
were counterfeited by someone.

155
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,470
Today,

156
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,990
we've invited an employee here.

157
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,950
He is

158
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,950
a delivery driver.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,230
He witnessed someone

160
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,390
deliberately mixing those so-called

161
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,850
defective products with our goods.

162
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,230
My...

163
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,580
My name is Xu Jiaming.

164
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,810
I'm a truck driver in this factory.

165
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,190
That night,

166
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,320
a man put someone else's products

167
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,820
into our product boxes indeed.

168
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,520
All of this was Li Zhiqing...

169
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,190
Ms. Li...

170
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,090
She...

171
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,960
She...

172
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,410
She didn't know about it.

173
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,740
She was framed.

174
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,110
It was all done by that director.

175
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,390
There was also a woman.

176
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,870
She gave me a large sum of money

177
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,630
and asked me to frame Ms. Li

178
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,670
and Dongqing.

179
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,670
If you don't believe me...

180
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,760
If you don't believe me, take a look at this.

181
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,380
You must have been exposed.

182
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:01,990
Wang Yan

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,590
deliberately said that in front of you

184
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,550
just to lure us to find that driver.

185
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,010
They must have planned this together.

186
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,150
Then what should we do next?

187
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,670
We'll play along with their plan.

188
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,740
I've already looked into it.

189
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,550
Wang Yan gave you some money.

190
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,070
Your father is in hospital now

191
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,630
and needs this money for surgery.

192
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
That's why you agreed to his request.

193
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,590
Perjury might lead to a prison sentence of several years.

194
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,030
You can look it up.

195
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,060
When you're in prison,

196
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,680
who will take care of your father?

197
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,390
Ms. Li,

198
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,990
what do you want me to do?

199
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,070
The above situation and related materials

200
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,510
have been submitted to the police by our company.

201
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,030
We'd like to ask the public to continue following the developments of this case

202
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,030
and support us.

203
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,510
Thank you.

204
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,770
Answer the phone.

205
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,920
Answer the phone now!

206
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,950
Hello.

207
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,270
What should we do now?

208
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,670
Don't worry.

209
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,430
I've already arranged everything.

210
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,270
I've got something on that director.

211
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,070
He won't reveal anything.

212
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,120
How could he do such a thing?

213
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,790
Li Dashui.

214
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,550
You posted false information online

215
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,390
and asked Internet trolls to damage others' reputations.

216
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,790
You're suspected of defamation and provoking trouble.

217
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,950
Please come with us to assist in the investigation.

218
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,670
Let's take him away.

219
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,700
I'm currently in the production workshop.

220
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,450
From now on, all production processes

221
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,990
will be made transparent and public to everyone.

222
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,110
Currently,

223
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,390
our second batch of products

224
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,550
has already been pre-sold.

225
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,310
All the employees

226
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,270
of our company and I

227
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,790
are using the products we've manufactured by ourselves,

228
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,710
so there are no quality issues at all.

229
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,470
All of you can now place orders without any worry.

230
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,670
[Stay True to Our Original Aspirations and Forge Ahead]

231
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,550
You've

232
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,930
quite underestimated

233
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,110
your wife who is a housewife.

234
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,310
Doing business

235
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,790
is just like fighting in a battlefield.

236
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,030
Arrogant soldiers

237
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,110
are bound to fail.

238
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,790
Mr. Gu.

239
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,270
Only you can help me now.

240
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,820
I do want to help you.

241
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,590
But haven't you said that

242
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,190
I'll retire soon?

243
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,030
It's not appropriate for me to get involved in this mess

244
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,670
right before I retire, is it?

245
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,950
I understand.

246
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,800
But you've dedicated your entire life to the company.

247
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,090
I know the chairman has always coveted your shares.

248
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,350
If this matter isn't solved,

249
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,830
can you truly enjoy your life after retirement?

250
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,770
I was right about you.

251
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,070
Do a good job.

252
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:27,850
In the future,

253
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,960
it will be the world of you young people.

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,790
So,

255
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,710
you've agreed to help me?

256
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,710
This is not helping you.

257
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,590
This is collaboration.

258
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,770
Collaboration.

259
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,070
How do you think we should collaborate

260
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,070
to drive Li Zhiqing away?

261
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,190
She has merely signed a contract with Jintai, hasn't she?

262
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,310
I have an even better project.

263
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,230
As long as you help me get it,

264
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,110
I'll find a way

265
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,310
to help you regain that position.

266
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,350
Mr. Gu.

267
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,710
What do you need me to do?

268
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,950
Isn't there a considerable

269
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,350
amount of funds in your hands?

270
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,230
I...

271
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,550
Mr. Gu.

272
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,550
You must be joking.

273
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,150
I don't have any funds.

274
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,390
Although I don't interfere

275
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,950
in the company's accounts,

276
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,230
the dirty tricks in them

277
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,950
can't be hidden from me.

278
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,590
Do I need to explain further who has pocketed those several

279
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,990
unaccountable accounts?

280
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,670
Since you want me to help you,

281
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,510
you should be completely honest with me.

282
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,750
Can you defeat

283
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,750
your wife with your own power?

284
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,830
Let me think about it further.

285
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,750
Alright.

286
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,670
Take your time to think.

287
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,910
Think it through carefully.

288
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,670
However, this good project

289
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,070
won't wait for anyone.

290
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,070
This might be your last chance.
