00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,490
From the leaked video,

5
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,120
the two were seen leaving a bar together,

6
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,300
getting into a car, and heading to a hotel

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,550
while displaying intimate behavior.

8
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,090
They did not return for the night.

9
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,620
I want to go home.

10
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,400
Ms. Li,

11
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,010
this is your home.

12
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,760
No.

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,610
I want to find my husband.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,850
Tonight,

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,480

00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,470
let me explain.

20
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,220
Eat.

21
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,710
It's not what they're saying online.

22
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,910
Let's talk after you finish eating.

23
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,040
Didn't you go looking for Qian Xiaoxuan

24
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,990
yesterday?

25
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,990
Yesterday,

26
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,390
I was just drinking with Xiaoxuan.

27
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,280

Zhiqing!

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,850
Today is really bad timing,

30
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,150
I have something to do later.

31
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,150
Let's meet next week as planned.

32
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,890
Okay.

But...

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,280
But she was called back to the company midway to revise a document.

36
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,040
I...

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,820
I was just about to leave,

38
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,820
but then...

39
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,320
Ms. Li,

40
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,250
long time no see.

41
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,450
Who are you?

42
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,350
I'm Chen Xiao.

43
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,350
Don't you remember me?

44
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,650
We met on a project a few years ago.

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,390
Come on,

46
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,380
let me buy you a drink.

47
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,130
Ms. Li,

48
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,350
what have you been busy with lately?

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,890
I'm sorry,

50
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,530
but I need to leave now.

51
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,610
Ms. Li,

52
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,510
you seem to have had too much to drink.

53
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,840
Let me take you home.

54
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,300
Come on.

55
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,030
So that guy named Chen Xiao…

56
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,020
He actually

57
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,930
drugged my drink!

58
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,230
Who are you trying to fool?

59
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:43,810
It's obvious that

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,230
you were sleeping with him.

61
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,360
How could you be so shameless?

62
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,070

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,920
It's okay.

66
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,140
Go back to your room and wait for Mom.

67
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,340
I'll take you back.

68
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,170
What's wrong?

69
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,670
Are you afraid she will hear?

70
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,900
If you don't want the kid to hear,

71
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,070
then don't do such shameless things!

72
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,240
Mom,

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,300
look at what you're saying in front of the child!

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,350
What did I say?

75
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,490
Think about what you've done!

76
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,780
You couldn't even give birth to a son—

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,640
fine, whatever.

78
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,180
But now you're cheating on my son?

79
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,670

80
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,170

You know best in your heart whether you did or not.

95
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,630
Mom sees me that way,

96
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,400
but how can you see me the same way?

97
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,160
Have I ever treated you badly

98
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,770
all these years?

99
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,360
You slept with another man;

100
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,120
is that how you repay me?

107
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,240
it's all my fault.

108
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,700
If only I hadn't left a little earlier, none of this would have happened.

109
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,850
It's my fault.

110
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,340
I shouldn't have drunk that glass of wine.

111
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,200
How's your husband reacting now?

112
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,240
He won't listen to anything I say now,

113
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,870
all he wants is to divorce me.

114

How could he be like this?

115
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,100
After so many years of marriage,

116
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,430
doesn't he have any feelings left?

117
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,330
I'll go find Wang Yan

118
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,590
and explain it to him face to face.

119
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,990
It's no use, Xiaoxuan.

120
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,280
Only by finding evidence

121
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,770
can I prove my innocence now.

122
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,740
I've tried contacting Chen Xiao,

but his phone has been turned off.

124

I also reached out to his colleagues at the company,

125
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,530
and they said he resigned a long time ago.

126
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,370
I must find him.

174
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,100
