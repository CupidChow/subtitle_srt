[Episode 14]

3
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,980
I'll go with you.

4
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,660
Okay.

5
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,470
Boss, it's time.

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,270
Both parties can start signing the contract now.

7
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,060
Did you bring everything?

8
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,250
Where's the official seal?

9
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,560
Hand it over.

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,400
Wait a little longer.

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,039
It's not time yet.

12
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,030
We're about to take over Jintai.

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,110
Do you still care about those few shares and a position?

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:32,860
Thank you.

15
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,090
You're playing me.

16
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,950
In her box,

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,620
there's no real official seal either, right?

18
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,550
Auntie, we will be there soon.

19
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
This way, Mr. Jin.

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,270
Ms. Li.

21
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,030
This is our Mr. Jin.

22
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,360
This is Ms. Li from Dongqing.

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,829
Hello.

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,670
Hello, Ms. Li.

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,160
I'm sorry, Mr. Jin,

26
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,150
you can't sign the contract.

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,670
She doesn't even have the company seal.

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,030
Son.

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,680
Mom brought it for you.

30
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,329
Not too late, I hope?

31
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,170
Mr. Jin.

32
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,030
Please.

33
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,290
-Please.
-Let's go.

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,430
Why are you here?

35
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,740
I...

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,150
Mr. Jin,

37
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,880
it's been a pleasure working with you.

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,079
Ms. Li, it's been a pleasure working with you.

39
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,370
The response to this batch of products has been excellent.

40
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,990
Sales have been consistently increasing.

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,670
Customer reviews of our products

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,590
have also been very positive.

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,990
So, moving forward,

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,710
we want to focus on online marketing.

45
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,110
Through methods like livestreaming,

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,310
we aim to expand our market.

47
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,350
Very good.

48
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,350
It seems

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,470
I have a good eye,

50
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,990
both in selecting products

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,870
and in choosing people.

52
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,390
Ms. Bai seems quite happy today.

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,790
It looks like everything is fine with Jintai.

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,590
Yes, indeed.

55
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,620
The company has finally gotten on track now.

56
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,550
Next,

57
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,270
we should seize the time to deal with Wang Yan.

58
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,810
I've looked into Chen Xiao.

59
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,750
He owes a large sum of money to someone called Wen.

60
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,430
This Wen has connections everywhere.

61
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,829
He's looking for Chen Xiao everywhere now.

62
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,950
We must find Chen Xiao.

63
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,950
I have a friend who's quite close to Wen.

64
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,430
He said

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,790
as soon as there's any news about Chen Xiao,

66
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,910
he'll notify us immediately.

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,870
You seem to have quite a lot of friends.

68
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,630
Zhou Ran.

69
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,980
You called for me, Mr. Wang?

70
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,160
Come to my office for a moment.

71
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,950
It's nothing.

72
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,600
Your work performance has been good lately.

73
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,630
I appreciate you.

74
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,030
If one day,

75
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,190
I return to my old office,

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,030
I won't forget about you.

77
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,140
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

78
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,100
Zhou Ran,

79
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,180
on the day of the signing ceremony,

80
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,040
I heard from my mother that you went to see her.

81
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,310
Your mother came to the company once before.

82
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,870
I noticed her legs weren't in good condition.

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,630
I happened to be buying some health supplements for my mother,

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,710
so I brought some for your mother as well.

85
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,030
That's very thoughtful of you.

86
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,640
Mr. Wang, you're so kind to me.

87
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,180
It's the least I can do.

88
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,350
Well,

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,400
did you say anything to her?

90
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,520
No,

91
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,320
I didn't say much.

92
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,030
Auntie asked me some questions about the company,

93
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,630
and I just told her the truth.

94
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,390
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

95
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,710
Was I out of line?

96
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,909
I won't talk about company matters to outsiders anymore.

97
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,870
No, no, it's fine.

98
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,470
If there's nothing else, I'll be going now.

99
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,290
Zhou Ran,

100
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,950
which university did you graduate from?

101
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,440
Why do I

102
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,030
feel like I've seen you somewhere before?

103
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,830
Zhou Ran.

104
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,909
You must be mistaken.

105
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,460
I went to university in my hometown.

106
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,270
After graduation, I came to Dongqing.

107
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
Then I must have remembered incorrectly.

108
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,870
Zhou Ran,

109
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,040
from the first time I saw you,

110
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,350
I've particularly admired you.

111
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,640
Mr. Wang.

112
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,220
Come in.

113
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,740
Mr. Wang,

114
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,840
there are some documents here that need your signature.

115
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,770
Thank you for your trouble.

116
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,220
I won't give up.

117
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,490
That Zhou Ran

118
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,110
really has a problem.

119
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,080
You should have trusted a woman's intuition earlier.

120
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,390
From the moment she interviewed for the executive assistant position,

121
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,070
I felt something was off about her.

122
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,790
I guess

123
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,190
she's a pawn planted by Li Zhiqing

124
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,030
at my side.

125
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,200
So when do you plan to expose her?

126
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,240
What's the rush?

127
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,060
Let's take it slow.

128
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,710
Not urgent yet?

129
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,790
Now Li Zhiqing and Jintai

130
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,430
are going full steam ahead.

131
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,750
Do you think Dongqing

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,590
will still have a place for you?

133
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,990
She thinks she can rest easy now that she's signed with Jintai.

134
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,230
How naive.

135
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,470
I'll make you watch

136
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,430
how she step by step

137
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,710
gives that position back to me.

138
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,760
Hey, where are you now?

139
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,680
A new batch of products is ready for shipment.

140
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,030
I need to go to the factory to keep an eye on things.

141
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,270
Don't go yet.

142
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,270
Chen Xiao has shown up.

143
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,430
I'll send you the location now.

144
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,270
Let's hurry over there.

145
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,670
The creditors will be here soon.

146
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:32,990
Okay.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,230
I'm heading there right away.

148
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,190
Trying to run?

149
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,550
Where do you think you're going?

150
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,570
Bro.

151
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,270
Wen.

152
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,290
Mr. Xiao,

153
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,870
there's nothing wrong with owing money.

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,310
I owed money when I was playing the stock market before.

155
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,630
But as a person,

156
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,270
you've got to follow some rules, right?

157
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,030
You hiding like this,

158
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,590
isn't it a bit inappropriate?

159
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,070
Wen... Wen,

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,230
I'll definitely pay back the money.

161
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,750
I'll go make a phone call.

162
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,830
I'll have them bring the money over.

163
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,070
The person you mentioned,

164
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,950
is it Mr. Wang?

165
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,230
How do you know?

166
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,590
What a coincidence,

167
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,710
today,

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,390
he's the one who told me about your whereabouts.

169
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,110
What?

170
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,730
You've made it quite difficult for me to find you.

171
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,440
Bro,

172
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,990
bro,

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,150
bro, bro, bro, no,

174
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,570
bro, bro, bro,

175
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,590
I'll pay back the money,

176
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,830
I'll definitely pay back the money.

177
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,270
When?

178
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,030
Give me a definite answer.

179
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,830
Stop!

180
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,820
His debt,

181
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,350
I'll pay it back for him.

182
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,350
You've got some good connections, young man.

183
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,870
Everyone's rushing to pay your debts.

184
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,550
We live in a society governed by law now.

185
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,350
This kind of behavior isn't appropriate, is it?

186
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:30,830
Wen,

187
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,870
let's do as Ms. Li says.

188
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,790
Don't worry,

189
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,110
we'll cover the money.

190
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,310
That's straightforward.

191
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,510
Let's go.

192
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,750
Ms. Li,

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,920
pass me the drink.

194
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,510
I'll drink it.

195
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,710
I need a drink to calm my nerves.

196
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,620
Ms. Li,

197
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,670
Ms. Li,

198
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,510
it's about your daughter, isn't it?

199
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,390
The blood on her face is mine.

200
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,710
Wang Yan told me to do it.

201
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,870
I didn't touch your daughter.

202
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,710
You can go tell that to the police yourself.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,750
No, no, no.

204
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,500
Sis, sis,

205
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,610
Ms. Li, Ms. Li,

206
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,030
no matter what you want me to do,

207
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,950
I'll do it.

208
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,350
Then I can hold off on calling the police for now.

209
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,640
But,

210
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,310
you must help me record a video.

211
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,750
Wang Yan.

212
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,240
I won't interfere with Chen Xiao's affairs anymore.

213
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,550
Take care of yourself.

214
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,550
Li Zhiqing.

215
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,470
You just wait.

216
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,270
Guys,

217
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,470
handle with care.

218
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,870
Don't bump or knock anything.

219
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,990
Come on, there's another box here.

220
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,870
Put it on top.

221
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,510
Okay.

222
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,790
Exposing Dongqing Company's toxic underwear

223
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,750
and toxic sanitary napkins.

224
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,750
Do they love women or harm women?

225
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,870
Dear friends,

226
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,470
today, Shui, the anti-counterfeiting king,

227
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,270
is going to expose a company with extremely reprehensible behavior.

228
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,190
According to first-hand information I've received,

229
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,180
Dongqing Company's female products

230
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,070
have been found to contain toxic substances.

231
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,670
It's highly likely...

232
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,550
Pay attention to what I'm saying,

233
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,190
it's highly likely

234
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,430
to cause cancer.

235
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,130
Ms. Li,

236
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,310
what's the situation now?

237
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,860
Rumors are flying all over the internet.

238
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,230
I'm sorry, Ms. Bai,

239
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,610
I just saw the news myself.

240
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,030
How about this?

241
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,650
I'll go to the company first to find out what's going on,

242
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,040
and I'll get back to you later, okay?

243
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,270
Everyone, please calm down.

244
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,740
Calm down.

245
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,550
I will definitely give everyone an explanation.

246
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:41,990
Ms. Li.

247
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,550
There are many negative rumors about our company circulating online today,

248
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,390
and now there are many troublemakers here.

249
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,190
Something seems fishy.

250
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,870
Please step back.

251
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,910
Make way.

252
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,270
Dear customer, regarding the issue you reported,

253
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,270
we have recorded it.

254
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,710
Alright, alright. Please don't be angry.

255
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,470
We have received the issue you reported.

256
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,580
We will definitely resolve it.

257
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,190
What's going on?

258
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,470
These products really have issues?

259
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,470
I contacted the testing company.

260
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,350
They said,

261
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,550
someone paid them to issue a test report.

262
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,750
But those products

263
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,910
did indeed come from our workshop.

264
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,310
That's impossible.

265
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,710
I personally checked all the raw materials.

266
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,550
This kind of thing couldn't possibly happen.

267
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:24,850
Let's issue a statement first,

268
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,590
saying we're doing our utmost to investigate.

269
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,030
Try to calm down the public opinion.

270
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,860
Stop all shipping channels.

271
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,470
Recall all the products

272
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,470
that have been sold.

273
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,350
Request a third-party agency to conduct testing.

274
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,470
And report to the police as soon as possible.

275
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,550
Okay.

276
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,310
As for the disturbance at the door,

277
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,270
I've already called the police.

278
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,270
We'll go to the factory later

279
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,670
to find out which workshop

280
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,550
these problematic products

281
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,510
came from.

282
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,310
There must be something wrong here.

283
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,750
[Heartless capitalist]

284
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,060
Director,

285
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,450
you've been overseeing all the shipments these past few days, right?

286
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,630
Yes, I was worried something might go wrong.

287
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,550
I waited until the last batch of goods was loaded onto the truck,

288
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,750
only then did I clock out.

289
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,920
Here's the shipping manifest you requested.

290
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,290
Hello?

291
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,630
Mr. Xu.

292
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:37,990
Yes?

293
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,670
Did you deliver the previous batch of goods?

294
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,670
Were there any issues during transport?

295
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,670
Ms. Li,

296
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,670
we have clear regulations.

297
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,830
Except for traffic lights,

298
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,110
stopping is not allowed.

299
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,870
If you don't believe me,

300
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,790
it's all recorded on the dash cam.

301
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,110
Goodbye.

302
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,670
May I take a look?

303
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,310
Well, Ms. Li...
