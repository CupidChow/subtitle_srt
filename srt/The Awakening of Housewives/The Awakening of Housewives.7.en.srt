[The Awakening of Housewives]

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,340
[Episode 7]

3
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,670
As you expected,

4
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,830
he's very nervous.

5
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,150
Have you made up your mind?

6
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,870
Revenge is nothing easy.

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,070
Even with just one wrong move,

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,470
you might end up ruining yourself.

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,629
For my father,

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,630
the company he dedicated his life to,

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,270
and Jia,

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,510
I can't let this scumbag

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,870
ruin everything.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,750
But...

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,350
it will be very difficult for you.

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,670
Compared to betrayal,

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,550
difficulty means nothing.

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,750
Count me in.

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,030
Let's take down Wang Yan together.

20
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,780
So boring.

21
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,500
Why are you so distracted today?

22
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,540
Someone's onto us.

23
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,060
They know about the fake accounts.

24
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,060
If this person really has solid evidence,

25
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,730
he wouldn't have played a trick like this.

26
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,620
Could it just be a prank?

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,520
What if he does have something?

28
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,780
We'll both end up in jail.

29
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,329
We need to destroy those accounts now.

30
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,780
Could it be Li Zhiqing, that old hag?

31
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,980
Her?

32
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,220
Does she even have the brains for this?

33
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,190
Whether it's her or not,

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,079
I'll

35
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,460
settle a score with her tomorrow.

36
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,160
Are you blind? Do you even know how to drive?

37
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,420
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,980
Did I hit the child?

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,520
This is a school zone!

40
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,020
Don't you know you should slow down?

41
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,420
People like you should have their licenses revoked!

42
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,060
Isn't this Jia's mother?

43
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,660
Yes,

44
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,500
Jia is in the same class as your child.

45
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,860
No wonder.

46
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,860
Today's my unlucky day.

47
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,890
Let's go, baby. We're going home.

48
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,710
Baby,

49
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,680
from now on, if you see this woman,

50
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,700
stay away from her.

51
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,380
And

52
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,940
don't play with Jia anymore, understand?

53
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,500
Why, Mom?

54
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,350
Their family is dirty.

55
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,500
Let's go.

56
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,610
Madam,

57
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,250
where's Jia?

58
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,530
I don't see her.

59
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,810
Wasn't she picked up by someone you sent?

60
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,650
What?

61
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,370
Here.

62
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,610
Bye bye.

63
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,290
See you tomorrow.

64
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:11,970
Right here.

65
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,050
Goodbye, Madam.

66
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,730
Sorry.

67
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,970
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

68
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,210
Please try again...

69
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,490
Sorry.

70
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,130
The number you have dialed...

71
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,370
Jia,

72
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,510
do you want some candy?

73
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,170
Tell me if you want some.

74
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,460
Oops.

75
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,050
How could I forget?

76
00:04:58,409 --> 00:04:59,930
Jia can't speak.

77
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,810
-Little mute!
-Little mute!

78
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,970
You kids,

79
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,570
how could you say that to Jia?

80
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,850
It's okay, Jia.

81
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,810
Come on.

82
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,210
Come on, Jia, have some candy.

83
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,940
It's okay, Jia.

84
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,810
Take a bite.

85
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,450
Jia!

86
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,760
Jia,

87
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,260
are you alright?

88
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,530
Do you feel unwell anywhere?

89
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,860
Qian Xiaoxuan,

90
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,330
you know Jia is allergic

91
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,570
to peanuts.

92
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,570
She almost died last time.

93
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,690
You tried to harm a child.

94
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,010
Are you even human?

95
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,810
I'm not human?

96
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,050
Li Zhiqing,

97
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,490
when you came to my house yesterday,

98
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,130
didn't you do the same to me?

99
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,610
Best friends

100
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,210
should return favors, right?

101
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,950
Good.

102
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,970
Return favors, right?

103
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,050
Jia,

104
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,210
watch cartoons for a while.

105
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,260
It won't take long.

106
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,030
How dare you slap me!

107
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,000
Qian Xiaoxuan,

108
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,450
listen,

109
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,490
stay away from my daughter.

110
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,910
I was already kind enough at your place that day.

111
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,250
You can come at me.

112
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,730
If you dare to lay a finger on my daughter,

113
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,570
there'll be consequences!

114
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,570
Stop filming!

115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,659
Stop filming!

116
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,210
Isn't that Jia's mother,

117
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,810
the one who cheated on her husband?

118
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,090
The one

119
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,930
caught with a young guy at midnight.

120
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,730
Yes. Yes.

121
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,200
Li Zhiqing,

122
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,170
be careful with your daughter.

123
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,290
If you don't divorce him,

124
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,730
I'll keep feeding your daughter candy.

125
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,420
Don't worry.

126
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,770
The child is fine now.

127
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,860
Thank you, doctor.

128
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,980
But Jia still can't speak.

129
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,130
What could be the reason?

130
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,450
Based on the examination results,

131
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,570
there's nothing physically wrong.

132
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,450
I believe

133
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,810
it's more of a psychological issue.

134
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,570
What can I do to help?

135
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,970
Spend more time with the child.

136
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,630
Oh, right.

137
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,050
What's also important is

138
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,050
you must ensure

139
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,330
she's in a peaceful environment

140
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,250
to recover gradually.

141
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,300
Everyone's here now.

142
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,770
Let's stick to the plan then.

143
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,370
I'm ready too.

144
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,370
Good.

145
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,090
Mr. Wang,

146
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,570
you've done a good job.

147
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,810
The company will be yours soon.

148
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,409
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Gu.

149
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:49,810
However,

150
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,330
there's still one obstacle in our way.

151
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:54,330
That kind of person

152
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,450
is no threat at all.

153
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,090
At the meeting later,

154
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,330
you just watch.

155
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,010
Mr. Wang,

156
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,770
there's a call for you.

157
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,130
It's been patched through.

158
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,690
Hello?

159
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:20,970
Mr. Wang,

160
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,930
why didn't you answer your phone?

161
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,410
Did you receive the package

162
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,530
last night?

163
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,530
Who are you?

164
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,730
What do you want?

165
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,330
I know all your little secrets.

166
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,210
Prepare two million yuan by 5 p.m. today.

167
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,200
Otherwise,

168
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,740
you'll get a surprise.

169
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,610
Do you think I'm a three-year-old boy?

170
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,169
Trying to trick me?

171
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,730
Believe it or not.

172
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,690
Hello?

173
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,410
Mr. Zhao,

174
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,580
do you know how big of a blow it is

175
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,530
to our company to lose Hongming?

176
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,090
What's there left to say?

177
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:47,770
Mr. Zhao,

178
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,010
we gave you a chance, but you blew it.

179
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,930
Mr. Wang,

180
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,970
the Hongming project was a ticking time bomb,

181
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,410
yet you hid it from everyone.

182
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,490
It was obviously a trap you set.

183
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,370
Zhao Ninghao!

184
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,770
You failed to secure the project,

185
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,170
but you're blaming Mr. Wang!

186
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,130
You've gone too far!

187
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,610
Everyone,

188
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,290
for the long-term development of the company,

189
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,450
if you agree to dismiss Zhao Ninghao,

190
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,710
please raise your hand.

191
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,130
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhao.

192
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,050
It's the majority's will.

193
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,530
You're fired.

194
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,010
I'll never forgive anyone who causes losses

195
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,170
to the company.

196
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,850
Previously, Ms. Li

197
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,170
was embroiled in a scandal.

198
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,930
I hope that everyone

199
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,130
can prioritize the interests of the company.

200
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,020
In this regard,

201
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,970
we should learn

202
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,930
from Qian Xiaoxuan.

203
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,240
Holy crap!

204
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,010
Look at this, everyone!

205
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,970
Come and take a look!

206
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,450
Isn't this Mr. Wang?

207
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:09,970
Right?

208
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:15,970
This...

209
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,650
This is not your daughter-in-law, right?

210
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,290
Who...

211
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,370
Who is she?

212
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,980
Stop looking! Stop looking!

213
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,090
Stop looking!

214
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,890
Mr. Wang,

215
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,610
your nightlife is quite wild.

216
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:55,690
Stop looking!

217
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,840
Stop looking!

218
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,130
Who did this?

219
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,770
Turn it off!

220
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,210
Turn it off!

221
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,250
Stop looking!

222
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,250
Stop looking!

223
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,330
Which one of you is Wang Yan?

224
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,560
Me.

225
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,410
It's me.

226
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,650
Someone reported you misappropriated company funds.

227
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,010
Come with us.

228
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,580
I am Zhao Ninghao,

229
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,650
Vice President of Dongqing Group.

230
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,840
[Authentication documents]

231
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,010
I accuse

232
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,610
Wang Yan, the acting chairman of the company,

233
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,170
of illegally misappropriating company funds.

234
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,610
How did it go?

235
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,480
I managed to fob them off for now,

236
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,210
but they're onto me.

237
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,730
What about us?

238
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,730
Issue a statement first.

239
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,210
Say the videos and photos are fake,

240
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,330
and we'll take legal action.

241
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,250
Netizens

242
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,210
don't believe that anymore.

243
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,010
Then what do you suggest we do?

244
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,170
How about

245
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,010
saying Li Zhiqing cheated first,

246
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,530
there has been no love

247
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,890
between you and your wife for a long time,

248
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,090
and we are true love?

249
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,250
This way, we can minimize the negative impact.

250
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,330
That's nonsense.

251
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,170
That's admitting to the affair.

252
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,530
Jintai hates anything that damages the image the most.

253
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,730
The most important thing now is to secure Jintai's deal.

254
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,610
Otherwise, the company will be finished.

255
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,570
And we'll be finished too!

256
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,850
I think

257
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,170
Li Zhiqing did this.

258
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,970
I think it's her too.

259
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,450
I'll have my mother keep a close eye on her.

260
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,370
Just keeping an eye on her is not enough.

261
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,570
We need to find her weakness.

262
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,770
Your daughter,

263
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,730
Jia.
