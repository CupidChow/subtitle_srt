[Zhao Ninghao]

4
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:34,800
Hello?

5
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,340
Are you asleep?

6
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,729
No.

7
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,900
Can you talk with me for a while?

8
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,350
Okay.

9
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,250
I can't sleep anyway.

10
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,590
What do you want to talk about?

11
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,900
I'll listen to anything you'd like to discuss.

12
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,539
Okay.

13
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,530
What happened? You look terrible.

14
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,150
Are the documents ready for this afternoon's signing?

15
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,610
Everything is ready but the official seal.

16
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,310
The seal is missing.

17
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,320
What did Ms. Bai say?

18
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,890
The signing time can't be changed.

19
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,640
Their CEO has already been on the plane.

20
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,220
We have four hours left.

21
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,950
We must find the seal.

22
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,690
It must be a trick of Wang Yan.

23
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,160
Where's the official seal?

24
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,130
Official seal?

25
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,780
I'm a project manager. Why are you asking me for the seal?

26
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,579
Stop pretending.

27
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,150
You've hidden the seal

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,390
to prevent me from signing contracts with Jintai.

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,470
Li Zhiqing,

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,910
I gave you the seal.

31
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,150
How can I know

32
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,150
where it is now?

33
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,080
Fine.

34
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,800
You're not going to hand it over, right?

35
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,050
I'll find it myself.

36
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,350
Mr. Wang,

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,990
come with me.

38
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,990
What do you mean?

39
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,860
Are you going to use force in public?

40
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,950
We live in a society governed by law.

41
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,840
I'll call the police.

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,240
Don't misunderstand.

43
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,590
There are some documents

44
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,570
that need your attention.

45
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,310
Come with us, please.

46
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,880
Okay, Li Zhiqing.

47
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,360
Take your time searching then.

48
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,910
Good luck.

49
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,370
Zhu Na.

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Go check the surveillance footage.

51
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,310
Okay.

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,440
Don't waste time.

53
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,430
Hurry up and search.

54
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,750
Hello?

55
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,850
Hello, is this Li Qingdong's family?

56
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,510
Yes.

57
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,180
Your father is in a bad condition.

58
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,380
Please come to the hospital right away.

59
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,830
Can you zoom in on this?

60
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,270
Yes, that's him.

61
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,240
See,

62
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,780
they've been searching for the seal all afternoon.

63
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,990
I heard Mr. Wang has hidden the seal.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,790
Obviously,

65
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,230
he doesn't want Ms. Li to sign the contract with Jintai.

66
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,670
You two,

67
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,230
keep Mr. Wang company.

68
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,230
Yes.

69
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,510
Mr. Wang,

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,110
we meet again.

71
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,840
I…

72
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,450
Where are you going?

73
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,720
The doctor told me my father's condition was not good.

74
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,670
I need to go there right away.

75
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,200
Don't be anxious. Get out of the car.

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,960
Let me drive.

77
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,870
What happened to you?

78
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,760
I don't know what happened to my Dad.

79
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,790
There are only three hours left now.

80
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,630
The seal is still missing.

81
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,230
Why do so many things happen at once?

82
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,790
What a coincidence!

83
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,790
Are you okay?

84
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,270
I'm fine.

85
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,720
Just a bit dizzy.

86
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,760
Don't worry.

87
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,070
I'll take care of everything.

88
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,710
Okay.

89
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,170
♫But I'm afraid of being rejected and misunderstood♫

90
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,980
♫I'm afraid of knowing afterwards how urgent it is to leave♫

91
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,850
♫I've cried myself out but you didn't even notice it♫

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,030
Have a rest.

93
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,230
I'll wake you up when we reach here.

94
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,780
Miss,

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,560
how is my father?

96
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,930
He is fine.

97
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,150
He is in a stable condition.

98
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,200
Didn't you call me

99
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,270
that my father's condition is awful

100
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,690
and ask me to rush to the hospital?

101
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,890
We haven't called any family members.

102
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,560
Oh no.

103
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,750
We've been tricked.

104
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,070
Wang Yan is deliberately stalling for time.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,280
We have just over two hours left.

106
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,110
Let's go.

107
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,680
We've searched everywhere

108
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,300
but don't find it.

109
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,880
There is only the safe that we can't open.

110
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,270
Come here.

111
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,620
Let go.

112
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,710
The password.

113
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,330
What?

114
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,070
The password.

115
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,360
Alright.

116
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,750
If I open it,

117
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,990
but there's nothing you want inside, what then?

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,510
Don't make me repeat my words.

119
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,350
Rude.

120
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,530
Come on.

121
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,070
Nothing.

122
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,350
I told you.

123
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,550
Stop wasting time on me.

124
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,310
Ms. Li.

125
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,950
I've checked the surveillance footage.

126
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,710
Last night,

127
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,990
someone came to the office at midnight.

128
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,710
Who?

129
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,000
Qian Xiaoxuan.

130
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,070
What are you looking at?

131
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,310
They've already gone. Stop peeking at me.

132
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,010
Li Zhiqing, what are you trying to do?

133
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,190
Do you have to make a scene at my home?

134
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,990
Cut the crap.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,550
Hand over the official seal.

136
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,410
I don't know what you're talking about.

137
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,200
What were you doing at the company last night?

138
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,070
Do I

139
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,590
need to report my trace to you?

140
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,350
You accuse me of taking the official seal.

141
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,870
Do you have any evidence?

142
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,150
Will you say it or not?

143
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,030
Fine.

144
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,570
You won't say it, huh?

145
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,850
What are you doing?

146
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,790
Let go of me!

147
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,270
Then I'll give you

148
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,430
a new hairstyle.

149
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,030
Let go of me!

150
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,090
Let go!

151
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,060
Let go of me!

152
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,070
Let go!

153
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,350
Who called the police?

154
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,030
Police!

155
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,410
Sir.

156
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,670
What happened?

157
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,220
She's our colleague.

158
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,550
She got a bit impulsive.

159
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,470
It's a work-related disagreement.

160
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,500
Alright.

161
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,790
You all come with me to the police station.

162
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,590
We need to take your statements.

163
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,030
I'm sorry, sir,

164
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,270
I have something urgent.

165
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,670
Can I go to the police station to make a statement after I'm done?

166
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,510
It won't take long.

167
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,090
Let's go.

168
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,230
Wang Yan.

169
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,690
You're quite devious.

170
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,550
You let the hospital call me,

171
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,150
and then lured me to find Qian Xiaoxuan.

172
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,070
You did all this

173
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,790
to buy time, right?

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,790
Tell me,

175
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,230
what will it take for you to hand over the seal?

176
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,550
Li Zhiqing,

177
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,030
mind your tone.

178
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,520
I didn't take the seal,

179
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,950
but if there are

180
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,150
an appointment letter reinstating my position

181
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,070
and some shares,

182
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,190
maybe I will help you find it.

183
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,830
You finally show your true colors.

184
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,160
You've been scheming all this time

185
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,430
to get back into that position, right?

186
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,590
Actually, we're the same kind of people,

187
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,230
ambitious in our careers.

188
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,350
Do you think

189
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,750
I would let a scoundrel like you

190
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,390
succeed?

191
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,590
Okay.

192
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,150
Then take your time searching.

193
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,660
I'm in no hurry.

194
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,790
After all, there's still

195
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,470
fifty minutes until the signing time.

196
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,590
Ms. Li,

197
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,220
our boss has already left for the venue.

198
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,790
You must find a way to solve the problem.

199
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,470
Ms. Li,

200
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,430
we can't agree to his terms.

201
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,670
We've put in so much effort

202
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,030
to remove him from that position.

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,990
At this point,

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,190
we have to take a gamble.

205
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,950
Go to the basement and take something.

206
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,990
Wang Yan,

207
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,350
I'll go prepare the documents you need.

208
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,190
Give me the seal.

209
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,710
Alright.

210
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,510
Then I'll see you at the venue.

211
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,590
Once I see the documents,

212
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,990
you can have the seal.

213
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,360
Don't try to pull any tricks on me.

214
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,060
Or

215
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,790
you may never know

216
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,150
where the seal is.

217
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,300
Let's go.

218
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,350
Guy.

219
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,790
My phone.

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,790
Naughty.

221
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,990
Hey, Xiaoxuan.

222
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
You can bring it out now.

223
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,430
Li Zhiqing has taken the bait.

224
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,230
She wants the seal.

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,590
Then we'll

226
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,630
give her another surprise.

227
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,470
Wang Yan never intended

228
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,990
to hand over the seal.

229
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,550
He just wanted to get the appointment letter by tricks

230
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,990
and then ruin my contract with Jintai.

231
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,390
A new clue!

232
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,430
Last night, besides Qian Xiaoxuan's place,

233
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,350
Wang Yan also went to this place.

234
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,350
I need to hurry over there.

235
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,180
Let me go.

236
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,950
If you go there,

237
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,630
he won't bring out the seal.

238
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,230
No way.

239
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,790
In that case,

240
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,230
you'll be exposed.

241
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,590
There's no other option right now.

242
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,480
We're running out of time.

243
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,140
You go to the hotel first and stall Wang Yan.

244
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,510
Alright.

245
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,270
Okay.

246
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,510
Who is it?

247
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,960
Auntie,

248
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,270
I'm Mr. Wang's secretary.

249
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,710
Do you remember me?

250
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,670
Yes.

251
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,850
Please come in.

252
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,710
Auntie.

253
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,990
Mr. Wang is a good man.

254
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,470
He's been kind to me,

255
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,830
and taken care of me all the time.

256
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,350
I always want to repay him.

257
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,830
So I came to visit you.

258
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,190
Girl,

259
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,990
you're quite pretty

260
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,790
and sensible.

261
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,030
Are you a couple with Wang Yan?

262
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,310
My son

263
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,550
is such a good man.

264
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,150
You should take good care of him.

265
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,190
Auntie,

266
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,460
actually, I came here

267
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,790
for something important.

268
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,470
What?

269
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,950
Mr. Wang, he…

270
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,290
What happened to him?

271
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,520
Mr. Wang took the official seal without permission

272
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,790
and the matter has been discovered.

273
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,630
Then

274
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,150
is it serious?

275
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,940
If it's investigated,

276
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,790
he might end up in jail for a few years.

277
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,180
Oh.

278
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,280
Are you alright?

279
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,070
Be careful.

280
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:06,890
Please sit down.

281
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,750
I'll call him.

282
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,600
Please don't.

283
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,550
Many people are spying on him.

284
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,270
If you call him, it will give everything away.

285
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,150
Then,

286
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,350
what should we do then?

287
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,030
If we send over the one he gave you last night,

288
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,590
there might be a chance to fix it.

289
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,910
Last night?

290
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,640
Wait.

291
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,990
I'll get it for you.

292
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,550
Yes, it is.
