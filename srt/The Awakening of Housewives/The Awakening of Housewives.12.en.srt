[Episode 12]

3
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,920
Ms. Bai.

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,430
You have a daughter too, don't you?

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,830
She must be spending a lot studying abroad every year.

6
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,140
Tonight, so many people in the industry are watching.

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,590
If this goes south,

8
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,870
will you still have a place

9
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,090
in the company?

10
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,110
Who will support your daughter's life then?

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,510
-Jia!
-Jia!

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,430
Jia!

13
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,450
Jia!

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,230
Ms. Li!

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,990
You're hurt.

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,910
I'm fine.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,650
Jia!

18
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,490
Jia!

19
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,130
Jia!

20
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:28,640
Jia!

21
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:34,930
Jia,

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,950
are you hurt?

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,710
Are you okay?

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,670
Mom!

25
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,160
Mom.

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,150
Mom.

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,430
Mom, I'm fine.

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,030
Don't cry, Jia.

29
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,590
Mommy's here.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,390
That man was just playing a game with us.

31
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,120
He was pretending to be a bad guy.

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,190
He wanted to play a game with you.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,390
Mom,

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,270
he said

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,789
Dad will pick me up soon.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,430
Where's Dad?

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,550
So,

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,110
we won the game, right?

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,830
Jia.

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,480
Pinky swear.

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,870
Mom.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,310
Ladies and gentlemen,

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,230
I apologize for the hiccup today.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,230
But this also shows

45
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,500
no storm,

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,990
no rainbow.

47
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,590
Let's welcome Dongqing's signing representative,

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,590
Jintai's partner representative,

49
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,590
Vice President Li Zhiqing!

50
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,310
Although

51
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,910
Ms. Li has been delayed by something today

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,030
and can't come here in person,

53
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,510
that won't affect

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,630
the partnership

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,070
between Jintai and Dongqing.

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,230
At Jintai, what we value most

57
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,670
is the integrity of our

58
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,230
signing partners.

59
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,590
You've forgotten so quickly?

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,230
I sincerely apologize for the delay.

61
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,470
Dongqing

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,670
is honored to collaborate with Jintai.

63
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,550
Next,

64
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,070
let's raise our glasses

65
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,390
to a successful partnership between Dongqing

66
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,470
and Jintai.

67
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,230
Cheers!

68
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,270
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,870
With Ms. Bai and Ms. Li working together,

70
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,950
this project finally has hope.

71
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,710
This is great.

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,390
Li Zhiqing,

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,230
I swear

74
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,350
I'll make sure you die a miserable death.

75
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,150
What do you think?

76
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,990
Not bad, right?

77
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,750
You brought

78
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,310
this plant here?

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,030
It deserves to be in a better place.

80
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,770
[Li Zhiqing, CEO]

81
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,370
All of this

82
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
feels like a dream.

83
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,470
How is Jia?

84
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,540
How has she been lately?

85
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,120
I transferred her to another kindergarten.

86
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,070
I told my mother.

87
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,890
Send Jia to my place.

88
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,590
Jia can't be in danger again.

89
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,350
No need.

90
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,470
That's too much trouble.

91
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,750
I'll handle it myself.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,230
It's settled!

93
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,110
Okay.

94
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,190
I'm going to announce a personnel change.

95
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,430
From today onwards,

96
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,830
Wang Yan will no longer serve as the acting chairman.

97
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,750
Ms. Li will be taking over.

98
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,310
Dongqing

99
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,730
faced some challenges before.

100
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,790
But fortunately, none of us gave up.

101
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,270
Securing the deal with Jintai wasn't just my effort alone.

102
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,270
I remember everything each of you has done.

103
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,110
Mr. Wang,

104
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,550
we have some unfinished business

105
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,030
that needs to be settled, don't you think?

106
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,030
I propose we fire Wang Yan.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,430
Although Wang Yan has done

108
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,270
a lot to harm the company's interests,

109
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,670
considering his years of service,

110
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,470
we'll let him stay for now

111
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,270
as...

112
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,310
a project manager.

113
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,830
That's all for now.

114
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,070
Everyone, get back to work.

115
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,190
It's a mess here.

116
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,430
Go find someone to clean it up.

117
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,070
Ms. Li asked me to tell you,

118
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,390
from today onwards,

119
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,790
you'll need to clock in and out like everyone else.

120
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,990
No more coming in late or leaving early.

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,990
Remember to clock in when you arrive.

122
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,030
Eat in the employee cafeteria.

123
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,590
Also,

124
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,950
if you have any reimbursements,

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,430
remember to fill out the forms.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,630
Tell Li Zhiqing

127
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,990
not to go too far.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,190
Take your time cleaning up.

129
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,490
Mr. Wang,

130
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,790
you want to see me?

131
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,310
Proceed the Langcheng project

132
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,670
according to this plan.

133
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,630
Okay, Mr. Wang.

134
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,070
I'll go

135
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,230
confirm with Ms. Li.

136
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,630
I've been handling this project from the start.

137
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,909
Is it necessary to confirm with her?

138
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,990
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang,

139
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,150
but Ms. Li has ordered

140
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,310
that from now on,

141
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,630
all company projects require her personal approval

142
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,590
before execution.

143
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,390
Chen.

144
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,550
Don't forget who promoted you.

145
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,670
What?

146
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,870
Ms. Li has just taken the position,

147
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,590
and everyone's avoiding me.

148
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,590
Afraid of choosing the wrong side, huh?

149
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,870
That's not what I meant, Mr. Wang.

150
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,030
We're just following company rules.

151
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,590
If you have any questions,

152
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,150
you can ask Ms. Li.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,990
Ask Ms. Li?

154
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,080
Ask Ms. Li?

155
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,150
Ask Ms. Li!

156
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,270
I don't understand.

157
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,150
You had a great opportunity.

158
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,990
Why didn't you kick him out of the company?

159
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,630
If you keep someone like him by your side,

160
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,750
he'll only try every way to retaliate.

161
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,630
I never intended

162
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,950
to kick him out of the company.

163
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,870
Why?

164
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:28,870
First,

165
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,550
from the company's perspective,

166
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,190
Wang Yan controls a few key investors.

167
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,430
We must find a way

168
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,630
to bring those investors under our control.

169
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,900
Second,

170
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,150
the most important thing is to find

171
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,710
the evidence of Wang Yan's embezzlement.

172
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,430
He needs to pay back every cent he stole.

173
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,150
We'll make him pay the price

174
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,630
and be truly finished.

175
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,830
So,

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,990
what comes next

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,430
is the real revenge.

178
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,190
What should we do next?

179
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,590
I remember

180
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,630
the person who kidnapped Jia

181
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,270
has an ouroboros tattoo on his arm.

182
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,430
Chen Xiao seems to have one on his arm.

183
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,030
We must find him.

184
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,070
The new car is ready.

185
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,270
For your safety,

186
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,790
we need to be careful too.

187
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,430
Okay.

188
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,990
Wang Yan, it's me.

189
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,190
Don't do that again.

190
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,230
I didn't expect that she still managed to secure Jintai's deal.

191
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,750
What should we do now?

192
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,550
Don't worry.

193
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,470
As long as the contract isn't signed,

194
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,230
I have a chance to strike back.

195
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,990
If I can't have it,

196
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,870
she can't have it either.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,630
I will take back

198
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,280
everything I've lost.

199
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,070
You've become bolder lately.

200
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,750
Let's get in and talk.

201
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,510
Ms. Bai just informed us

202
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,390
that the contract signing is scheduled for 1 p.m. tomorrow.

203
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,030
Okay.

204
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,550
Rest early today.

205
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,990
All in.

206
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:18,950
Reveal.

207
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,750
You in or not?

208
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,190
Ruthless or not?

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,630
What can I say? I'm just on a lucky streak.

210
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,090
Shuffle, hurry!

211
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,230
Do you still dare to play?

212
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,990
I'll play.

213
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,190
Are you in or not?

214
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,770
So?

215
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,790
Don't leave, everyone.

216
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,290
Let's play till dawn.

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,790
Hurry up!

218
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,710
Long,

219
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,430
lend me some more.

220
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,830
You just borrowed so much,

221
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,950
and you've already lost it all?

222
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,430
Come on.

223
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,950
You gotta bait the hook before you catch the fish, right?

224
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,750
I have a feeling

225
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,150
my luck is about to change.

226
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,230
I can lend you more,

227
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,150
but pay up your previous debt first.

228
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,510
Otherwise, forget it!

229
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,870
You're looking down on me, huh?

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,070
Listen,

231
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,430
with just one phone call,

232
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,830
someone will deliver the money to me!

233
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,430
Haven't I told you before?

234
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,950
If I don't call you,

235
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,190
don't call me!

236
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,430
Get as far away as you can!

237
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,870
Mr. Wang,

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,270
I want to stay away too,

239
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,030
but

240
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,550
I still need some money to spend.

241
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,230
Didn't I already give you money?

242
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,990
That's not enough.

243
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,310
That's only enough

244
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,430
for a couple of days of fun.

245
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,870
My creditors

246
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,630
are breathing down my neck.

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,830
Please transfer some more money to me.

248
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,010
Chen Xiao,

249
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,670
who do you think you are?

250
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,710
Let me tell you,

251
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,310
I've already given you what I should.

252
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,630
I won't give you a single cent more!

253
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,350
Wang Yan,

254
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,670
don't think you can just use me and throw me away.

255
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,710
If I get caught,

256
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,750
do you think you can get away with it?

257
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,230
You'd better think carefully.

258
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,430
If you can't keep your mouth shut,

259
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,550
I'll find someone to shut it for you.
