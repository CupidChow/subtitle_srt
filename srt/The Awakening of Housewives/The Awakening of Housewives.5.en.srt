00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,430
[Episode 5]

3
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,170
What's wrong with you?

4
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:43,810
Zhiqing.

5
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,490
There seems to be something stuck on your lips.

6
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,400
Yes, let me wipe it off for you.

7
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,400
Done.

8
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,110
It's gone.

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,030
So,

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,510
you two have always regarded me as a fool.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,600
Good for you, Li Zhiqing.

12
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,910
You've even changed the password of the door.

13
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,930
This is my house.

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,640
Of course I can change it whenever I want.

15
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,539
Jia.

16
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,620
Jia.

17
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,860
Leave here with me.

18
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,490
Come on. Leave here with me.

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,780
Let's go.

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,220
Let's go.

21
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,789
Leave here with me.

22
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,470
Let's go. Hurry up.

23
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,990
Come on. Leave here with me.

24
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,620
What are you doing?

25
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,800
What am I doing?

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,190
I'm going to take Jia to leave here.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,680
If she lives with a mother like you,

28
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,820
what good things could she possibly learn?

29
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,070
I'm Jia's mother.

30
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,210
You have no right to take her away.

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,200
I'm her grandmother.

32
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,500
Of course I have the right.

33
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,100
It's so unlucky that

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,200
my son has married a bitch like you.

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,070
Jia, go back to your room first.

36
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,950
As long as you don't divorce my son,

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,190
I'll make your life miserable every single day.

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,479
Watch your tongue!

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,509
You don't deserve it.

40
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,070
Seeing you makes me feel sick.

41
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,350
As a worthless girl,

42
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,050
she even goes to such an expensive kindergarten.

43
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,900
She'll be just like you when she grows up.

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,640
You don't deserve it.

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,510
Seeing you makes me feel sick.

46
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,760
As a worthless girl,

47
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,350
she even goes to such an expensive kindergarten.

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,750
You...

49
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,110
I... Well... I...

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,470
You wicked bad woman!

51
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,790
I'll fight with you to the death!

52
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,840
Jia, be happy.

53
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,550
Look how flustered she is.

54
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,230
Let's go.

55
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,050
Jia.

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,040
We've arrived.

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,710
You love going to kindergarten the most, don't you?

58
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
Why aren't you happy?

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,680
Jia.

60
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,550
No matter what others say,

61
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,180
you'll always believe me, right?

62
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,010
I'll love you forever.

63
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,850
And I'll be with you forever.

64
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,020
Let's make a pinky promise.

65
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,090
Come on.

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
It's time to go to school.

67
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,380
Bye bye.

68
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,620
Langcheng.

69
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,580
Zhiqing.

70
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,620
She took the bait.

71
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,820
Baby.

72
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,010
What happened to your face?

73
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,500
Darling, I think we should break up.

74
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,460
Tell me.

75
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,500
Who bullied you?

76
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,740
I don't dare to tell you.

77
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,460
I'm afraid that she'll hit me.

78
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,920
Was Li Zhiqing the one who did it?

79
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,380
She rushed to my house last night

80
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,060
and called me a dirty slut.

81
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,100
She hit me so hard.

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,840
This shrew

83
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,460
has gone too far.

84
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,860
She also said that

85
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,780
you didn't cheat on her,

86
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,060
but you were actually a scumbag whom she dumped initiatively.

87
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,460
She even called your mother a useless old woman

88
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,700
who took advantage of her own seniority.

89
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,700
Don't worry.

90
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,420
No matter how she has treated you,

91
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,420
I'll definitely make her pay a double price.

92
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,620
This is the display

93
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,420
of our Langcheng's newly developed products.

94
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,180
We primarily used vintage linen and cotton materials.

95
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,460
Then we applied imported sewing techniques.

96
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,820
There are also unified color tones and styles.

97
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,380
As

98
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,460
this is a product developed for women,

99
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,980
we've been strictly controlling

100
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,180
both the quality assurance

101
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,740
and the style positioning.

102
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,140
This is

103
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,170
our detailed profit-sharing report for this quarter,

104
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,460
along with the financial data and the income statement.

105
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,140
That's all.

106
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,020
I'd like to thank Langcheng for their trust in our Dongqing.

107
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,780
Wait.

108
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,420
How come it's different from what we discussed before?

109
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,460
Haven't we agreed that you'll get 40% of the share and I'll get 60%?

110
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,340
How come your Dongqing

111
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,140
suddenly raised it to 60% for you and 40% for me?

112
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,020
Mr. Wang.

113
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,740
To be honest,

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,220
there are quite many companies to choose from in the market.

115
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,460
Why did our Langcheng choose your Dongqing?

116
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,620
It was out of respect for the old chairman.

117
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,260
What do you mean by suddenly putting me on the spot like this?

118
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,300
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Qin.

119
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,420
It's my mistake.

120
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,020
It's your turn.

121
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,340
Wait, Mr. Qin.

122
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,190
Perhaps my colleague didn't explain it clearly.

123
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,460
Although on the basis of the original plan,

124
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,900
Dongqing's share has increased by 20%,

125
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,260
we have correspondingly added

126
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,900
in-depth services for two sectors.

127
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,020
I've already sent the information to you all.

128
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,900
I know Langcheng has a strong demand

129
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,340
for these two sectors.

130
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,420
But I don't think the matrix effect formed by these two sectors

131
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,020
can be quantified by just 20%, right?

132
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,540
Mr. Wang, I didn't expect that

133
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,700
your company

134
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,860
had hired such a talented young woman.

135
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,220
This is all Mr. Wang's idea.

136
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,820
I'm just responsible for executing it.

137
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,860
Great.

138
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,540
Then we'll get 40%.

139
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,390
-It's good to collaborate with you.
-It's good to collaborate with you.

140
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,380
They will definitely try to tamper with your project proposal.

141
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,270
Why don't we just let them read it thoroughly?

142
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,820
Increase the share by 20% in the original proposal.

143
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,060
Just say that we'll provide more in-depth services

144
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,790
for these two sectors.

145
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,060
I'm sure Langcheng will be satisfied.

146
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,300
I'm sure Langcheng will be satisfied.

147
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,500
Mr. Wang, Mr. Wang.

148
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,300
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,700
It was my mistake today.

150
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,020
I hate it the most when people say those three words.

151
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,820
You almost offended

152
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,860
such an important client.

153
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,520
You're the executive assistant now.

154
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,420
Hand over your work to Zhou Ran.

155
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,300
Then get back to your original department.

156
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,820
I...

157
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,090
Alright.

158
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,659
Zhiqing.

159
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:45,820
Our plan succeeded.

160
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,950
Good.

161
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,560
It's my turn to make an appearance now.

162
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,380
Mr. Wang.

163
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,700
Congratulations to you on getting Langcheng's project.

164
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,020
You've said that if I get Langcheng's project,

165
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,900
you'll give me a reward.

166
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,780
Then what kind of reward do you want?

167
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,900
Of course,

168
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,910
I want a very intimate reward.

169
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,460
Ms. Li.

170
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,220
Mr. Wang really isn't here today.

171
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,740
Please don't make things difficult for me.

172
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,260
Why are you here?

173
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,799
This is my father's company.

174
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,960
I don't think you have the right to question me.

175
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,809
What's your purpose here?

176
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,340
I'm here to see Wang Yan.

177
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,059
Mr. Wang is busy working right now.

178
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,060
He said

179
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,460
he wouldn't see anyone,

180
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,460
especially you.

181
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,140
Fine.

182
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,540
Then you can go get me the financial reports.

183
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,860
Who do you think you are?

184
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,700
What gives you the right to check the accounts?

185
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,460
Listen.

186
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,740
Half of the people in this company

187
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,620
were trained by me.

188
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
I'm also a shareholder of the company.

189
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,620
Do you think I have the right to check the accounts or not?

190
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,020
You can take Ms. Li to get them.

191
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,500
This way, please, Ms. Li.

192
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,660
By the way,

193
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,380
your parents' cooking was really good last night.

194
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,820
Please thank them for me.

195
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,060
When I have time,

196
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,180
I'll visit them again.

197
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,860
Please, Ms. Li.

198
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,540
Are these all from this year?

199
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,660
Yes.

200
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,740
They're all placed here.

201
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,940
I'm not sure about

202
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,020
the specific details.

203
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,180
There are so many files.

204
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,260
How do you expect me to find the ones I need?

205
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,820
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,520
You'll have to search for them slowly.

207
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,940
Xuan.

208
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,180
Everything has been arranged.

209
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,220
Usually, no one goes into the storage room.

210
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,980
I guess

211
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,260
she'll probably be locked inside for a while.

212
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,700
Well done.

213
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,890
Just let that bitch

214
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,290
taste what it's like to be fooled.

215
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,820
Is anyone there?

216
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,820
What's going on?

217
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,660
I... don't know.

218
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,890
Come on. Let's go take a look.

219
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,150
Mr. Wang.

220
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,100
What's going on?

221
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,860
I've heard that there's a fire in the storage room.

222
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,800
A fire?

223
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,190
Is anyone inside?

224
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,830
The sprinkler system in the storage room is broken.

225
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,500
Ms. Li seems to be inside.

226
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,140
I've called the fire department.

227
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,660
Ms. Li is inside.

228
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,500
We haven't had a chance to repair it yet.

229
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,900
Ms. Li, are you alright? Ms. Li!

230
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,460
The property management's rescue team is on their way.

231
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,140
Xuan.

232
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,820
Why don't we just open the door?

233
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,700
I have the key.

234
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,380
Ms. Li!

235
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,070
Don't intervene.

236
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,590
Ms. Li!

237
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,180
Ms. Li, are you alright?

238
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,940
Hang in there!

239
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,150
How come the password is incorrect?
