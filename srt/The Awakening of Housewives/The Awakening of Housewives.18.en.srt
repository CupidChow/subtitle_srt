Come on, everyone,

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,630

Happy birthday, Xiaoxuan.

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,510
Dad,

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,670
why did you suddenly wake up?

25
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,470
Isn't it good to lie here?

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,630
If you want to blame someone,

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,550
I think you should blame yourself for

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,310
not leaving the shares to me earlier.

29
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,750
Otherwise,

30
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,430
you wouldn't have come to this.

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,590
Everything I'm doing

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,710
is forced by you and your daughter.

33
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,510
I have no choice

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,350
but to make you

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,790
disappear from this world.

36
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,590
Then, everything will be mine.

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,030

What's wrong?

42
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,209
You seem distracted.

43

Nothing.

44
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,870
Maybe it's

Wang Yan,

47
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,270
this isn't like you.

48
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,270
It was

49
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,550
a useless will.

50
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,870
But now, it's effective.

51
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,270

62
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,510
and I can get the project.

I am deeply grateful to him.

71

It was he who gave me the opportunity.

72

He taught me how to do business,

73
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,200

74
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,909
He treated me like his son.

Don't get too excited.

112

Is anyone here?

194
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,950
Nurse?

195
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,020
[Bad baby]

196
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,370
Qian Xiaoxuan.

197
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,730
Qian Xiaoxuan.

198
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,900
Qian Xiaoxuan.

199
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,960
Come here.

200
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,070
How are you feeling?

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,910
Much better.

202
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,790
Baby,

203
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,190
I need to apologize to you.

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,190
I was

205
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,920
too impulsive that day.

206
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,830
And,

207
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,190
your pregnancy was an accident.

208
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,070
I... I never expected it.

209
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,110
I don't blame you.

210
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,010
It was my fault.

211
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,730
Don't worry.

212
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,390
Once I get the company back,

213
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,880
we'll get married.

214
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,630
By then,

215
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,720
you'll be the esteemed chairman's wife.

216
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,030
I trust you.

217
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,670
You must be thirsty.

218
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,270
I'll go get you a glass of water.

219
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,200
The doctor has examined you.

220
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,950
You're fine,

221
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,790
but you

222
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,510
miscarried.

223
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,550
You've always wanted to laugh at my misfortunes.

224
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,630
Are you satisfied now?

225
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,810
I hate you.

226
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,250
I want you to die.

227
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,590
But

228
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,670
you miscarried.

229
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,910
I can understand how you feel.

230
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,300
Never mind.

231
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,810
No one cared about it anyway.

232
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,240
Even if it were born, it would suffer just like me.

233
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,430
You've taken enough pleasure in my downfall.

234
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,350
If you saved me to get back at Wang Yan,

235
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,510
you'd better stop dreaming.

236
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,350
Not for that.

237
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,990
Then for what?

238
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,670
Because

239
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,990
we are both women.

240
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,150
I'm leaving.

241
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,190
Wait.

242
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,390
Let's have a talk.
