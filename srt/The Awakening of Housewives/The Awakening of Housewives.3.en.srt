00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,390
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,610
How's Dad?

4
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,260
I've been worried about him.

5
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:07,940
Jiajia,

6
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,830
go back to your room first.

7
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,400
Why are you looking at me like that?

8
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,390
Have you

9
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,660
made up your mind on divorce?

10
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,780
Wang Yan,

11
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,000
you bastard!

12
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,460
Why are you doing this to me?

13
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,240
Zhiqing,

14
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,759
you're back.

15
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,300
The water has been cut off at my house.

16
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,420
I came here to take a shower.

17
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,700
You don't mind, right?

18
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,110
Your robe is quite comfortable.

19
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,500
Is it the style

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,639
I recommended to you last time?

21
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,770
Xuan.

22
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,800
Xiaoxuan,

23
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,300
try these fruits.

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,260
Give them to me.

25
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,130
They're sweet.

26
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,770
I'll wash them for you.

27
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,530
Thank you, Aunt.

28
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,720
How is it?

29
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,290
Is it sweet?

30
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,720
Yes.

31
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,840
Well,

32
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,500
let's have a drink today

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,410
to celebrate Wang Yan taking over the company.

34
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,430
Really?

35
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,010
Zhiqing,

36
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,160
what kind of wine should we drink?

37
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,580
What are you looking at?

38
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,490
Are you looking for your puppy?

39
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,350
You shouldn't have forgotten it.

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,220
Didn't you eat it too?

41
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,450
How did it taste?

42
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,890
Was it delicious?

43
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,899
You can't give birth to a son,

44
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,450
and you've cheated on my son.

45
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,890
[Divorce Agreement]

46
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,120
Sign it.

47
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,220
We'll get divorced.

48
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,200
I like you so much.

49
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,000
Cheers.

50
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,570
You said

51
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,600
you didn't want my position to be higher than yours,

52
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,909
so I resigned to be a housewife.

53
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,210
You said

54
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,420
you didn't like me dancing and being in the spotlight,

55
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,140
so I gave up my dreams

56
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,560
and stayed at home to do housework.

57
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,310
For you,

58
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,320
I became someone I used to hate.

59
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,840
What do you want me to do?

60
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,800
Li Zhiqing,

61
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,430
what's that in your hand?

62
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,710
Li Zhiqing,

63
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,360
look how terrible you are!

64
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,960
Don't do anything rash.

65
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,520
Li Zhiqing,

66
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,390
are you mad?

67
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,370
Do you think anyone

68
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,400
would like a madwoman like you?

69
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,020
Wang Yan.

70
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,180
You

71
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,540
made me a slut in others' eyes.

72
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,790
You caused my father to fall off the stairs and remain unconscious.

73
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,470
You made Jiajia a mute.

74
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,690
Well,

75
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,640
you call me madwoman.

76
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:44,560
Calm down.

77
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,920
Calm down.

78
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,740
Then I'll show you what a madwoman will do.

79
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,820
Wang Yan,

80
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,090
you forced me to do this.

81
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,430
Since you want to destroy me,

82
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,120
then,

83
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,720
from now on,

84
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,260
I won't let any of you go.

85
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,030
Come on.

86
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,750
Li Qingdong

87
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,990
was so lucky.

88
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,630
Such a high staircase

89
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,220
didn't even kill him.

90
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,010
Anyway,

91
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,560
he'll never wake up.

92
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,870
We are in the company.

93
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,430
What if someone sees us?

94
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,400
This company will be mine soon.

95
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,320
Where are you going?

96
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,210
Do you know what time it is?

97
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,340
Why are you still dawdling?

98
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,680
Do housework right now!

99
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,530
Do the laundry.

100
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,690
Make breakfast.

101
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,040
I'm starving.

102
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,500
If you get divorced,

103
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,070
I will lose a maid.

104
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,360
If you are hungry, cook it yourself.

105
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,520
Wash your clothes on your own.

106
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,090
Don't you have hands?

107
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,470
Let me tell you,

108
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,500
from now on,

109
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,880
I won't do housework anymore.

110
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,900
How dare you!

111
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,650
What nonsense are you talking about?

112
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,950
A woman

113
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,910
who doesn't do housework

114
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,850
nor serve others,

115
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,340
is not a qualified woman.

116
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,340
Who told you

117
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,570
women are born to serve others?

118
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,760
Those who serve others

119
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,570
are called servants.

120
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,420
How dare you talk back to me!

121
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,900
You've gone too far!

122
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,470
You…

123
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,590
Clean up the dining room.

124
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,370
Then, get out of my house.

125
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,060
Don't come back here again.

126
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,320
You…

127
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,200
Li Zhiqing!

128
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,470
I want to meet you.

129
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,030
As you've heard,

130
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,280
the chairman hasn't been feeling well

131
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,470
and is receiving treatment in the hospital.

132
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,560
I will be in charge of

133
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,280
all the matters in the company.

134
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,620
I agree.

135
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,440
Mr. Wang is most familiar with the company's business.

136
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,800
He's young and energetic.

137
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,670
So, he's the most suitable one to manage the company.

138
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,560
I object.

139
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,150
Mr. Wang has only been with us for a few years.

140
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,250
He doesn't have so much management experience.

141
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
I propose

142
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,490
that we should let Ms. Li Zhiqing

143
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,180
come back to take over the company.

144
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:23,850
Zhao Ninghao,

145
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,620
my wife has been away from the workplace for many years.

146
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,960
What do you mean by that?

147
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,920
Nothing.

148
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,070
Ms. Li is the old chairman's daughter.

149
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,210
I think she is more capable than you.

150
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,580
Therefore,

151
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,860
Li Zhiqing is the most suitable person

152
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,220
to take over the company.

153
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,680
You have no right to call the shots.

154
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:41,970
Mr. Zhao,

155
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,820
did you meet the KPI for the first half of the year?

156
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,690
Your father is a shareholder,

157
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,080
but our company

158
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,050
prioritizes profits.

159
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,450
I think

160
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,550
the business sector you're responsible for

161
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,870
should be handed over to Xiaoxuan and his team.

162
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,790
Mr. Wang,

163
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,380
it's…

164
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,620
Our company

165
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,860
values meritocracy.

166
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,170
We don't operate like a family business.

167
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,070
If anyone's performance is bad,

168
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,400
don't blame me

169
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,030
for being ruthless.

170
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,770
It's you.
