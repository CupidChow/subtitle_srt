[The Awakening of Housewives]

00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,520
[Episode 10]

3
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,350
Senior.

4
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,319
Hello?

5
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,880
Wang Yan.

6
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,670
Are you crazy?

7
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,580
Where's my money?

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,310
What money?

9
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,830
What are you talking about?

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,910
Get out of here!

11
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,270
The voice-changing call,

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,910
the anonymous letter

13
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,150
and the garbage truck.

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,590
Li Zhiqing.

15
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,509
Nice performance.

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,550
Do you mean

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,990
the money you've transferred from my account?

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,470
Let me tell you.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,270
I have all the bank evidence in my hands.

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,789
I want you to return all that money

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,750
to me completely.

22
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,630
Take one more step forward and you'll regret it!

23
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,670
Li Zhiqing.

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,430
We're not divorced yet, are we?

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,190
You've already given him the keys?

26
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,470
He'll stay in my house tonight.

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,750
He'll protect me.

28
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,360
He'll protect you?

29
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,220
Are you leaving or not?

30
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,960
If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

31
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,690
Then you had better protect her well.

32
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,100
At night, she can be

33
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,100
quite hard to deal with.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,710
I used you

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,630
just now.

37
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,860
It's okay.

38
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,829
Why are you here?

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
We got the money back.

40
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,550
I was worried that he might come here to give you a hard time,

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,270
so I stayed downstairs all this time.

42
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,390
Let's go.

43
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,030
Let's have a drink.

44
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,650
Mr. Wang.

45
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,190
I've figured out everything for you.

46
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,990
I asked a professional to check it.

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,670
That picture was photoshoped.

48
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,990
Although

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,470
you've been deceived,

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,360
there's at least one piece of good news.

51
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,870
Your wife doesn't have

52
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,750
any real evidence.

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,750
From now on, if I don't ask you anything,

54
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,020
just keep your mouth shut.

55
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,670
Alright.

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,710
Yes, sir.

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,510
Mr. Wang.

58
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,070
There are so many termination agreements

59
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,550
and a pile of legal claim letters.

60
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,990
What do you think we should do?

61
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,560
What do you mean?

62
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,570
Are you trying to hold me accountable now?

63
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,710
I won't take the blame for this.

64
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,950
Who's responsible for the company's current state?

65
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,030
When you're in this position,

66
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,950
don't you feel guilty?

67
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,270
That's right.

68
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,840
I can't even pay salaries now.

69
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,030
If it's really not okay,

70
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,630
just disband our team.

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,110
That's great.

72
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,460
I was just thinking the same thing. Leave the company now.

73
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,560
Don't let me see you tomorrow.

74
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,740
I have no problem with that,

75
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,040
as long as Ms. Li agrees.

76
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,390
Everyone, calm down first.

77
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,829
You've all been with my father

78
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,950
through thick and thin.

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,070
I won't let the company collapse.

80
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,830
I'll definitely

81
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,030
pay the salaries as usual.

82
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,590
If there's a deficit in the accounts,

83
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,230
I'll cover it personally.

84
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,990
Count me in.

85
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,260
Count me in.

86
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,350
-Count me in.
-Count me in.

87
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,750
Ms. Li.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,110
If you're trying to win people over,

89
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,990
you should at least come up with a better lie.

90
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,030
Right?

91
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,029
Are you treating us all as fools?

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,430
Anyone can brag.

93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,149
Do you have a better solution

94
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,990
to help Dongqing get rid of this predicament?

95
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,270
The person who has put the company in this situation

96
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,870
is the one treating us all as fools.

97
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,990
Jintai.

98
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,670
As long as we make Jintai become our client,

99
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,110
we'll be able to save the company.

100
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,310
Mr. Zhao and I will come up with a new proposal.

101
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,190
We'll do our best

102
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,620
to make Jintai become our client.

103
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,310
Where's Li Zhiqing?

104
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,240
Come out here!

105
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,030
Are you afraid to come out because you've done

106
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,070
something shameful?

107
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,590
Ms. Li

108
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,390
is in a meeting right now.

109
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,310
Please wait here for a moment.

110
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,270
On what grounds can you stop me?

111
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,390
I'm her mother-in-law.

112
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,070
You first made trouble at home, and now you're causing trouble in the company.

113
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,670
You really won't stop it, huh?

114
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,630
Is this how an elderly person should behave?

115
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,909
Are you behaving well like a daughter-in-law?

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,310
Her son is already behaving like that,

117
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,590
and she even has the nerve to criticize others?

118
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,350
Well, Zhao Ninghao...

119
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,430
Zhao Ninghao, come out here!

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,230
I'm here.

121
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,270
Why do you want to see me?

122
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,270
So you're already trying to protect him?

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,710
My son is still sitting in the company.

124
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,630
You two are doing such dirty things

125
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,190
right under his nose.

126
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,190
Don't you know that spreading rumors

127
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,470
can lead to legal consequences?

128
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,470
I'm spreading rumors?

129
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,990
In front of everyone in the company, will you say that

130
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,390
you don't have any other intentions towards my daughter-in-law?

131
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,230
Do you dare to say it?

132
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,070
Do you dare?

133
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,590
Alright.

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,390
You're feeling guilty, aren't you?

135
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,740
If you want to make a scene,

136
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,150
then go ahead and do it.

137
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,270
If you leave now, I'll lose all respect for you.

138
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,590
Why would I leave?

139
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,670
I want everyone in the company to know

140
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,230
what kind of person you really are.

141
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,950
Has Wang Yan's client arrived?

142
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,870
He's in the lobby.

143
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,670
Don't go.

144
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,510
This way, please.

145
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,430
Let me tell you.

146
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,150
This person

147
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,590
always seems decent.

148
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,930
She's actually quite despicable.

149
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,070
Mr. Wang.

150
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,190
Who is this?

151
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,670
As for this kind of person,

152
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,830
if you don't expose her,

153
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,870
she'll never know what shamelessness means.

154
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,950
Guys, just remember that

155
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,909
she's quite revolting.

156
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,990
Now that you have such a leader,

157
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,070
I even feel sick for all of you.

158
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,790
She's like a shrew.

159
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,470
Recently, your company's atmosphere

160
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,390
has been quite lively.

161
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,950
That person...

162
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,470
is...

163
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,990
Don't you think it's such a disgrace?

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,470
She's our company's cleaning lady.

165
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,590
I thought so.

166
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,270
How could your company have someone like this?

167
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,030
That's right.

168
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,150
She always pretends to be decent.

169
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,030
Zhou Ran.

170
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,430
Take Mr. Fang to the office to rest first.

171
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,950
She acts as if she were awesome.

172
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,830
I'll just wait for you right here.

173
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,070
So you're not coming out?

174
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,270
I just won't leave.

175
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,310
What are you looking at?

176
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,590
Don't you have work to do?

177
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,750
Son.

178
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,350
What are you doing?

179
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:39,800
What are you doing?

180
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,030
Why are you here?

181
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,710
I'm here to teach Li Zhiqing a lesson for you.

182
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,950
I have an important client there.

183
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,590
Leave now.

184
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,470
Don't embarrass me.

185
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,190
Son.

186
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,510
Go!

187
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,350
Well...

188
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,230
We happen to need a cleaning lady here.

189
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,990
Would you like to consider it?

190
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,510
Mr. Fang.

191
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,070
Take care.

192
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,230
Alright. It's good to collaborate with you.

193
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,990
Bye.

194
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,470
Hello, what is it now?

195
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,910
Hello, Mr. Chen.

196
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,510
Has Ms. Bai read the proposal I gave you

197
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,390
last time?

198
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,510
Ms. Bai is still angry about that matter of yours.

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,870
If she doesn't make a decision on this,

200
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,950
it'll be useless for you to talk to anyone else.

201
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,190
I understand.

202
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,350
We've been old friends for so many years.

203
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,150
Stop mentioning that we're old friends.

204
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,070
Solve the problem as soon as possible.

205
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,470
Yes, yes, yes.

206
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,310
I'm wondering

207
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,390
whether you can

208
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,350
put in a good word for me in front of Ms. Bai.

209
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,880
If this works out, I'll have to...

210
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,190
I didn't read my horoscope before coming out.

211
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,310
I'll stop playing it.

212
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,490
Mr. Xiao.

213
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,190
Don't leave.

214
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,590
You haven't paid the money yet.

215
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,430
Can't you see that?

216
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,590
I don't have any money now!

217
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,750
Since you've won so much, I'll pay next time.

218
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,990
There is no such a usual practice.

219
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,110
Then what do you want?

220
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,750
If you don't have money, pay with your fingers.

221
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,750
Each finger is worth 2,000 yuan!

222
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,950
Is this enough now?

223
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,110
You can let him go now, huh?

224
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,790
Let me make this clear first.

225
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,390
I have no money to repay you.

226
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,790
I didn't expect you to return the money, either.

227
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,590
So you are

228
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,990
making a sacrifice for love?

229
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,910
But there's one thing

230
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,270
you need to help me with.

231
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,590
I knew it.

232
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,990
Tell me.

233
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,710
What is it?

234
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,090
You paid for me, and I have to help you.

235
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,910
Help me kidnap Li Zhiqing's daughter.

236
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,650
You want me to do such an inhuman thing?

237
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,070
Alright.

238
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,710
You've come to the right person.

239
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,200
[Inpatient Department]

240
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,810
Ms. Li!

241
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,300
What's wrong?

242
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,470
Why are you here so late?

243
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,150
Your father is critically ill.

244
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,510
We couldn't reach you by phone.

245
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,350
Fortunately, your husband is here.

246
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,150
My husband?

247
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,950
Wang Yan?

248
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,790
He's in the ward.

249
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,910
Go take a look now.

250
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,460
Okay.

251
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:41,950
Okay.

252
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,640
The patient has been resuscitated now.

253
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,990
His condition is basically stable.

254
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,710
Thank you, Doctor.

255
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,910
Don't worry too much.

256
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,550
Zhiqing.

257
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,940
Actually, you should thank your husband.

258
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,640
He basically

259
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,070
comes here to visit your father every night.

260
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,350
If he hadn't discovered it in time this time,

261
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,550
the consequences would have been unimaginable.

262
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,100
Thank you, Ninghao.

263
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,580
There's no need to thank me.

264
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,350
This is what I should do.

265
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,270
Previously, the chairman

266
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,790
and you took such good care of me.

267
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,750
Then I'll go out first.

268
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,440
Son, look.

269
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,910
Let me tell you. This color really suits you.

270
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,750
Look.

271
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,750
Mom.

272
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,310
Is this why you've asked me to come here?

273
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,510
This outfit

274
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,110
really

275
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,470
suits you so much.

276
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,670
Go try it on.

277
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,350
You'll surely look so handsome in it.

278
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,230
Mom,

279
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,230
could you please not come to my company again?

280
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,550
I have so many important clients.

281
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,190
Don't cause any trouble for me. Okay?

282
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,550
Alright.

283
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,550
I won't

284
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,070
go to your company again. Okay?

285
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,190
Go try on this outfit now.

286
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,310
Go try it on.

287
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,220
Just go.

288
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,150
Why are you here?

289
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,440
So you used my mother?

290
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,110
I'm sorry.

291
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,840
I missed you,

292
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,300
so I came to see you.

293
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,190
While there are few people outside,

294
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,110
leave at once.

295
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,390
Don't blame me for being disrespectful to you.

296
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,710
I'll apologize to you.

297
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,270
About the pregnancy,

298
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,470
I lied to you.

299
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,070
Have you finished speaking?

300
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,550
If you've finished, leave at once.

301
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,330
I can help you get Jintai's project.

302
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,350
Do you think there's a chance of winning for you to get Jintai's project?

303
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,790
I won't lose.

304
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,950
You've caused so much trouble.

305
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,710
I'm sure you're quite clear about Ms. Bai's attitude

306
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,950
towards you now.

307
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,590
If you can't get Jintai's project,

308
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,190
you'll be kicked out of the company.

309
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,070
Do you want to lose to Li Zhiqing?

310
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,270
Then do you have a better solution?

311
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,620
Qian Xiaoxuan.

312
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,550
You've gone too far.

313
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,190
But I like it.

314
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,310
You always know exactly what I want.

315
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,670
Take her down

316
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,270
while she's vulnerable.

317
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,470
I'm willing to

318
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,990
do anything for you.

319
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,830
It was my fault to deceive you.

320
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,870
However,

321
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,710
I really want to have a child with you.

322
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,150
Then you can

323
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,710
just have one with me.

324
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,750
What's that sound?

325
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,270
How shameless!

326
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,230
Ms. Li.

327
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,350
It's not appropriate to watch this, is it?
