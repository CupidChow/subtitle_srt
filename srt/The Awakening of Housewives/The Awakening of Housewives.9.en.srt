[The Awakening of Housewives]

00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,530
[Episode 9]

3
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,390
Baby,

4
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,940
when did this happen?

5
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,200
You're pregnant,

6
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,390
yet I treated you like that.

7
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,170
I'm truly not human.

8
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,170
This pair of scumbags

9
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,709
are truly an inseparable match.

10
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,450
Be careful,

11
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,850
don't damage my stroller.

12
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,490
Alright, let's go.

13
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,289
Qian Xiaoxuan,

14
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,810
what do you mean?

15
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,450
Zhiqing,

16
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,730
thanks to you for taking back my apartment,

17
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,450
I now have the chance to be your neighbor.

18
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,210
Please take care of me in the future.

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,810
So you moved across from me

20
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,330
just to annoy me?

21
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,490
I'm here to better take care of the baby.

22
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,330
From now on,

23
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,830
we'll be like real sisters.

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,759
Mom.

25
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,220
Xiaoxuan is

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,039
carrying our Wang Yan's child.

27
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,890
After she moved closer,

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,190
it'll be convenient to visit.

29
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,450
I've really seen it all now.

30
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,660
I've never met such disgusting people before.

31
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,930
What are you mumbling about?

32
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,370
Mom,

33
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,810
don't let your anger harm your health.

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,280
Be good, Xiaoxuan.

35
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,460
What do you want to eat?

36
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,460
I'll make it for you.

37
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,170
Mom,

38
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,860
I don't have much appetite.

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,720
I don't know why,

40
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,930
but lately I've been craving sour foods.

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,020
Craving sour foods, huh?

42
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,500
Well,

43
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,100
that means you're pregnant with a boy.

44
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,550
Unlike some people,

45
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,180
who are completely useless.

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,840
What are you laughing at?

47
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,630
From now on,

48
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,610
I'll be watching someone make a fool of themselves.

49
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,800
Zhou Ran,

50
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,980
help me check if Qian Xiaoxuan

51
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,620
is really pregnant.

52
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,100
It's Zhiqing!

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,340
Zhiqing is back!

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,040
She's been a housewife for so many years,

55
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,820
and now she's able to return to the office.

56
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,600
Now,

57
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,660
we're in for quite a show.

58
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,570
Wang Yan has gone too far.

59
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,740
You're now a vice president of the company too.

60
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,190
Yet he makes you sit here.

61
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,510
No way.

62
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,770
I'm going to talk to him now.

63
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,370
He's deliberately provoking us.

64
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,530
Where we sit

65
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,850
doesn't matter.

66
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,420
What's important is

67
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,880
we need to beat him to

68
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,100
securing Jintai.

69
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,490
Na.

70
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,470
Your team's recent proposal is quite good.

71
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,980
I heard Mr. Wang praising you all.

72
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,970
Really?

73
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,380
Did Mr. Wang

74
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,300
say anything else?

75
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,970
Mr. Wang said you've been performing well recently.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,320
He's considering promoting you to supervisor.

77
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,300
Really?

78
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,250
You

79
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,360
are not kidding me, are you?

80
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,820
Why would I kid you?

81
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,530
Qian Xiaoxuan is not in the company.

82
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,550
You have the best chance of taking her position.

83
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,540
Zhou Ran,

84
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,940
before,

85
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,610
I must have misjudged.

86
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,540
It turns out

87
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,020
you're the one in the company

88
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,740
most worth getting to know deeply.

89
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
But Na,

90
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
have you heard?

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,519
Qian Xiaoxuan is pregnant.

92
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,100
It can't be Mr. Wang's child, can it?

93
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,089
Shh.

94
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,690
But

95
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,050
it doesn't make sense.

96
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,300
Qian Xiaoxuan

97
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,250
was ordering me around just a few days ago,

98
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,430
making me buy things for her.

99
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,080
Among those things,

100
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,540
there were sanitary pads.

101
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,909
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

102
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,780
How could I possibly be mistaken?

103
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,280
This Qian Xiaoxuan,

104
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,260
relying on her status as Mr. Wang's mistress,

105
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,230
she's always bossing me around.

106
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,370
All of her things,

107
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,640
I bought them all.

108
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,810
How could I possibly be mistaken?

109
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,010
I've found out.

110
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,190
As expected.

111
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,610
Qian Xiaoxuan's pregnancy is fake.

112
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,450
I knew she would pull this trick.

113
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:00,790
She thinks

114
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,210
she's the only one who can act.

115
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,610
Jintai.

116
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,690
Jintai.

117
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,430
Mr. Wang,

118
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,840
did you receive the photos and videos?

119
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,590
Was it satisfying enough?

120
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,350
If not,

121
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,970
I have something even more explosive.

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
Who are you really?

123
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,700
I am your

124
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,460
grim reaper.

125
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,620
Are you willing to make a deal with me now?

126
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,360
In your hands,

127
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,790
there are only those few photos and videos, right?

128
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,360
If those are not enough,

129
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,370
I have something even more explosive.

130
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,210
Take a look at this.

131
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,710
If you don't want to go to jail,

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,480
just do as I said last time.

133
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,820
Get the money ready

134
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,410
and wait for my message this afternoon.

135
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,300
I don't have that much money, I...

136
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,740
Hello?

137
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,500
For the sake of the company and family,

138
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,420
I need to find legal evidence against Wang Yan as soon as possible.

139
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,140
I won't give up.

140
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,500
What's wrong?

141
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,410
Why so loud?

142
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,650
Mr. Wang.

143
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,940
Come in.

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,320
While I was cleaning up the workstation,

145
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,200
I found some things left behind by Qian Xiaoxuan.

146
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,250
There's also a package.

147
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,430
How would you like to handle it?

148
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,440
Throw them away.

149
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,700
Wait.

150
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,730
Just leave them here.

151
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,360
This drug will create the illusion of pregnancy.

152
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,860
Well, well.

153
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,080
Qian Xiaoxuan.

154
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,140
How dare you deceive me?

155
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,230
Qian Xiaoxuan.

156
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,850
How dare you betray me?

157
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,260
Haven't I been good enough to you

158
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,340
all these years?

159
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,500
What are you talking about?

160
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,580
Still putting on an act with me, aren't you?

161
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,610
I've already destroyed the account book.

162
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,550
Only we know its contents.

163
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,060
Now that the information has leaked,

164
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,540
who else could it be but you?

165
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,170
I really don't know.

166
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,780
Feng Lulu, Zhou Ran,

167
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,460
and your mother.

168
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,420
They're all around you.

169
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,300
Any of them could have accessed the account book.

170
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,460
I only told you about this.

171
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,200
If it wasn't you,

172
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,789
who else could it be?

173
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,299
I really don't know.

174
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,740
How would this benefit me?

175
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,140
I'm carrying your child.

176
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,380
Why would I want to hurt you?

177
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,380
My child?

178
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,290
Is anything you say true?

179
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,620
Let's go.

180
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,490
Let's go to the hospital.

181
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,500
I want to see if what you're saying is actually true.

182
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,790
Let's go.

183
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,220
You lied to me.

184
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,960
You're not even pregnant.

185
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,810
You're afraid I'll dump you, aren't you?

186
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,990
You took me for a big fool.

187
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,200
Wang Yan,

188
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,430
listen to my explanation.

189
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,830
Bitch.

190
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,500
I hate being lied to more than anything.

191
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,380
Wang Yan.

192
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,290
Don't go.

193
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,310
I did this because I love you.

194
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,980
Stay away from me from now on.

195
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,100
Don't let me see you again.

196
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,540
Wang Yan.

197
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,520
Wang Yan.

198
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,110
[One hour later, Yunding Building]

199
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,230
What are you doing?

200
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,220
Hey, Chen Xiao.

201
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,300
Meet at Yunding Building in an hour.

202
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:01,860
Son.

203
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,310
Son.

204
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,700
Hello.

205
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,490
Throw the bag into the garbage truck.

206
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,440
Immediately.

207
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,100
Impossible.

208
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,460
If you want to make a deal, it has to be in person.

209
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,300
There's no room for negotiation.

210
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,220
This is your only chance.

211
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,780
Hello?

212
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,040
Follow that garbage truck.

213
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,060
Get lost!

214
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060
Move aside, quickly!

215
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,250
Hello?

216
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,460
Mr. Wang,

217
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,210
we've found the truck.

218
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,020
Mr. Wang,

219
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,670
we've dug through the garbage.

220
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,180
They've taken the bags.

221
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,280
The driver has fled too.

222
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,850
I did manage to copy the dashcam footage.

223
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,980
Take a look at this.

224
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,060
Everything is ready.

225
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,860
Let's go.

226
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,620
Li Zhiqing.

227
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,420
I'm going to kill you.

228
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,780
It's so satisfying today, Senior.

229
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,220
It's been a pleasure working with you.

230
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,910
Senior,

231
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,620
do you remember when we were in school?

232
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,740
You always dragged me to skip classes.

233
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,400
It was clearly you who didn't want to turn in homework.

234
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,660
So many years have passed in the blink of an eye.

235
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,500
If only we could turn back time.

236
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,020
What do you mean?

237
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,040
I wouldn't have let you marry Wang Yan.

238
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,260
Not bad, Senior.

239
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,280
You're almost ready to graduate.

240
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,620
This is just the beginning.

241
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,860
In the future, you'll see

242
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,700
a completely different Li Zhiqing.

243
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,620
We still have a lot to do.

244
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,180
Don't worry,

245
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,420
no matter what,

246
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,860
I'll always be on your side,

247
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,240
Senior.
