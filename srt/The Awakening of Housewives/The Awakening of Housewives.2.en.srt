[The Awakening of Housewives]

00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,380
[Episode 2]

3
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,760
I'm sorry,

4
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,010
I walked into the wrong room.

5
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,430
Wait,

6
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,190
what if that old woman sees us?

7
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,380
Don't worry.

8
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,600
She'll be out of my life soon.

9
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,780
Zhiqing,

10
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,670
you're my best friend.

11
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,180
No matter what happens,

12
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,930
I'll always be by your side.

13
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,830
What if she doesn't agree to divorce?

14
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,050
I have ways to make her divorce.

15
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,380
Maybe we can stage an accident

16
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,289
to make her disappear completely.

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,180
After all, that old woman trusts me a lot now.

18
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,190
If she doesn't divorce,

19
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,150
then we'll stage an accident

20
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,310
to make her disappear completely.

21
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,280
Watch where you're walking! Are you trying to get yourself killed?

22
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,420
Who?

23
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,570
Dad?

24
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,390
Dad, what brings you here?

25
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,460
I came to consult you,

26
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,900
Mr. Wang.

27
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,890
Dad,

28
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,980
please don't call me that.

29
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,320
I wouldn't dare

30
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,240
accept such an honor.

31
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,810
I wouldn't dare to overpraise you.

32
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,900
I wanted to ask about

33
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,830
the company's accounts from the past 6 months.

34
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,860
A large sum of money is missing.

35
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,890
What's going on?

36
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,440
Is there?

37
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,000
How could there be a discrepancy?

38
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,870
Did Zhao Ninghao tell you this?

39
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,790
You know,

40
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,579
he's always had a bias against me,

41
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,040
the Vice President.

42
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,370
And

43
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,350
he's been coveting Zhiqing

44
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,650
for quite some time.

45
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,340
Bullshit!

46
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,860
I was planning to retire,

47
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,590
but I haven't gone senile.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,370
What are you trying to do?

49
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,840
Do you want to

50
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,030
transfer the company's money

51
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,550
and take it

52
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,130
for yourself?

53
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,420
Dad,

54
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,310
you handed the company over to me

55
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,930
with your own hands, right?

56
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,500
So whatever the company has become now

57
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,640
is none of your business anymore.

58
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,070
Besides, you're getting old;

59
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,730
wouldn't it be better to enjoy your retirement?

60
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,500
Worrying too much

61
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,580
can lead to sudden death.

62
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,300
You...

63
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,320
You little bastard!

64
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,560
Wang Yan,

65
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,400
you ungrateful beast!

66
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,400
I trusted you so much

67
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,390
and put you in the position of the Vice President.

68
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,860
Who was it that

69
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,960
knelt down and begged me to join the company?

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,120
Without the Li family,

71
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,610
you'd be worse than

72
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,350
a dog.

73
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,980
I can lift you up,

74
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,640
and I can also bring you down.

75
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,390
I'll notify them

76
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:46,060
to hold a shareholders' meeting tomorrow.

77
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,860
Just wait!

78
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,890
Li Qingdong!

79
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,920
You've finally spoken your mind.

80
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,120
It must have been exhausting holding it in for so long.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,670
From the day I entered this family,

82
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,760
you've looked down on me.

83
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,150
You despise my family background

84
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,310
and my education.

85
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,400
Deep down,

86
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,540
you've always believed that I'm not good enough for your daughter.

87
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,880
You little bastard!

88
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,860
How dare you speak to me like this!

89
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,900
What are you trying to do?

90
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,760
It doesn't matter whether you look down on me.

91
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,000
Next, I'll make you watch

92
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,460
as I take everything away

93
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,170
from you and your daughter.

94
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,010
Dad!

95
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,880
How is my dad's condition?

96
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,090
The doctor said the chairman

97
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,590
is temporarily out of life-threatening danger.

98
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,270
How could my dad

99
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,180
have fallen down the stairs?

100
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,660
Who found him?

101
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,090
Wang Yan.

102
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,950
Wang Yan?

103
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,660
Why was he there?

104
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,640
I told the chairman

105
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,060
there was a problem with the company's accounts,

106
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,650
and he suspected Wang Yan was behind it,

107
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,830
so he went to confront him

108
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,730
to get to the bottom of it.

109
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,610
Good thing I came,

110
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,880
or

111
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,790
I wouldn't have heard you two

112
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,800
spouting nonsense.

113
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,840
Your father fell

114
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,900
because of his weak legs.

115
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,920
If it weren't for my son

116
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,060
rushing him to the hospital,

117
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,370
he wouldn't be lying

118
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,580
here right now.

119
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,480
This is all your fault.

120
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,620
You knew he had trouble walking,

121
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,810
yet you're always busy fooling around.

122
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,430
You can't even take care of your own father!

123
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,900
Please mind your words.

124
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm talking to my daughter-in-law.

125
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,780
Who do you think you are to interrupt?

126
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,800
Or are you sleeping with her too?

127
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,200
Enough!

128
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,170
If he really did it,

129
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,030
I won't let him get away with it.

130
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,350
This is a hospital room.

131
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,680
Please leave.

132
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,310
Hello.

133
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,860
The number you dialed is temporarily…

134
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,770
Hello?

135
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,510
Are you Jia's grandmother?

136
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,320
Jia, are you feeling better?

137
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,160
Don't worry.

138
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,830
Grandma will be there to pick you up soon.

[Jia's kindergarten teacher]

140
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,210
Hello?

141
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,650
Is that Jia's teacher?

142
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,260
Jia just had

143
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,320
a high fever,

144
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,540
but we couldn't reach you.

145
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,060
What?

146
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,860
I'll go pick her up right away.

147
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,820
Her grandma just picked her up.

[Mother-in-law]

149
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,960
Ms. Li,

150
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,020
the surgery plan is ready.

151
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,760
Your father has severe intracranial bleeding

152
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,500
and needs an immediate craniotomy

153
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,560
by a specialist from another province.

154
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,520
If delayed,

155
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,870
he may never wake up.

156
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,520
However,

157
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,770
the cost is quite high.

158
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,720
Please consider it carefully.

159
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,150
If you decide to proceed,

160
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,580
the payment must be made in full today.

161
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,540
No need to consider further.

162
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,170
I'll pay right away.

163
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,630
Okay.

164
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,280
Sorry, Ma'am,

165
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,330
but all your cards have insufficient funds.

166
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,510
That's impossible.

167
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,400
I have enough money in there.

168
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,860
You need to think of a way quickly,

169
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,500
or we won't be able to book the specialist in time.

170

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,610

172
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,070
Six Circles, huh?

173
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,500
Pung!

174
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,240
East Wind.

175

Three Characters.

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,750

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,770
Why is it so hot?

183

Jia is in such a state,

187
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,330
why didn't you take her to the hospital?

188
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,760
I gave her a fever-reducing pill.

189
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,910
It's just a kid getting sick—

190
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,090
what's the big deal?

191
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,150
Look at you.

192

Let's go.

194
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,990
We're going to the hospital.

195
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,060
I'm claiming the title to win!

196
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,320
Let's go again!

197
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,810
Let's play another round!

198
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,770
Let's play another round!

199
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,700
My position isn't good.

200
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,800
If a fever isn't treated in time,

201
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,240
it can indeed lead to meningitis,

202
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,370
which may cause temporary speech impairment.

203
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,720
But in this child's case,

204
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,830
I believe it's psychological.

205
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,290
Spend more time with her, talk to her,

206
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,900
and she might recover that way.

207
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,590
Thank you, doctor.

208
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,430
Hello?

209
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,120
Ms. Li,

210
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,930
we've scheduled the expert's time.

211
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,290
The surgery will take place in the next few days.

212
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,090
But the cost…

213
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,220
Someone has already paid for me.

214
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,480
Paid?

215
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,470
Who paid for me?

216
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,540
Jia,

217
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,990
what's wrong?

218
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,040
Are you still feeling unwell?

219
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,460
Tell Mom

220
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,480
what you want to eat.

221
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,620
Jia, talk to Mom, please.

222
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,670
How is Jiajia doing?

223
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,750
The fever is gone,

224
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,230
but she still can't speak.

225
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,660
How could this happen...

226
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,250
Was it you

227
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,500
who paid for my dad's surgery?

228
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,910
The surgery is urgent.

229
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,230
Don't worry about the money for now.

230
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,840
Just think of it as a loan.

231
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,620
You can pay me back when you have it.

232
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,000
Jia,

233
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,660
we're home.
