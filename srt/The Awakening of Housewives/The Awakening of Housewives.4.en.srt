[Episode 4]

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,390
It's you.

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,710
Ms. Li,

5
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,700
you remember me?

6
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,660
I saw you at the company two months ago.

7
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,110
It was you who took the photos?

8
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,590
Why did you do all this?

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,920
A girl who hadn't yet entered the workforce

10
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,670
was dragged by a friend to attend a drinking party.

11
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,550
There,

12
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,890
she met the illustrious Wang Yan.

13
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,440
[Three years ago]

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,590
Mr. Wang, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,430
I'm late.

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,780
Come on.

17
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,910
Come on, hurry up.

18
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,660
Come this way.

19
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,730
Excuse me, coming through.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,740
This is the CEO of Dongqing Company.

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,960
Hello, Mr. Wang.

22
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,630
Zhou Ran.

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,789
Sorry for arranging this meeting here on such short notice.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,830
It's alright. I'll have a drink first.

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,270
Drink up.

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,950
Come on, Mr. Wang, have a drink.

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,750
We'd like to toast to Mr. Wang as well.

28
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,789
Come on, everyone.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,190
To Mr. Wang.

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,910
Drink up, everyone.

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,380
Zhou Ran, have a drink.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,229
You're Zhou Ran, right?

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,270
Come on, let's have a drink.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,789
Wait a moment.

35
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,870
The young lady just graduated.

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,350
Is it appropriate for you to toast like this?

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,789
What kind of drinks do you have?

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,990
I'll drink on her behalf.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,550
Alright.

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,970
Mr. Wang is so considerate.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,990
Come on.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,590
Here you go, Mr. Wang.

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,390
I'll drink for her.

44
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,550
Okay?

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,870
She thought

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,550
she had met the first important person in her life,

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,750
but what she didn't expect was...

48
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,870
We're leaving, Mr. Wang.

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,940
What awaited her

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,590
was not a bright future,

51
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,990
but a dark hell.

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,270
Remember to send me a WeChat message when you get home.

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,230
Be safe.

54
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,990
Okay, Mr. Wang.

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,050
Zhou Ran.

56
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,590
Are you alright?

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:28,950
Here,

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,290
here,

59
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,790
drink some mineral water.

60
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,700
Thank you.

61
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,270
At that time,

62
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,330
that girl was too young.

63
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,950
Afterwards, she was left with nothing but fear.

64
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,310
But what made her most desperate was

65
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,390
three years later,

66
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,630
she actually encountered him again at the company where she was interning.

67
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,390
Come here, Zhou.

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,950
Come over here.

69
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,670
Come on.

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,390
Let me introduce you to someone.

71
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,210
This is Mr. Wang.

72
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,860
This is our new employee.

73
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,590
Not bad, Mr. Sun.

74
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,350
You have a good eye.

75
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,460
But that devil doesn't remember her at all.

76
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,670
Yet her life

77
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,110
has already been completely ruined by this scumbag.

78
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,140
So you want to use me against Wang Yan?

79
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,230
Yes.

80
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,910
I initially wanted to take revenge on you too,

81
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,579
but I realized you knew nothing about it.

82
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,430
You've been kept in the dark by this despicable couple.

83
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,990
Are you so sure I'll cooperate with you?

84
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,310
Because you and I are the same,

85
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,710
we're both victims.

86
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,590
Most importantly,

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,830
we both want this scumbag to be ruined.

88
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,310
You're right,

89
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,710
but there's one thing I need to correct.

90
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,350
I don't just want them to be ruined.

91
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,990
I also want them to face legal consequences.

[Private meeting in hotel]

93

[Setting a trap]

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,750
What do you think of that Qi around Wang Yan?

95
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,190
Are you referring to the rumors about her taking kickbacks in the company?

96
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,590
Is there any evidence?

97
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,550
I've already found

98
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,350
the contact person.

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,030
But

100
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,990
we still need a pretext.

101
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,750
Senior,

102
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,300
if you want to hit the target,

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,910
first

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,430
you need to calm down.

105
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,790
Then you can make a precise strike.

106
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,190
Excuse me.

107
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,710
I'll try to get the transfer records.

108
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,550
Alright,

109
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,740
I'll find an opportunity

110
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,630
to fire her.

111
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,950
You've been working with Mr. Wang for quite some time, haven't you?

112
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,270
This matter of taking kickbacks,

113
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,710
you should know how to handle it, right?

114
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,630
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhao.

115
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,750
I won't dare to do it again.

116
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,350
Considering you're a long-time employee,

117
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,540
I suggest you resign voluntarily.

118
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll give you the full compensation.

119
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,909
Can you help me?

120
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,790
I need to find a way to get close to him first.

121
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,870
I can figure out a way

122
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,110
to get rid of his executive assistant.

123
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,670
The rest

124
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,190
is up to you.

125
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,190
Come in.

126
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,470
Mr. Wang,

127
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,180
I'm here to apply for the position of executive assistant.

128
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,790
Not bad.

129
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,350
Mr. Wang.

130
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,390
I'm also here to apply for the executive assistant position.

131
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,350
Xiaoxuan sent me.

132
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,110
Have you worked as an executive assistant before?

133
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,230
I...

134
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,350
I have.

135
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,950
At my previous company,

136
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,630
I was an executive assistant for two and a half years.

137
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,390
It's my duty to help the boss with their concerns.

138
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,870
In terms of experience and ability,

139
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,030
I'm certainly

140
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,190
much more capable than the person next to me.

141
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,430
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

142
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,910
It's alright.

143
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,700
Let me help you.

144

Xiaoxuan.

145
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,390
Mr. Wang,

146
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,630
you're very busy.

147
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,550
Lu is one of my people.

148
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,830
She's very experienced.

149
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,190
Why don't we let her help you?

150
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,540
Sure,

151
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,230
let's do that then.

152
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,950
Tomorrow with Langcheng,

153
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,270
there's a very important meeting.

154
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,990
For the project proposal,

155
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,990
you'll be the one to give the report.

156
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,910
Okay,

157
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,760
got it.

158
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,770
Xiaoxuan, what should I do?

159
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,710
It's just one night.

160
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,790
How can I come up with such a big proposal?

161
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,100
Langcheng is a big client.

162
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,190
Which project team was following up with Langcheng before?

163
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,510
But why would she give the proposal to me?

164
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,950
If she doesn't give it to you,

165
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,630
can't you figure out a way?

166
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,190
In the workplace,

167
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,110
if you want to get things done,

168
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,550
you need to use your brain.

169
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,710
I'll be going now.

170
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,190
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,190
Our daughter is back.

172
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,790
We have a guest.

173
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,550
Zhiqing has been waiting for you for a while.

174
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,950
Come, sit down and have dinner.

175
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,530
Yes, indeed.

176
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,070
Zhiqing came specially to see us.

177
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,550
And she brought so many things.

178
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,950
That's really too kind.

179
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,150
It's my pleasure.

180
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,190
Xiaoxuan is my best friend.

181
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,950
We're like family.

182
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,590
Right, Xiaoxuan?

183
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,870
If you have anything,

184
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,190
couldn't we talk outside?

185
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,390
did you have to come to my house?

186
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,430
What are you saying?

187
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,430
Zhiqing coming here,

188
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,950
isn't it just like coming home?

189
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,550
This child.

190
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,110
Exactly.

191
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,430
Yes.

192
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,590
Some things

193
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,070
are better said at home.

194
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,190
if we talk outside,

195
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,990
it would feel distant.

196
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,750
Let's talk outside.

197
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,390
Oh, don't.

198
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,350
It's fine here at home.

199
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,590
Yesterday,

200
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,750
didn't you come to my house too?

201
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,290
Is that so?

202
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,150
Uncle and Auntie,

203
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,270
don't you know?

204
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,120
Yesterday,

205
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,590
Xiaoxuan said her house had no water,

206
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,270
so she came to my place to take a shower.

207
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,070
She was even naked,

208
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,150
wearing a bathrobe,

209
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,110
having dinner with my husband.

210
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,410
This...

211
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,350
What's going on here?

212
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,550
Congratulations, Xiaoxuan.

213
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,470
We used to be sisters,

214
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,310
but from now on,

215
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,670
we'll be family.

216
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,670
Enough.

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,830
Not enough.

218
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,510
Uncle, Auntie,

219
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,150
I'm here today on behalf of Wang Yan to propose marriage.

220
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,070
From now on, I'll be the first wife,

221
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,430
and Xiaoxuan will be the second wife.

222
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,630
We'll be one big happy family.

223
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,990
I'll create a WeChat group for us.

224
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,830
Have you been drinking before you came here?

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,270
Why are you talking nonsense?

226
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,070
How is this nonsense?

227
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,910
The room number is 4023, right?

228
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,870
The video of you and my husband in a hotel room.

229
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,470
Do you want me to open Uncle and Auntie's eyes?

230
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,670
Qian Xiaoxuan.

231
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,710
What's going on here?

232
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,590
Come here.

233
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,870
Li Zhiqing.

234
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,790
What do you mean?

235
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,710
You deliberately said that for my parents to hear.

236
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,270
You're really disgusting.

237
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,070
You're the disgusting one.

238
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,820
You loose woman!

239
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,710
Did you think I was nice to you before

240
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,190
so you can bully me as you please?

241
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,510
Then you're wrong.

242
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,910
From childhood to adulthood,

243
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,550
no one has ever dared to bully me.

244
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,550
What are you doing?

245
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,270
Later,

246
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,230
don't shout too loudly.

247
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,790
Xiaoxuan.

248
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,940
Open the door, Xiaoxuan.

249
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,590
If you don't open the door, I'm calling the police.

250
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,430
Zhiqing,

251
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,270
open the door.

252
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,950
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,790
Uncle, Auntie.

254
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,590
Sorry for the disturbance.

255
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,590
When I have time,

256
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,790
I'll come visit again.

257
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:41,890
Oh, right.

258
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,470
Daughter.

259
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,510
Xiaoxuan,

260
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,110
the apartment the company gave you,

261
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,750
I've already had it taken back.

262
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,110
Your things

263
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,270
are all left outside.

264
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,110
Hurry and get them.

265
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,350
Also,

266
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,110
don't forget,

267
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,950
things that aren't yours,

268
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,290
don't take them.

269
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
Li Zhiqing.

270
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,310
I'll remember this grudge.

271
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,430
Next time,

272
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,790
I'll make you wish you were dead.

273
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,080
♫Why do the roses you gave wither at midnight♫

274
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,640
♫Why does the love in your eyes seem like a game♫

275
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,910
♫Why do impossible things always break hearts♫

276
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,410
♫You arrive like from heaven, then turn and leave♫

277
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,670
Darling,

278
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,670
marry me.

279
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,320
♫I call out with no response♫

280
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,130
♫If the warm equatorial winds could reach the North Pole♫

281
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,680
♫If the brightest evening star appeared in broad daylight♫

282
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,290
♫If the vast plains could echo back♫

283
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,670
Would you love me forever?

284
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,400
♫Could I enter the depths of your heart?♫

285
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,790
I will love you forever.

286
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,690
♫If migratory birds never left♫

287
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,350
♫If raindrops could fall on the moon♫

288
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,630
For a lifetime,

289
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,520
for eternity,

290
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,180
♫Could I keep you by my side♫

291
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,050
♫Like the wind holds onto clouds♫

292
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,460
What's wrong?
