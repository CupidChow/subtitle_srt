00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,350
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,229
You're Ms. Li, right?

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,600
I can tell right away

5
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,870
that you're here for a divorce consultation.

6
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,170
Do I look like someone with an unfortunate marriage?

7
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,380
Of course not.

8
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,500
I was just joking.

9
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,750
Ninghao

10
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,910
has already told me about

11
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,620
your request.

12
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,000
I heard

13
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,990
you're the most famous divorce lawyer.

14
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:57,039
Overrated.

15
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,620
I wouldn't say the best.

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,110
However,

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,310
my clients

18
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,390
generally give me great feedback,

19
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,440
especially

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,720
since they come back to me

21
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,870
for their second divorce.

22
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,700
You're quite humorous.

23
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,949
So,

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,710
did you bring all your evidence and materials?

25
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,280
I, Chen Xiao,

26
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,220
under the instructions of

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,110
Wang Yan from Dongqing Company,

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,530
deliberately drugged his wife, Li Zhiqing,

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,110
and

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,150
fabricated evidence of her infidelity.

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,110
Later, Wang Yan paid me again;

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,030
he asked me

33
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
to kidnap his own biological daughter

34
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,130
to threaten his wife, Li Zhiqing.

35
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,490
To be honest,

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,430
after handling divorce cases for so many years,

37
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,910
I've seen my fair share of scumbags.

38
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,410
But someone as despicable as Wang Yan

39
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,700
is truly rare.

40
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,550
Rest assured,

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,390
I will make sure he walks away with nothing

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,540
and is completely ruined.

43
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,890
Thank you.

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,630
Are you done talking?

45
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,830
What's wrong?

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,080
Something on your mind?

47
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,530
My mom

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,710
set me up for a blind date tonight.

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,070
I don't want to go.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,710
Why don't you give it a try?

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,230
Don't make your mom worry.

52
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,070
You should try to move forward.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,630
We

54
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,910
can't let that scumbag keep holding us back forever.

55
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,950
Wang Yan,

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,030
I've done quite a few things for you, haven't I?

57
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,310
And yet, you betrayed me.

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,750
What do you mean?

59
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,110
I told Wen that I would repay the money for you.

60
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,150
Still talking tough when you're at death's door?

61
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,940
Chen Xiao.

62
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,480
You!

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,270
No matter how much you want, I'll give it to you.

64
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,269
I'll even pretend you were never here.

65
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,490
You're definitely

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,230
paying up.

67
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,149
However,

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,630
there's something else I need from you.

69
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,870
What?

70
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,870
The hard disk.

71
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,470
There's no hard disk.

72
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,350
How much money do you want?

73
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,470
I'll give you all of it.

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,010
There's no hard disk.

75
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:36,950
It's too late!

76
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,550
In this line of work,

77
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,150
reputation matters.

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,950
If you don't want to suffer,

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,030
just spit it out.

80
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,550
I told you,

81
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,870
there's no hard disk.

82
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,630
What are you doing?

83
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,750
Say it or not?

84
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,710
There's no hard disk.

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,110
Do you have it now?

86
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,560
No.

87
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,360
Do you have it?

88
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,060
No.

89
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,750
Do you have it or not?

90
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,300
Boss.

91
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,840
We found it.

92
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,159
Untie yourself.

93
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,860
Let's go.

94
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,170
What's going on, Wang Yan?

95
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,430
What happened?

96
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,630
It's gone.

97
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,840
It's over.

98
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,630
Everything is over.

99
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,430
I have nothing left.

100
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,110
How could you have nothing left?

101
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,170
You still have me, Wang Yan.

102
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,350
By the way,

103
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,110
I have something to tell you.

104
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,750
You...

105
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,310
I want the company.

106
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,350
I want status.

107
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,990
I want money!

108
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,190
I want endless money to spend.

109
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,909
Can you give me all of these?

110
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,190
For you,

111
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,870
are these the only things that matter the most?

112
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,710
What about me?

113
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,490
What about me?

114
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,950
You...

115
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,830
Of course you're important.

116
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,230
You're all I have left.

117
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,750
Chen Xiao took the hard disk;

118
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,710
it contains transaction records for every project.

119
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,560
If it ends up in Li Zhiqing's hands,

120
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,270
we're both finished.

121
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,550
Chen Xiao likes you,

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,630
right?

123
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,150
Go find him now.

124
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,830
No matter what it takes,

125
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,950
get that hard disk back for me.

126
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,350
Where are you going?

127
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,030
I'm going to find Li Zhiqing.

128
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,110
Come on, cheers!

130
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,030
Let's go.

131
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,850
Jia,

132
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
come to Dad.

133
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,710
No.

134
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,470
Jia,

135
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,760
I'm your real father.

136
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,350
Who does he think he is?

137
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,590
Who do you think you are?

138
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,950
He's my real father.

139
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,630
Wang Yan, what do you mean?

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,110
What do I mean? I'm going home.

141
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,910
Going back to that lousy rental of yours?

142
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,870
Then what's the point of blocking my way here?

143
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,910
I've already hired a lawyer

144
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,390
and officially filed for divorce.
You'd better get ready.

145
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,710
Someone will be contacting you in the next few days.

146
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,510
And

147
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,450
as for all those shady things you've done,

148
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,630
I've handed over the evidence to my lawyer.

149
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,030
You'd better watch out.

150
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,620
You...

151
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,470
What are you trying to do?

152
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,669
Guy,

153
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,150
stay away from my wife.

154
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,270
You're the one who should stay away!

155
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,230
Wang Yan!

156
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,270
Well, Li Zhiqing,

157
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,970
not only are you shacking up with him,

158
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,590
but you're also trying to drive a wedge between me and Jia?

159
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,910
I never realized you were this ruthless.

160
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,230
And I never realized

161
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,750
you were such a bastard.

162
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,870
Yes,

163
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,070
I'm a bastard.

164
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,110
Woof!

165
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,750
Get out of here now.

166
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,370
Get lost!

167
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,890
Just wait, I'll tear you apart!

168
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,680
Where's the alcohol?

169
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,430
Bring me some drinks.

170
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,710
What's this drunk playing at?

171
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,870
He's clearly a loser.

172
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,830
Who knows?

173
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,150
What a buzzkill.

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,390

175
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,230
Come on, cheers!

[Li Zhiqing]

177
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,130
Hello, Ms. Li.

178
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,590
I've got the stuff with me.

179
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,510
It wasn't easy getting it, you know.

180
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,030
So, I'm gonna have to trouble you

181
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,190
to send a little more cash my way.

182
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,360
Chen Xiao,

183
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,190
you're going too far.

184
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,510
If I hadn't helped you pay off that debt,

185
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,870
do you think Wen and his guys would've let you go?

186
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,710
Let's keep this simple.

187
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,750
Two million in cash.

188
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,430
You'll get your stuff right away if the money is transferred.

189
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,390
If you don't pay up,

190
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,390
I'll have to have a chat with Qian Xiaoxuan.

191
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,730
Fine.

192
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,310
I'll give it to you.

193
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,710
Where are you?

194
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,270
I'm at the bar.

195
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,150
Come and get it.

196
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,590
Turn yourself in.

197
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,670
Confess to the police and you'll be treated leniently.

198
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,430
There's no one else.

199
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,630
Just me.

200
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,310
Wang Yan sent you here?

201
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,800
Where's the hard disk?

202
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,110
I just don't understand.

203
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,270
He treats you like this,

204
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,470
yet you're still helping him?

205
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,830
It's none of your business.

206
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,790
You're too late.

207
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,110
I've already given the drive disk to Li Zhiqing.

208
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,620
Does she have something on you,

209
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,840
or are you in some kind of trouble?

210
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,590
I can help you fix it.

211
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,650
Name

212
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,560
your terms.

213
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,950
From your tone,

214
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,950
it sounds like whatever conditions I propose,

215
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,750
you'll agree to them all?

216
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,910
Name your price.

217
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,830
Come back with me,

218
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,520
and I

219
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,900
will name a price.

220
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,390
Just say it here.

221
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,870
Are you sure?

222
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,020
Li Zhiqing will be here any moment.

223
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,440
[Chen Xiao]

224
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,990
Wait.

225
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,270
Do you have any alcohol?

226
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,670
Trying to set the mood, huh?

227
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,510
You've got quite a few tricks up your sleeve.

228
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,430
I used to

229
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,510
look down on Wang Yan,

230
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,950
but now I'm actually quite envious of him.

231
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,240
I've got even more tricks to show you.

232
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,470
Do you want to give it a try?

233
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,230
The alcohol...

234
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,910
What did you put in my drink?

235
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,600
[Li Zhiqing]

236
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,870
Where are you, Chen Xiao?

237
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,070
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,670
You're too late, Li Zhiqing.

239
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,990
Qian Xiaoxuan got what she wanted.
