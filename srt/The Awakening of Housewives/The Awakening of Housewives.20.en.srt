♫I publicly declared that I had long let go of it♫

188
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,020
What are you going to do next?

189
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,760
♫I'm not afraid of the dark and silence♫

190
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,470
I'm going to

191
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,030
take my dad to have a road trip.

192
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,250
♫What's there to fear?♫

193
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,440
I'll entrust the company to you.

194
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,540
Before I leave,

195
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,470
♫Sometimes, I'm afraid of setting off fireworks♫

196
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,400
is there something you haven't told me yet?

197
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,310
♫Sometimes, I'm afraid of tears falling down uncontrollably♫

198
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,920
What do you mean?

199
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,890
Weren't you going to invite me to an art exhibition?

200
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,330
♫Sometimes, I'm afraid of going home at night♫

201
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,490
Do you want to go back on your word?

202
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,960
♫But I'm afraid of breaking promises, enduring emptiness and having illusions♫

203
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,810
♫I'm afraid of late nights, auditory senses and unscientific ways♫

204
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,960
♫Your joy doesn't resonate with mine at all♫

205
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,800
♫But I'm afraid of being rejected and misunderstood♫

206
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,660
♫I'm afraid of knowing afterwards how urgent it is to leave♫

207
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:39,700
♫I've cried myself out but you didn't even notice it♫

208
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,110
Are you shivering?

209
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,860
No, I'm not.

210
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,230
You clearly are.

211
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,380
Never mind.

212
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,850
Let's go home.

213
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,310
Fine. Let's go home.

214
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,450
You think I'm scared?

215
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,910
Just wait and see.

216
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,200
[The crew of this drama solemnly declares that we firmly oppose domestic violence, marital infidelity and interfering in others' marriages.

217

[We advocate promoting traditional virtues, respecting the elderly and caring for the young, maintaining gender equality, marital fidelity and family harmony. We encourage resolving disputes through legal channels and support victims in seeking legal aid.]

218
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,900

219
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,900
[Let us work together to build a harmonious and stable society, and protect citizens' personal safety and legal rights.]
