[Episode 19]

3
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,540
Hello, Mr. Gu.

4
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,950
How's the project going now?

5
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,170
It's going even more smoothly than we imagined.

6
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,050
The shareholders are all very satisfied.

7
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,170
I've already spoken with them.

8
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,800
At tomorrow's board meeting,

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,110
you'll see for yourself.

10
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,140
Wang Yan has brought some shareholders here.

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,390
They're all waiting for you in the conference room.

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,460
They say they want to hold a shareholders' meeting.

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,680
I think something's not right.

14
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,730
Okay.

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,630
I understand.

16
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:20,180
Wang Yan.

17
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,750
You've put on quite a show here.

18
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,690
But if I remember correctly,

19
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,340
you were suspended, weren't you?

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,000
You're not qualified to hold any shareholders' meeting.

21
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,450
The chairman

22
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,850
left half of the shares to me.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,070
Besides, today

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,590
we're just here to vote

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,610
to elect a new CEO, aren't we?

26
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,060
Fine.

27
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,450
Let's proceed as you say then.

28
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,740
Well then,

29
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,170
thank you all shareholders for your trouble.

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,140
Those who agree that I

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,710
should replace Li Zhiqing

32
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,210
as the new CEO of the company,

33
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,170
please show your support.

34
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,030
Raise, raise your hands.

35
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,570
Mr. Gu.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,780
Raise your hand!

37
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,240
Are you finished?

38
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,570
No.

39
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,010
The shares in my possession,

40
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,010
plus those in your hands,

41
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,600
exceed 51 percent, don't they?

42
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,579
The will you mentioned,

43
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,730
is it this one?

44
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,510
This is my father's will.

45
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,890
But on this,

46
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,690
your name isn't mentioned.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,710
That will you have is fake.

48
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,000
Even, even without these shares,

49
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,750
I've secured the company's biggest project.

50
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,670
Shouldn't I be the one to take your position?

51
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,960
Right, Mr. Gu?

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,750
What project?

53
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,140
Mr. Wang, what are you talking about?

54
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,810
Have you lost your mind?

55
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,890
Are you done?

56
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,180
It's my turn to speak now.

57
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,520
Wang Yan.

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,260
From today on,

59
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,030
you have been

60
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,070
completely fired from the company.

61
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,370
Mr. Gu,

62
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,500
didn't we have an agreement?

63
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,890
Yes, we did,

64
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,079
but you

65
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,430
arrived one step later than your wife.

66
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,430
However, you need to remember,

67
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,110
this is just a will.

68
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,740
For it to take effect,

69
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,040
you still need to meet the conditions stated above.

70
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,020
Otherwise,

71
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,520
it's just a piece of waste paper.

72
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,950
Take care, Mr. Wang.

74
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,460
Thank you, Uncle Gu.

75
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,670
Have a seat.

76
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,170
What are you thanking me for?

77
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,680
If it weren't for your father,

78
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,520
I'd still be selling shoes at the entrance of the pedestrian street.

79

[Will]

80
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,980
If Wang Yan continues to hesitate,

81
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,800
you can use this will

82
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,810
to give him a push.

83
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,550
These two together,

84
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,190
that's enough.

85
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,100
That Wang Yan is greedy.

86
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,170
This trap,

87
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,500
he'll definitely have to fall for it.

88
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,040
You all conspired to trick me.

89
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,990
Where's my money?

90
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,430
Money?

91
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,850
You mean

92
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,920
the money you embezzled from the company?

93
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,490
It's been returned

94
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,760
to the company's account.

95
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,420
Don't you hate Li Qingdong anymore?

96
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,740
Didn't you always want his shares?

97
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,950
I do want money,

98
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,470
but I also know

99
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,540
that whether it's

100
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,510
in business or in life,

101
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,060
one must learn to be grateful.

102
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,970
Otherwise, biting the hand that feeds you

103
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,430
is no different

104
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,820
from a dog.

105
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,490
You...

106
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,680
Do you know

107
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,670
where you failed?

108
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,570
You

109
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,760
shouldn't have messed with that woman.

110
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,650
I've heard everything.

111
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
Give up.

112
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,700
You have no chance left.

113
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,470
No,

114
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,820
the opportunity has just arrived.

115
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,909
The company, shares, money,

116
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,870
you've lost everything.

117
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,790
What do you have left to fight Li Zhiqing with?

118
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:46,990
Shh,

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,950
what if I told you

120
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,100
all of this

121
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,110
could possibly

122
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,430
be mine?

123
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,030
What are you talking about?

124
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,910
Now Li Qingdong is dead.

125
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,070
and Zhiqing and I are not divorced.

126
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,080
I am also an heir.

127
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,300
If Li Zhiqing ends up like Li Qingdong,

128
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,410
wouldn't everything belong to me?

129
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,870
Are you insane?

130
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,850
Do you still have that drug?

131
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
The drug.

132
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,040
That drug.

for a lifetime.

137
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,340
Li Zhiqing.

138
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,880
Wang Yan is going to make a move on you.

139
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,380
Be careful.

What does he want to do?

00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,120
Tonight is your wedding anniversary.

142
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,690
He will go to you.

143
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,840
He hasn't noticed that you have a change of heart, has he?

144
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,580
He's very arrogant.

145
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,460
He thinks I'm completely obedient to him.

146
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,810
Oh, right.

147
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,010
Remember,

148
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,320
don't drink anything he gives you.

149
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,450
Okay, I got it.

150
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
What are you doing here?

151
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
I've made up my mind.

152
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,140
I agree to the divorce.

153
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,590
We can discuss any matters at the company tomorrow.

154
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,580

the company shares,

161
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,990
I don't want any of it.

162
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,680
I'll leave with nothing.

163
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,780
I'll leave Jia with you too.

164
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,040

Everything is so familiar.

Wang Yan,

00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,010
what tricks are you trying to pull this time?

172
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,630
I know there's no medicine for regret in this world.

173
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,090
So I came this time to say,

174
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,350
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,450
I was wrong.

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,350
Once I sign this,

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,320
our marriage will be completely over.

178
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,480
I'll stay away from you and the child.

179

Remember,

190
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,930
don't drink anything he gives you.

191
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,790
You think I've drugged the drink?

192
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,320
I want to drink

193
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,660
yours.

194
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,510
Alright.

195
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,350
I know you don't trust me.

196
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,200
It's okay.

197
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,070
Drink this one from me.

198
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,550
Li Zhiqing,

199
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,860
of all your calculations,

200
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,410
you didn't expect today, did you?

201
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,830
Wang Yan.

202
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,670
What do you mean?

203
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,210
She believed it.

204
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,480
Of course.

205
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,480
She thinks I really betrayed you.

206
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,920
So tonight,

207
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,990
she will definitely drink that glass from you.

208
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,370
After tonight,

209
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:22,970
all of this

210
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,060
will belong to us.

211
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,340
I knew it,

212
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,780
you're the best to me.

213
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,840
Trying to use Qian Xiaoxuan against me.

214
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,400
Little did you know

215
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,090
she would be so loyal to me, did you?

216
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,890
By the time you see this Weibo post,

217
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,220
I will no longer be in this world.

218
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,190
I've been tormented by depression every day.

219
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,430
My beloved father

220
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,400
has also left me a few days ago.

221
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,690
I will leave all my inheritance

222
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,530
to my husband, Wang Yan.

223
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,120
Although we've had our disagreements in the past,

224
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,720
with my farewell,

225
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,820
everything will come to an end.

226
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,930
Tomorrow at 9 o'clock,

227
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,010
send it on time.

228
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,360
I never thought

229
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,740
our marriage would end this way,

230
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,780
and my wife would...

231
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,490
Would leave like this.

232
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,540
I still find it hard to accept.

233
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,520
My mind is filled

234
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,320
with every little memory of her.

235
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,150
I...

236
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,080
I've let her down. I...

237
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,250
The sunset must be beautiful today.

238
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,380
Naughty.

239
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,670
You're finally here.

240
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,150
Today

241
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,110
must be a bright and sunny day.

242
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,580
Pack up and seal all of Wang Yan's belongings.

243
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,470
Alright.

244
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,090
Where's Wang Yan?

245
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,850
Over there.

246
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,810
Impossible.

247
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,110
Hello, Mr. Wang,

248
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,890
Ms. Li has brought the police to arrest you.

249
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,260
Where is he?
