[The Awakening of Housewives]

2
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,510
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,680
There's always a way out.

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,990
How did you get it?

5
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,990
Now you can rest assured, right?

6
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,550
I'm so tired.

7
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,080
I want to hug you.

8
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,560
What do you mean?

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,910
You're disgusted with me?

10
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,110
I just drank too much.

11
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,990
I'm tired.

12
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,289
I want to get some sleep.

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,270
What do you mean?

14
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,590
Come back!

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,630
Do you think

16
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,030
I managed to get it back because

17
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,550
something happened between Chen Xiao and me?

18
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,590
I told you before.

19
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,350
No matter what method you use,

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,070
as long as I get it back, that's all that matters.

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,000
As for Chen Xiao, that bastard,

22
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,830
I'll make sure he comes to a bad end.

23
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,750
Mr. Gu,

24
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,710
why did you call me here

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,590
so urgently?

26
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,949
Take a look at this.

27
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:08,970
[Will]

28
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,350
I found this

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,470
when I sent someone to sort out the chairman's documents.

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,950
I never expected

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,070
Li Qingdong to leave half of his shares to me.

32
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,110
No wonder Li Zhiqing kept it from me all this time.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,790
This is what they say

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,670
when all seems lost,

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,110
a new path

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,070
emerges.

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,750
With these shares,

38
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,430
plus yours,

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,150
our chances of winning are a lot bigger.

40
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,460
A high chance of winning?

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,670
In business,

42
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,630
a high chance of winning

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,390
means there's still risk.

44
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,630
We need to make it foolproof.

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,510
Once

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,910
we secure that project,

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,230
I will persuade the other shareholders.

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,670
By then, the company

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,870
will surely be ours.

50
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,390
But remember,

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,030
this is just a will.

52
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,870
For it to take effect,

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,230
all conditions stated must be met.

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,070
Otherwise,

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,710
it's just a worthless piece of paper.

56
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,950
Take care, Mr. Wang.

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,150
So?

58
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,390
[Last Will Notarization]

59
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,960
I went to the notary office and confirmed it.

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,430
The will is real.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,750
What's wrong?

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,110
You don't trust Mr. Gu?

63
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,630
It's not that I don't trust Mr. Gu.

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,829
I just don't trust Li Zhiqing.

65
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,070
Since it's real,

66
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,710
I can rest easy now.

67
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,630
The doctor just finished examining your father.

68
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,990
The results should be out soon.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,630
Okay.

70
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,270
Thank you.

71
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,070
No big deal.

72
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,030
Ms. Qian, right?

73
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,070
Why did you come alone?

74
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,110
Where's the father of the child?

75
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,670
He...

76
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,830
He's busy.

77
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,830
And I'm still in the early months.

78
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,230
So I came by myself.

79
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,830
Okay.

80
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,350
Please have a seat and wait for a bit.

81
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,470
I'll call you when it's your turn.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,890
Here.

83
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,470
Baby, be good.

84
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,310
Don't move around.

85
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,510
Don't make things hard for your mom.

86
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,150
We'll meet soon.

87
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,910
Honey, water.

88
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,430
Wait.

89
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,590
Let me get it for you.

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,110
Here.

91
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,270
Congratulations.

92
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,050
You've finally got what you want.

93
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,350
What do you want?

94
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,750
You know exactly how many awful things

95
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,150
Wang Yan has done.

96
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,630
Do you really think it's worth having a child

97
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,750
with someone like him?

98
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,110
Didn't you have one with him too?

99
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,070
I don't care what he's done.

100
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,090
All I know is

101
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,870
when I was at my lowest,

102
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,550
Wang Yan helped me.

103
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,630
You're not the only woman

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,230
he's helped.

105
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,950
So what?

106
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,430
Don't think that with just a few words,

107
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,430
you can drive a wedge between us.

108
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,630
Has it ever occurred to you

109
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,950
that he's just using you?

110
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,310
Once you're no longer useful to him,

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,350
he'll throw you away

112
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,550
like trash.

113
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,590
I think you're the pathetic one.

114
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,150
You're old.

115
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,230
Your husband doesn't even spare you a glance.

116
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,910
Ms. Li,

117
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,510
why did you come here from the inpatient department?

118
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,070
Your father's results are out.

119
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,430
All indicators look good.

120
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,909
He'll probably wake up in a few days.

121
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,950
Thank you.

122
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,909
It's my job.

123
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,150
You heard it clearly?

124
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,750
Is that really what the doctor said?

125
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,150
If that old man wakes up,

126
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,420
this will would be useless.

127
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,110
Yes.

128
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,270
And then

129
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,350
the fact that you pushed him down the stairs

130
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,710
probably won't stay hidden either.

131
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,190
He's waking up at the worst possible time.

132
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,430
Li Zhiqing.

133
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
What do you mean?

134
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,909
I don't even have company access now?

135
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,430
Didn't HR notify you?

136
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,550
They must have forgotten.

137
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,590
I'm officially notifying you

138
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,230
that you're suspended.

139
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,510
Don't go too far.

140
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,270
This is a normal personnel change,

141
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,550
and

142
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,190
it was decided by the board of directors.

143
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840
Go home and wait for further notice.

144
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,710
Li Zhiqing!

145
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,550
Wang Yan!

146
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,550
Don't make me call security.

147
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,670
Fine.

148
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,870
Just you wait.

149
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,790
Mr. Wang.

150
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,990
Who are you?

151
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,310
Hello.

152
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,070
I'm Ms. Li's lawyer.

153
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,550
Do you have a moment?

154
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,150
Sorry.

155
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,630
I'm not in the mood.

156
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,470
Mr. Wang,

157
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,030
it's better to have a conversation

158
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,790
with me than with people from the court.

159
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,510
Don't you think?

160
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,470
This is a

161
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,970
[Divorce Agreement]

162
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,340
divorce agreement.

163
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,150
It's okay.

164
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,620
I have plenty more here.

165
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,430
My wife and I love each other very much.

166
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,870
We won't divorce.

167
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,190
Here's the thing.

168
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,350
I'm just here

169
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,670
to complete the formalities.

170
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,510
Ms. Li

171
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,830
has already submitted

172
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,110
the relevant evidence to us.

173
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,110
Based on my 20 years of experience,

174
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,870
the court

175
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,470
will definitely rule in favor of the divorce.

176
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,030
Moreover,

177
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,070
the evidence

178
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,110
overwhelmingly

179
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,350
works against you.

180
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,110
So,

181
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,790
I suggest you voluntarily agree to some terms,

182
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,830
such as

183
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,510
forfeiting all assets

184
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,910
and the custody of the child.

185
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,670
This way,

186
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,310
it saves

187
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,150
both parties time

188
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,990
and

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,950
allows you

190
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,070
to retain some dignity.

191
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,910
Are you done?

192
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,090
If you're done.

193
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,470
take your bag and get out.

194
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,310
Then

195
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,790
I'll just remind you

196
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,710
that you really don't have much time left.

197
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,190
By the way, Mr. Wang,

198
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,630
do you know

199
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,470
the relationship

200
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,030
between law and metaphysics?

201
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,430
They both ensure

202
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,830
scumbags don't get away.

203
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,750
That's why I said

204
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,780
you're just not cut out for family life.

205
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,110
Look at this place.

206
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,390
Why didn't you clean it up?

207
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,830
It's much cleaner than when you were here, right?

208
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,110
Just say it.

209
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,030
What brings you here?

210
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,150
Don't beat around the bush.

211
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,750
I heard

212
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,150
you asked my son for a divorce.

213
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,670
You even hired

214
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,830
a lawyer.

215
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,710
Divorces are always initiated by men.

216
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,870
If anyone's asking for a divorce,

217
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,470
it should be my son asking you.

218
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,310
He cheated on me first.

219
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,910
What right does he have to ask for a divorce?

220
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,230
Can you show me some respect?

221
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,710
I'm your mother-in-law.

222
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,310
You were.

223
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,630
Once the marriage is over,

224
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,990
you're nothing.

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,670
You...

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,750
Fine.

227
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,830
I won't argue with you.

228
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,270
I should

229
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,030
act my age, after all.

230
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,110
You just

231
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,230
want Jia, right?

232
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,710
You can have Jia.

233
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,110
But the company

234
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,390
and this house

235
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,230
stay with my son.

236
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,870
That's fair, right?

237
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,190
Are you kidding me?

238
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,870
My father established the company.

239
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,270
I bought

240
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,310
this house.

241
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,310
When Wang Yan moved in,

242
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,830
he was drowning in debt.

243
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,150
What right does he have to negotiate with me?

244
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,390
One day as a couple, a lifetime of grace.

245
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,310
Wang Yan

246
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,830
is Jia's father, after all.

247
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,390
He doesn't deserve that title.

248
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,950
Jia's greatest misfortune

249
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,190
is having a father like him

250
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,390
and a grandmother like you!

251
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,270
Li Zhiqing!

252
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,750
You... You've gone too far!

253
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,670
Get out!

254
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,190
I won't let you have peace!

255
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,640
I won't let you have peace!

256
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,110
Whether you divorce or not,

257
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,710
I won't let you have peace!

258
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,390
Bye bye.

259
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,590
I absolutely won't let you have peace!

260
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,390
♫Happy birthday to you♫

261
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,580
♫happy birthday to you♫

262
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,010
♫Happy birthday to you♫

263
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,540
♫Happy birthday to you♫

264
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,530
Happy birthday.

265
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,770
What's wrong?

266
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,880
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

267
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,550
Wang Yan,

268
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,550
let's leave.

269
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,830
Where to?

270
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,430
Grab some money

271
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,760
and go to a place where no one knows us.

272
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,790
I won't leave.

273
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,110
Wang Yan, be clear-headed, okay?

274
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,430
Don't sink any deeper.

275
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,670
I am very clear-headed.

276
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,150
I can't give up now.

277
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,510
Otherwise, everything I've worked for

278
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,190
would be for nothing.

279
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,870
I want to take back everything...

280
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,310
everything I've lost before!

281
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,110
If we leave now, it's not too late.

282
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,910
If Li Zhiqing's father wakes up,

283
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,150
it will be too late for everything.

284
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,710
Then I'll find a way

285
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,600
to make sure he never wakes up.

286
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,430
What did you say?

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,750
Nothing.

288
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,390
Nothing,

289
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,030
Baby.

290
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,750
Today is your birthday.

291
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,830
I booked a bar just for you.

292
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,990
You can invite a lot of friends

293
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,150
to celebrate with you.

294
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,150
Remember,

295
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,320
the more people, the better.

296
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,510
Make it lively.

297
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,270
No matter what we did in the past,

298
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,990
I just want to be with you now.

299
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,310
Okay, I understand.
