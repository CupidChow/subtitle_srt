[The Awakening of Housewives]

00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,500
[Episode 8]

3
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,120
You haven't beaten Wang Yan.

4
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,490
Don't rush.

5
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,820
This is just the beginning.

6
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,310
The kindling has been piled up.

7
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,380
We just need to stoke the fire.

8
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,050
This is the secret recipe I obtained.

9
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,810
It's made of the powder of mugwort and tangerine peel

10
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,330
and mixed with water.

11
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,210
Ms. Wang from the mahjong club said

12
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,850
it can cure muteness.

13
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,850
Do you think this is drinkable?

14
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,250
Of course, it's drinkable.

15
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,010
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,410
I don't want others to know

17
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,770
my granddaughter is mute.

18
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,050
I do it

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,450
for the good of you and your daughter.

20
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,289
Then, you drink it.

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,170
I'm not mute.

22
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,770
This is for Jia.

23
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:30,930
Where's her?

24
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,770
Where did she go?

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,770
It is none of your business.

26
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,530
I am her grandmother.

27
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,930
I have the right to know her whereabouts.

28
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,250
Then, drink it.

29
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,210
I told you.

30
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,410
It's not drinkable.

31
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,970
You...

32
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,770
As long as you don't come to disturb Jia anymore,

33
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,810
I'll be grateful.

34
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,900
I won't.

35
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,370
If you don't get divorced with Wang Yan,

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,010
I will never let you go.

37
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,329
Jia,

38
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,530
what are you drawing?

39
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,560
Show it to me, okay?

40
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,010
What is this?

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,630
Zhou Ran,

42
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,610
I need you to do me a favor.

43
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,490
Can I send Jia to your place

44
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,530
and entrust you to look after her for a few days?

45
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,050
I can't endure making her

46
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,210
in such a terrible condition.

47
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,250
Don't worry.

48
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,450
My mom is very attentive.

49
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,010
She will take good care of Jia.

50
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,329
Thanks for her.

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,950
What an awful report!

52
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,760
Mr. Wang,

53
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,410
this is the third termination contract

54
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,850
sent by companies.

55
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,950
They all want to terminate the contracts, huh?

56
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,250
I helped them make so much money.

57
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,530
Now they're kicking me while I'm down?

58
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,550
[Ms. Bai of Jintai Group]

59
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,440
Hello?

60
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,520
Ms. Bai?

61
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,970
You don't want to sign the contract with Jintai, right?

62
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,090
Do you know how many companies

63
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,130
are lining up and begging to cooperate with Jintai?

64
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,370
I know, I know.

65
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,450
I can explain.

66
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,970
The whole incident is a setup.

67
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,050
Someone is trying to frame me and Dongqing.

68
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,370
Enough. I don't care about it.

69
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,690
This is the most crucial time to sign contracts.

70
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,990
You know your value

71
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,010
to the company, right?

72
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,170
Yes.

73
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,650
If you can't clean up this mess,

74
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,650
you'd better give up this project as soon as possible.

75
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,010
I see.

76
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,450
Ms. Bai.

77
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,570
Don't worry.

78
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,250
I will resolve this matter.

79
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,450
Hello?

80
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,770
Hello?

81
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,350
Ms. Bai?

82
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,550
What do you want to do?

83
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,450
To laugh at me?

84
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,409
I have no spare time

85
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,570
to care about you and that bitch.

86
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,290
What I care about is Dongqing.

87
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,650
It's none of your business.

88
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,810
I can't just stand by and

89
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,610
watch you destroy Dongqing.

90
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,730
Several companies have already proposed to terminate their contracts

91
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,810
and a few more

92
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,570
have sent legal letters to make a claim.

93
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,970
How are you going to resolve this?

94
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,990
This is not my fault.

95
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,210
If not,

96
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,210
then who should be blamed for?

97
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,090
Qian Xiaoxuan?

98
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:26,970
Yes,

99
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
it's her fault.

100
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,690
So,

101
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,590
are you planning to pin the blame on her?

102
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,610
None of your business.

103
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,850
Wang Yan,

104
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,010
you are a sneaky bastard.

105
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,250
Isn't she the mistress

106
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,409
of Mr. Wang?

107
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:45,970
Exactly.

108
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,650
How does she have the nerve to come to work?

109
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,810
I want to talk to you.

110
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,810
Li Zhiqing.

111
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,450
Your tactics are despicable.

112
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,930
To deal with a bitch,

113
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,920
I have to use the matching trick.

114
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,370
What exactly are you trying to say?

115
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,970
After things are exposed,

116
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,490
do you think Wang Yan will still protect you?

117
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,360
At least I won't be abandoned like you.

118
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,930
I think you underestimate Wang Yan.

119
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,130
This is not my fault.

120
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,130
If not,

121
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,170
then who should be blamed for?

122
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,050
Qian Xiaoxuan?

123
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,250
It's her fault.

124
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,450
You fabricated the recording.

125
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,010
You'll know

126
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,130
whether I fabricated it.

127
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,700
You're trying to drive a wedge between us.

128
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,610
Let me tell you, Li Zhiqing,

129
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,490
Wang Yan loves me.

130
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,370
He would never do this.

131
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,210
This incident

132
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,570
is extremely serious.

133
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,490
Someone has used despicable means to smear my reputation.

134
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,170
As the person in charge of the company,

135
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,930
I cannot endure it.

136
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,250
Therefore, I am announcing a personnel dismissal today.

137
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,210
Qian Xiaoxuan,

138
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,840
[Dongqing Trading Company]

139
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,920
you are fired.

140
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,130
This entire incident was

141
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,450
plotted by Qian Xiaoxuan.

142
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,210
She seduced me,

143
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,810
and after I rejected her, she continued to harass me.

144
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,410
Finally,

145
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,730
she was so cunning that she took videos and photos,

146
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,360
attempting to blackmail me.

147
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,250
Who did it?

148
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,500
Lu.

149
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,409
Can't you read the air?

150
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,530
She's your boss.

151
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,650
Shouldn't you go help her?

152
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,450
She doesn't need my help.

153
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,170
As soon as she takes off her clothes,

154
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,410
those men will come over like lapdogs

155
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,650
to help her.

156
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,410
I was wondering why she was promoted so quickly.

157
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,130
It turns out she's using the ruse of self-injury.

158
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,050
Do you all hate me so much?

159
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,810
We are low-level employees.

160
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,250
We don't dare do so.

161
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,210
We have to come up with plans,

162
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,090
take out your trash,

163
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,090
clean your apartment, and scrub your toilet according to your wish.

164
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,250
Believe it or not,

165
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,130
I'll be back in this office.

166
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,810
Remember what you said today.

167
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,049
Get lost.

168
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,850
Why are you back again?

169
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,850
Now, do you believe me?

170
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,090
You thought you were important to Wang Yan.

171
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,050
But he only cares about himself.

172
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,490
What exactly do you want?

173
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,450
Work with me against Wang Yan.

174
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,810
Why should I help you?

175
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,650
Do you

176
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,530
still want to rely on men to get promoted?

177
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,050
You've seen Wang Yan's true colors today.

178
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,330
Men are not reliable.

179
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,170
I'm offering you

180
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,290
a shortcut.

181
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,490
As long as you have leverage over Wang Yan,

182
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,490
you won't be abandoned again.

183
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,930
Haven't you wanted to

184
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,490
set up your own company?

185
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,450
I can provide you with funding.

186
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,290
I'm only giving you one chance.

187
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,450
Wait.

188
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,290
What do you want?

189
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,650
The company pays you high salaries.

190
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,410
Now，

191
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,490
none of you can step up to solve the problem.

192
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:58,850
Say something.

193
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,530
Are you all mute?

194
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,070
You,

195
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,450
pack your things and get out.

196
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,850
Why haven't you left yet?

197
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,530
Shouldn't you be the one leaving?

198
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,120
Who let him up here?

199
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,480
Call security.

200
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,490
I asked him to come.

201
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,930
The CEO of Hongming admitted it

202
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,670
that Mr. Zhao shouldn't be responsible for the failure of the project.

203
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,730
So,

204
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,550
you have no reason to fire him.

205
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,650
You are not a member of this company either.

206
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:42,890
Both of you,

207
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,370
get out of here.

208
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,290
Everyone

209
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,690
has been with my father all along.

210
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,690
This company is my father's life's work.

211
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,690
I can't stand by and watch it collapse.

212
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,130
so,

213
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,930
I'm preparing to return to the company.

214
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,490
What do you think the company is?

215
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,950
Your playground?

216
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,490
You think you can come and go as you wish?

217
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,530
Wang Yan,

218
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,050
I have shares in the company.

219
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,650
You're not the only decider.

220
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,930
I disagree.

221
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,350
I agree.

222
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,210
The company is on the edge of a cliff.

223
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,970
We need someone to save it.

224
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,980
No.

225
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,730
Mr. Gu,

226
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,630
even if we need someone,

227
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,810
it shouldn't be her.

228
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,490
She's been away from the workplace

229
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,730
for so many years.

230
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,410
How can she save the company?

231
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,130
This is the project proposal for Jintai.

232
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,850
I'm confident that

233
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,130
I can win back Jintai.

234
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,950
I've been handling the Jintai project.

235
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,250
Who gives you the right to interfere?

236
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,810
Jintai was handled by the chairman before the incident.

237
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,090
What does it have to do with you?

238
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,490
After what you did was exposed,

239
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,090
Jintai didn't even

240
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,210
answer your calls anymore.

241
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,650
You keep mentioning Jintai,

242
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,530
what if you can't win it back?

243
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,650
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

244
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:55,890
Fine.

245
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,660
If you can't win it back,

246
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,730
you should leave the company

247
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,860
and transfer all of your father's shares

248
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,660
to me.

249
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,650
Okay.

250
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,670
Ms. Li, they're here.

251
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,690
The shameless ones

252
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,130
did such filthy things in my car.

253
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,610
But they didn't know

254
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,210
the car is equipped with an all-weather security system.

255
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,210
Let's listen to what schemes they're plotting.

256
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,050
It might

257
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,690
be used as evidence in court someday.

258
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,210
You know what?

259
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,370
Everyone outside is gossiping about me now.

260
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,330
Baby,

261
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,650
don't take these matters seriously.

262
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,120
Someone has to take the fall.

263
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,290
I know.

264
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,970
I understand your intentions.

265
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,570
Don't worry.

266
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,530
Once I take back the company,

267
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,570
I'll make sure you take Li Zhiqing's position.

268
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,490
By the way,

269
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,770
the embezzlement hasn't been exposed, right?

270
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,490
Rest assured.

271
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,490
The account books

272
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,770
have been destroyed.

273
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,930
You still have backups, right?

274
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,810
Yes,

275
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,250
backups are on the hard drive.

276
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,610
However,

277
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,530
they'll never have the chance to get them.

278
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,810
You must keep it safe.

279
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,610
Li Zhiqing, the old woman, has already approached me.

280
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,370
She wants to drive a wedge between us

281
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,210
and asked me to gather evidence against you.

282
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,490
So, did you

283
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,810
agree?

284
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,570
Of course, I did.

285
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,650
She believed I would cooperate with her.

286
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,390
I want to

287
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,730
push her off the rooftop.

288
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,090
By the way,

289
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:40,890
here you are.

290
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:41,810
Look at this.
