1
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:02,250
Well, you and I

2
00:00:02,797 --> 00:00:04,516
are in the same hell, aren't we?

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,484
We just wanna have sex
with someone we love.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,219
Wanna be fulfilled.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,594
But those ordinary things

6
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:14,203
are seen as dirty

7
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:15,625
and disgusting.

8
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:19,969
Are you still awake?

9
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,156
I don't know what to say

10
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:25,617
but I just want an answer.

11
00:00:33,508 --> 00:00:34,531
Hello?

12
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:40,422
I'm miserable...

13
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:46,625
and anguished.

14
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:50,750
Where are you?

15
00:00:52,742 --> 00:00:53,789
In front of my place.

16
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:56,922
I'll be right over.

17
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:59,008
No.

18
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:00,781
I'll go to you.

19
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,625
You hate commuting.

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,648
I'd rather go to you.

21
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:10,422
Then…

22
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:13,305
can you come to that museum's neighborhood?

23
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:15,258
I'll be right there.

24
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:16,703
Wait for me.

25
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,789
Excuse me.

26
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:32,875
Please go to Yamate Street.

27
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:33,945
You got it.

28
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,594
Going out?

29
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,992
The company's system's acting up.

30
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,195
I'll be out a while.

31
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:56,703
It's raining quite heavily in Tokyo.

32
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:59,061
It's like when it rains, it pours.

33
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,000
Uh, "When it rains, it pours"

34
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:05,765
is a proverb that means
misfortunes happen at the same time.

35
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:24,297
I...

36
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,945
wanna have sex with you, Mr. Nakarai.

37
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:35,383
Mm.

38
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:38,297
Okay.

39
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:24,507
"When it rains, it pours"
(Episode 5)

40
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,688
In hotels,

41
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,516
I don't know why there are so many pillows.

42
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:46,734
The toothbrushes are too big.

43
00:03:49,336 --> 00:03:50,516
Are you okay?

44
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:52,547
You sure you can do this?

45
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,453
I'm nervous.

46
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,742
Like you're virgin again?

47
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:03,234
An old feeling that is quite frightening.

48
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:08,156
When was your first time?

49
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:10,164
First year of high school.

50
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:13,609
How was it?

51
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:16,390
That's confidential.

52
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:18,672
Too ashamed to share?

53
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:21,531
I have to respect my partner.

54
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:26,914
But I don't know your partner.

55
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:29,883
Even so.

56
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:35,492
You being who you are,

57
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,977
I may be fond of it quite a bit.

58
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:51,852
It's swollen.

59
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,898
May I?

60
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:33,484
Mm.

61
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:28,195
No.

62
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:29,391
I can't.

63
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:42,047
Well, may I do it as I usually do?

64
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:44,133
By "usually," you mean…

65
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:51,781
Not having to ask permission

66
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:54,383
or say I'm about to put it in.
Things like that.

67
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,133
Okay.

68
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:05,508
May I touch you?

69
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:08,531
Mm.

70
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,695
You don't have to worry that I'll break.

71
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:52,586
Mm.

72
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:29,039
It hurts, doesn't it?

73
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:31,266
It's okay.

74
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:46,391
I didn't know.

75
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,016
I really didn't know...

76
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,277
anything about you.

77
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:59,609
You can hug somebody so gently.

78
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,695
Uncomfortable, right?

79
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:06,148
No.

80
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:16,906
Just thinking the person
who doesn't want this body

81
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,367
is really taking it for granted.

82
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,297
Saying that now is cheating.

83
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:33,109
I almost cried.

84
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:38,453
Well, I'm telling the truth.

85
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,477
You're...

86
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:46,727
not bad or dirty.

87
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:08,063
You want breakfast?

88
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:09,577
I'm hungry.

89
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:11,531
Mm.

90
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,070
That's...

91
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,188
Morning sugar replenishment.

92
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:26,000
Even so.

93
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:36,633
So sweet.

94
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,227
Which bread do you want?

95
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:42,719
Give me that baguette.

96
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:45,500
Here.

97
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,875
By the way, that museum.

98
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:56,515
I heard it's closing on
the 17th of next month.

99
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:57,914
Yeah?

100
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:00,211
Well, nobody visits it.

101
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:03,023
I'm kind of sad about that.

102
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:04,164
Really?

103
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:07,555
Why are you so indifferent?

104
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,492
I'd love to see that statue one more time.

105
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:12,984
I'll pass.

106
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:20,133
I feel like things started there.

107
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:23,742
So I'm afraid something
else is gonna happen.

108
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,226
Mr. Nakarai,

109
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:31,891
I can't tell if you're brave or cowardly?

110
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,867
Sorry about that.

111
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:37,219
Why? It's okay.

112
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,664
It's good that you're like this.

113
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:52,250
I'm glad you came to me yesterday.

114
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:55,336
You cried and said you were miserable.

115
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:57,000
I didn't cry.

116
00:11:58,555 --> 00:12:00,359
Honestly, why did you come?

117
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:06,000
I wanted to keep a secret too.

118
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:09,406
From Fujisawa Kazuaki?

119
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:11,359
Yes.

120
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:14,554
He's hiding something from me.

121
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,320
Whatever it is,

122
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:20,367
despite my curiosity, I don't wanna know.

123
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:26,914
What about you?

124
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:31,180
For me,

125
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:34,126
to cheat but ever get caught.

126
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,094
Well, we're both men.

127
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,406
Yes.

128
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:46,805
Let's get on the same page first.

129
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:51,203
Neither of us will break up
with our significant others.

130
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:53,422
Nothing will change

131
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:55,992
and get destroyed.

132
00:12:57,883 --> 00:12:58,750
Yes.

133
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,891
I'm gonna go.

134
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,445
It's still raining.

135
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:08,984
I know.

136
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:20,789
Here. Money for the room.

137
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,109
I'm off.

138
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,352
What is it?

139
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:39,445
Don't want me to go?

140
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:42,750
No.

141
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:44,961
I don't want you to go.

142
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,203
What are you on about, idiot?

143
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:55,063
I'm serious.

144
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:01,313
That's even worse.

145
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:34,547
What now?

146
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,250
What should we do?

147
00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:42,359
That's already the case.

148
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:45,594
What should we do?

149
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,336
We're both crazy.

150
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,578
I guess so.

151
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:41,180
When it rains, it pours.

152
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:42,336
Hm?

153
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:45,352
I heard it on the radio

154
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:47,469
on my way here.

155
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:51,367
Sounds...

156
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:54,641
like us, doesn't it?

157
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:07,553
(Kaori: missed call)

158
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:09,046
(I was bored being alone,
so I came to my parents.)

159
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:10,352
(I'll go straight to work tomorrow.)

160
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:47,485
You're back.

161
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,102
The problem. Was it solved?

162
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,281
Mm, eventually.

163
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,047
It was a bit tricky.

164
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:01,914
That's good.

165
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:06,086
I'm a little tired.

166
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:07,766
I'm gonna shower and take a nap.

167
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,727
Mm, go ahead.

168
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,320
Are you okay?

169
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:51,672
About what?

170
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:54,508
Well,

171
00:17:54,664 --> 00:17:56,672
physically and other things.

172
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:01,664
Don't worry about me now
after doing it several times.

173
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,524
What about you?

174
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,320
My girlfriend was out when I got home.

175
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,281
But she goes to her parents' a lot anyway.

176
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:14,047
Probably just to kill time.

177
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:16,641
Don't talk like you don't care.

178
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:18,695
You'd better go pick her up.

179
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,281
It's fine.

180
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:24,414
Don't worry, Mr. Nakarai.

181
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,820
Ah!

182
00:18:29,914 --> 00:18:30,969
I'm so tired.

183
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:32,750
- Yeah.
- Mm.

184
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:34,891
Wanna get something to drink?

185
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,336
Mm. Oh.

186
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:37,625
- Just a second.
- Mm.

187
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,578
What's wrong?

188
00:18:55,195 --> 00:18:56,524
What are you doing?

189
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:00,406
I forgot my ID on my desk.

190
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:03,883
We can't get around if we stay late
and don't have our ID.

191
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,297
We have to report to the admin department.

192
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:11,117
But an admin is
bothering others himself?

193
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,453
Come on, hurry up and open it.

194
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:16,477
I'll buy you some sweet coffee.

195
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:22,664
Just thinking the person
who doesn't want this body

196
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,922
is really taking it for granted.

197
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,906
Hagiwara?

198
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,203
I don't want coffee.

199
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:52,258
I want you, Mr. Nakarai.

200
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:00,070
Don't talk crazy.

201
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:03,313
I know.

202
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,289
Hagiwara.

203
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:10,610
We already agreed...

204
00:20:12,516 --> 00:20:14,281
that we wouldn't destroy anything.

205
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:18,078
Yes.

206
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,641
I know.

207
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,289
But...

208
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,024
when I saw your face, I couldn't do it.

209
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:35,906
Calm down.

210
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:39,985
Can you really calm down?

211
00:20:41,477 --> 00:20:43,344
Don't you understand how I feel at all?

212
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:49,360
Am I alone in thinking these things?

213
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:53,430
You've got your secret now.

214
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:55,531
So you're satisfied.

215
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,539
And it's over?

216
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:09,102
I'm sorry.

217
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,516
I'll call security for you.

218
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:29,961
- You're back.
- I'm back.

219
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:31,492
Oh, here.

220
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:33,336
There's a delivery.

221
00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:35,835
- Thank you.
- Mm.

222
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,961
Have you eaten?

223
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,156
I have. I took a client out to dinner.

224
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:43,281
Is that so?

225
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:49,742
I'm gonna take a shower.

226
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:50,891
Mm.

227
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:26,250
- Kaori, have you seen my phone...
- Tokyo will still have clear skies

228
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:27,506
and continue to have good weather.

229
00:22:27,507 --> 00:22:29,084
The north wind will let up,

230
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:32,420
allowing the warmth
of sunlight during the day.

231
00:22:33,023 --> 00:22:35,515
But there is a possibility
of an abrupt change.

232
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:36,422
No way.

233
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:52,906
(Nakarai Sei 080-022-0119)

234
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:16,399
Mr. Nakarai, it's me, Hagiwara.

235
00:23:16,953 --> 00:23:19,250
I'm sorry. Kaori found us out.

236
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,531
She checked my phone

237
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:23,844
and took it with her.

238
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,078
So from now on,
if you're contacted by my phone...

239
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:33,977
Eh?

240
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:45,437
(Next episode)

241
00:23:45,438 --> 00:23:47,258
Let's leave each other alone.

242
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:49,211
I'm not your pet dog, Kaori.

243
00:23:49,414 --> 00:23:50,375
I've always known.

244
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:52,602
Don't you talk about him to me!

245
00:23:52,758 --> 00:23:53,789
I'm sorry, Sei.

246
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:54,735
Mr. Nakarai.

247
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:56,633
If you cry where I'm not around,

248
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:58,203
please let it be my fault.

249
00:23:58,382 --> 00:23:59,711
I don't get it at all.
