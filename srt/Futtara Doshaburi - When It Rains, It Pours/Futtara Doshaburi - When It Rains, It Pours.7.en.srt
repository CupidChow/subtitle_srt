1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:02,422
Get out of here. You guys broke up?

2
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:03,813
Keep it down.

3
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:07,563
Well, why?

4
00:00:07,664 --> 00:00:09,576
I thought you were getting married.

5
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:11,773
There were many reasons.

6
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:13,953
Was it infidelity?

7
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,304
It was, wasn't it?

8
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:17,117
I'm not telling you.

9
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:18,688
Definitely infidelity.

10
00:00:19,844 --> 00:00:20,984
What about your place?

11
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:22,188
I'm moving out.

12
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:23,828
Really?

13
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:29,195
You're not changing jobs
because you want to start over, right?

14
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:31,766
Didn't you say
someone tried to poach you?

15
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,250
Mm...

16
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:36,961
Anyway,

17
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:38,953
that's life I guess.

18
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:42,563
Oh, I'm gonna buy some coffee.

19
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:56,906
Let's just...

20
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:59,336
leave each other alone.

21
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:00,992
Since then...

22
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:04,117
he's been avoiding me at work.

23
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:06,195
No.

24
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:09,164
He tries his best to avoid me.

25
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:12,539
At this point...

26
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:15,148
we're probably the same.

27
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:30,688
Since then...

28
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:33,680
Kazuaki hasn't come home once.

29
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:39,039
It's not a lie that
I'm interested in Hagiwara.

30
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:43,688
But...

31
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:46,094
it's because of my loneliness.

32
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:48,867
It temporarily lowers my guard.

33
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:52,461
(Delete the application
Share the application)

34
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:56,045
(Do you want to delete "Amadare"?)

35
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:56,522
(Delete)

36
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:09,799
Anyway, Hagiwara
broke up with his girlfriend.

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,441
What? Really?

38
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:12,961
Mm.

39
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:16,073
I don't know what the reason was,

40
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:17,644
but Hagiwara's

41
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,526
been putting on a brave face lately.

42
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:22,784
I'm worried.

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,452
It's no longer my business.

44
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:48,432
(Are you okay?)

00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:49,604
"When it rains, it pours"
(Episode 7)

46
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,511
I told you it wasn't an easy decision.

47
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:55,019
Nowadays, changing jobs is normal.

48
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:57,480
I can guarantee the terms.

49
00:03:58,417 --> 00:03:59,730
Well...

50
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:01,464
Starting over

51
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:04,284
and a change of scenery
can help you move on.

52
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:08,495
I'll give you a little more time.

53
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,105
I'll contact you again.

54
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,558
Bye.

55
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:20,860
(New email: I can't forget)

56
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,367
(I'm a 35 y/o married woman.
I can't forget about that night.)

57
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:25,878
(Let's exchange social media.
I'll send you my pics.)

58
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:36,339
Excuse me.

59
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:51,057
(Azuki Housing: Hiraiwa Taku)

60
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,479
(Ran into your co-worker.
Here's my card.)

61
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,386
(Feel free to contact me.)

62
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:54,995
A co-worker?

63
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,230
We ran into each other recently.

64
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,214
There's actually nothing to discuss.

65
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,909
So why did you come?

66
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,691
We haven't hung out in so long.

67
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:07,605
Cheers.

68
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:14,628
Ah, that's great.

69
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:17,441
Hang on.

70
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:18,667
Don't do that.

71
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:19,386
Hm?

72
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:20,902
Grill the salted one first.

73
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:26,316
What?

74
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:27,902
Nothing.

75
00:05:28,183 --> 00:05:30,597
Someone else also said that to me.

76
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:39,972
Well,

77
00:05:40,902 --> 00:05:42,066
that day,

78
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:43,659
when I ran into you.

79
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:44,863
Mm.

80
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:51,519
Back then, did I make
a sour face or something?

81
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:54,917
No, you didn't.

82
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:57,243
No?

83
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,837
That's good then.

84
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,102
Why did you ask?

85
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:04,019
Nothing, it's just...

86
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,347
Is it Mr. Hagiwara?

87
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:09,667
I ran into him again there.

88
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:14,698
It seemed like a chance meeting,

89
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:16,605
but still,

90
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,402
it felt like he was waiting for me.

91
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:24,620
Then he asked me,

92
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:28,230
"You actually wanted to
contact Mr. Nakarai, right?"

93
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,870
So I gave him my card.

94
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:33,792
A part of me didn't believe him,

95
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,542
but now that I'm talking to you again,

96
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,191
I'm grateful to him.

97
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:41,503
But...

98
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:46,385
I was wondering if I'd acted so strange

99
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,386
that I made someone
I'd just met worried.

100
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:51,355
Couldn't help wondering.

101
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:56,847
No.

102
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,597
He's just kind.

103
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,208
Probably put himself in my shoes.

104
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:06,902
Yes.

105
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,503
He's always kind.

106
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,448
- Going that way?
- Yeah.

107
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:12,948
See you around then.

108
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,256
(Gyu-ai)

109
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,292
Both today...

110
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,542
But you've done nothing wrong.

111
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,034
And back then,

112
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,933
he acted like he didn't notice anything.

113
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,816
Then too.

114
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:34,667
And then too.

115
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,855
Hagiwara's kindness...

116
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,542
always comforts me.

117
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:59,269
Completely forgot.

118
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:14,073
Sorry for not contacting you at all.

119
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:18,925
Me too.

120
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,863
I wanted to talk to you about something.

121
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:28,480
Mm.

122
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:31,230
Kazuaki,

123
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:35,495
you're a very important person to me.

124
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:39,238
And that hasn't changed.

125
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:50,715
But I don't think...

126
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,847
we could go back.

127
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,310
I've always liked you.

128
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:14,474
Since we were kids.

129
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:19,091
In a special way.

130
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:27,221
If so...

131
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:29,662
But to you,

132
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:36,123
I've always been
just a close friend, right?

133
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:39,606
So...

134
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:42,833
I...

135
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:45,677
just wanted to be by your side.

136
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:47,927
That was my thinking.

137
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,450
But...

138
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,919
the day of the accident...

139
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:07,099
I saw your parents' car
while I was in town.

140
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:11,623
I waved...

141
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:14,154
and they saw me.

142
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,005
So they stopped on the side
of the road to say hi.

143
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:22,794
They looked happy, said they'd
bought you a gift for getting a job.

144
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,427
Then they said,

145
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:29,396
"Please take care of Sei."

146
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:33,123
We parted ways.

147
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:38,162
After that their car...

148
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:42,990
If at the time...

149
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:46,029
I didn't wave at them,

150
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:49,380
didn't hold them back,

151
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:54,584
they wouldn't have been in an accident.

152
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,693
That stuff...

153
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,630
I didn't dare tell you...

154
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:04,849
that I was the reason...

155
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,724
you lost both parents concurrently.

156
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:13,373
Despite that...

157
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:17,302
I told myself I did it for you.

158
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:19,951
Then I put on a brave face.

159
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,153
Took care of you...

160
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:23,904
Kazuaki, that's enough.

161
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:27,044
The scariest thing...

162
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:30,881
was that...

163
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,123
a part of me was glad
that I got to do it.

164
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:39,919
While I took your family from you,

165
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,623
and kept you away from your friends,

166
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:48,310
I was...

167
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,333
relieved that you were relying on me.

168
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:05,231
I was happy when you said you liked me.

169
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:08,099
But that feeling...

170
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,396
was caused by
the deaths of your parents.

171
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,137
Wouldn't have happened otherwise.

172
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,185
No.

173
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:22,318
That's not it at all.

174
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:31,427
Whenever you wanted me,

175
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:34,794
there were so many times I just...

176
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:38,935
wanted to forget everything and hug you.

177
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:43,036
But...

178
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,130
that day came back...

179
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:48,145
Idiot.

180
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,560
You could've kept quiet.

181
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:54,201
Kept quiet and been my boyfriend.

182
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,107
And lived happily with me.

183
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:02,748
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:15,732
I'd always known that you...

185
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:19,388
kept something from me.

186
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:24,099
But...

187
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:27,115
I feigned ignorance.

188
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:33,263
After a while...

189
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,365
your tenderness...

190
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:40,927
became more and more unbearable.

191
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:50,521
Kazuaki.

192
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:53,888
Do you like me?

193
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:03,778
Mm.

194
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:08,552
I...

195
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:11,998
love you.

196
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:20,162
So...

197
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:23,224
what I'm about to say,

198
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,951
you must believe it 100%.
You must not doubt it.

199
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,380
Even if you didn't wave them down,

200
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:37,982
it wouldn't have changed anything.

201
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,091
No.

202
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,599
- That...
- It was predetermined.

203
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:45,489
What if...

204
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,240
they didn't go out that day?

205
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,888
Or what if they didn't drive?

206
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,513
There were countless scenarios.

207
00:14:58,802 --> 00:15:00,951
But when it comes to life and fate,

208
00:15:01,638 --> 00:15:03,185
things are already set.

209
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:10,169
As long as we're alive,

210
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,888
there are things we must accept,

211
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:17,146
even though it feels impossible.

212
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,029
You did nothing wrong.

213
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:23,349
You didn't ruin anything.

214
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,075
So...

215
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:30,435
the strength you used to support me,

216
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:35,044
I want you to use it
to make yourself happy.

217
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,325
Sei.

218
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:53,857
Take it step by step.

219
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:57,943
As for me,

220
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,544
step by step,

221
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:06,474
I'll walk with your own strength.

222
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:21,029
A sunshower.

223
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,662
I promise I will.

224
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,091
Thank you, Sei.

225
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:52,498
Mr. Hagiwara.

226
00:16:54,123 --> 00:16:55,099
Oh.

227
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:01,935
I wanted to thank you, Mr. Hagiwara.

228
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,787
Nakarai contacted me.

229
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:07,560
We met up the other day.

230
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:09,630
Is that so?

231
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:14,404
That guy had been through a lot,

232
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:17,138
but I couldn't help him at all.

233
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:20,412
It was killing me inside.

234
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,865
So getting to see him smile now,

235
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,302
it's a relief.

236
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:31,974
I'm not sure how to say this,

237
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,746
but I sense that he's fine now.

238
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,748
Kind of.

239
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:42,357
Is that so?

240
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,062
Next time let's eat together.

241
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:52,476
I had barbecue with Nakarai
the other day

242
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:56,249
and he would grill the normal meat
before the salted one.

243
00:17:58,476 --> 00:17:59,546
I know.

244
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,632
And he got annoyed
when you warned him, right?

245
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:04,077
Oh.

246
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:05,100
Yes.

247
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:09,952
Due to slightly low air pressure,

248
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:11,984
the temperature has dropped.

249
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:15,671
From now on, Tokyo may see cold rain.

250
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:16,687
The weather will...

251
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:17,960
I want to see Hagiwara.

252
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,616
I want to email him.

253
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:22,945
To hear his voice.

254
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:34,116
(Gyu-ai)

255
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:37,773
I want to see Mr. Nakarai.

256
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:42,858
I want to drink with him
and laugh about trivial things.

257
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,484
I want to kiss him.

258
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:51,218
To have sex with him.

259
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:55,827
I want us to hold each other
while listening to the rain.

260
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:58,773
I want him to tell me he likes me.

261
00:18:59,898 --> 00:19:01,273
I want to tell him I like him.

262
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:14,827
(Nakarai Sei)

263
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,327
(Do you want to delete
Nakarai Sei's contact info?)

264
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,187
(Delete)

265
00:19:22,188 --> 00:19:23,866
(Deleted)

266
00:19:31,476 --> 00:19:33,187
Ah, Nakarai.

267
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:34,764
How's it going?

268
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:37,507
I was about to look for you.

269
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,170
What's up?

270
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:42,898
Ms. Kondo from Operations
is resigning to get married,

271
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:45,243
so her intern class's
throwing a farewell party.

272
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:48,163
So would you please host the party?

273
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,570
Why me?

274
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,046
You haven't done it once.

275
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:54,405
It's not fair.

276
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:57,163
Yeah, but...

277
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:00,163
I've never even talked to Ms. Kondo.

278
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,882
Hosting parties...

279
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:06,679
Shouldn't you ask Hagiwara?

280
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:10,273
Well, he may have been gone by then.

281
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:11,796
Oops.

282
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:13,671
What does that mean?

283
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:16,085
Sorry, pretend you didn't hear that.

284
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:18,663
If you really want to know,
ask him yourself.

285
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:21,124
I'll leave you to handle the hosting.

286
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:23,178
Wait!

287
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:34,859
"May have been gone by then"?

288
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:43,114
(Shinomiya: FYI,
Hagiwara's on leave today.)

289
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:44,694
(Ask him tomorrow if you must.)

290
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,037
(Reply)

291
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,694
(New email: Monday 17 March)

292
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:52,882
By the way, that museum.

293
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,366
I heard it's closing
on the 17th of next month.

294
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,609
Seriously?

295
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:44,530
Want an umbrella?

296
00:21:45,507 --> 00:21:47,327
I have a folding one.

297
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:51,507
Thought you didn't have one.

298
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:53,866
I bought it.

299
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:56,022
Because I'm moving soon.

300
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:03,202
May I ask why?

301
00:22:05,562 --> 00:22:06,726
You may.

302
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:08,702
But it's a long story.

303
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:12,546
I'll listen no matter how long it is.

304
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,476
The same goes for you.

305
00:22:19,023 --> 00:22:21,312
What does "he may have
been gone by then" mean?

306
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:25,866
I'm not going anywhere.

307
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:29,038
If you wanna hear it,
it'll take a while.

308
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:32,749
Forget it then.

309
00:22:33,195 --> 00:22:34,351
Liar.

310
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:49,960
I like you, Hagiwara.

311
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,546
I wanna be with you.

312
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:00,780
I wanna be with you too.

313
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,538
That's all?

314
00:23:29,234 --> 00:23:30,452
Let's start by...

315
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:32,554
giving me your email address.

316
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:45,000
(This is a work of fiction)
