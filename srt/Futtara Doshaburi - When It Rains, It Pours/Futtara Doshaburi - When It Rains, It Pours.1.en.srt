00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,850
Mm...

2
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:15,766
Oh, you're back?

3
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,250
Thought you went for a drink.

4
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:18,257
Just a little bit.

5
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:19,250
Really?

6
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:22,554
Let me sit here.

7
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:26,273
All right.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,648
Wait, that's mine.

9
00:00:36,148 --> 00:00:37,343
What are you looking at?

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,086
Emailing a list of restaurants
for the intern class reunion.

11
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:42,875
I was gonna email it to myself

12
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:45,211
but I sent it to the wrong email address.

13
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:46,109
Eh?

14
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:48,836
Who mistypes their own email address?

15
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:50,508
This guy right here.

16
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:51,953
Right in front of you, Kaori.

17
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,063
Eh?

18
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:00,953
Anyway.

19
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:03,758
Ms. Ayako invited me to her house.

20
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:05,703
She invited you too, Kazuaki.

21
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:09,406
Ms. Ayako just moved into her new house.

22
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:13,711
She said one day she wanted to
open a beauty salon at home.

23
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,081
I have to dry my hair.

24
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,574
Or I'll catch a cold.

25
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:34,089
Okay.

26
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:55,871
Before

27
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:58,949
there was never a table between the beds.

28
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:02,558
Is it raining?

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,324
You're right.

30
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:09,956
It's noisy.

31
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:15,968
It's gonna keep me up.

32
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:35,546
The next thing I knew,

33
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,390
the beds slowly moved away from each other.

34
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,140
Even if I reach out,

35
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:43,913
I can't make contact.

36
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:48,796
A ninja

37
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:50,858
is jumping over the grass

38
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,265
that gets higher every day.

Sorry for contacting you at night.

46
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:10,796
Did you get an email
from Gourmet Map today?

47
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:14,327
I was trying to email it to myself
but I sent it to the wrong person.

48
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,499
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:17,687
Either way, I apologize.

51
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:36,526
Sorry.

52
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:37,737
Did I wake you?

53
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:38,979
No.

54
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:41,479
Did you go out?

55
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:42,706
Went to a bookstore.

56
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:46,276
I suddenly thought of the book
I'd seen during the day.

57
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,166
But now that I think about it,

58
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,338
there's no need to hurry.

59
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:53,331
I can get it tomorrow.

60
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:55,885
What's up with you?

61
00:04:56,987 --> 00:05:02,862
Sometimes I can't stop my impulsiveness.

62
00:05:03,518 --> 00:05:05,128
My body just moves on its own.

63
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,206
Taking action is a good thing.

64
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:12,698
That's a good point.

65
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:18,213
It's raining.

66
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:39,635
Good night.

67
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,128
Go to sleep.

68
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:36,760
At this house,

69
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,362

Oh.

73
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:55,038
You must be thinking,
"If you're gonna slack off, just leave."

74
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:56,531
Not at all.

75
00:07:57,726 --> 00:07:59,530
It's my boyfriend.

76
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,453
He's a bit controlling.

77
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:02,796
It's annoying, right?

78
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,329
"When will you be home after OT?"

79
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:06,828
or "What will you eat at lunch?"

80
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,413
I have to tell him everything.

81
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,476
Do you make him report
to you too, Shinomiya?

82
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:12,281
No.

83
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:15,116
I just snoop on his phone.

84
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,593
Seriously?

85
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,311
Well, I'm afraid he'll cheat on me.

86
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:21,828
Everyone knows that all of our secrets...

87
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:24,304
are on our phones.

88
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:25,913
That's scary.

so I'll be home late.)

90

91
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:37,640
Girlfriend?

92
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:38,820
Mm.

93
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:41,171
You said she was a nail technician.

94
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:43,281
She must be really hot.

95
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:45,726
I think it's you, Hagiwara,
who should be worried.

96
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,773
Been together for a long time.
Must be boring.

97
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:50,163
We don't have a problem.

98
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:51,929

100
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:05,312

105
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:45,101

106
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,976
Mm?

107
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:48,925
That night I had an interview at home.

108
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:50,050
An interview?

109
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,965
Here?

110
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,238
Yes.

111
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:55,144
What a coincidence.

112
00:09:55,402 --> 00:09:57,175
I have the intern class reunion that day.

113
00:09:58,402 --> 00:10:00,004
But you usually don't attend.

114
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:02,847
That's true.

115
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,980
But if I keep bailing,
my boss will reprimand me.

116
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:10,480
That's right.

117
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,261
I'll introduce you to my editor.

118
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:17,004
He's quite an interesting person.

119
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,785
No point in introducing a parasite.

120
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:26,148
You're not a parasite.

121
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:34,285
Sei?

122
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,730
It's nothing.

123
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,699
I'm gonna work a bit more.

124

125

So...

126
00:10:58,707 --> 00:11:00,988
what exactly am I to Kazuaki?

127
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:17,004

128
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:04,031
I'm home!

129
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:08,898
My regular customer asked me
to help with a broken nail.

130
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:11,132
Have you eaten? I made fried rice.

131
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:14,007
Ah, it's late. I'd rather not eat.

132
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:16,163
I already ate free snacks I got.

00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,093

Hey.

137
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,179
Your nails are long.

138
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,179
Please allow me.

139
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:39,734
What should one do with a broken nail?

140
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:43,952
We say "broken" when in fact
it's just a fracture in the nail surface.

141
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:47,499
Just press a thin cloth on it
and apply gel to strengthen it.

142
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:49,541
It's like repairing a nail.

143
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:53,343
Well, I'm a technician.

144
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:16,171
Sir,

145
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,648
this shop doesn't provide
that kind of service.

146
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:20,953
You're right.

147
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,171
Sei, your dad and I are going out!

148
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:16,663
I'm a little surprised you replied.

149
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,397
You're a serious person.

150
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:40,383
So are you.

151
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,796
I don't usually do stuff like this,

152
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,975
but saying that
would've sounded like I was flirting.

153
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:52,663
Even though I'm a man,
I have no ulterior motive.

154
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:56,570
No problem, I'm a man too.

155
00:14:57,515 --> 00:14:59,734
Ah, that's a relief.

156
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:01,695
Saying this sounds strange too.

157
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:07,288
Talking to the person
you emailed by mistake again?

158
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,171
Mm.

159
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:11,734
Are you really that serious, Kazuaki?

160
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:13,234
Worried?

161
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,374
No, this person's a man.

162
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:18,054
There's no need to worry.

163
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,234
I might be lying.

164
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:22,382
Eh? What is this?

165
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:24,046
Do you want me to worry?

166
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:25,257
A little.

167
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:28,116
But you already showed me the email

168
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:29,702
because you didn't want me to worry.

169
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,866
That's true, I guess.

170
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:34,273
Thank you for being considerate.

171
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,007
My co-worker.

172
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:39,718
Hm?

173
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:42,288
She said she snooped
on her boyfriend's phone.

174
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:44,507
Ah. There are people like that.

175
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,570
I understand the feeling.

176
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:47,562
You do?

177
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:50,570
Well, it's about someone we like.

178
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,984
It's natural to be curious.

179
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:53,976
But if you ask me,

180
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:58,007
it's really a matter
of knowing right from wrong.

181
00:15:58,054 --> 00:15:58,999
I see.

182
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:01,374
But no need to make it that dramatic.

183
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:05,445
It's just if you ask me if I'm the kind of
woman who checks her boyfriend's phone,

184
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:08,519
then I'm the kind who doesn't.

185
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:23,124
If women are divided into
"women who__ and women who don't__,"

186
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,873
what word will you add?

187
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:44,350
Women who put on makeup in
front of others and women who don't.

188
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:56,124
If you have to divide women into two kinds,
how would you do it?

189
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:58,374
Mm...

190
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:01,631
Probably women with children
and women without children.

191
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:04,819
Not something you
find in someone's profile.

192
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,944
Pick something relating
to the mind or traits.

193
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:14,577
I don't think questions using women's
gender as a criterion have answers.

194
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:18,280
No matter what I pick,
it will apply to men too.

195
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:20,397
Really?

196
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:22,749
To be honest,

197
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:25,741
traits that befit women or men

198
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:27,546
don't really exist.

199
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:29,702
It depends on each person.

200
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:31,444
You're right.

201
00:17:33,514 --> 00:17:34,233
Why do you ask?

202
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:35,780
For work?

203
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:36,835
No.

204
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,460
They really exist.

205
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:47,460
Women who put on full makeup outside.

206
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:50,795
As for my girlfriend, she said makeup

207
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:53,178
was like "wearing a mask."

208
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:58,100
The penpal you mentioned?

209
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:00,803
What penpal? So outdated.

210
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:04,100
Don't even think about meeting up.

211
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:05,694
Don't worry.

212
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:08,243
Looks like he already has a girlfriend.

213
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:11,038
Really,

214
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:13,921
why did you even reply to a missent email?

215
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:18,014
Worried?

216
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,319
Should I stop talking to him?

217
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:25,795
Do whatever you want.

218
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:37,639
Please accept a package for me.

219
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:38,381
Mm.

220
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:39,303
All right.

221
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:41,374
I'm off.

222
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:42,624
Oh.

223
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:43,538
I forgot.

224
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:45,303
What? Want me to get it?

225
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:58,428
Now I'm fully charged.

226
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:01,436
I'm off.

227
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:18,452
About the whole "woman who __
and women who don't__" thing,

228
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:22,241
I was wondering if it were you,
how would you answer?

229
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:44,740
(I'm attending an acquaintance's
exhibition opening)

230
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:08,186
(Kazuaki Fujisawa
Vostok Designer)

231
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:09,483
(Perfect Distance: Non-disruptive Design)

232
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:23,404
Women we can fuck and women we can't fuck.

233
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:38,217
(Reminder:
Issuance of new identification card)

234
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:40,796
Shit.

235
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,248
Excuse me.

236
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:46,374
I'm Hagiwara from the sales department.
Is Mr. Nakarai here?

237
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:51,530
Ah, Mr. Nakarai?

238
00:20:56,202 --> 00:20:57,413
Did you bring your stamp?

239
00:20:57,694 --> 00:20:58,772
I did.

240
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:00,116
Sorry for coming late.

241
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:04,366
Oh.

242
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:07,600
What?

243
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:09,155
Is there an error?

244
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:13,522
No, I just wanted to change my photo.

245
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:16,381
This one doesn't look good, right?

246
00:21:16,382 --> 00:21:17,561
(Hagiwara Kazuaki)

247
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:21,124
You damaged the card and requested
a new one two months ago, right?

248
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:23,835
Ah, yes.

249
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:26,193
You shouldn't use that card holder.

250
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,928
But it was given to me by my girlfriend.

251
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:36,092
You're required to use the card holder
given by the company.

252
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,202
Yes.

253
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,913
I'll be careful.

254
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,905
Mr. Nakarai, you're not coming
to this reunion either, are you?

255
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:53,248
You've never come.

256
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:54,100
I am.

257
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,803
Oh, really?

258
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:57,131
I'm the planner.

259
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:02,311
Stamp here, please.

260
00:22:03,561 --> 00:22:05,491
Oh, yes.

261
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,131
If you damage it again,
I'll charge you next time.

262
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:15,733
Sorry to bother you.

263
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:17,600
Anyway,

264
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:21,944
I think that card holder looks cool.

265
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,335
(Mailbox)

266
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:29,389
Oh, Hagiwara.

267
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:30,311
- Hey.
- Hey.

268
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,491
Have you found the restaurant?

269
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:33,264
Oh, I'll send you the email today.

270
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,217
Thanks.

271
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:35,741
Nakarai.

272
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:47,014
Ah, but I don't have money this month.

273
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,693
Me neither.

274
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,444
I talked to the managing director.

275
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:51,663
This is right before the
sales bonuses are paid,

276
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:53,999
so I got additional
100,000 yen for the party.

277
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,272
- Awesome!
- You really are dependable.

278
00:22:56,402 --> 00:22:59,214
Well, I'm good at this stuff.

279
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:03,792
So that means the restaurant we're going to

280
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:05,355
should be great, right?

281
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:08,910
(Women we can fuck and women we can't
fuck.) Will there be big pieces of meat?

282
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:10,738
- Of course.
- Yes!

283
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:12,613
Hey, be careful.

284
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:14,418
My bad.

285
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:15,690
- You're sure?
- My bad.

286
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:17,160
(Women we can fuck and women
we can't fuck.) But it's really not funny.

287
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,672
(Women we can fuck and women
we can't fuck.) I'm really sorry.

288
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:34,355
Hagiwara, what's wrong?

289
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,183
No, nothing.

290
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,598
Yeah? Mm.

291
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:42,816
Don't you drink.

292
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:44,277
No way.

293
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,887
(Next episode)
Doesn't look like he has sex much.

294
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:49,418
You're marrying Kaori-chan soon, right?

295
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:52,191
In this situation,
it'd be awesome if she was pregnant.

296
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:53,362
Have sex with me?

297
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,832
I don't wanna hear you talk that way.

298
00:23:55,855 --> 00:23:56,921
So stupid.

299
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:58,098
What are you doing?
