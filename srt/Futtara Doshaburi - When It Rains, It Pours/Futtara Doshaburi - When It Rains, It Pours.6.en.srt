1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,898
(Coffee) Welcome.

2
00:00:02,867 --> 00:00:04,219
- Paying via phone.
- Sure.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,054
Hm.

4
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:08,055
112 yen, sir.

5
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:12,398
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:14,648
Looks like I forgot my phone.

7
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:15,641
Oh, sure.

8
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:25,265
Huh.

9
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:28,781
What am I doing?

10
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:31,734
Developing feelings after sex.

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,578
How easy can I be?

12
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:38,078
"We won't destroy anything."

13
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:42,109
I was the one who said that.

14
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,788
Unbelievable.

15
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:47,266
What the hell am I doing?

16
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:52,281
I'm back.

17
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:54,758
Where were you?

18
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:56,453
A convenience store.

19
00:00:56,914 --> 00:00:57,992
Look at this.

20
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:01,797
I forgot my phone, so I couldn't
buy anything and had to come back.

21
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:08,778
Want some coffee?

22
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:11,559
No, I'm good.

23
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:17,958
I was thinking of moving.

24
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:19,747
Eh?

25
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:25,904
The city's convenient
but loud and chaotic.

26
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:28,427
I'm tired of living in a condo.

27
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:30,700
Move to where?

28
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:33,520
Kamakura.

29
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,950
I found a beautiful house,
recently completed.

30
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:43,482
I didn't know that.

31
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:47,927
If you don't like it,

32
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,943
we can have a new one built.

33
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:52,637
Not that I don't like it,

34
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,434
but it's come out of nowhere.

35
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:58,372
From Kamakura,
it'll be a long commute to work.

36
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:03,450
Then, how about quitting your job?

37
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:06,779
Eh?

38
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:11,278
You're not hurting for money.

39
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:13,895
You don't need to work.

40
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:38,654
We already agreed...

41
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:42,536
that we wouldn't destroy anything.

42
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,208
Kamakura?

43
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:53,904
Maybe that's not a bad idea.

44
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:56,700
Forget about everything

45
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:58,630
and start over.

46
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:14,224
Hm?

47
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:25,169
Someone...

48
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:27,450
called you,

49
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,490
so I answered.

50
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,553
Said he'd been caught...

51
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:42,482
and apologized.

52
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:46,208
Went on about things
that didn't make sense.

53
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,232
Is that so?

54
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,052
Cat's out of the bag.

55
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,154
Who is this Hagiwara?

56
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:04,419
A co-worker.

57
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:08,865
He's more than that, isn't he?

58
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:13,075
He's back to just a co-worker.

59
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:17,818
Sei.

60
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,552
If you took the call,

61
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,387
you must've seen the emails.

62
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,247
Everything's as they say.

63
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,661
It started with a email
sent to the wrong person.

64
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:33,747
We kept emailing each other

65
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:35,927
until we finally met...

66
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:38,779
and had sex.

67
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,560
I rushed out late at night,

68
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:45,786
lied to you

69
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:47,740
and slept over at the hotel.

70
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,497
It's true he approached me,

71
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:53,341
but I didn't mind at all.

72
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:56,005
I was even glad.

73
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,544
We went at it like rabbits.

74
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:17,294
Shut up.

75
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:18,599
Give that back.

76
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,779
What are you gonna with it?

77
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:29,536
I have to email Hagiwara.

78
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:31,310
And say what?

79
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:33,862
I don't know yet.

80
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:36,919
Just ignore him.

81
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:38,130
I can't.

82
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:39,911
I'm worried about him.

83
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,224
Sure you just wanna email him?

84
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,615
Why would you ask that?

85
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:49,216
Just answer me.

86
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,271
I wanna see him.

87
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:08,325
Kazuaki...

88
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,372
Wait.

89
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,677
Get off me.

90
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:23,833
Why?

91
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,833
Get off me.

92
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,536
Get off me.

93
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:47,075
Hey, wait...

94
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:52,818
So you went and had sex.

95
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:55,333
As easy as that?

96
00:06:57,357 --> 00:06:58,247
And you…

97
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:00,552
did it with a man.

98
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,138
It wasn't easy.

99
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,865
Wasn't easy at all.

100
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:09,130
Even though it looked that way.

101
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,005
Both Hagiwara and I...

102
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:14,396
Don't you talk to me about him!

103
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:33,216
This isn't happening.

104
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:34,966
Kazuaki.

105
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:37,450
What do you mean?

106
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,255
You shouldn't be doing this.

107
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:45,661
Why not?

108
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:48,622
You said you always wanted me to do it.

109
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,003
Cut it out.

110
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,675
This isn't right.

111
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:11,550
Now that you fucked another man,
you're satisfied?

112
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,808
As long as you've gotten sex,

113
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:18,042
it could just be with anyone?

114
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:25,152
It could probably be with anyone.

115
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,566
But right now…

116
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:34,046
you're the only one
I don't wanna do it with.

117
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:38,746
Why not?

118
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:45,699
Don't.

119
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:54,136
Why not?

120
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,253
Because...

121
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:02,160
we...

122
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:04,465
won't be able to come back.

123
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:08,324
Come back?

124
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:13,175
Come back to what?

125
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,378
"When it rains, it pours"
(Episode 6)

126
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:32,394
Kazuaki.

127
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:33,824
Morning.

128
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:41,796
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,468
I'm sorry, Sei.

130
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,014
I'm sorry, too.

131
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:13,530
I...

132
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:16,741
never meant to hurt you.

133
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:28,390
I know.

134
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,601
Mr. Nakarai?

135
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:37,304
You look like shit.

136
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:42,905
Can we talk during the lunch break?

137
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,210
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:52,851
Like I said on the phone last night.

139
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:57,562
You should've made sure
who answered the phone.

140
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,858
Did they teach us that during training?

141
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:03,765
Eh?

142
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,507
When you called,

143
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:10,071
it was him who answered.

144
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,054
Eh? I'm sorry about that.

145
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:16,101
It didn't occur to me at all.

146
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:18,476
Are you okay?

147
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:21,476
What about you?

148
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:27,226
She took my phone.
I haven't gotten it back.

149
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:30,483
Have you been contacted by my phone?

150
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,358
No.

151
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:34,812
Even if I was, I wouldn't know.

152
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:36,491
My phone's done for.

153
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:39,187
How did that happen?

154
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:42,046
It had nothing to do with you.

155
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:44,874
Now what?

156
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:47,642
What are you gonna tell your girlfriend?

157
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,249
Pay her for emotional damage?

158
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,249
Why are you talking like
it's someone else's business?

159
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:54,718
Well, it is.

160
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:57,936
I'm someone else and so are you.

161
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,123
Just ignore me.

162
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:01,842
Bye.

163
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:04,646
Mr. Nakarai.

164
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:10,398
Is that…?

165
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:15,804
As you can see,

166
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:20,655
he flew into a blind rage from jealousy.

167
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,002
A bit clichéd, but it seems to work.

168
00:13:28,748 --> 00:13:29,833
What's with you?

169
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:36,499
Want me to go into detail as well?

170
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,780
Whether he was better than you?

171
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:39,936
You're...

172
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,187
a lousy liar.

173
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,608
Don't try to put on a brave face.

174
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:10,952
Please don't cry.

175
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:13,398
I'm not crying.

176
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:18,319
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:19,639
It was my fault.

178
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:20,843
- It wasn't.
- Of course it was.

179
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:21,929
Stop pestering me.

180
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,304
If you cry when I'm not around,

181
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,006
at least blame me, please.

182
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:35,804
You're not making any sense.

183
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:46,233
What happened to your finger?

184
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:52,835
The storm glass broke.

185
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:58,155
I'm sorry.
You made an effort to gift it.

186
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:08,265
I'm sorry, Hagiwara.

187
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:12,096
No, it wasn't your fault.

188
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:13,726
It was all me.

189
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:21,210
I'm sorry.

190
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,537
I...

191
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:37,898
I can't do anything for you.

192
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:44,726
I have to go.

193
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:50,077
Mr. Nakarai.

194
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,788
Let's just...

195
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,757
leave each other alone.

196
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:13,358
Oh.

197
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:15,163
You just got a delivery.

198
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:17,124
- A delivery?
- Yes.

199
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:18,468
There.

200
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:23,811
The delivery guy was so handsome too.

201
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:24,804
(Sender: Mizutani Kaori)

202
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:43,717
(I'd like to talk after work.
Anywhere is fine.)

203
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,858
(I see. Where should we go?)

204
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:50,577
(But with a man?)

205
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:00,608
Welcome, sir.

206
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,858
Kaori.

207
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:15,132
I'm sorry.

208
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:21,582
Why that person?

209
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,671
Because of his pretty heels?

210
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,319
Heels?

211
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:33,218
I saw it all on your phone.

212
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,398
Caught me off guard completely.

213
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:44,281
There are so many sides of you
I didn't know about.

214
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:48,225
And then…

215
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:55,273
I found out I was the kind of woman
who snoops on her boyfriend's phone.

216
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:58,562
I'm sorry.

217
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:02,351
Welcome, sir.

218
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:04,406
What can I get you?

219
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:06,296
Hot coffee, please.

220
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:08,679
Right away, sir.

221
00:18:13,445 --> 00:18:16,235
I never thought
things would turn out this way.

222
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:19,578
I found someone
who'd listen to my problems,

223
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:21,327
whom I happen to work with.

224
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:24,054
It was supposed to be just that.

225
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:27,992
What do you want to do next?

226
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:31,061
Break up with me and be with him?

227
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:31,835
It's not like that.

228
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:33,468
So you want to reconcile?

229
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:47,960
Well, I'll go first.

230
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:54,913
I still like you, Kazuaki.

231
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:59,343
If you slept with a woman,

232
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,492
I might be able to find a way
to forget about it.

233
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:08,195
But...

234
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,819
I just don't understand
why it had to be a man.

235
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:15,070
I can't take it.

236
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:17,718
That's what's bothering me.

237
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,085
To touch each other's body...

238
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:23,742
it would be unbearable.

239
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:29,937
It's been unbearable for you already.

240
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,484
So you blame me?

241
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,179
Because I wouldn't allow it,

242
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,803
you got so desperate
you grabbed the guy nearby?

243
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:37,952
"Wouldn't allow it"?

244
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:41,976
I'm not your pet dog, Kaori.

245
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:58,195
That day...

246
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:01,687
The day you went out.

247
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:06,132
I felt horrible too.

248
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,804
I thought I should I go after you.

249
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,617
Go after you...

250
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,135
bring you back and apologize.

251
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:19,788
But...

252
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,499
after I apologize,

253
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:24,210
we would have to have sex, right?

254
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,702
With that thought,

255
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,242
my body wouldn't move.

256
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,226
It's not that I'm dissatisfied with you.

257
00:20:34,757 --> 00:20:37,148
I like you. Truly.

258
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:40,007
But...

259
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:43,195
no matter whom I date,

260
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:46,585
after a while,
I'd stop wanting to do it.

261
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,765
Whenever I see you hurt,

262
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:54,452
I'd think, "I'll do it tomorrow."

263
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:56,492
Every single time.

264
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,412
Kept thinking, "Here we go again."

265
00:21:06,242 --> 00:21:07,327
But...

266
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,265
I couldn't go through with it.

267
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:38,359
Kazuaki.

268
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:44,343
You never once called me names
or blamed me in your emails.

269
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:47,468
Really?

270
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,882
I always knew...

271
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,804
that you were being
very nurturing toward me.

272
00:21:58,195 --> 00:22:00,460
I truly appreciate that.

273
00:22:04,312 --> 00:22:05,468
Despite our situation.

274
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:09,273
I am sorry.

275
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:15,296
I'm, too,

276
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,945
sorry for doing something dishonest.

277
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,078
You say it.

278
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,218
Kazuaki, please say it.

279
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,460
I found someone else I like.

280
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:51,343
Let's break up.

281
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:13,085
Goodbye.

282
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,148
Sorry to keep you waiting.

283
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:31,742
Hot coffee, sir.

284
00:23:44,327 --> 00:23:45,725
(Calling: Nakarai Sei)

285
00:23:47,656 --> 00:23:50,202
The number you've dialed
is unavailable...

286
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,991
(Gone to the studio in Kamakura)
