1
00:00:06,117 --> 00:00:06,797
Good morning.

2
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:08,164
Good morning.

3
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:10,352
What time did you get home?

4
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:12,695
Oh, I took the last train.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,156
You guys must've had so much fun.

6
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,484
Nothing special.

7
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:16,969
Are you hungover?

8
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:18,836
No, I'm fine.

9
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,190
Oh, good.

10
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:23,437
Oh, I made rice balls for you.

11
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:24,249
Mm.

12
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,297
I thought you might be hungover,
so I put plums in them.

13
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:29,968
Thank you.

14
00:00:30,023 --> 00:00:30,773
Mm.

15
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:33,827
Oh, I'm having a meal with Ms. Ayako today

16
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:35,266
then I'll sleep at my parents' house.

17
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,891
Oh, is that so?

18
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:38,008
- Mm.
- Is that so?

19
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:53,852
You have rice on your face.

20
00:00:58,484 --> 00:00:59,711
So cute.

21
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,805
Like a child.

22
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:08,609
I'll get something delicious
on my way back tomorrow.

23
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:09,664
Oh, mm.

24
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:10,656
I'm off.

25
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,797
Take care.

26
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:29,109
Sorry for the late reply.

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,688
I understand your feelings.

28
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:37,742
I've lived with my best friend from school.

29
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,117
Of course he's a man,

30
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,195
but I fell in love with him

31
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:45,430
and want to have sex with him.

32
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,641
I want to bed him.

33
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:49,000
Eh?

34
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:51,438
But he...

35
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:55,320
said he didn't see me
as someone who could be his lover.

36
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:57,430
Even so...

37
00:01:58,477 --> 00:02:01,742
he said he wanted to be with me forever.

38
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:04,359
So I can't leave

39
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:06,836
because I can't break it off
and I secretly hope.

40
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:10,422
Though it may be different
from your situation,

41
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,750
we're the same
in terms of living in abject misery.

42
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:15,796
Just now.

43
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:19,617
I used the power of alcohol
to help me initiate sex with him.

44
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:24,742
But I was rejected as usual.

45
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,813
Even though it's routine,

46
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,766
this time it has quite
an effect on me mentally.

47
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,898
That's all there is to my story.

48
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,328
Thank you.

49
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,977
Oh.

50
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:54,063
Sorry. Did I wake you?

51
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:58,109
From today on, I have to work
from the studio in Kamakura.

52
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,141
I don't know how many
days it'll take this time.

53
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:09,563
Kazuaki.

54
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,344
You were wasted yesterday.

55
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:15,680
- Have some fruit...
- Kazuaki.

56
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:17,867
Huh?

57
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:22,602
I...

58
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:24,180
Yesterday...

59
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,679
How about yogurt?

60
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,476
Never mind.

61
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,883
I'll get it myself.

62
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,531
Really?

63
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,742
So I'll put it in the refrigerator.

64
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:44,141
Don't forget to eat.

65
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:46,156
Mm.

66
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:50,492
Take care.

67
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:51,805
Yeah.

68
00:03:53,055 --> 00:03:54,594
Drive carefully.

69
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:58,992
Don't worry.

70
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,141
Is this true?

71
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:18,976
"When It Rains, It Pours"
(Episode 3)

72
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:24,400
(But I fell in love with him
and want to have sex with him.)

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,952
(I can't leave because
I can't break it off and I secretly hope.)

74
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,472
(But we're the same
in terms of living in abject misery.)

75
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:31,508
That sounds horrible.

76
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,352
Of course it's true.

77
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:55,242
Oh.

78
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,352
It's not that I doubt you.

79
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:00,531
How do I say this?

80
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:03,594
It sounds like you're struggling.

81
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,414
Well,

82
00:06:06,781 --> 00:06:07,969
both of us are.

83
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,898
I don't know if it's a struggle in my case.

84
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:15,141
Getting to date someone I like,

85
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:17,539
living together,

86
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:19,391
and maybe a possibility of marriage.

87
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,359
Although I'm seriously worried about this,

88
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:24,906
I don't know if it's
qualified as a struggle.

89
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:29,836
I may not explain it very well.

90
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:33,227
But people who live together as lovers

91
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:35,273
yet refuse to have sex

92
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:37,890
are no different from people
who are normally decent

93
00:06:37,953 --> 00:06:41,477
but make a scene when alcohol
enters their system, aren't they?

94
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:46,367
I just don't know
what my girlfriend thinks about this.

95
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,296
Maybe there are some things

96
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:53,359
my girlfriend has to keep inside
that I haven't noticed.

97
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,703
I know I should discuss it
with her to find out, but...

98
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,039
I'm the type who speaks his mind.

99
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:05,445
Lately I can see that he's uncomfortable,

100
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:06,852
but maybe...

101
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:09,625
I might've done it
just to make him uncomfortable.

102
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:11,836
That's why

103
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:14,454
I think you, someone who's
willing to endure being alone,

104
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:15,906
are a very good person.

105
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:18,789
Because you like the other person

106
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:20,756
so you don't want to make her uncomfortable

107
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:22,961
and don't want to argue with her.

108
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:32,039
(Three years earlier)
This is the first plan.

109
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,563
The person who's in charge of this

110
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:36,406
just brought the finished sample.

111
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:37,977
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:41,117
The train I was on had an emergency stop.

113
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:51,172
Ms. Mizutani.

114
00:07:51,953 --> 00:07:52,828
The documents.

115
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,672
Yes.

116
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,508
You're gonna quit?

117
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:00,492
Mm.

118
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,383
I previously studied nail art.

119
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:08,047
And I think I want to open
my own shop someday.

120
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:09,805
Wow, that's great.

121
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,984
Next time let me practice
on your nails, Hagiwara-kun.

122
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:14,891
Eh?

123
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:16,391
But I'm a man.

124
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:17,641
Don't worry.

125
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:20,609
I'll make them look shiny
and suitable for a salesman.

126
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:23,570
If I do your nails,
your sales will definitely increase.

127
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:50,813
Hello?

128
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:51,898
What's up?

129
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:54,258
Can I see you now?

130
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,828
Eh?

131
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:57,070
Well...

132
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,727
I...

133
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:02,609
might have fallen for you, Hagiwara-kun.

134
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:06,852
So I feel completely restless inside.

135
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:09,453
I wanna see you right now.

136
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:10,836
I'll come to you..

137
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:12,359
Where are you?

138
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,133
I missed you so much.

139
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:30,250
I missed you too.

140
00:09:30,258 --> 00:09:31,477
Eh?

141
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:36,766
You must be tired.

142
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,023
Kaori.

143
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,906
Jeez, take off your coat first.

144
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:47,500
All right.

145
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,617
I feel so nervous.

146
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:13,898
I like that.

147
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:25,852
I think the two of us

148
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,500
have always been honest about our feelings.

149
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:38,867
(Kaori: We have to throw out
noncombustible waste today. Don't forget.)

150
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,000
(Isakado)

151
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:53,438
In the past, have everyone you're into

152
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:55,797
always been men?

153
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:59,172
If I'm prying, I apologize.

154
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:04,656
Oh, Mr. Nagarai.

155
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:06,570
You're working on a holiday?

156
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,984
The accounting department
needs to change computers,

157
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,242
so I came to supervise.

158
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,031
What about you?

159
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:18,344
The person I've worked with got promoted,

160
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:21,039
so I figured I'd send a gift.

161
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:24,031
But I forgot what his new position was,

162
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:25,844
so I came to check his business card.

163
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,641
The sales department is demanding.

164
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:33,367
I thought I'd take this opportunity
to return the umbrellas

165
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:35,063
we borrowed at the reunion party.

166
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:38,742
Then I'll go buy something for him.

167
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:46,445
You drink something that sweet?

168
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:50,961
I indulge myself only when I'm tired.

169
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,210
But it doesn't seem very healthy.

170
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:55,945
My girlfriend says the same thing.

171
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,391
So I only drink it at the company.

172
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,672
Shall we go together?

173
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,547
Eh? Go where?

174
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:17,055
To return the umbrellas.

175
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:18,984
Gonna be hard to go alone.

176
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:22,773
No, but what about the computers?

177
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:23,859
It's done.

178
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,297
I see.

179
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,944
I hope you didn't catch
a cold the other day.

180
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:35,334
You stood in the rain for so long.

181
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,273
I'm fine.

182
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:40,609
Afterward, I thought about it.

183
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:43,358
A building connected to a train station.

184
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,750
The rent must be obscene.

185
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:46,930
Is the salary from our company enough?

186
00:13:47,414 --> 00:13:49,219
I live with a friend.

187
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:51,086
Live with a friend...

188
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,039
Are you sharing the space?

189
00:13:54,773 --> 00:13:56,156
Something like that.

190
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:02,438
That bag is beautiful.

191
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,211
Oh, this?

192
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:06,600
My friend made it himself.

193
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:07,666
He's a designer.

194
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,055
Wow.

195
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:10,344
That's so cool.

196
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:12,695
Now I want one.

197
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:15,789
I don't think they're for sale.

198
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,859
He didn't make a lot of
them in the first place.

199
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:20,750
I see.

200
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:23,328
But there may be some
left in the warehouse.

201
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:24,906
Want me to ask him?

202
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:27,961
Ah...

203
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:29,586
No, it's okay.

204
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:31,438
I don't think it'll suit me.

205
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:33,929
I don't think I agree.

206
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:36,023
Not that it won't suit me,

207
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,164
but it suits you better.

208
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:39,594
It's perfect for you.

209
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:43,628
Thank you.

210
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:49,227
To become a designer,

211
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:51,148
does one need to attend an art college?

212
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:52,313
No.

213
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,141
He studied at my university.

214
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:55,445
A regular university.

215
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,688
He majored in ergonomics.

216
00:14:59,953 --> 00:15:02,922
But he's always been good at making stuff.

217
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,719
I received awards from his works
made during summer breaks.

218
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:08,882
Wow.

219
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,305
As for me, I'm rough around the edges,

220
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:17,484
so I can't do things like that.

221
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:20,828
So I asked him to make things for me.
Didn't need to look good.

222
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:23,438
So he made them for me too.

223
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:25,836
I see.

224
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:28,609
But you're not
rough around the edges, Mr. Nagarai.

225
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:31,219
Yes, I totally am.

226
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:33,844
It's just...

227
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:38,336
when I spend time with him,

228
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:39,570
I...

229
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:41,469
start to become more like him.

230
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:43,781
I see.

231
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:46,163
Sometimes that happens.

232
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:50,422
Anyway, should we call a taxi?

233
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:51,578
They're very heavy.

234
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,766
I hate using transportation.

235
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:56,211
Eh?

236
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:57,672
People like that exist?

237
00:15:58,047 --> 00:15:59,250
I'm not good at it.

238
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:01,289
You get motion sickness?

239
00:16:02,555 --> 00:16:04,766
It's fine. Let's just walk.

240
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:06,500
Really?

241
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:16,055
Thank you very much

242
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:17,305
for accompanying me.

243
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:18,664
I'm free anyway.

244
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:20,617
Ah, that's right.

245
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:22,602
There's a good coffee shop over there.

246
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:23,968
I'll get you one.

247
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:25,171
Hey, take some money.

248
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:26,688
It's okay.

249
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:27,852
It's not.

250
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:33,289
That wallet's also your friend's?

251
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:34,953
Yes.

252
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:39,383
I'm just curious.

253
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:44,578
Is your roommate who's a designer

254
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:45,555
your boyfriend?

255
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,117
Why?

256
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:49,195
Nothing.

257
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:53,383
It's just that the wallet
really suits you, Mr. Nagarai.

258
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,320
I don't know how to say it,
but that's how I feel.

259
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:02,398
Oh, you don't have to tell me.

260
00:17:03,227 --> 00:17:04,625
Sorry for the weird question.

261
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,203
It's not.

262
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:13,805
Oh.

263
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:15,578
It's raining?

264
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:25,031
It's so unfortunate.

265
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:26,203
That's true.

266
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,109
But you like getting
wet in the rain, right?

267
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:33,539
Like the other day.

268
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:37,422
I'm not in a mood today.

269
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:39,695
Is that so?

270
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:03,023
There's a museum in a place like this?

271
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:04,867
I know.

272
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:28,530
(Religious Joy)

273
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:30,859
(The moment a devout
girl ascends to heaven)

274
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,992
Looks like...

275
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,813
the rain has stopped.

276
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,375
You're right.

277
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:03,781
Sorry.

278
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:05,844
I'd like to send an email.

279
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:07,672
Oh, me too.

280
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,453
I'm now in a museum to get out of the rain.

281
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:22,828
And I saw something amazing.

282
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,781
It's a female statue.

283
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,305
Seeing her makes me realize

284
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:32,406
people can never escape
from sexual frustration

285
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:34,367
as long as we're alive.

286
00:21:34,844 --> 00:21:36,852
It really resonates with me.

287
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:41,313
I think you probably agree as well.

288
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:45,484
If you're in Tokyo,

289
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:47,313
I'd like you to come and see it.

290
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:49,976
(Email sent)

291
00:21:57,813 --> 00:21:58,898
What a coincidence.

292
00:22:04,953 --> 00:22:05,891
Hello,

293
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:12,304
I just saw a carved wooden statue
of a woman in a museum.

294
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:17,031
Probably not something to be
looked at through indecent eyes.

295
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,664
I'm not sure if she looks obscene...

296
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,984
or sad,

297
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:25,664
but I can relate to her in some way.

298
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:28,828
If you see this statue,

299
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:31,617
I think you'll understand.

300
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:33,805
Eh?

301
00:22:58,617 --> 00:23:02,039
Here's the website with rain sounds
I told you about the other day.

302
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:03,742
I forgot to send it to you.

303
00:23:04,523 --> 00:23:05,773
There's an app too.

304
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:22,078
Right now?

305
00:23:40,438 --> 00:23:42,070
Don't send it via email.

306
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:45,413
(Next episode)

307
00:23:45,414 --> 00:23:47,828
Would you like to share
a meal next Wednesday?

308
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:48,781
Sure.

309
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,664
You know very well

310
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,391
what I really want.

311
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:55,289
When he shows his masculine side,
it kills the mood.

312
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:57,500
I don't know what to say,

313
00:23:57,789 --> 00:23:59,367
but I'd like you to answer.
