1
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:03,336
The Tokyo underground is very deep.

2
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:07,250
Like an ant colony in a clear box.

3
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:09,782
If you look at the Tokyo underground
from a section view,

4
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:11,703
it must be full of holes.

5
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:13,531
Maybe...

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,999
somebody similar to us.

7
00:00:16,702 --> 00:00:19,123
is surprisingly close to us.

8
00:00:19,577 --> 00:00:22,952
I think that whenever I visit Roppongi.

9
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,546
Why Roppongi?

10
00:00:26,788 --> 00:00:29,800
Well, the Oedo line is extremely deep.

11
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:33,483
Mm.

12
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:35,694
Ah, no.

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,639
You can't.

14
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:38,718
The sauce will stain the grill.

15
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:40,361
Grill the salted one first.

16
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:44,116
You're surprisingly picky.

17
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:46,405
Are you like this during sex?

18
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:48,014
What do you mean?

19
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,733
We've got this far. No need to hide.

20
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:52,366
Or...

21
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:55,459
she won't have sex with you
because you're self-centered?

22
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:57,733
One-minute foreplay

23
00:00:57,968 --> 00:00:59,932
or being pushy when she's not even wet.

24
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:01,123
That's not true.

25
00:01:01,272 --> 00:01:02,303
How rude.

26
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:04,413
You've never seen me during sex.

27
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:06,030
Why don't you ask her next time?

28
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,027
Who would dare ask?

29
00:01:12,757 --> 00:01:15,637
You can't even ask about this stuff,
and you're thinking about marriage?

30
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:21,803
Oh,

31
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:24,889
anyway, what I asked you
the other day in the email.

32
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,655
Have you always been
attracted to men, Mr. Nakarai?

33
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:28,749
No.

34
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:30,788
Just the current one.

35
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:34,413
Before that I'd had girlfriends as usual.

36
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,100
But...

37
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:39,147
this was the first time...

38
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:42,202
I fell in love with somebody.

39
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:45,733
Was there a reason for that?

40
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:53,468
Uh, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:55,530
It's fine if you don't wanna talk.

42
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,764
My parents...

43
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:01,843
died in an accident
when I was in my third year of college.

44
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,843
So I was depressed for about half a year.

45
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:09,068
(October 25, 2019)

46
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:10,968
He was there for me during that time,

47
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:13,358
patiently giving me moral support.

48
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:19,792
My parents' deaths might have
clued me in that I always loved him

49
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:22,378
or ignited that feeling in me.

50
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:26,534
I really don't know.

51
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,808
What's wrong?

52
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:44,886
Mr. Nakarai, that's troubling.

53
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:46,581
Very troubling.

54
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,104
Huh?

55
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:49,432
If that's the case,

56
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,120
even if he fell in love with you as well,

57
00:02:52,284 --> 00:02:53,542
he wouldn't dare touch you.

58
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,683
I'm well aware of that.

59
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,128
I wouldn't know what to do.

60
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:05,276
On that day,

61
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:07,550
the person I'd been talking to via email,

62
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:10,026
who I'd thought as a stranger,

63
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,011
- turned out to be my co-worker.
- Uh...

64
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:17,643
I'll see you around.

65
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,440
There probably wouldn't be any more emails.

66
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:27,274
Even if there were,

67
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:30,808
they would be superficial
greeting emails as a courtesy.

68
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,073
Mr. Nakarai.

69
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,542
Next Wednesday,

70
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:39,315
we don't have overtime.

71
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:41,636
How about dinner?

72
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:45,175
There's so much I wanna talk to you about.

73
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:52,198
Well,

74
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,948
sure.

75
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:38,649
"When It Rains, It Pours"
(Episode 4)

76
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:39,494
(Gyu-ai)

77
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,073
- Thank you very much.
- I ate too much.

78
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:42,635
You're taking the train?

79
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:43,494
Yes.

80
00:04:43,736 --> 00:04:45,447
- That way.
- Mm, me too.

81
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,931
You can eat what you like first.

82
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:50,424
It's...

83
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:51,502
Nakarai?

84
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:56,049
Hiraiwa?

85
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:58,025
It's been so long!

86
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,400
Are you doing well?

87
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:03,658
My company's just around the corner.

88
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:05,970
You work around here too?

89
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:07,236
Oh.

90
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:08,806
No.

91
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:11,525
Ah, sorry.

92
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:13,119
I got carried away.

93
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:14,978
I'm doing well.

94
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,314
Really? That's a relief.

95
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:18,814
Is Fujisawa doing well?

96
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:20,025
You're still close, right?

97
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,119
Why are you asking?

98
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:25,002
Uh, nothing.

99
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:27,595
Back then Fujisawa was like your spokesman,

100
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:28,470
that's why.

101
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,072
Anyway,

102
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:33,181
I asked Fujisawa to tell you
to contact me when things got better.

103
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:36,970
Sorry.

104
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,353
It's okay. No need to apologize.

105
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:40,306
Oh.

106
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:42,994
Give me your LINE handle.

107
00:05:43,572 --> 00:05:45,431
I'm not on LINE.

108
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:48,924
Oh.

109
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:50,611
Is that so?

110
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:52,885
I see.

111
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:56,205
See you around then.

112
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:57,892
See you.

113
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,689
Is that a good idea?
He seems like a nice guy.

114
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:08,439
He is.

115
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:11,244
He's a friend from college.

116
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:14,033
But after my parents died,

117
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:16,267
I got so depressed I didn't see him at all.

118
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:20,908
But you were the one who picked that restaurant.

119
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:22,736
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:24,424 --> 00:06:25,556
I was joking.

121
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:27,431
You've done nothing wrong.

122
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:29,580
I guess not.

123
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,010
But you've done nothing wrong either.

124
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:36,111
Same goes for Mr. Hiraiwa back there.

125
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Do you mind?

126
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:43,572
Spray it on me.

127
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,783
I see you worry about these things.

128
00:06:48,236 --> 00:06:49,392
I don't at all.

129
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,377
It's not me. He doesn't like it.

130
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,697
By "he," you mean...

131
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,345
Mr. Fujisawa?

132
00:06:57,588 --> 00:06:59,853
I do it because I want to.

133
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,806
Because all the things...

134
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,228
that he's conceded for me,

135
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:07,728
the patience he's shown me,

136
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,431
it's tremendous.

137
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:11,612
Like what?

138
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,299
He agreed to live with me.

139
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:18,611
Personally,

140
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:21,916
I don't expect anything from him

141
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:25,111
or live with him for any kinds of benefits.

142
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:29,158
Same goes for you, right?

143
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:32,588
I must admit

144
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:36,744
that I'm slowly losing
the confidence to say that.

145
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:43,377
Even if she's nice to me,

146
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:46,627
I still don't think she'll have sex with me.

147
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:49,744
And even if I'm nice to her,

148
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:52,752
it may be because I wanna have sex with her.

149
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:56,658
The fact that I'm like that,

150
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,189
being someone with hidden agendas,

151
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,595
irks me.

152
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,767
Hagiwara,

153
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:08,103
you're a good man.

154
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:11,986
Between me and Mr. Hiraiwa,
who's a better man?

155
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,963
Hard to say. Neck and neck.

156
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:17,752
I feel that right now...

157
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,330
by a beautiful river

158
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:22,963
lies a murky swamp called libido.

159
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,885
If one pours just a glass
of the swamp water into the river,

160
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:31,142
the whole river will turn slightly murky.

161
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,736
So I shouldn't do that.

162
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,916
Actually, that...

163
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,767
may be the most depressing thing about this.

164
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:44,135
Kazuaki?

165
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:45,666
Aren't you going in?

166
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,884
Oh, you went for grilled food?

167
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:52,310
That's so nice.

168
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:57,845
All right.

169
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:00,361
I'm home.

170
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:03,142
Oh, are you free this weekend?

171
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,822
Ms. Ayako invited us to her new house.

172
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:08,790
She's expecting.

173
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,486
Says she's three months pregnant.

174
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:13,861
Kazuaki?

175
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:16,220
Aren't you coming in?

176
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:18,455
Oh.

177
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,314
Sorry.

178
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:28,760
I went out for dinner on the day you returned.

179
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,095
Don't worry about it.

180
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:34,845
How was Kamakura?

181
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,103
Well,

182
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:38,885
same old same old.

183
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,618
Oh, but

184
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:44,149
a TV show asked for an interview out of the blue.

185
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,697
And you said yes?

186
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:47,674
That's weird.

187
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:50,814
What about you?

188
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,580
Has anything changed?

189
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:54,877
No.

190
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:56,416
Not really.

191
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,486
I'd like to get a TV.

192
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,252
Sure.

193
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,541
Why?

194
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:25,017
Don't you hate TVs?

195
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,408
If you want one,

196
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:30,165
then it's fine.

197
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:33,720
Shall we buy it this weekend?

198
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:36,822
Just kidding.

199
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:38,619
I don't actually want it.

200
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:40,299
What's the matter?

201
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:41,274
Are you drunk again?

202
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,931
You know very well

203
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:45,048
that what I really want is...

204
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:46,088
I'm gonna work.

205
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:57,931
That's why my situation's so troubling.

206
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:05,431
Ouch.

207
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:07,994
It hurts.

208
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:10,439
I'm off.

209
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:11,720
- Take care.
- Take care.

210
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,564
Mr. Nakarai.

211
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,111
What's wrong with your foot?

212
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,533
I tripped at home.

213
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:24,978
I cracked the nail on my second toe.

214
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:27,736
It doesn't hurt too badly

215
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,681
but I'm worried I'll break it
if I put weight on it.

216
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:32,799
You should go to the hospital.

217
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,869
I don't like hospitals.

218
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:38,056
A nail salon should be able to help.

219
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,627
Want me to ask my girlfriend if she's free?

220
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,502
I'd rather not.

221
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,400
It's embarrassing
for a man to visit a nail salon.

222
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,947
But it's not a good idea to walk like that.

223
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,681
You'll hurt your waist.

224
00:11:54,017 --> 00:12:02,337
(Function)

225
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:07,361
Welcome, sir.

226
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:08,605
Oh.

227
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:10,720
Mr. Nakarai, right?

228
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:11,704
Yes.

229
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,291
Hagiwara told me what happened.

230
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,361
Please.

231
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,791
Shall I put your coat away for you?

232
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,627
It's fine. I'll leave it on.

233
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:22,174
Got it.

234
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:25,080
Then please take off your shoes and have a seat.

235
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:26,181
Yes.

236
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,314
You're here today because of a cracked toenail
on your left foot, right?

237
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:34,275
That's right.

238
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,049
May I take a look?

239
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:37,049
Yes.

240
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:42,455
May I?

241
00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:52,010
Oh, you must be in pain.

242
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:56,025
But don't worry. We can fix it.

243
00:12:56,806 --> 00:13:00,424
I'll apply a disinfectant first.
If it stings, just let me know.

244
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:01,385
I will.

245
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,244
May I?

246
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:16,197
You have beautiful heels.

247
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,088
Oh, really?

248
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,127
I never noticed that.

249
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,291
What don't you like about Hagiwara?

250
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,955
That guy is kind

251
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,010
and a good person.

252
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:36,986
It probably never occurred to you
how distraught he's been.

253
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:40,213
What a cruel woman.

254
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:44,470
It should be fine now

255
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:51,101
That's amazing.

256
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,556
If the coat peels off,
you can come back at any time.

257
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:56,002
Thank you very much.

258
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:58,383
How much?

259
00:13:58,385 --> 00:13:59,838
Oh, there's no charge.

260
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:01,470
It's an easy fix.

261
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:03,127
No, that won't do.

262
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:06,033
My boyfriend will scold me otherwise.

263
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,197
I went to a nail salon today.

264
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,916
A nail salon?

265
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:22,088
I bumped my foot yesterday and crack a toenail.

266
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:23,845
Then my co-worker

267
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:26,783
recommended the nail salon
his girlfriend works at.

268
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,549
Which foot?

269
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:32,650
The second toe of my left foot.

270
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,697
Let me see.

271
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:37,158
Sit down.

272
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:55,010
She put a disinfectant on it, right?

273
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:57,502
Don't worry about it.

274
00:14:58,049 --> 00:14:59,416
It doesn't hurt anymore.

275
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:01,595
Really?

276
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,478
Mm.

277
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:05,642
What about here?

278
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:09,877
It's fine.

279
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:13,478
Is that so?

280
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:18,391
Anyway,

281
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:20,791
she gave it a good coating.

282
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:25,353
That's enough. It's embarrassing.

283
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,072
Where did you hit your foot?

284
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:36,314
The table.

285
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,986
I walked normally, but I hit it hard.

286
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,166
I get it.

287
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:47,135
Sometimes when I'm tired,
I accidentally bit my mouth too hard.

288
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,025
Reminds me of when I eat normally

289
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:55,041
and accidentally use too much force
without even realizing it.

290
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:56,760
It's quite scary.

291
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:05,806
Like certain things we do without thinking

292
00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:09,416
that actually hurt the other person badly,

293
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:10,549
troubling him.

294
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,236
Something like that?

295
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:19,611
Who are you talking about?

296
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:25,111
I don't know.

297
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,938
(Is your nail better?)

298
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,923
A delivery from Mr. Nakarai.

299
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:37,830
Eh?

300
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,485
Oh.

301
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,533
Hm.

302
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:55,603
Hey.

303
00:16:57,905 --> 00:17:01,335
(Thank you very much for the other day.
Please say hi to Hagiwara for me.)

304
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,280
Just tell me face to face.

305
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:04,874
Wow.

306
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,155
It's a storm glass.

307
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,288
What's that?

308
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:12,116
They say these white crystals
can predict weather.

309
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,062
When it's gonna rain,

310
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,194
I think the crystals will freeze.

311
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,249
Oh, it's Vostok too.

312
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:21,382
Vostok?

313
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:23,319
You don't know it?

314
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:26,624
It's a brand that sells
furniture and miscellaneous items.

315
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:28,132
It's quite popular.

316
00:17:28,304 --> 00:17:29,866
That thing I gave you.

317
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:32,514
The ID card holder. It's Vostok.

318
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:33,545
Eh?

319
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:34,452
Mm.

320
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:41,866
So cute.

321
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:43,209
(Designer, Fujisawa Kazuaki)

322
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,554
Fujisawa...

323
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:46,296
(Born September 27)

324
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,726
Kazuaki0927...

325
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:50,976
Hm?

326
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:53,476
No, it's nothing.

327
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:54,788
Mm.

328
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:06,116
Well, we're both working
the jobs we love independently.

329
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:09,085
I used to think that
if we ever have kids, I'd be thrilled.

330
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:12,772
He already bought kids' clothes
and found a babysitter.

331
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:14,038
He's very impatient.

332
00:18:15,257 --> 00:18:17,632
I want Ayako to get to keep doing what she loves.

333
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:18,983
Besides,

334
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:21,468
quality time is important for couples.

335
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:23,796
That sounds wonderful.

336
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:27,569
Oh.

337
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:31,717
We ran out of horseradish.
We already made roast beef.

338
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:33,655
Hey, can you go buy some?

339
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,241
What is horseradish?

340
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,623
You don't know it?

341
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:38,702
Oh, I'll buy it for you.

342
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:39,882
Oh, really?

343
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:41,405
I really appreciate it.

344
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:42,851
A supermarket's right around the corner.

345
00:18:42,874 --> 00:18:43,608
Yes.

346
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:46,030
Hey, go with her. You have to pay for it.

347
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:46,882
Of course.

348
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:49,093
I'm off.

349
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,702
- Take care.
- Bye.

350
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,120
It's written all over your face
that you're repressed.

351
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,249
Eh?

352
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:14,851
This baby.

353
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:18,097
I had it done at a hospital.

354
00:19:18,718 --> 00:19:19,523
Eh?

355
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:21,491
Oh, is that so?

356
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:23,233
That man.

357
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,007
He's impotent.

358
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,257
So he can't have sex.

359
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:33,562
He would look at someone else
in the nude and eagerly jerk off.

360
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:36,398
When he's finished, he'll fall asleep happily.

361
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:41,062
I found out after we got married.

362
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,335
Is it a good idea to tell me about that?

363
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:48,983
What?

364
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,687
I wanted to share because it's you.

365
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:55,764
You should be able to picture it, right?

366
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,116
I don't understand.

367
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,155
I...

368
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,030
pushed down my embarrassment

369
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:04,545
and consulted Kaori.

370
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,319
I told her I wanted to be a normal couple.

371
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:12,405
And did you know

372
00:20:12,851 --> 00:20:14,569
what that girl said?

373
00:20:15,124 --> 00:20:15,960
I don't.

374
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,593
She said it joyfully.

375
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,249
Eh? My boyfriend and I haven't had sex either.

376
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,499
I like making out with him,

377
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:28,890
but when he shows his masculine side,
it kills the mood.

378
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:34,882
Why are you telling me this?

379
00:20:37,312 --> 00:20:39,038
Well, you and I

380
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:41,499
are in the same hell, aren't we?

381
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:45,273
We just wanna have sex with the person we love.

382
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,093
Wanna be fulfilled.

383
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:49,398
But those ordinary things

384
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,881
are seen as dirty

385
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:52,351
and disgusting.

386
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,765
But your situation is much better than mine.

387
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,077
At least she likes children.

388
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,608
She'll probably have sex with you
on her ovulation day.

389
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:14,687
Why?

390
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,319
Well, you said you wanted one.

391
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:33,718
Thanks.

392
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:15,960
Kaori.

393
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:22,429
What's going on?

394
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:25,640
Let's do it.

395
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:35,788
Maybe next time.

396
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,273
It's late now.

397
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:43,327
Good night.

398
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:20,312
Are you still awake?

399
00:23:21,382 --> 00:23:23,554
I don't know what to say,

400
00:23:24,187 --> 00:23:25,749
but I just want an answer.

401
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:38,233
(Call me. 080-022-0119)

402
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:39,374
If I...

403
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:41,624
call him right now,

404
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,671
I'll probably...

405
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:45,584
(Next episode)

406
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:46,865
When it rains, it pours.

407
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:49,796
Doesn't sound like us at all, does it?

408
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:51,148
I'll be right over.

409
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:52,999
No, I'll go to you.

410
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:54,421
I'd rather go to you.

411
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,991
I wanna have sex with you, Mr. Nakarai.
