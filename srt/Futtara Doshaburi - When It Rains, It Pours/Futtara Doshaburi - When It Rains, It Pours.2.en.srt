1
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:26,012
I'm exhausted.

2
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:30,544
Wait.

3
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:33,255
I'll stop talking about it.

4
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:42,805
Hey.

5
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,348
Hey, Kazuaki.

6
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:46,887
Wait!

7
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:48,551
Hey, wait!

8
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:13,907
On the other side of the curtain,

9
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:17,727
what kind of sky is there?

10
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:21,157
When it comes to that here,

11
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:24,392
it's always vague.

12
00:01:35,608 --> 00:01:38,655
(Women we can fuck and women we can't fuck.)

13
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:48,293
(So ​​for men...)

14
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:52,832
So for men,

15
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:58,329
there're also men we can fuck
and men we can't fuck, right?

16
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:03,135
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

17
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:10,455
Are you gonna eat the yogurt?

18
00:02:11,322 --> 00:02:12,846
No, it's fine.

19
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:14,041
Yeah?

20
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:24,056
What is it?

21
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:26,799
No, nothing.

22
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,061
Probably something like that.

23
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,983
When you watch animal documentaries,

24
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:49,374
you can see that during mating,

25
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:52,224
females' right to choose
is mostly much more powerful.

26
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:53,585
And then what?

27
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,522
Males use the color
of their bodies in courtship

28
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,991
and fight to the hilt with other males
until they get to mate.

29
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,233
Humans are no different, aren't they?

30
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:07,426
Please do your best.

31
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:08,913
In the case of humans,

32
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:11,350
reproduction isn't our only goal.

33
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:14,233
I think it's a little more
complicated than that.

34
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:17,499
No, I understand that it's complicated.

35
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:19,913
But I mean eventually.

36
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:23,084
Uh, what about Italy?

37
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:24,858
Eh, can we go?

38
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:26,038
Of course.

39
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,546
This is my personal opinion.

40
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:30,796
If it makes you uncomfortable, I apologize.

41
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:32,835
Take care.

42
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:34,569
It doesn't make me uncomfortable.

43
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:37,717
But people in a seemingly happy

44
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,444
relationship like you having this notion

45
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,342
is quite unexpected.

46
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:45,725
Take care.

47
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:58,639
So how would you answer the question?

48
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:01,717
If you have to divide the men into two kinds.

49
00:04:03,374 --> 00:04:04,577
Now,

50
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:08,389
it feels like I'm being tested.

51
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:50,686
"When It Rains, It Pours"
(Episode 2)

52
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,999
Men who seize opportunities to have sex
and men who don't.

53
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:10,717
(Do you mean yourself...)

54
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:16,894
I'm off to see my client.

55
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,837
Mr. Hagiwara, it's from
the administrative department.

56
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,170
Thank you.

57
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:42,694
(Isakado, Sales Department
Okiwara Kazuaki)

58
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:44,382
What a mess.

59
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,038
Do you need something?

60
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:56,507
Uh...

61
00:05:56,827 --> 00:06:00,194
Well, the name on the business card is wrong.

62
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,561
You're right.

63
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,866
It's Oki instead of Hagi.

64
00:06:15,085 --> 00:06:16,007
I apologize.

65
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:18,780
You don't have to do that.

66
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,797
You need them today, right?

67
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:22,358
How many do you have left?

68
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,499
Well, about two or three.

69
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:28,374
Sorry for waiting until they're almost gone.

70
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,350
Understood.

71
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,702
Can you give me five minutes?

72
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:33,577
Uh, yes.

73
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:46,991
This guy doesn't look like he has sex much.

74
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:52,382
Doesn't look like he has any sexual desire.

75
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:59,600
Now that I think about it,
that stuff's always on my mind.

76
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:00,975
I'm really beyond help.

77
00:07:05,118 --> 00:07:07,923
Please bear with these for now.

78
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,665
How did you do it?

79
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,688
We have a business card printer
for emergencies.

80
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,477
Is that so?

81
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:19,251
I'll send them the correct version tomorrow.

82
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,641
Sorry for the trouble.

83
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:22,954
No, it's on me.

84
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:26,290
My name is easily misspelled.
I feel guilty too.

85
00:07:36,587 --> 00:07:37,587
About the reunion,

86
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,579
is there anything I can help with?

87
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:41,079
Eh?

88
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:42,665
The one you're planning.

89
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:45,595
Working on it alone must be hard.

90
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:48,306
Thank you very much.

91
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:50,829
But I'm in the sales department,

92
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:53,063
so I'm used to organizing stuff.

93
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:54,876
Is that so?

94
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,727
You should be prepared as well, Mr. Nakarai.

95
00:07:58,118 --> 00:08:01,337
You can be nominated
as the reunion planner at any time.

96
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:02,852
You're right.

97
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:06,039
When you're the planner, I'll help you.

98
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:07,970
I don't find it that difficult.

99
00:08:10,095 --> 00:08:11,829
If there's a problem, I'll rely on you.

100
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:13,681
Sure.

101
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,196
- Just a little more.
- Yes.

102
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:22,470
I'm hungry.

103
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:24,938
Well,

104
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,704
I'm getting married.

105
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:27,977
Are you serious?

106
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,399
- Yeah.
- Hey, is the meat still not ready?

107
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:33,715
We've been together for so long,
so I feel it's time.

108
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:35,825
Yeah.

109
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,403
Will there be a ceremony?

110
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,848
Mm, well.

111
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:42,997
Probably only close relatives.

112
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:45,997
Yeah, nowadays it has to be like that.

113
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:47,005
Right?

114
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,638
What about you?

115
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,060
Are you marrying Kaori-chan soon?

116
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,411
Mm, I'm waiting for the right timing.

117
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,458
What timing?

118
00:08:58,106 --> 00:08:59,192
When she's pregnant?

119
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:00,669
Seriously?

120
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:03,144
Nah.

121
00:09:04,683 --> 00:09:05,980
Don't worry.

122
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:09,230
We'll figure it out together carefully.

123
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:10,495
Right?

124
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,266
If you get pregnant
in this condition, I'd be amazed.

125
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:17,378
It'd be a miracle.

126
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:19,386
Eh?

127
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:24,605
Well,

128
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,167
we haven't been having sex at all.

129
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:32,675
Kazuaki?

130
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:36,667
Kazuaki?

131
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:39,042
Kazuaki?

132
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,050
Kazuaki?

133
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:48,589
You two.
If you wanna make out, do it at home.

134
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:51,331
Eh? Why's that?

135
00:09:51,995 --> 00:09:54,981
By the way, I was out of town
for work the other day...

136
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:05,965
What is it?

137
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:09,426
Oh, sorry.

138
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,059
The other day I was talking to a co-worker.

139
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:17,465
I warned him to be careful about something.

140
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:20,496
After that he looked...

141
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,059
a little scared of me.

142
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:25,442
Really?

143
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,059
Am I really that scary?

144
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:31,559
He looked shaken up

145
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:33,903
like a primary school kid

146
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:39,043
who'd hid moldy bread
inside his desk and got caught.

147
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,989
I don't think you're scary.

148
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,582
Really?

149
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:49,457
But it depends on the person.

150
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,473
To some, you may look inaccessible.

151
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:56,106
You're also a man of few words.

152
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:06,129
Should I improve myself?

153
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:10,278
No.

154
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,293
At work,

155
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,208
we don't need people to like us.

156
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:16,911
For me,

157
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:19,872
I like you the way you are.

158
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:28,747
Oh!

159
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:29,981
Hm?

160
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:31,731
I suddenly got an idea

161
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:33,653
about the chair I'm designing.

162
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,465
Go draw.

163
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:36,801
Sorry.

164
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,153
Hey, I'll take care of it.

165
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:42,528
- Thanks.
- Mm.

166
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,590
I'm gonna go.

167
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,231
Sorry for the late reply.

168
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:02,192
It took me a while to believe

169
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,590
that there are men who don't
seize opportunities to have sex.

170
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:12,184
Probably light eaters
who encounter unappetizing dishes.

171
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:15,286
Eh?

172
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:19,067
Are you talking about food?

173
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,083
No.

174
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,473
I didn't think so.

175
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,395
As for me,

176
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:31,333
I'm a man who hasn't been given
the opportunity to have sex.

177
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:35,254
What does that mean?

178
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:40,074
I've been living
with my girlfriend for two years.

179
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,832
And I think we'll get married.

180
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:47,488
But...

181
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:50,504
one thing has been bothering me.

182
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:52,894
That is…

183
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:55,465
we haven't been having sex at all.

184
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:58,683
We used to do it regularly,

185
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:02,183
but it became less frequent gradually.

186
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,707
The next thing I knew,
we hadn't done it for a year.

187
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:09,730
I want to do it.

188
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,058
But my girlfriend doesn't.

189
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,230
She doesn't verbalize it
by saying no or telling me to stop.

190
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:20,518
But she always refuses indirectly.

191
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:24,912
I don't dare say anything more.

192
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:29,506
All I can do is think, "Again?"

193
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:37,704
The people we should keep
are fellow intern classmates.

194
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:39,404
- That's right!
- Yes!

195
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:40,638
- Well said!
- Agreed!

196
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,553
Cheers!

197
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:44,436
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

198
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:46,061
- Yay!
- Yay!

199
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,201
Cheers.

200
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:50,483
Take care.

201
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:54,662
You must be the most successful one.

202
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,162
I'm telling you guys. With Hagiwara,

203
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:59,529
I heard he'd been approached
by another company.

204
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:00,701
Get out! Seriously?

205
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,045
Don't tell people that.

206
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:03,591
Really?

207
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,287
Where?

208
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,084
No, we talked about it over drinks.

209
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:07,543
He wasn't serious.

210
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,551
You don't know that for sure.

211
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,178
Thank you.

212
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:14,771
I'm gonna get some more.

213
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:15,881
Sure thing.

214
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:19,373
(But one thing has been bothering me.
That is, we haven't been having sex at all.)

215
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:21,123
(I don't dare say anything more.)

216
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:23,170
What are you drinking?

217
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:24,983
Gin with lemon.

218
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:27,420
Really? Surprising.

219
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:29,694
You don't look like a drinker.

220
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,442
Because I don't go to parties, right?

221
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:35,061
Oh, that's right.

222
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,091
Excuse me.

223
00:14:37,263 --> 00:14:38,648
I'd like gin with lemon, too.

224
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:39,845
Yes, sir.

225
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:42,373
Mr. Nakarai,

226
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:45,552
you look like someone
who only drinks mineral water.

227
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,071
What are you talking about?

228
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:52,365
Well, I guess you give out
a clean and refreshing vibe.

229
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:56,756
Let me ask you something.

230
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:59,365
Why are you strangely polite to me?

231
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,459
Strangely?

232
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:03,834
You always use

233
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:05,865
honorific particles.

234
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,584
It's strange.

235
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,748
Like trying to be polite by default.

236
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:12,233
Polite by default?

237
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:15,381
That's a cool phrase.

238
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:19,705
Sorry to keep you waiting.

239
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:26,998
You have very long eyelashes, Mr. Nakarai.

240
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,037
They must be beautiful when curled.

241
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,470
Those inner eyelashes.

242
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:33,530
Oh, like women with beautiful eyelashes.

243
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:34,998
I've never tried it.

244
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:37,341
Have you?

245
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:40,412
Yes, I'm in charge of beauty accessories.

246
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:43,678
Those things are quite scary
if you're not used to them.

247
00:15:44,404 --> 00:15:47,147
Women can do it so casually.

248
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:48,647
Really?

249
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:52,154
When something gets close to your eyes,

250
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,311
you get afraid, right?

251
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:57,225
Like my girlfriend.
When she wears a mask,

252
00:15:57,444 --> 00:15:59,320
she applies something harshly on her eyes.

253
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:00,990
Seeing that stresses me out.

254
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:05,115
Is it popular to call
putting on makeup wearing a mask?

255
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:06,178
Eh?

256
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:07,311
Really?

257
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:08,537
No.

258
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:10,529
I don't know.

259
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:21,522
Your fingers.

260
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:22,686
Eh?

261
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:25,639
Just feel like you take
very good care of your fingers.

262
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,659
Etiquette for salespeople?

263
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,389
Oh.

264
00:16:30,014 --> 00:16:32,459
My girlfriend is a nail technician,

265
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:35,506
so she helps me take care of my nails.

266
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:40,654
Such a good girlfriend.

267
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:44,014
I guess.

268
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,733
Hm?

269
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:51,014
Yes.

270
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:52,857
She's so nice it's a shame she's with me.

271
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,865
Sounds like a loving relationship.

272
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,522
Yes.

273
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:05,326
- You'd better hurry.
- This is terrible.

274
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:06,990
Wait! Hold on!

275
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,178
Come on.

276
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,561
Get home safe!

277
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:19,318
Eh?

278
00:17:24,397 --> 00:17:25,529
What are you doing?

279
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:41,904
I don't encounter rain very often.

280
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:44,826
It just rained the other day.

281
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:50,670
I live in a building connected to a train station

282
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,233
so I rarely hear the sound of the rain.

283
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:56,295
Really? That's so nice.

284
00:17:57,123 --> 00:18:00,272
Sometimes the sound of the rain
bothers me so much I can't sleep.

285
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:03,959
I prefer that to complete silence.

286
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,639
If you like the sound of the rain,

287
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,858
there's a website
where you can play rain sounds.

288
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:11,912
I can send it to you via LINE.

289
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:15,193
I don't use LINE.

290
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:16,764
Oh.

291
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:19,826
You actually look the type.

292
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:22,592
What's the type?

293
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:23,302
Eh?

294
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,334
I'll email you the link then.

295
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:30,311
My email address is...

296
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:32,889
Oops!

297
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,076
I left something at the restaurant.

298
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:36,889
Excuse me for a moment.

299
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,029
No need to trouble yourself.

300
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:41,889
Really?

301
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:44,295
Uh,

302
00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:45,959
shall we find another bar?

303
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,670
I have to go home.

304
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:51,733
Take care.

305
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:03,264
You had an umbrella. Why are you soaked?

306
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,029
I have to take this one back to the restaurant.

307
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:12,014
Has the interviewer left?

308
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,154
I'm sorry I made you go out.

309
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,123
The reunion party was quite fun.

310
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:23,262
A guy in sales has very shiny nails.

311
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,855
Said his girlfriend was a nail technician.

312
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:28,543
What were you guys talking about?

313
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:31,535
Basically, he was showing off his girlfriend.

314
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:33,371
Yeah.

315
00:19:33,668 --> 00:19:34,668
I guess so.

316
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:38,262
What nonsense.

317
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,285
Go take a shower, so you get warm.

318
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:44,723
Mm.

319
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,457
Things Kazuaki hates...

320
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:56,370
are parties,

321
00:19:58,354 --> 00:19:59,745
plastic umbrellas,

322
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:03,276
flashy clothes,

323
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:05,901
TVs,

324
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:10,065
towels in colors other than white,

325
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,081
and...

326
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:17,128
sex.

327
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:26,244
Sei, your dad and I are going out!

328
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:42,073
I...

329
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:44,737
want to continue being with you.

330
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:48,252
I want to be with you forever.

331
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:53,589
I might not be able to give you
the kind of relationship you want,

332
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:59,628
but I'm not planning on dating
or marrying someone else.

333
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:04,096
Will that work for you?

334
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:08,495
He keeps his promise.

335
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,151
Kazuaki has always been with me

336
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:15,386
and taken good care of me.

337
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:18,042
But he...

338
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:20,034
won't hold me.

339
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,253
We don't even hold hands.

340
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:30,346
Sei!

341
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:37,011
What's wrong?

342
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:38,519
Are you sick?

343
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,379
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,621
I drank too much.

345
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:46,418
I'll get you some water.

346
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:51,706
Maybe...

347
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:55,034
I will be with Kazuaki forever.

348
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:57,206
But...

349
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,401
the word "forever"

350
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,885
means being gently rejected forever.

351
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:10,237
Sei.

352
00:22:11,253 --> 00:22:12,167
Come on.

353
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,667
Here's some water.

354
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:28,620
It's my fault.

355
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,503
I told you to shower
not long after you'd had alcohol.

356
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:36,003
Are you okay?

357
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,339
Have sex with me.

358
00:22:39,831 --> 00:22:40,776
Eh?

359
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:46,081
Have sex with me.

360
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:53,089
If you can't do it,

361
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:56,753
I wanna see you masturbate.

362
00:22:58,456 --> 00:22:59,885
Until you're finished.

363
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:03,026
I don't wanna to hear...

364
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,542
you talk that way.

365
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:15,369
So I'll masturbate. You watch.

366
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:20,970
Get dressed.

367
00:23:23,346 --> 00:23:24,401
Warm yourself up.

368
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:25,753
And go to bed.

369
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:30,096
Kazuaki.

370
00:23:41,432 --> 00:23:42,651
I'm so stupid.

371
00:23:44,948 --> 00:23:45,479
(Next episode)

372
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:47,292
I might have fallen for you.

373
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:48,534
I wanna see you right now.

374
00:23:48,573 --> 00:23:49,627
Kazuaki, I...

00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:51,175

376
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:53,800

377
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,503

378
00:23:55,711 --> 00:23:57,250
It's so unfortunate.

379
00:23:58,227 --> 00:23:59,406
Right now?
