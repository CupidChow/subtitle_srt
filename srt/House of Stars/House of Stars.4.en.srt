00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,360
All right.

191
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,550
I'll book the earliest fight.

192
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,910
Do you want me to come with you?

193
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,180
Why did you go there?

194
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:50,900
You know it very well, right?

195
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,260
If I get caught,

196
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,480
I'll lose everything.

197
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,240
Didn't you say it yourself, Mark?

198
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,360
Everything will end

199
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,840
when we find the evidence.

200
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,890
Even if Mom finds the evidence,

201
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,190
how can she tell

202
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,300
that it's our doing?

203
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,650
I know that you don't want to take risks,

204
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,600
but we don't have a choice.

205
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,970
When the time comes,

206
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,120
I'll bear the consequences myself.

207
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,940
You've improved significantly, Weha.

208
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,490
Thank you.

209
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,790
How can I help you?

210
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,220
You'll definitely pass the coming audition.

211
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,780
I can do this.

212
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,630
You did it!

213
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,750
You didn't forget anything, right?

214
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,210
No.

215
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,410
Wait for me.

216
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,490
Take good care of yourself

217
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,190
when I'm not around.

218
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,230
Besides...

219
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,330
Watch out for the hungry ghosts in this area.

220
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,270
Did something happen?

221
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,840
Nothing. Nothing happened.

222
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,700
Then, I'll get going.

223
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,030
Sure.

224
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,170
Dang it.

225
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:06,830
Toey.

226
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,480
What's in that box?

227
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,580
It's nothing.

228
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,440
Nothing?

229
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,300
Give it to me.

230
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,650
Now.

231
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,180
The box is for you, Gun.

232
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,350
I smelled something strange, so I opened it.

233
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,150
I think the issue is getting worse.

234
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,810
Shall we call the police?

235
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,380
Don't worry.

236
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,480
Throw it out

237
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:54,980
before anyone finds out about this.

238
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,210
Get some rest.

239
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,640
We'll catch the flight early morning tomorrow for the shoot.

240
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,180
All right.

241
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm going to move into the apartment after I come back.

242
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,940
I've given out the script. Has everyone gotten your scripts?

243
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,819
Hi, Jiu.

244
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,960
Hello.

245
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:23,800
Hello.

246
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,550
Take a seat. I'll finish my work first.

247
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,120
All right. Go ahead. It'll only take a while.

248
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,840
-Hello, Miss Susie.   
-Hello.

249
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,520
Sorry to bother you.

250
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,110
It's the first table-read for the second season. I thought I'd drop by and say hi.

251
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,240
That's so nice of you.

252
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,910
I happen to have just received some sweet gooseberries.

253
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,180
I left them inside my car.

254
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,660
I'll send my kid to fetch it later. Go and fetch it now.

255
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,510
Don't worry about it.

256
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,830
Thank you so much.

257
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,200
I really appreciate the thought.

258
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,260
Too bad I'm allergic to fruits.

259
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,500
Oh. Really?

260
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,190
What a pity.

261
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,990
Don't worry. I don't want to disturb you further.

262
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,910
I'll take a seat over there.

263
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,850
All right.

264
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,800
Miss Susie.

265
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,760
Make yourself at home.

266
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,710
I'll ask my boy to bring you some drinks later.

267
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,870
Sure.

268
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:14,720
Hey.

269
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,360
Some of these look really delicious.

270
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,380
What do you want?

271
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,760
You can order whatever you want.

272
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,830
My treat.

273
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,410
After all, it's been a long while since we last met.

274
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,950
Why are you buying?

275
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,360
This round's on me.

276
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,710
It's been so long since our last meeting.

277
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,040
As usual?

278
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,450
Yes. As usual.

279
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,050
Excuse me.

280
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,400
A glass of Chaewruea.

281
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,630
And a glass of September.

282
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,430
Excuse me, miss. I have a question.

283
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,530
If you are to choose one of us

284
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,850
to settle the bill,

285
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,720
which one will you pick?

286
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,540
What?

287
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,220
Nothing. It's just a joke.

288
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,890
If you have to choose one of us to pay the bill,

289
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,790
is it me? Or my friend?

290
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,530
I guess it's you.

291
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,660
Yes.

292
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,050
How are you doing?

293
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,070
Me?

294
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,090
Just...

295
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,620
As usual.

296
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,500
Boring life with a boring job.

297
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,610
I get paid regularly,

298
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,060
and I don't have many things to worry about.

299
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,360
Also,

300
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,180
there isn't news like before anymore.

301
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,540
What about you?

302
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,600
You're really famous now.

303
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,620
You have a pretty girlfriend

304
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,950
and a nice career.

305
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,770
I'm so envious of you.

306
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,510
You have a perfect life.

307
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,260
It's not that perfect.

308
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,640
Sometimes, I think it's really terrible.

309
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:54,670
It's very stressful.

310
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,790
It seems like there has been a lot of gossip.

311
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,150
Tell me about it.

312
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,920
I'm all ears.

313
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,220
I think...

314
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,760
It's nice having a girlfriend.

315
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,970
She's a nice girl.

316
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,510
Maybe it's because we're both celebrities

317
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,770
and we both want to be the best in the industry.

318
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,700
Hmm...

319
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,780
She always bosses me around,

320
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,800
telling me what I should do and what I shouldn't.

321
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,120
I wasn't too bothered at the beginning.

322
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:24,850
But as things moved forward,

323
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,450
it started to get a little depressing.

324
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,840
I wish for more freedom.

325
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,360
Well.

326
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,440
I think

327
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,010
she's coming from a good place. Don't overthink it.

328
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,290
I understand that she comes from a place of love,

329
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,540
but...

330
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,630
Sigh. Forget it.

331
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,160
I feel much better now after talking to you.

332
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,170
It's my pleasure.

333
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,790
You keep everything

334
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,950
to yourself.

335
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,330
If you have something to say,

336
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,890
say it.

337
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,480
Then, none of you will hold any grudges.

338
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,230
After that, find a way to solve it.

339
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,330
By the way,

340
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,700
where is your girlfriend?

341
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,440
Is she not joining us?

342
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,200
I think she went abroad to visit her mom.

343
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,600
Thank you.

344
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,880
For you,

345
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,070
I'll always have time.

346
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,090
Sure.

347
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,470
Since Minda is not around,

348
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,490
life is short.

349
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,950
Do

350
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,290
what you want to do.

351
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,000
Don't waste anyone's time.

352
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,290
Good luck.

353
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,160
All right.

354
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,340
I'll give it a try.

355
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,270
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

356
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,340
Try reading the highlighted part.

357
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,880
This one.

358
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,100
Also,

359
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,410
remember to roll your tongue.

360
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,420
Ro Ruea.

361
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,800
Great.

362
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,270
The audition is tomorrow.

363
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,700
If I don't pass this,

364
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,950
I'm sure I'll have to leave this place.

365
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,770
Don't worry about it.

366
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,950
You've been working really hard.

367
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,980
I believe you can do it.

368
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,370
Hopefully.

369
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,610
Is there something on my face?

370
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,800
No.

371
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,930
I'm thinking

372
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,270
that you might look better

373
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,880
if you change your hairstyle.

374
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,160
You look better like this.

375
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,790
Also,

376
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,850
if you want to make some changes,

377
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,150
I think a suitable outfit

378
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,240
will give you a better look.

379
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:10,960
But

380
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,630
I'm not good at picking out outfits.

381
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,080
Don't worry.

382
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,430
I'll help you with that later.

383
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,710
Let's practice the lines.

384
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,030
Why are you here?

385
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,830
Are you worried about something?

386
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,460
I'm not worried.

387
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,630
I think

388
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,450
I feel happier now.

389
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,180
What about you?

390
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,260
Do you have time?

391
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,640
I will always have time

392
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,380
for you.

393
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,800
Drink with me.

394
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,090
What's your go-to drink?

395
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,110
Hmm...

396
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,990
I'm good with anything.

397
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,540
I drink everything.

398
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,480
By the way,

399
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,210
are you really okay?

400
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,770
Because

401
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,970
you are acting a little strange.

402
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,200
I'm good.

403
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,670
It's just...

404
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,120
Do you want this?

405
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,440
Actually,

406
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,930
I want it

407
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,140
too.

408
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,580
By the way,

409
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,400
it's quite warm

410
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,700
in here.

411
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,680
Is it warm?

412
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,860
[Life is short.]

413
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,340
[Do]

414
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,670
[what you want to do.]

415
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,350
[Don't waste anyone's time.]

416
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,870
Are you awake?

417
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,500
I'm awake.

418
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,550
Are you

419
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,990
fully awake?

420
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:25,180
[CG Fan Club's Twitter]

421
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,920
[I'm here to pick up Pitch.]

422
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,280
We're going to the fan-meeting rehearsal.

423
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:28,830
Huh?

424
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,340
Is it happening now?

425
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,730
Why did I have no idea about it?

426
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,920
They changed the schedule without notice.

427
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,560
Let's go now.

428
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,300
What are you looking at?

429
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,000
It's nothing.

430
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,330
Here's your coffee.

431
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,520
Thank you.

432
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,650
[You did very well.]

433
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
[I like your acting a lot.]

434
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,560
[But unfortunately,]

435
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,280
[all the spots have been filled.]

436
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,440
[Anyway,]

437
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,090
[I'll see you in my next audition.]

438
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,130
[What's going on?]

439
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,980
I'm here

440
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,460
to talk about Weha.

441
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,970
I wish to spend more time teaching Weha.

442
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,580
I think I've given enough chances to Weha.

443
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,610
Why should I keep giving him chances when he can't make money for me?

444
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,410
But

445
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,520
you saw how seriously Weha was taking his job

446
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,140
and how hard he worked.

447
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,030
Weha even earned a compliment from the casting team today.

448
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,290
It's an important step for Weha.

449
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,090
Give me some more time.

450
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,760
Please.

451
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,700
Do you think compliments are worth anything?

452
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,230
I can't see the result,

453
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,380
as long as I don't see the money coming in.

454
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,290
Let me ask you something.

455
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,820
What place are you in now to ask me for a second chance?

456
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,350
I don't have anything else to say to you.

457
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,940
You can leave now.

458
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:20,750
All right.

459
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,310
How are you?

460
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,070
I'm fine.

461
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,640
You'll feel better after you go out for a walk.

462
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,270
But...

463
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,410
-You won't...
-It's fine.

464
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,240
I didn't do it.

465
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,290
It's fine.

466
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,900
Just treat it

467
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,350
as a farewell.

468
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,650
Why do you only wear clothes in this color?

469
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,970
I only have clothes in this color.

470
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,460
Shall we find a day to go shopping for clothes?

471
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,950
What about today?

472
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,240
All right. Let's go.

473
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,500
Weha.

474
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,330
Weha.

475
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,500
I'll talk to my friend first.

476
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,510
Go ahead.

477
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,670
Hith.

478
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,909
Hey. Weyu.

479
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,179
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

480
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,699
How could I miss such an interesting event?

481
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,130
This is Weha. My friend.

482
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:38,980
Hello.

483
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,300
There's no need to greet me so formally.

484
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,210
I think we're the same age.

485
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,560
All right.

486
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,280
Please help yourselves.

487
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,969
Make yourselves at home.

488
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,159
All right. I'll see you later.

489
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,150
Weyu.

490
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,460
Yes?

491
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,410
What's wrong?

492
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,420
Do you want to try this? It tastes pretty good.

493
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,210
Is it good?

494
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,160
Then...

495
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,060
Weha, try this.

496
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,680
You need to take off your clothes. Take it off!

497
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,890
Take it off!

498
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:03,730
Take it off!

499
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,330
Let's make things more exciting.

500
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,350
Take off your pants!

501
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,010
Take them off!

502
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,690
Take them off!

503
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,980
His underpants are funny.

504
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,660
Enough. Don't do that.

505
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,500
That's enough?

506
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:45,260
-What are you worried about?
-I'm not drunk.

507
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,100
-Let's keep playing.
-Enough.

508
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,200
Weha.

509
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,090
Are you drunk?

510
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,840
He hasn't taken off everything yet.

511
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,940
What are you worried about?

512
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,590
What a party pooper.

513
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,590
Weha, are you all right?

514
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,880
Take it slow.

515
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,550
Wait a minute. I'll get you some water.

516
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,180
No.

517
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,140
Don't go.

518
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,420
Sit.

519
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,220
Weyu.

520
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,110
Yes?

521
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,900
Do you know

522
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,790
how tired

523
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,330
I am now?

524
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,300
I feel

525
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,940
very depressed and sad.

526
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,670
I feel like a burden.

527
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,290
Without your guidance,

528
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,680
I can't even do anything properly myself.

529
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,710
I'm not good enough.

530
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,530
Cheer up.

531
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,970
I think you're a very good actor.

532
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,300
You're very determined.

533
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,520
Besides,

534
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,200
you're still working toward your goal.

535
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,420
Things won't be difficult for someone like you.

536
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,640
And I am

537
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,360
very happy

538
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,980
to be able to teach you.

539
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:02,980
Thank you.

540
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,110
If

541
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,550
it weren't

542
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,390
for your continuous guidance,

543
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,380
I would probably have remained as a country bumpkin.

544
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,340
No one would care about me.

545
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,230
No one would notice me.

546
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,720
I didn't want to leave home.

547
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,570
I wanted to stay at home.

548
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,480
I wanted my family to see what I was capable of.

549
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Sorry.

550
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,020
I shouldn't have made you listen to me.

551
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,680
I hope for your understanding.

552
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,990
I get it.

553
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,910
I get all of that,

554
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,680
because

555
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,820
I was once in your shoes.

556
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,260
You did a very good job.

557
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,480
You did a great job

558
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,860
to be able to reach where you are today.

559
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,580
Thank you.

560
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,700
Wipe away your tears.

561
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:29,670
Are you all right?

562
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,850
-Well...
-Miss Susie wants to meet you two.

563
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,840
Excuse me. Let me answer this first.

564
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,320
Do you know

565
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,740
what you have done?

566
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,420
What's wrong?

567
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,860
Are you trying to challenge me?

568
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,170
Well, be prepared to face the consequences.

[House of Stars]

570
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,600
Is Soh here?

571
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:31,460
[Next Week]

572
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,840
Where is Pitch?

573
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,240
Isn't Pitch at the House of Stars?

574
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,640
[I'm going to the apartment to look for Tod.]

575
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,540
[I think they do have feelings for each other.]

576
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,460
They look like a good match.

577
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,320
[I can't do this, right?]

578
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:22,580
[I want it.]

579
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,140
I want it.

580
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:24,750
You...

581
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,450
Well, well.

582
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,030
I saw everything.

583
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,360
He brought the jacket for you.

584
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,890
How sweet.

585
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:39,770
Right?

586
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,550
What's going on, Minda?

587
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,570
It seems like Gun is really interested in you.

588
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,390
Nothing's happening.

589
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,720
But I think

590
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,080
Gun is really adorable.

591
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,840
Minda,

592
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,750
why don't you try accepting him?

593
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,920
-I mean it.
-What's there to accept?

594
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,730
Gun doesn't like me at all.

595
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,570
He's here.

596
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,130
See.

597
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,570
Why is he acting so shy if he has no feelings for you?

598
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:13,600
He's not acting shy.

599
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,130
