120
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,250
You're really good at causing trouble.

121
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,420
Miss Susie wants you to observe the work,

122
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,290
not get involved in that kind of thing.

123
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,570
-I'm sorry.
-It's my fault.

124
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,950
I made a mistake

125
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,160
by letting him stay in the apartment.

126
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,470

127
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,370

Why did you allow Pitch to get hurt?

136

That incident was an accident.

137
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,510

138
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,110
Are you trying to say it's not your fault?

139
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,830
Clearly, Pitch got hurt

140
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,420
because he was with you.

141
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,620

-Soh.

145
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,930
I feel guilty too.

146
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,080
So if Pitch hadn't been with me, he wouldn't have gotten hurt?

147
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,750
Then why did you let Pitch go with you?

148
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,140
Or is it

149
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,160
because you like Pitch?

150
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,840
You know it's your fault.

151
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,920
When will you tell Miss Susie

152
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,140
to stop him from following you?

153
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,830
Miss Susie has already ordered a ban.

154
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,330
That's good.

155
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,750
Are you done?

156
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,670
You still haven't answered my question.

157

Do you really

158
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,760

159
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:58,900
Soh,

160
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,330
I think you should understand the rules of the House.

161
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,530
Or are you not following them?

162
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,569
I understand very well.

163
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,480
Fine.

164
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,290

167
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,619

168
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,220
Sit down.

169
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,570
I just made too much.

170
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,980
You can have it.

171
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,600
I didn't drug it.

172
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:41,960
You cooked

173
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,990
quite well.

174
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,080
Is there any water?

175
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,040
It's just

176
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,150
stuck in my throat.

177
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,780
It's in the refrigerator.

178
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,110
[Then why did you let Pitch go with you?]

179
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,690
[Or is it]

180

181
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,470
Come on. Get in the car.

182

All right.

183
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,050
Can't you?

184
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,550
I can't.

185
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,920
Are you not playing anymore?

186
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,890
That's enough.

187
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,380
I ran out of game coins.

188
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,190
It's all right. Here.

189
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,210
Take these.

190
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,150
Make sure you finish them, all right?

191
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,430
Gun.

192
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,470
Pitch.

193
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,220
The claw machine isn't a challenging game.

194
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,000
It's all about the technique of grabbing the head.

195
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,190
Try again.

196
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,230
Okay.

197
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,920
Lower it a bit more.

198
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:52,940
Give it a try.

199
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,410
Gun,

200
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,890
I didn't expect to grab it successfully.

201
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,360
It depends on the tempo and timing.

202
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,830
This doll's face

203
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,090
looks like you.

204
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,430
It's different, right?

205
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,360
I'm much cuter.

206
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,160
Let's go.

207
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,520
Are you satisfied?

208
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,940
Okay.

209
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,120
[Bonchon]

210
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,680
Whoa.

211
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,990
That looks delicious.

212
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,450
Isn't that the famous actor Gun?

213
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,920
He looks so much like him.

214
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,720
Gun,

215
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,980
I need to go to the restroom first.

216
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:20,650
It's him, right?

217
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,730
Take a picture.

218
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,790
He's gone.

219
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,150
[Toilet]

220
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,450
Did you wait long?

221
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,200
I'm sorry.

222
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,100
I just didn't want to cause any more trouble for House.

223
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,090
I understand.

224
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,320
Are you hungry?

225
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,860
I've already made a reservation at a restaurant.

226
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,770
Thank you.

227
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,490
Thank you.

228
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,780
Order whatever you want.

229
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,050
I've wanted to eat at this place for a long time.

230
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,710
So you remembered.

231
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,890
I just heard you say it.

232
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,240
I just mentioned it casually while passing by.

233
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,080
I didn't know you would remember.

234
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,050
Or is it that every excellent actor has such a good memory?

235
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:55,810
No.

236
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,880
I only remember important things.

237
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,910
Normally, there's a long wait at this restaurant.

238
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,820
Why is there no one today?

239
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,260
Or

240
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,140
-is this branch...
-I booked it.

241
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,040
Huh?

242
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:20,630
Yes.

243
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,210
I know you're rich now.

244
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,870
Just order what you want. Hurry up.

245
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,720
Aren't you hungry?

246
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,050
One, two, three. Okay.

247
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:20,790
Thank you very much.

248
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,940
-Goodbye, thank you.
-Thank you.

249
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,550
[Want to eat something?]

250
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,810
This is the audition script for your new movie.

251
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,550
What script?

252
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,410
What genre of movie?

253
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,860
Which director?

254
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,000
It's a romantic conversation movie.

255
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,590
It's from DeepFeel.

256
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,190
It's the script for the friend of the male lead.

257
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,880
What about the male lead?

258
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,200
The male lead has already been cast.

259
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,660
Who is it?

260
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,430
Is he more famous than me,

261
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,090
more well-known,

262
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,940
or from our company

263
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,260
that he didn't need to audition?

264
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,840
But I'm Korn.

265
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,280
I've been a star since I was young.

266
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,730
I have a lot of works.

267
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,140
And I still have to audition

268
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,600
for the role of the male lead's friend?

269
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,790
I won't go.

270
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,970
Do you really want to be like this?

271
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,350
What?

272
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,120
Making yourself look like a failure,

273
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,740
locking yourself in a room,

274
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,750
and living day by day like this.

275
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,270
Can you please be quiet?

276
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,260
Your current situation

277
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,030
is really unbearable to watch, you know.

278
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,070
It's because of how you are

279
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,150
that you're always in someone else's shadow

280
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,740
and can never break free.

281
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,710
Enough. Can you please stop?

282
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,020
You think I want to be like this?

283
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,650
Because you're someone like this.

284
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,080
You've never cared about me.

285
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,500
When I worked so hard to the point of exhaustion,

286
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,520
did you ever talk to me nicely as a girlfriend?

287
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,820
Did you?

288
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,790
Did you ever praise me?

289
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,760
Did you ever encourage me?

290
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,820
Did you ever ask if I was tired?

291
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,040
All you did was complain,

292
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,480
which made me question my true self

293
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,660
and our reasons for being together.

294
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,010
I don't know when our love ran out.

295
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,890
You want to be good.

296
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,780
Is it wrong to want you to become better?

297
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,870
You're confused right now

298
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,200
because of Pha.

299
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,910
So you haven't realized it when you said that.

300
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,680
Without him, you would never have become like this.

301
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,270
Everything

302
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,000
is because of you.

303
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:58,930
Get out.

304
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,870
I told you to leave!

305
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,460
You won't leave, right?

306
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,250
I was wondering why you've been gone for a long time.

307
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,140
So you're here.

308
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,290
What's the matter?

309
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,460
Let's go eat.

310
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,070
I don't want to.

311
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,530
I don't feel like it.

312
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,070
Don't feel like eating,

313
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,950
or maybe you want to eat

314
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,020
something else?

315
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:35,900
I have the same thought as you.

316
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,400
If I remember correctly,

317
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,500
you like eating Massaman curry

318
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,280
and Tom Yum,

319
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,240
right?

320
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,340
Oh, you know that?

321
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,910
Let me feed you.

322
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,560
Is it delicious?

323
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,860
I've been thinking

324
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,950
about your situation.

325
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,210
I started reflecting on myself.

326
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,740
Am I really a good actor?

327
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:53,570
Or perhaps,

328
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,370
am I suited to be an actor?

329
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,870
Why do you think that way?

330
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,330
You

331
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,350
are an excellent actor

332
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,240
and dedicated to your work.

333
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,470
You've been working hard.

334
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,380
Is that how you see it?

335
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:14,890
Yes.

336
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,010
You're amazing.

337
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,170
Absolutely amazing.

338
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,270
But

339
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,450
others may not see it the same way as you do.

340
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,870
Is that how they think?

341
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,420
But

342
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,590
if we try to please everyone,

343
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,120
it's impossible.

344
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,380
I think

345
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,330
there might be many people

346
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,060
who, like me, admire you.

347
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,980
Or maybe

348
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,130
you don't enjoy what you do.

349
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,200
I still do.

350
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,080
You could even say it's my passion.

351
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,720
But I don't know why

352
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,780
the work I used to do felt fulfilling,

353
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,320
but now it feels forced.

354
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,460
Forced, huh?

355
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,670
Because

356
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,580
of Minda?

357
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,310
Well...

358
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,270
Forget it.

359
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,740
Let's drink.

360
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:33,760
Okay.

361
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,520
The taste is really good.

362
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,280
I'll serve it for you.

363
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,440
It's a bit spicy.

364
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,110
How about this?

365
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,230
Do you want to go out for a walk with me?

366
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,610
Change the environment.

367
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,199
That way, we'll know

368
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,940
if it's because you've lost your passion

369
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,690
or because of someone.

370
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,010
Yes,

371
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,730
we can give it a try.

372
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:26,650
That's settled then.

373
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:27,739
So,

374
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,880
when I have a shooting schedule for a video,

375
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,120
I'll let you know right away.

376
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,830
Now let's start eating.

377
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:48,170
[Minda calls]

378
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,460
This is my film crew.

379
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:53,449
Hey, Fu.

380
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,320
Hello.

381
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,280
Hello, sisters.

382
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,360
Hey, Phawin, how are you?

383
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,870
Have you eaten yet?

384
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,910
I was just thinking of packing the leftovers here.

385
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,210
Phawin, you're such a joker.

386
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,370
Today, your fans sent a lot of food.

387
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,260
You should try it.

388
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,660
Hmm, why are there so many today?

389
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,780
Have you eaten yet?

390
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,140
Yes, we have.

391
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,750
Well, we need to get back to work.

392
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,370
Okay.

393
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,210
Go to the room over there and get the files for me.

394
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:23,800
Sure.

395
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,130
Korn,

396
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,450
can you take a picture of me with the food by the fans?

397
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:33,660
Sure.

398
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,440
Thank you.

399
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,090
One, two, three.

400
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,790
One, two, three.

401
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,080
Korn,

402
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,420
can you take a vertical shot as well?

403
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:56,750
Sure, no problem.

404
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,570
One, two, three.

405
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,160
Thank you.

406
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,510
The pictures look great.

407
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,940
Did your fans give you all this food?

408
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,410
Yes,

409
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,900
most of it was sent by fan clubs.

410
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,680
Whenever I go to the set or attend events,

411
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,840
they send it to me.

412
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,910
You can press this one later.

413
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,530
Okay, I got it.

414
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,200
Okay.

415
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,410
Then I'll take my leave.

416
00:36:59,550 --> 00:36:59,900
Hello?

417
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,160
Where are you?

418
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:05,860
I'm out doing something.

419
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,000
Something?

420
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,240
What's the matter?

421
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,760
It's just something.

422
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,210
Are you with that Phawin?

423
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,710
You're going too far.

424
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,720
Are you two at the point of going everywhere together now?

425
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,230
Do you still consider me?

426
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:34,920
[Sorry, the user you've dialed is currently unavailable.]

427
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,480
I have to go back.

428
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,860
Why?

429
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,060
Is it because of Minda?

430
00:37:59,380 --> 00:37:59,710
Yeah.

431
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,890
Korn.

432
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,510
Why do you care about her?

433
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,790
Hasn't she always been like this?

434
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,050
Well...

435
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,470
Whether you leave now or later,

436
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,250
the result will be the same either way.

437
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,260
Stay with me a little longer,

438
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,690
won't you?

439
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,710
Where did you go?

440
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,540
I had something to do.

441
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,210
Something?

442
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,540
Then why did you turn off your phone?

443
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,840
It ran out of battery.

444
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,420
Korn!

445
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,160
Minda,

446
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,510
I'm tired and want to go to sleep.

447
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,430
I just wanted to know

448
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,950
where you went!

449
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,420
I went out with Phawin.

450
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,880
Are you satisfied now?

451
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,550
So I guessed it right.

452
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,570
Why?

453
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,000
Why?

454
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,030
Phawin took me to his film set

455
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,710
to meet the producer

456
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,380
and director.

457
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,270
Who knows, I may get a job there.

458
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:31,510
And you know what?

459
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,740
When I went to his film set,

460
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,910
it felt so good.

461
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,430
Everyone paid attention to me

462
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:39,750
and respected me.

463
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,650
It wasn't like now, feeling so stifled.

464
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,770
Is this what you really want?

465
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,870
Well, I have my own way too.

466
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,120
Miss Susie,

467
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,480
Soh and Pitch are going to shoot outside the province.

468
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,210
Is this all you're taking?

469
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,230
Yes.

470
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,640
Is the land your family's?

471
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,010
Yes.

472
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:21,660
What's wrong?

473
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:26,860
What happened

474
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,150
with the task I asked you to handle?

475
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:34,860
Hello, Pitch.

476
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,530
Hello.

477
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,390
How are you?

478
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,300
I knew it.

479
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,060
Are you okay, Pitch?

480
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,080
Where are you hurt?

481
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,310
Is it serious?

482
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,420
Where are you right now?

483
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,940
Send me your location, and I'll go find you.

484
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,660
Wait, don't rush over just yet.

485
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,100
I'm fine now.

486
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,420
I'm at Gun's apartment.

487
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,590
Let me go find you.

488
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,160
Oh, no need. No need.

489
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,630
If you come over now, you'll just get scolded again.

490
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,050
I don't mind.

491
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,700
I'm more worried about you.

492
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,530
But it's already late.

493
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,560
What if you encounter bad people or something unexpected happens?

494
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,350
It's not safe outside.

495
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,890
I'll be worried.

496
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:18,830
All right, then.

497
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,510
I'll go pick you up tomorrow.

498
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,650
Don't worry.

499
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,040
I'll send Pitch back tomorrow morning.

500
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:27,640
All right.

501
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,660
Pitch, be careful on your own.

502
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,480
Soh, how is Pitch?

503
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:38,850
Pitch is fine now.

504
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,020
He's with Gun.

505
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,000
We don't have to worry since he's with Gun.

506
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,120
We don't have to worry?

507
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,390
Obviously, every time Pitch is with Gun,

508
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:50,930
something bad happens.

509
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,060
Well, that's true.

510
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,070
But Gun is an adult.

511
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:57,620
I think

512
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,550
he should be able to handle it.

513
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,460
Handle it?

514
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,400
Then how did Pitch get hurt?

515
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,070
But at least...

516
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,580
At least we have one less thing to worry about now.

517
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,170
Yeah.

518
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,150
Toey, you're back. So...

519
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,060
Well,

520
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,280
where's Gun?

521
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,950
He's at his apartment.

522
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:55,980
Oh.

523
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,250
Is Gun not coming back?

524
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,610
It seems like he'll be staying at the apartment for a while.

525
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:03,800
Then...

526
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,990
Can I have Gun's address?

527
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,870
I don't have any plans today,

528
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,950
and I want to go see Gun.

529
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,660
Maybe I can learn something work-related too.

530
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:15,810
Is that okay, Pitch?

531
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:18,790
That sounds good to me.

532
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,540
Is it okay?

533
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:24,520
Is it okay?

534
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,100
Is it okay?

535
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,840
Is it okay, Toey?

536
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,330
Is it okay?

537
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,030
Please. You're the most handsome, Toey.
