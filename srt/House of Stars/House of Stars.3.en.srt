Why didn't you bring Pitch back with you?

00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,110
I apologize.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,970
How many times do I have to tell you this?

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,250
Oh, no! I have to go now.

Get out of here!

Miss Susie, I didn't mean to do that.

15
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,479
I went to the rehearsal.

00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,180
What time did the rehearsal end?

But it's okay.

158
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,980
I can show you around myself.

159
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,980
So let's get started.

160
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Where is the interview?

161
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,610
I was just kidding.

162
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,820
What's wrong with you?

163
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,810
Well, I don't like seeing you hanging out with him.

164
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,870
It was just a live stream.

165
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,540
I just didn't like it.

166
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,480
He's always against me

167
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,700
and it seems like he wants you.

168
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,980
You're being unreasonable.

169
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,980
What? I'm being unreasonable, huh?

170
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,080
Yes. I'm being unreasonable.

171
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,850
I get jealous when you're together.

172
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,380
Are you happy now?

173
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,530
Why are you jealous?

174
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,510
You're avoiding the topic again.

175
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,720
I'm not avoiding anything.

176
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,980
I simply don't want to be here.

It's fine, right?

188
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,990
It's fine.

189
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,060
Hmm... Have you spoken to Miss Susie?

190
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,120
Haha. I haven't told her about it yet.

191
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,610
Pitch, you're going to cause me trouble.

192
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,310
I will talk to her later.

193
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,180
Don't worry.

194
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,980
Hearing what you said makes me even more worried.

195
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,920
Hi, Toey.

196
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,550
Pitch, what brings you here?

197
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,220
I'm here with Gun.

198
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,980
Oh.

199
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,420
I want to learn how Gun handles his work.

200
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,900
Gun, you're here early to work out again.

201
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,450
You too.

202
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,840
Of course.

203
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,040
Pitch, are you here so early to work out too?

204
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,900
I do this sometimes.

205
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,810
Gun is my idol.

206
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,440
[He starts his workout by jogging.]

207
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,600
[The speed is all right. This is easy.]

208
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,910
How do I use this?

209
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,980
Help! Help!

210
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,050
This is so intense. Are we going to the Olympics?

211
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,750
Oh...

212
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,240
Wayu, you've been working since the morning. How are you feeling?

213
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,150
Are you tired?

214
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,079
Not at all.

215
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,079
There are only a few scenes left.

216
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,910
Hey! Toey.

217
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,770
Hello.

218
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,810
Hello.

219
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,900
It's all right.

220
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,980
You should've come in earlier.

221
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,720
Wayu did very well in the previous scene.

222
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,170
Thank you.

223
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,850
No problem.

224
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
I'll check it out once the show is aired.

225
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,110
And... Who's this?

226
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,490
He's Pitch. One of our company's actors too.

227
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,140
Hello.

228
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,580
Hello.

229
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,980
I'm here today as Toey's assistant.

230
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,450
I'd like to learn from the professionals like you.

231
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,520
Oh. He's here to learn new things.

232
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,880
I like hardworking and determined people like you.

233
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,280
Thank you.

234
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,500
Just let me know if you need any help.

235
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,180
Sure... I'll let you know.

236
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,990
I've got to get back to work.

237
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,690
All right. Bye.

238
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,130
Make yourself at home.

239
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,910
How dare you do that to me? Huh?

240
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,020
How dare you do that?

241
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Huh?

242
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,640
Why did you do that?

243
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,700
Okay. Cut!

244
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,980
You did a remarkable job just now.

245
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,530
Aren't you under their watch?

246
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,440
Change the size of the image.

247
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,800
How did it go?

248
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,310
We'll do a wide-angle shot here, then a cross-shot at the back.

249
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,810
We'll talk about the insert later.

250
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,490
Hi, Mr. Jo.

251
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,130
Miss Susie, hello.

252
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,480
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

253
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,890
I thought I should drop by to say hello. Thanks for taking care of our kids.

254
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,930
Not at all.

255
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,980
It's me who should say thank you, Miss Susie,

256
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:27,840
Thanks to you, I get to work with brilliant actors like Gun and Wayu.

257
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,690
Excuse me. I would like to see how my actors are doing.

258
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,640
Sure.

259
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,480
Hi, Miss Susie.

260
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,510
Miss Susie...

261
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,230
What are you doing here?

262
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,500
Well...

263
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,550
I found out my shortcomings,

264
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,010
so I want to improve myself and become a better person.

265
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,590
Also, I met Gun, a good role model.

266
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,730
He has everything planned out and is a very good actor.

267
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,580
Please allow me to learn from Gun.

268
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,180
If you allow me to do so,

269
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,980
I can assure you that I will definitely make improvements.

270
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,710
I wasn't expecting

271
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,300
such a good idea from you.

272
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,250
Yes.

273
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,240
What did you say, Miss Susie?

274
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,740
But on one condition.

275
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,910
Yes.

276
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,350
You must not cause any trouble to Gun.

277
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,870
Please rest assured that it won't happen.

278
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,980
Wait, Miss Susie...

279
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,980
Miss Susie. We should get going.

280
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,410
I've got to go. I'll leave Pitch with you.

281
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,220
Here. I prepared a new practice for you.

282
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,760
I watched this film before.

283
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:07,850
That's good. You're going to learn how to dub a video today.

284
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,980
Really? Sorry.

285
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,140
Yes.

286
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,370
Now, put on the earphones.

287
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,480
Let's take a look at this. Then, we're going to repeat the dialogue.

288
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,600
Are you ready?

289
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,980
All right. Three. Two. One.

290
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:51,810
"Remembar ma wurds. Vith great pover comes great resbonsipility."

291
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,380
Let's try again.

292
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:02,870
"Remembar ma wurds. Vith great pover comes great resbonsipility."

293
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,690
"Remembar ma wurds. Vith great pover comes great resbonsipility."

294
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:20,410
"Remembar ma wurds. Vith great pover comes great resbonsipility."

295
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,180
Don't do that, Peter. (with a provincial accent)

296
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,780
What's up, Pitch?

297
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,680
I visited the film set with Gun today. I need to tell you something.

298
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,230
Huh? What's wrong? What happened?

299
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,480
Did Gun do something to you?

300
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
No, he didn't.

301
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,610
Well... Gun is an A-list actor, right?

302
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,120
But he queued up for food just like everybody else did. I was really impressed.

303
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,670
He had to change into an outfit in which the colors didn't match at all.

304
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,720
But he put it on anyway, without any complaint.

305
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,680
What's more, he managed to pull off that outfit.

306
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,750
Besides, his acting was so good. He was really professional.

307
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:19,210
If you want to set me on fire, do it as you wish.

308
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,580
But... You must release my men!

309
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,490
Argh!

310
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,900
Is that so?

311
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,980
Yes. I think I made the right decision shadowing him.

312
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,350
Are you going to follow him around tomorrow too?

313
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
Definitely.

314
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,880
But don't forget that we have a rehearsal tomorrow.

315
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,230
Really?

316
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,420
Yes. Go and get some rest. It must've been a long day for you.

317
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,980
Okay. Good night.

318
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,500
Gun! Wait. Slow down, please.

319
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,470
How can you!

320
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,980
Thank you.

321
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,070
Read through it carefully before signing the contract.

322
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,080
This place is going to be your second home.

323
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,210
You can stay here. I've prepared a room for you.

324
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,100
Or you can continue to live at your place. It's up to you.

325
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,070
I've separated the boys and the girls. You'll get enough privacy.

326
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:04,580
For the common area, you can use the facilities as you like.

327
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:14,670
But my room is a restricted area and you should never enter my room.

328
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,300
Yes, ma'am.

329
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,380
Host will introduce you to the residents of the house.

330
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,730
Wow. Do you come here often to read?

331
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,320
Shh...

332
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,210
It's my first time in this room.

333
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,410
What are you reading?

334
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,370
Martial arts techniques. You're like a middle-aged man.

335
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,690
When in a library, be silent.

336
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,980
Don't you know the rule?

337
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,380
All right.

338
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,720
[Soh: Where are you?]

339
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,170
[Pitch: The library.]

340
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
Mute it.

341
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,690
[Soh: It's time for rehearsal.]

342
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,470
[Pitch: I forgot about it. I'll be there in a second.]

343
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,060
[Soh: I'll wait for you in the living room.]

344
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,980
[Pitch: Okay.]

345
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,810
Gun.

346
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,780
Gun, I've got to go.

347
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:10,250
By the way, Toey said that you have a workshop this evening, right? I'll see you then.

348
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:26,730
Sorry. I forgot about it.

349
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,980
It's okay. We still have time. We'd better get going.

350
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,120
Where are you going?

351
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,180
We are going to the fan meeting rehearsal.

352
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,950
Can I come with you?

353
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,240
I just need to see how you guys do it.

354
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,880
Sure, if you want to.

355
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,230
Okay. We'll take a break before we continue with the rehearsal for the final session,

356
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,380
which we'll do a surprise scene for our fans. Okay. Let's take a break.

357
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,680
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

358
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,080
You are very talented. You sing really well.

359
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,030
I'm flattered.

360
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,350
What else are you going to do for the rehearsal?

361
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,260
We're going to do a rehearsal for the promotion of the sequel.

362
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,430
For the series you're in?

363
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,150
Yes. We will do a special performance.

364
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,290
Then, we will officially start promoting the second season.

365
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,280
Wow. I'm excited to see it. I'm sure it'll be amazing.

366
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,850
That's too flattering.

367
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,980
I meant it! I watched the show you acted in.

368
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,560
I love the scene where you confessed your feelings to each other. You did well.

369
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Oh. Thank you so much.

370
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,150
Hearing the compliment directly is making me shy.

371
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,250
I'll get you some drinks.

372
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,420

373
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,690
Are you doing this for your fans?

Why is this happening?

377

What's the matter?

378
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,980
Someone leaked the news about the second season of our TV series.

379
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,980
Then, there will be no surprise anymore.

380
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,350
But they are real fans who really want to see the second season, right?

381
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,980
They shouldn't know about the sequel, right?

382
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,440
Maybe... Do you want to talk to them?

383
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,980
If they're really your fans, they will understand.

384
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,980
Soh, try talking to them.

He has removed it.

Do you want to come with me? I can send you to the House.

It's okay. I will visit Gun at his rehearsal.

Soh, I need to do some shopping. I'll see you at home later.

You put a lot of effort into this. What script is this? Let me have a look.

406
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,440
The hero was a spy.

407
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,130
He worked in an intelligence agency in disguise until he accomplished his mission.

408
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,170
Unfortunately, he got caught by his best friend.

409
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,890
So he had to kill his friend.

410
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,380
Wow.

411
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,840
This is so challenging.

412
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,760
Precisely.

413
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,260
It's a very challenging job.

414
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,080
I put in a lot of effort to play this character.

415
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,500
If I can't do it,

Aren't you going to do something about it?
