00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,510
[CHAT] Gun : I've arrived.

2
00:00:53,150 --> 00:01:00,040
[CHAT] Pitch : That's fast.

3
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:06,880
[CHAT] Gun : I didn't make any stop. Afraid that you would slept before arriving.

4
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:15,280
[CHAT] Pitch : Sleep? I've just finished my shooting.

5
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,740
This .. you're talking to Gun?

6
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,200
Yes, he texted me that he has arrived.

7
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,539
Anything else you guys talk. I saw you smile all the time.

8
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,570
Did I?

9
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,220
or you adore ...

10
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,650
Pitch !

11
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,280
Today you did a really great job.

12
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,470
Though that staying with Gun will cause only troubles.

13
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,479
But you've learnt a lot from him.

14
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Yes.

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,700
Thank you.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,650
Zo, are you alright?

17
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,740
Oh.

18
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,200
It's nothing.

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,470
You stayed overnight at Pitch's house? How was it?

20
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,280
I would love to go to.

21
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,100
Ummm well .. Today you can join us.

22
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,500
Hoo ... Host wouldn't let me go.

23
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,810
Oh yeah, I totally forgot.

24
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,670
It's okay. I'm grateful seeing you guys together.

25
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,720
What?

26
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,250
Oh.

27
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,370
I mean .. recently, there's a distance between 2 of you.

28
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,310
I've worried.

29
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,480
I'd like .. you two get close like before.

30
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,310
Or ...

31
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,700
Do you guys have any issue?

32
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,150
No, we don't.

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,940
It's good that you don't.

34
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,440
Though you do .. you guys would .. talk with an open heart.

35
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,810
Won't you?

36
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,810
Well ...

37
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,120
Should be.

38
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,210
Thanks to you.

39
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,370
Pitch.

40
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,250
I have something to ask.

41
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,340
What is it?

42
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,750
Do you like Gun?

43
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,120
What ?!

44
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,120
He is my role model.

45
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,079
I like him?

46
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,340
Well ! I like him but ... in a feeling that ...

47
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,580
feeling that he is my idol.

48
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,300
Not in a relation.

49
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,420
No, it's ... could be.

50
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,300
Well,

51
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,540
Why you're asking?

52
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,020
I just need to make sure something.

53
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,700
I see.

54
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,680
And ... Did you get the answer?

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,820
I think I did.

56
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,650
Yeah?

57
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,250
[CHAT] Gun : Sweet dream, see you tomorrow.

58
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,920
See you.

59
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,290
Oh ...

60
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,440
Let's .. go home. Mom is waiting.

61
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,940
Yes sir, I will definitely work hard on this, before starting the next play.

62
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,140
Yes, sawasdee krab.

63
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,980
How is everything, Wayha? Was talking about the script?

64
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,480
It's good.

65
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,940
Very interesting.

66
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,640
Though .. he told me just the first part. I've already liked it.

67
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,990
But...

68
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,610
But ... What?

69
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,750
In my script, there's a love scene.

70
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,080
I have to kiss a girl.

71
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,270
But I ...

72
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,590
I've never been in a relation since I was born.

73
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,360
So I don't know how to act it actually.

74
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,050
Never been in a relation.

75
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,880
Wow.

76
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,430
If I explain, can you imagine?

77
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,070
Umm ... let's ...

78
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,990
search it from the internet.

79
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,320
See how others do.

80
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,520
Do ?!

81
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,850
What they do?

82
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,750
I mean kissing.

83
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,180
Oh

84
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,990
I found it.

85
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,350
Kissing 101 for rookies, 1st method.

86
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,420
Send a signal that you want a kiss.

87
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,440
Without saying or ...

88
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,940
acting obviously for example ...

89
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,880
look right at their lip.

90
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,650
Don't purse your mouth.

91
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,270
Relax it until it looks natural.

92
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,430
Don't open too wide. You should still cannot breath through your mouth.

93
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,520
But wide enough to fold bottom lip.

94
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,020
Do you understand?

95
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,679
Wayha.

96
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,600
Wayha !

97
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,770
Yes?!

98
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,809
What?

99
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,980
If you get it ... I will continue reading.

100
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,410
Ummm ...

101
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,300
Well ... I don't understand.

102
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,150
You don't understand means ...

103
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,450
I pretty sure that I cannot imagine it.

104
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,680
Then ...

105
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,870
Let's watch a movie with love scenes?

106
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,050
So you can imagine.

107
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,280
Umm ... Its the idea.

108
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,590
Well, let me search it.

109
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,480
Okay, this one.

110
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,400
Oh .. wait .. this is male-male.

111
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,980
It's not male-female. I wll find the new one.

112
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,150
Oh ...

113
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,940
It's okay, Wayu. It's not different, isn't it?

114
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,600
Well ...

115
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,120
It's not different.

116
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,420
They good at kissing.

117
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,250
They're like .. gently kiss like this.

118
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,790
Little by little.

119
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,330
Then ...

120
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,350
So how about the posture?

121
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,780
I ...

122
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,450
Where should I put my hand?

123
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,050
Ummm ...

124
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,850
Wayha.

125
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,770
Let's try to do .. or act naturally.

126
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:16,440
Clear your head like .. nothing in your mind.

127
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,820
Like ... this.

128
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,950
Ow!

129
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,510
Why don't you pick up?

130
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,660
Called but no pick up, texted but no answer.

131
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,280
Damn it.

132
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,570
Mintra, sawasdee krab.

133
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,870
Sawasdee krab, Mintra.

134
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,500
Did you see Korn?

135
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,820
Errr ... I saw him with Pawin.

136
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,790
What ?!?

137
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,150
Gone with that bitch Pawin again?

138
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,070
Yes.

139
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,620
Pawin again.

140
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,700
(Whisper) Com'on .. Let's go.

141
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,730
Hellooo~

142
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,380
On this 6th right?

143
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,920
Umm ..

144
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,780
Gun is still available.

145
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,920
Do you preferred to confirm now?

146
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,060
Okay, alright.

147
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,790
Thank you so much.

148
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,340
What is it, Mintra?

149
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,690
Which shooting set did Pawin go today?

150
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,600
Please hold on, Mintra.

151
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,770
Hello there.

152
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,240
The deposit for the food truck?

153
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,820
Oh .. you can transfer back to me.

154
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,340
Alright, I'll send you my bank account.

155
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,860
Wait a sec, Mintra .. wait wait.

156
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,520
Oh .. Mintra?

157
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,550
Today is very crowded.

158
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,410
So much fun. Let's come again Korn.

159
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,060
Went out with him again?

160
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,600
Like it much? A leftover garbage,

161
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,460
which is never yours?

162
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,530
Hey !

163
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,460
The garbage you mentioned .. they are something that my fans intend to make it for me.

164
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,080
Though it's not worth for you.

165
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,940
But it means so much to me.

166
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,310
I've tried so so hard.

167
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,280
To get back together again with you.

168
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,970
Why the fuck you keep destroying it?

169
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,950
Who is the one destroying it?

170
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,390
Right now.

171
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,760
There is nothing left now.

172
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,690
Don't try to hold back the thing you've lost.

173
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,650
I don't have a feeling with you anymore.

174
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,900
And think about it wisely.

175
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
What you are doing right now.

176
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,610
Isn't it love?

177
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,600
What do you mean?

178
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,430
The things you are into right now.

179
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,210
You just need to win the game.

180
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,370
You don't even care how my feeling was.

181
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,310
You don't need to lose me for Pawin.

182
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,200
Don't want your imagined couple favor to drop.

183
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,140
You only care for your reputation.

184
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,320
That's not true.

185
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,870
I've never thought that way.

186
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,820
Korn / Let me go.

187
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,810
Leave me !!

188
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,240
Enough.

189
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,810
Ouch, finally arrived.

190
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,090
Who is that?

191
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,820
A new actor?

192
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,540
Umm ..

193
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,630
Sawasdee krab.

194
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,540
I got to go.

195
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,900
Just got back, where are you leaving to?

196
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,200
Oh, I got an urgent errand.

197
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,640
Oh and ... I saw someone in the house too.

198
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,170
Assuming that Miss Suzie recruited a new actor.

199
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,070
New actor? No, it's not.

200
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,470
Oh yeah?

201
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,470
It's time to go, be right back before the curfew.

202
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,220
See ya !

203
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,270
I have a meeting too, well then ...

204
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,680
What are you doing here?

205
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,470
Why you have to be so shocked?

206
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,770
Mother ...

207
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,980
This is not your place.

208
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,100
This is Mommy's house.

209
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,360
I have a right to stay here, havn't I?

210
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,810
Isn't it good?

211
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,620
So we can live all together ...

212
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,710
3 of us.

213
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,200
You 2 go put away your stuff.

214
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,010
And you ...

215
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,119
It's Sun.

216
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,970
My name is Sun.

217
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,910
You named it for me, Mom.

218
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,010
What do you want?

219
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,290
I just need my mom.

220
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,080
Let me stay here with you mom.

221
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,350
With my sister.

222
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,910
Can I?

223
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,650
You will leave me to stay by myself again, mom?

224
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,280
You may stay here.

225
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,410
Mo ...

226
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,410
But stay away from everyone in this house.

227
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,020
Not a problem.

228
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,540
Thank you.

229
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,510
Mother.

230
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,740
Go easy on me alright?

231
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,370
Sis'.

232
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,640
Wayha.

233
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,050
The movie you've watched. How was it?

234
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,980
Oh ..

235
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,670
It's good. But ...

236
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,480
I quite don't get it.

237
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,600
I think I have to try it in real life.

238
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,780
Try in real life?

239
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,910
Yo ! Zo ! brother.

240
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,480
You got back from the other city?

241
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,800
Is it fun?

242
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,070
Umm ... It's good.

243
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,210
Hmmm .. Here, Wayha.

244
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,520
Zo used to be in a kissing scene with Pitch too.

245
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,970
I think, let ask hime, would get a lot of new ideas.

246
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,400
Oh ! That's true.

247
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,320
Brother, the series you played.

248
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,720
I ever watched it before.

249
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,700
Both of you were in the relation.

250
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,020
Very good chemistry.

251
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,340
I thought it was real. / Excuse me.

252
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,700
Well ... I'm exhausted.

253
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,150
Umm ... I .. I desperately need you to teach me how to kiss.

254
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,950
Please Zo !

255
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,940
What now?

256
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,040
It's okay.

257
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,050
Zo seems really tired.

258
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,170
I will help you then.

259
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,450
#GunPitch

260
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,310
That's a great couple. #GunPitch

261
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,390
Isn't that a senior and junior in the same company?
They are so close, how can we resist to imagine, sis'?
I think their relation is real.

262
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,850
LEAKED Leading actor G dating with P at the mall.

263
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,780
Gun is the senior who Pitch keep following to improve himself? #ZoPitch

264
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,600
Zo is lunatic.

265
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,650
Actually he is insane? Need a prescription at the psychiatric hospital every week?

266
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,410
Becuase Pitch cheated on Zo, Zo becomes depress.
#AntiGunPitch #ZoPitchOnly

267
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,130
The third wheel ruins everything.
Never thought Pitch would do this. #AntiGunPitch

268
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,320
Zo is obsessive. Pity Pitch.
#AntiGunPitch

269
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,410
It's not Zo who lunatic.
In fact, Zo has a lunatic mistress instead. #AntiGunPitch

270
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,050
Zo, brother, could you please open the door?

271
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,600
Zo.

272
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,420
Zo, brother?

273
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,590
What is happening?

274
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,550
Wayha, look at this.

275
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,160
It's gone viral.

276
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,810
And ... where is Zo now?

277
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,440
Zo is in the room now.

278
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,090
I've knocked many times but he doesn't seem to come open.

279
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,470
Zo, brother.

280
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,710
Zo.

281
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,010
Zo.

282
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,250
Do you hear me?

283
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,870
Can you open the door?

284
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,630
He won't.

285
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,720
I've knocked for too long.

286
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,640
May I get in?

287
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,160
Hey

288
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,570
Let them talk.

289
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,600
Yo.

290
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,070
Are you alright?

291
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,500
The social communities,

292
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,920
They didn't know the fact. They just post it for fun.

293
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,900
Put a spin to make it becomes bigger.

294
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,020
They don't even care the truth.

295
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,760
You don't overthinking.

296
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,040
I'm here by your side.

297
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,530
I believe that ..

298
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,820
Miss Suzie could possibly handle this for sure.

299
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,010
It's gonna be alright.

300
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,310
I didn't do it.

301
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,530
I'm their fans.

302
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,560
I will don't destroy Zo's reputation.

303
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,140
If you didn't do it, then who did?

304
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,620
You may thought that their relation didn't go as you expect.

305
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,190
So you want to destroy them.

306
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,570
Not only me who is just the fans that really like them.

307
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,950
Moreover,

308
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,710
Since that day you caught me,

309
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,270
I didn't stalk Zo-Pitch anymore.

310
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,110
Host also keeps an eye on me.

311
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,430
Even breathing ... It's very difficult.

312
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,560
Isn't it normal, that I doubted you.

313
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,090
No.

314
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,600
But I still insist what I said.,

315
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,950
that I didn't do it.

316
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,100
Why are you so worried about this?

317
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,760
When Pitch was injured you still ...

318
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,270
Keep going...

319
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,760
I just want to come and listen.

320
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,570
I already told Zo.

321
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,540
Okay.

322
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,000
Go ahead and leave.

323
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,370
Just check Gun's and Pitch's work schedule for me.

324
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,700
So we can arrange the press conference together.

325
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,260
and don't forget to tell Zo ..

326
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,880
that don't have to worry.

327
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,730
Okay.

328
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,190
You're really good at

329
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,310
taking care of other's families.

330
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,680
But with your own family,

331
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,620
You've never take a good care.

332
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,500
Right?

333
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,620
Everyone's here,

334
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,700
is my family.

335
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,270
Everything alright?

336
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,390
Yes.

337
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,120
I am done with the location and already made an appointment with the medias.

338
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,430
Good.

339
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,810
And this is a result of Zo's mental health check.

340
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,300
Tomorrow I leave it to you.

341
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,980
Don't give them a chance,

342
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,090
to keep stirring the news.

343
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,600
Sure.

344
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,020
Well noted.

345
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,290
Coffee?

346
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,000
Yes.

347
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,480
Here ...

348
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,380
Filtered Coffee .. Dark Roast.

349
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,660
Thank you.

350
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,990
Have you prepared today's proclaim?

351
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,810
Yes, I have.

352
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,160
You don't have to worry.

353
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,000
For the news that is being talked about in the social media right now,

354
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,490
about the mental symptom of Zo.

355
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,250
It was from someone who have a malicious intention.

356
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,410
We didn't rest assured,

357
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,270
This is the result of Zo's health check.

358
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,940
including the mental health.

359
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,050
The result came out normal.

360
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,170
Then the picture we saw ...

361
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,850
What Zo is doing at a psychiatric hospital?

362
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,710
Is is real or not?

363
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,410
Uh ...

364
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,850
It really was me ...

365
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,630
But ..

366
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,940
I was just visiting a distant relative ..

367
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,810
who is recovering there.

368
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,850
Not a secret girlfriend as we knew from the news ?

369
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,770
This is very funny.

370
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,610
I'm still single, I'm in the mood of wanting to have a sweetheart.

371
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,470
Hmmm~ Sweetheart~

372
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,870
Actually ..

373
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,140
As I became a public person, I ...

374
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,610
already thought that ..

375
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,380
There must be a lot of news coming out.

376
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,000
Both true and not true.

377
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,660
But ..

378
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,510
I want everyone

379
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,580
use a little judgment when sharing those news.

380
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,430
Because,

381
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,030
some of these things may change someone's life.

382
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,250
Then #Gunphith

383
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,590
that netizens began to match them.

384
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,780
Is it true?

385
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,880
Gun and Pitch are senior and junior from the house.

386
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,870
And Gun is the most experienced.

387
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,750
So he takes a responsibility to take care of the juniors when Miss Suzie is busy.

388
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,010
Recently, there is a food support truck from the house

389
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,670
that went on the shooting set of Zo & Pitch.

390
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,850
That's right.

391
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,660
If I'm free, I'll be a representative of the house.

392
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,830
to take care of everyone in the house.

393
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,520
Seeing the youngsters to perform better

394
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,560
I'm grateful.

395
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,870
Leaked photos of Gun and Pitch walking at the mall.

396
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,530
Holding a hand.

397
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,730
How was it?

398
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,440
Yes. / How was it? / Was that true? / Holding each other hand ..

399
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,760
Pitch and I are close.

400
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,410
When I want to hang around,

401
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,170
go out for some food, go shopping, or watch a movie,

402
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,950
with my brother, this is normal.

403
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,970
Very good

404
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,390
Intimate~

405
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,020
Um..

406
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,150
[Sound of reporters talking]

407
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,760
That's pity.

408
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,780
See both of you together.

409
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,950
Feel like the imagined couple .

410
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,610
So cute.

411
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:27,800
Aye!

412
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,730
You had a good interview today.

413
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,130
But Gun gave such an awesome interview!

414
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,600
What a brilliant person.

415
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,900
Umm ...

416
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,980
Will you go home or go back to the 'House' today?

417
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,760
Should be the 'House'.

418
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,900
Um ..

419
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,020
And tomorrow are you're going to visit Sin?

420
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,760
Probably.

421
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,880
I will come with you alright?

422
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,750
Have you eaten yet?

423
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,010
I'm not very hungry.

424
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,650
Today, I plan to skip dinner.

425
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,430
Are you okay?

426
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,690
If you feel too stress,

427
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,590
Want to try seeing a doctor I know?

428
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,170
I can remcommend to you.

429
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,920
No, it's okay.

430
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,820
Pardon me.

431
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,400
But I'm hungry.

432
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,700
Is there anything for me to eat?

433
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,480
Eh ...

434
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,640
or let me find my own food

435
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,550
I found that the people in this house are good at having an affair.

436
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,130
Mom, you don't know or pretend like you don't care about me?

437
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,410
I'm sorry.

438
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,240
For misbehaving.

439
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,610
I apologize for making you feel bad.

440
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,160
I know I put too much pressure on you.

441
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,940
But I wish the best for you.

442
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,880
I'm not worried about the reputation like you said.

443
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,760
Give me one more chance, Korn.

444
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,620
I can't live without you.

445
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,080
I love you so much.

446
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,290
I think I've said it all.

447
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,590
Please give me one last chance, Korn.

448
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,130
Enough.

449
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,969
Even you do like this ...

450
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,120
I don't have any emotions anymore.

451
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,250
Korn ...

452
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,860
Let me go to the toilet.

453
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,820
What are you looking at?

454
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,310
Heh! Looking at a bad bitch having a downfall.

455
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,880
Even if you sacrifice yourself to test him, he still don't want you.

456
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,220
Slu ... / Ouch !

457
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,130
Calm down.

458
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,210
Slut ..

459
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,570
Wow~

460
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,010
Take it easy.

461
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,440
Don't be mad.

462
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,450
People will find out that ...

463
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,520
you are obsessed too.

464
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,980
None of your fucking business !

465
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,250
I want to ask you something?

466
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,350
Pitch like Gun?

467
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,550
Yes.

468
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,870
I like him.

469
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,270
But ..

470
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,370
In a feeling that ...

471
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,860
feeling that he is my role model.

472
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,380
Not in a relation.

473
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,840
Then why did you let Pitch go to live with you?

474
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,000
or ...

475
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,800
You like Pitch.

476
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,410
Zo.

477
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,150
I think you should understand our house rules.

478
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,260
or you won't follow the rules.

479
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,070
I know the rules well.

480
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,530
Good.

481
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,140
That's all you wanted to say?

482
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,010
Don't you have to work today?

483
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,440
No, I don't.

484
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,420
Instead of taking a break during holiday.

485
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:51,880
Actually

486
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,280
You don't need to come.

487
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,060
It's okay.

488
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,010
I came as a representative of the house.

489
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,620
Thank you for coming.

490
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,410
Zo.

491
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,040
Zin.

492
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,070
Zo is here.

493
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,290
Have you eaten yet?

494
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,660
Is there any homework for me to help?

495
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,850
Aren't Zin getting any better?

496
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,310
Ummm ...

497
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,950
Well ...

498
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,220
As you can see.

499
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,490
Seeing someone's face, thinking it is me all the time.

500
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,040
So has your father come to take care?

501
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,750
Not at all.

502
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,330
He never come back at all.

503
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,150
Only send the money as always.

504
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,960
This is ...

505
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,370
Zin.

506
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,970
My older brother.

507
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,110
And this ..

508
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,260
is Gun.

509
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,200
The guy I've mentioned.

510
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,540
Sawasdee krab.

511
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,950
Sawasdee, Zo.

512
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,390
If the accident didn't happen.

513
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,570
Now, my brother, Zin must be famous just like Gun.

514
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,300
The reason why I became an actor.

515
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,630
Actually,

516
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,160
I carry on his dream.

517
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,330
Zin has dreamed of being an actor.

518
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,920
He has always told me ...

519
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,190
He will become the country's highest paid star.

520
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,790
He will get rich.

521
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,580
So he could stand in the flashlight.

522
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,730
He has been to the casting many times.

523
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,760
Finally, he became a leading actor.

524
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,230
But then ...

525
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,680
Unfortunately, he got into the accident.

526
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,280
7 years ago, maybe?

527
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,640
After got hit by a car.

528
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,410
Consequently, he has suffered from a serious PTSD.

529
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,970
At first ...

530
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,630
The symptom was very crucial.

531
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,690
Keep picturing the fatal event.

532
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,940
Can't even live normally.

533
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:32,960
Recently ...

534
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,530
he is getting much better.

535
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,380
But always see everybody face as ...

536
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,910
Gun?

537
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,100
Gun?

538
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,750
Gun, brother?

539
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,350
Oh ?!

540
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,710
What ?!

541
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,810
Gun would you like to talk to .. Sin?

542
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,160
I got to go now.

543
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,920
What?

544
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,780
Where are you going?

545
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,250
Gun.

546
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,200
Hello?

547
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,200
Miss Suzie.

548
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,310
You knew it all the time?

549
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,980
whom did I crash.

550
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,350
What had you known?

551
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,900
Answer me !

552
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,650
Yes.

553
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,330
I knew it.

554
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,490
Why you keep hiding me all the time?

555
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,290
How can you do this?

556
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,690
If I didn't do like this.

557
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,700
Is there gonna be you today?

558
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,280
But this is one's life.

559
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,880
I destroyed his life.

560
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,640
Destroyed his family.

561
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,970
Damn you !

562
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,610
I'll speak to you at the 'House'.

563
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,140
Gun, brother.

564
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,310
Gun ... Gun !

565
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,020
Let me go !!!

566
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,000
What's the matter with you, bitch ?!

567
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,890
Arghhhhhhhhhh.

568
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,330
Hey !!

569
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,460
Mintra !

570
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,080
Mintra !

571
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,730
Korn.

572
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,130
You should be dead by now !

573
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,270
Enough.

574
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,570
You alright?

575
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,070
Ouch!

576
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,880
What's happening ?!

577
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,010
So what happened actually?

578
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,920
You know who did this.

579
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,770
But you chose to hide it from me.

580
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,620
How the fuck you did this?

581
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,650
A kids that act so dissolute like you.

582
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,600
How could you do anything?

583
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,140
I know your relation doesn't go well.

584
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,690
Would you make it better?

585
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,730
or make it worst?

586
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,960
Then you guys pack your things and get out from this house.

587
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,090
I think,

588
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:39,450
We should stop our relation.

589
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,060
Brother.

590
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,070
How are you.

591
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,110
Go out for a walk like this ...

592
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,400
It feels good.

593
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,240
Would you like to go anywhere, brother?

594
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,660

595
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,760
