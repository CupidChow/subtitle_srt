00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Brother Ag, I got Brother Kang to be in this drama.

3
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Is that true?

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I want Brother Kang to be the lead.

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Wow!

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You can attract more fans.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Great!

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's really great!

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hello.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm here whenever I mention him!

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hello, Brother Kang. My name is... WEE@is the organizer.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And this is Ag, the director of this drama.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hello!

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, we've discussed it.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to make you the main character of this drama.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But I want to invite you

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
to dub the role with your partner for the audition today.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Sure!

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay. That’s great.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hello @I'm Wilha Jardan

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm 1.80cm tall, weighing 75kg, age 23.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Where are you from?

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's me...

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's okay. It's okay!

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, let's do this. We'll go straight to the role audition.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Did you get the script? Yes. Okay.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
[Whiha is the protagonist's friend.]

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Then he came out and met Marco.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The main character is Kang, okay?

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you ready? 3...2 and action!

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Why did you do that?

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You know what will happen

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
what will happen!

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You said it yourself, Marco!

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Once I get the evidence, everything will be over.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But if they know that we did it,

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
what should we do?

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I know you don't want to take the risk!

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but there’s no other way.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Just follow your plan!

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll take care of the rest!

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, stop!

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Whaha: Your performance is not bad.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And you look good too. Okay.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But I don’t think you speak clearly.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I brought some accent.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay. Then wait outside!

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I’ll ask someone to send you the audition result.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay. Thank you.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Next, please come in.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hello.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Pizza. You play my role? Dream is Happy. The main character of this drama, right?

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes!

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm watching your drama. I really love it.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you!

[Why do actors of the Y series]

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
want to audition for an action film?

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I want to start a new life for myself.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I want to get more challenging roles

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
so that the audience can see my acting skills.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hello...

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is Picci with you?

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How did you know?

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, let's take a look.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Are you ready? Three, two, action!

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Why did you do that?

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You know what will happen if you get caught!

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You said it yourself, didn't you?

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If I get the evidence, everything will be over.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But what if you get caught?

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I know you don't want to take the risk

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is there any other way?

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
How about this? Just do what you're responsible for!

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll take care of the rest!

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't you care about others' lives?

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't care what others do!

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's enough as long as our plan is completed!

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're so selfish!

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
OK... stop!

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Pizza!

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You've experienced acting. I want to be honest!

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You're a good actor

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Your performance is not bad, and you have a good mindset.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But your personality doesn't suit the one I'm looking for!

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don’t blame yourself. I believe you’re not ready yet.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I think your current show is airing. That's great!

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay. Thank you!

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The audition failed again.

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay. It’s okay.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There will be another chance.

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I had an audition several times before I was finally selected.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But how many times has it been?

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It’s not enough to use all my fingers and your fingers.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Will I be kicked out?

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't worry!

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The one who should be worried should be...

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Pizza, come with me!

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000

100

Why did you call me here?

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Where did you go last night?

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Do you think I don't know what you did?

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hey, Picci! Why are you here?

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's past curfew time. If you get caught...

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Shush... Duk, don’t tell anyone.

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I have something to ask you.

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
[I'll be back right away after you say hello. I promise.]

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then why didn't you call?

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I called. Did you answer?

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don’t think I heard anything.

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Just tell me if you need anything.

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I heard there’s an audition tomorrow.

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I want to know where the audition is?

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What time is it?

115
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's all?

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What do you want to know?

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Please tell me, Ted!

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay? Please!

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000

Tak, come on, come on!

123
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Have you forgotten that Duk is my man?

124
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You sneaked out in the middle of the night

125
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How lucky I am! Nothing happened!

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And what happened today.

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're so bold. You sneaked out for an audition and didn't tell me!

128
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I...

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No need to explain!

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know @You're so tough now

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You act on your own again.

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who will be affected?

133
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's a family rule, why?

134
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I... I'm sorry.

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I just wanted to find a chance to prove myself.

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
An opportunity?

137
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
To prove yourself?

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Haven't I given you enough opportunities in the past?

139
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Advertising again Drama @Let you have today

140
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You said you wanted a chance!

141
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
but you hurt others. Is that true?

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Your reckless behavior

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You're a person who kills others' opportunities.

144
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't you know? What did you do?

145
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I didn't mean it.

146
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm really sorry.

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If you want to prove your ability, go out and do your best!

148
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There’ll be a fan celebration in two months.

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Focus on the rehearsal.

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't let this happen again!

151
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Otherwise, I won't let you stay!

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can make you famous and block you!

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You can go now!

154
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Congratulations on your new drama.

155
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you.

156
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Then why did Picci go to audition today?

157
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He sneaked out!

158
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He just wants to prove himself.

159
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It’s good to have ambition and aspiration.

160
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But everything happens at the right time.

161
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Pizza is a beginner in this field.

162
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Even if he made a little mistake, everything could be in vain.

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You know that too!

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yes!

165
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What brings you here today?

166
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's not about that kid, is it?

167
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes...

168
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I dreamed about that again!

169
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Don’t worry. It’s been a long time.

170
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You can try to find the doctor I introduced, okay?

171
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's okay.

172
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I won't let this happen again. Will it get better?

174
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay!

175
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
OK!

176
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Did they talk inside?

177
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't change the subject.

178
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I know

179
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But you have to be decisive sometimes.

180
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Okay.

181
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Pizza, why did you go to the audition today?

182
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What does Susie say?

183
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Do you need my help?

184
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
No!

185
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I just want to have a chance to prove myself

186
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
but I failed.

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You've been thinking too much since yesterday, haven't you?

188
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I told you not to think too much!

189
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't think too much about that anymore.

190
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Then why...

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I just realized

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
what I did was terrible!

193
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I never thought it would affect people around me.

194
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Now that I think about it, it’s so bad.

195
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You mean...

196
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It’s like I ruined the same audition as Haha.

197
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We all had that experience.

198
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
We should know that too.

199
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
How many people will come to audition?

200
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
In the end, they only chose few or even one person.

201
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I never thought of that.

202
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But if I did that, what would my brothers think?

203
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think

204
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
you should talk to him directly.

205
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and tell him directly.

206
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You're right.

207
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Then I'll go find Whiha first.

208
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Thank you.

209
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Weiha, are you there?

210
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What are you doing here?

211
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm looking for Wai-ha.

212
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I want to apologize to him!

213
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It’s good to know how to apologize.

214
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
From now on, you should think about everything.

215
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't make more mistakes.

216
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay.

217
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You don't have to be curious about anything.

218
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Wait, I'm not done yet.

219
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You did well today.

220
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'll get going then.

221
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Wow.

222
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yes.

223
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Have you seen Haha?

224
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Haha?

225
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I think it's upstairs.

226
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay Thank you

227
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Haha.

228
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's Pizza. What's the matter?

229
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I want to apologize to you.

230
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You can be mad at me or hate me.

231
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I was thoughtless.

232
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I didn't mean to steal your audition.

233
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't want you to think

234
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
you have less auditions.

235
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I never thought about that.

236
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm really sorry.

237
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, boss!

238
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I didn’t pass the audition because of you.

239
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Don't think too much.

240
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's because I'm incompetent.

241
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Also,

242
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm used to failing the audition!

243
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's nothing.

244
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Don't worry.

245
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Did you fail the audition again?

246
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yes.

247
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Thank you, Whaha.

248
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yes, Piccolo.

249
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Don't worry about it.

250
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I bought roasted chicken and papaya salad.

251
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's eat together.

252
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll help you. Come on.

253
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What?

254
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Minda

255
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Why are you so late?

256
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I've been waiting.

257
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

258
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It’s hot, tired and hungry.

259
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Then try this.

260
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
A vitamin drink.

261
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It’s refreshing and satisfying.

262
00:22:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But dating in public is also good.

263
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Wow, it tastes good.

264
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Thank you, Kang Eun.

265
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Kang Eun knows me best.

266
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
A vitamin drink.

267
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Best drink for my best friend!

268
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Okay, stop... Okay! Staff, take it.

269
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Wow, it's hot, right?

270
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Here's your fan.

271
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You two did a great job.

272
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
As expected of the best couple of the year.

273
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Everyone is envious.

274
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's not that bad.

275
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Thank you.

276
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But there is a rumor

277
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I was a little shocked too.

278
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I didn't expect a famous star like Kang Eun

279
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
fell in love with a pretty little evil girl like Minda.

280
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And there’s a rumor that Min is pregnant.

281
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah! It’s indeed a fearful rumor.

282
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Say whatever you want.

283
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
If you just talk, you'll feel better. I won't take it to heart.

284
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Much better than someone else.

285
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm afraid people might find out

286
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm afraid the red color will go down.

287
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
More people like the same sex.

288
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Wow! That's too much.

289
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What do you mean?

290
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Love is a relationship between two people, it has nothing to do with gender!

291
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's their business to love each other

292
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What era is this?

293
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I didn't expect you to be so old-fashioned.

294
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I have to go.

295
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Why did you drag me out?

296
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I don't understand why you're mad at her

297
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Look at her!

298
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I know you're very optimistic about these things

299
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But it's working time. Mind your emotions, okay?

300
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
She's just saying.

301
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Even I’m gossiped.

302
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Anyway, it’s working time.

303
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Don’t worry. OK?

304
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Okay, let's go!

305
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I’m just in time.

306
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Please come here and stand here.

307
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Okay.

308
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Please take a group of "cute".

309
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
About 3-4 photos.

310
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Okay, no sound.

311
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Thank you.

312
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Okay, everyone get ready.

313
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Ready... 3...2, action!

314
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Good. Cut! Good.

315
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Okay. Thank you very much.

316
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Thank you very much

317
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Thank you.

318
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Please give me back the props.

319
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Thank you

320
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You can get changed later.

321
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.

322
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Thank you so much.

323
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You did great. Thank you so much.

324
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
We'll work together again sometime.

325
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Okay. See you next time.

326
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But I have to apologize to Kang Eun.

327
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
If I say something that makes you uncomfortable,

328
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm really sorry.

329
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
[It's okay.]

330
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And I'm sorry if I said something too much

331
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yes

332
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I didn't know that Kang Eun would think like this

333
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But it's okay

334
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
See you again.

335
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Bye. I'm leaving.

336
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Bye bye

337
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It's me Hello

338
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
[I'm running out of facial masks.]

339
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Let's go to the mall on our way back.

340
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
No, I'm not in the mood.

341
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What if you get caught?

342
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I know you don't want to take the risk

343
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Is there any other way?

344
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I know you don't want to take the risk

345
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But there's no other choice. Marco...

346
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
No, let's do it again!

347
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I knew you don't want to take risks

348
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But there's no other way. Marco!

349
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
If you can act like Piccolo, that’s great.

350
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I know you don’t want to take risks.

351
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Is there any other way?

352
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What's that video?

353
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Well...

354
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's a video of Piccolo audition.

355
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Are you going to say...

356
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Piece went to the same audition with you?

357
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yes.

358
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Since Kang Eun is here

359
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Please watch my performance

360
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I want your guidance

361
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
No.

362
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm not good at this.

363
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
See you.

364
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Why did he go there?

365
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Probably secretly.

366
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
When I saw him that day,

367
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yes. Or do you want to audition too?

368
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Now I have a new YY drama

369
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And I still need a character.

370
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I think that character suits you well.

371
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Anyway, should I ask the director?

372
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I promise that if you play that role,

373
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
your fans will love it.

374
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Trust me!

375
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
[You don't have to suffer anymore.]

376
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Being with those annoying people

377
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Are you scolding me?

378
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
No. Don't be so guilty.

379
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Why didn't you protect me?

380
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
What do you want me to say?

381
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Want some?

382
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I know you don't want to take the risk

383
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But trust me.

384
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I have no choice.

385
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
[Then everything will be over.]

386
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Are you still rehearsing?

387
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I think I...

388
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I wasn't good enough, so I didn't pass the audition.

389
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But it's too hard to rehearse alone!

390
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yes. Can you please watch my performance?

391
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Me?

392
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Me?

393
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Let's start!

394
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Let's start. 3...2...1.

395
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I know you don't want to take the risk, but you have no choice, Marco!

396
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Just follow the plan.

397
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'll take care of it.

398
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Stop!

399
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Did I do a bad job?

400
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Actually, it's not bad.

401
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Will you make it more clear?

402
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
For example, Marco. No, Marco.

403
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco...

404
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Hey... Your pronunciation is correct. Let's try again from the beginning!

405
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I know you don't want to take this risk, but you have no choice, Marco.

406
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Let's relax and talk slowly.

407
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I know you don't want to take the risk

408
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
but Marco has no choice.

409
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Good. That's it!

410
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I can't believe

411
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I mean it. You graduated from the Literature Department anyway. Please help him with Whiha.

412
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I...

413
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Please.

414
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Please.

415
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Okay.

416
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco!

417
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
How is it? Are you feeling better after talking to Whiha?

418
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Yes. I apologized and talked to him, and I felt a little relieved.

419
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I promise I won’t let this happen again.

420
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:27,000
[It's better to communicate thoughts and feelings through communication.]

421
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
If anything happens again... Don’t think too much.

422
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Okay. Speaking of communication,

423
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Kang Eun?

424
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
He came to praise me. It's amazing!

425
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
What did you say?

426
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Well, when I was looking for Whiha,

427
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
why did he suddenly come to you?

428
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Yeah!

429
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Maybe it’s because I went to work with him today. And I did a good job. Maybe he likes it.

430
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Maybe he just wanted to comfort me.

431
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It’s hard to figure out what Kang Eun is thinking.

432
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Well, do you know about the fan meeting? what Kang Eun is thinking?

433
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Sophie told me.

434
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Why?

435
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I got a song. I wanted to ask you out for a rehearsal.

436
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Do you want to listen with me?

437
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Sure!

438
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Hello.

439
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
[Today's self-defense lesson is delayed to 17.] 00 p.m.

440
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Okay.

441
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Hello. Did you wait long?

442
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Are you hot? No, I can wait.

443
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Thank you. [Okay.]

444
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Sure. Let me take a picture for you.

445
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Come in and take a picture. Hold this for me.

446
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Closer. One, two, three. Okay.

447
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Can I kiss your face?

448
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Thank you. Come on. Come on.

449
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Okay.

450
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Let Soo sing first.

451
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
As for Picci, you stand by on the right, you'll come out and sing in the second part, understand?

452
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Also, I don't want you to sing in a rigid way.

453
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'll do my best to make the song

454
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And we can try rehearsing. You all look at me.

455
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
If you're an audience, try your best to show the greatest infection.

456
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Picci, stand by on the right and ask Soo to stand by on the left. Are you ready?

457
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
If you're ready, then get ready. Ready, right?

458
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Not too much, not too painful

459
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
How patient I am I can say I never cry

460
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I've always been okay and lonely

461
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
We don't talk much I don't understand your thoughts

462
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
From the day we became distant

463
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Every day When I think of you

464
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Do you think I have the chance to surpass me?

465
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I love you so much.

466
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I like you so much.

467
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But you’ve been so cold to me lately.

468
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It’s weird. You’ve changed.

469
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
What happened? Why aren't you like before?

470
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
[Before you changed,]

471
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
We looked at each other face-to-face. We did that every time.

472
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
If there’s a misunderstanding, we can understand each other at any time.

473
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It won’t be so painful.

474
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Okay. The first rehearsal was pretty good.

475
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
[It's nice to have a personality like this. I like it.]

476
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
As for Picci, I think you don't understand the song well enough!

477
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I think you just sing it plainly and have no inner personality.

478
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You know what I mean, right?

479
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yes.

480
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Okay. Both are okay, right? @I want you to rehearse again.

481
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Are you ready? Then please get ready.

482
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Wow.

483
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yes

484
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Why did you bring such children's books?

485
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Oh... Sister Susie asked me to teach you how to pronounce Wah.

486
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So you don't have to go out today?

487
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm going out soon.

488
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Okay. I’m leaving.

489
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Okay.

490
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Hello. Is that Deok?

491
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm almost there. You can get ready.

492
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Okay. What did you bring so much?

493
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Are you practicing writing?

494
00:41:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Why is there a textbook for elementary school kids?

495
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You need to get the basics first.

496
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You know? We are different in pronunciation

497
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's because of the vocal cords

498
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and how to think and analyze.

499
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Read it carefully from the first alphabet to the last alphabet.

500
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Can you just jump to read the rhyme?

501
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Why?

502
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Isn't this too childish?

503
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Sure.

504
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You're good at bargaining.

505
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Let's start with that.

506
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Follow my pronunciation.

507
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Ah...

508
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Yi... Yi...

509
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
El... O... Wo.

510
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
If you can't, you have to go back and read the alphabet first!

511
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Read it again.

512
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Ah...

513
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
One more time.

514
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Ah... Yiyi...

515
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You want some?

516
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Ah...

517
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Ii...

518
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Is it good?

519
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Your mouth got dirty?

520
00:43:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Right now, it's like we're singing in a clear voice Okay?

521
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
We used to laugh together.

522
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
We looked at each other face to face. We did it every time.

523
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Hya! Ah! Push!

524
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:02,000
If there’s a misunderstanding, we can understand each other at any time.

525
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It won’t be so painful.

526
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Good. @In fact, the teacher wants Picci to blend in more emotional factors.

527
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
As for Soo, your emotions are expressed very well.

528
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It’s like we really have such deep love, OK?

529
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Okay. That's all for today. Okay. Thank you.

530
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Thank you. Take a break. Thank you.

531
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
HOST, I’d like to talk about Pizza and Soo’s future schedule.

532
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Sure. Thank you.

533
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Can you two go home alone? I need to talk about work.

534
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Sure. Okay. Call me when you get home. Have a safe trip.

535
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I'm sorry. I couldn't do it well today.

536
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It’s okay @Pizza is already good.

537
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
The teacher praised you a lot when you were singing. I’m no match for him.

538
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Wow, you’re really good.

539
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I didn’t. I’m serious.

540
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Picci, don't underestimate yourself!

541
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Yeah. I want to see Shin today. Do you want to go with me?

542
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Well, it's better not to. I've been watched a lot lately.

543
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Say hello to Shin for me.

544
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Sure. Shall I take you home first?

545
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's okay. If you're going to give me a ride, I'll go around.

546
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I can go back by myself.

547
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Should I? But there aren’t many cars around here.

548
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Don't worry about me!

549
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Tell me when you get home. Okay. Shin is waiting.

550
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Wait. Here. Thank you.

551
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Let me take you to change... This way, please.

552
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Wow! Brother, let me help you!

553
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
No problem. I'll take it myself. Thank you.

554
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It's okay. I'll help.

555
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
You're the one who took the day off, right?

556
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Yes.

557
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
What's your name?

558
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Pizza... Oh, Yi? Then come with me. I'll come right now.

559
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I'll pick this up later. Come on, come here quickly!

560
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Okay, let's start now. Start with the first move.

561
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Please put water in the bucket. I’ll get more water later.

562
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Okay.

563
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
That's it. That's it. Do you want to try?

564
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Okay, let's rehearse.

565
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Kang Eun, stand here for me. Action.

566
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
One, two, three, four, five.

567
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Throw, throw, punch, shield, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

568
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Ah @OK

569
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Can I? Okay, let's take a rest and drink some water and review the order.

570
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yiyi... Yiyi, bring water to my brother... Here.

571
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Here’s some water.

572
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Shin, how is it?

573
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Soo.

574
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Today... I bought your favorite brown sugar pie for you.

575
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I'll get it for you.

576
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I have a lot to tell you.

577
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I’m sure you’ll be most interested in them.

578
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Let me put it in my mouth.

579
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Ah...

580
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Hey...throw.

581
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Okay?

582
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Your shoulder must hurt.

583
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I'll find you a new partner later.

584
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Come here!

585
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It's you. Don't look at others.

586
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Come and help me.

587
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Go and get some rest.

588
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I'm sorry.

589
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
What was your name again?

590
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Pizza...nickname Yi.

591
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Yi...Yi...

592
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
You saw it just now, right? Can it work?

593
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Yes, okay?

594
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Okay!

595
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Start... Hey, good!

596
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
3... Hey... 4.

597
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Throw... Bang!

598
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
OK?

599
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
No problem.

600
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh no... I gotta go!

601
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Boss...

602
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's urgent! Go straight! Hey!

603
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Get out of this house!

604
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Kang Eun…

605
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I don’t like you hanging out with him.

606
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Why are you jealous?

607
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Is it okay to come with us like this?

608
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I'll go get a new guy.

609
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Oh! Whatever.

610
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
What are you doing here?

611
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Have you seen Mons?

612
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
This kid is interesting.

613
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
A little halo, but we need to train him.

614
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
What's your name?

615
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Is it me?

616
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I'm Pizza.
