194
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,400
Thank you very much.

195
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,410
He looks scary.

196
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:56,930
Right?

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,710
If you get the villain role, you'll be famous.

198
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,080
That's a great image.

199
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,770
Host, the autopsy results are out.

200
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,800
Wait here.

201
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,790
I'll go to the hospital and take care of everything.

202
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,500
Why do you look so disappointed when you see me?

203
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,330
No.

204
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,990
Something ridiculous keeps happening today.

205
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,330
What happened?

206
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,590
A lot.

207
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,440
Is there anything I want to know?

208
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,840
You know that Sun is Suie's child.

209
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,130
I can tell from the clues.

210
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,810
Do you know that Miss Host is also Sussie's child?

211
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,030
This is also...

212
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:30,900
Ha?

213
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,920
That's it

214
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,110
We were as surprised as you when we found out.

215
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,670
What about the Most?

216
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,270
Host is waiting for the autopsy results at the hospital.

217
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,860
We're waiting for Miss Host.

218
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,630
Have you eaten?

219
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,190
I know you're worried.

220
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,590
Your health is also important.

221
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,440
What do you want to eat? I'll order for you.

222
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,600
Are you buying?

223
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:04,619
No.

224
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,810
With the money from House.

225
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,140
I don't know who pays this month

226
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,100
Host, how did it go?

227
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,170
The autopsy results are out.

228
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,220
Mom...

229
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,460
Sister Susie

230
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,220
died of severe food allergy.

231
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,680
And alcohol

232
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,110
has worsened allergic reaction.

233
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,310
The doctor confirmed that Sussie died in an accident.

234
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,080
What?

235
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,740
What?

236
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,460
Is it that simple?

237
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,890
I’m allergic to food.

238
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,140
Are you allergic to food?

239
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,440
Actually,

240
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,960
Susie is allergic to some fruits.

241
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,730
Like loquat mango.

242
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,200
But how could this happen?

243
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,750
I prepared everything on the day of the event.

244
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,090
Since the autopsy results are like this,

245
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,570
the living must keep moving forward.

246
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,780
I'll hold a press conference about this.

247
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,470
Go home and rest.

248
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,730
Go back.

249
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,130
Okay.

250
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:17,880
Okay.

251
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,170
It's okay.

252
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,010
I've been looking for you.

253
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,050
Pitch.

254
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,070
What are you doing in this room?

255
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,490
I miss Sussie so much.

256
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,700
When she was still alive,

257
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,390
I should have done better.

258
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,440
But you've improved a lot.

259
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,620
By the way,

260
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,080
I have something to ask you.

261
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,590
Yes, go ahead.

262
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,880
Do you want to be an actress?

263
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,640
That's a strange question.

264
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,150
As you know,

265
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,600
I joined the entertainment industry because of Sin.

266
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,480
And...

267
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,370
Why do you ask?

268
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,420
I just want to know something.

269
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,870
[Give me a chance, Korn.]

270
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,680
[How can I live without you?]

271
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,090
[You went this far,]

272
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,730
But I don't feel anything.

273
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,690
[That's why]

274
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,450
[That's why you're someone else's shadow.] I couldn't get out.

275
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,240
Because you are such a person.

276
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,040
You never respect me.

277
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,240
No matter how hard I tried,

278
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,100
I've never heard anything good from my girlfriend.

279
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,840
It's for your own good.

280
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,790
Is it wrong to make you happy?

281
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,180
The doubts you have now... It's all because of Phawin.

282
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,260
What's wrong with you?

283
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,020
Stop!

284
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,930
Stop! I tried my best to restore our relationship.

285
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,160
Why do you keep destroying it?

286
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,400
Don't try to hold on to something that's already broken.

287
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,450
And think about

288
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,200
what you're doing.

289
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,280
can be called "love"?

290
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,200
Come out and see me.

291
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,050
I need to talk to you.

292
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,030
Actually,

293
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,710
it might end like this.

294
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,650
But I hope

295
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,930
when it's over.

296
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,170
Just say it.

297
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,820
I want to apologize to you.

298
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,700
All this time,

299
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,650
care about your feelings.

300
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,800
I only put pressure on you.

301
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,750
What I said made you feel bad too.

302
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,010
I'm really sorry.

303
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,760
Thank you

304
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,960
for everything.

305
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,080
Everything is really good.

306
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,800
Even if you say that,

307
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,180
I won't turn back.

308
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,120
From now on,

309
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,540
I won't hold onto you anymore.

310
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,870
You can choose

311
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,390
you can choose.

312
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,670
Don't be forced by others.

313
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,400
Just like how I forced you.

314
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,060
I

315
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,280
choose my own path.

316
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,550
Good luck.

317
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,680
What are you thinking?

318
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,820
Nothing.

319
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,910
Are you thinking about Susie?

320
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,340
No.

321
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,670
But

322
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,330
a little.

323
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,780
I just

324
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,910
want to

325
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,750
be loyal to your feelings.

326
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,800
I don't want to regret it later.

327
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,030
I want to quit the house.

328
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,380
Why do you want to quit Why

329
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,400
Well...

330
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,660
I like you.

331
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,770
I like you so much that

332
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,960
I can't hold it in anymore.

333
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,730
I want...

334
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,180
Our relationship is clearer.

335
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,910
I want to tell people

336
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,340
He is mine.

337
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:36,970
But...

338
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,100
If I were still at House,

339
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,920
I can't do this

340
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,470
The rule of the house

341
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,440
Yes.

342
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,590
Then...

343
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,840
I'll quit with you.

344
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,700
Why did you quit?

345
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,610
Me too.

346
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,510
a part of our relationship.

347
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,480
And

348
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,270
I like you very much.

349
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,000
Do you like it that much?

350
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,150
Really?

351
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:16,850
Korn

352
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,230
You...

353
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,990
Did you drink?

354
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,410
A little

355
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,640
Korn, enough.

356
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,850
I made it clear to Minda.

357
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,400
I only have you now.

358
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,700
Don't kiss me.

359
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,410
What are we?
We're a couple.

360
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,760
Yes.

361
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,160
Then...

362
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,980
Can I kiss you now?

363
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,660
[I won't hold you accountable.]

364
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,900
[But you have to do as I say.]

365
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,940
[And you must stop this perverted behavior.]

366
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,830
How could you do that?

367
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,760
But this is a life.

368
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,850
I ruined his life and his family.

369
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,540
I'm their fan.

370
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,880
I won't ruin his reputation.

371
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,500
I don't think it's strange.

372
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,290
I'll suspect you.

373
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,080
Yes, but I'm still saying the same thing. I didn't do it.

374
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,290
What's wrong?

375
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,920
Are you sad about Sussie?

376
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,040
That's also the reason.

377
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,470
There's something else.

378
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,740
It's okay.

379
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,150
It will pass.

380
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,270
I...

381
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,080
have something to ask you.

382
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,490
Sure.

383
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,390
You must have met a lot of fans.

384
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,260
What do you think of an awful fan?

385
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,590
Like stalker fans.

386
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,490
If you meet

387
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,330
a stalker fan,

388
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,410
it won't be good.

389
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,060
Everyone's performance is different.

390
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,400
We have to be sincere.

391
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,270
But if I communicate with them, You might know something.

392
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,630
Sometimes,

393
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,040
maybe they don't like our actions.

394
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,650
but it's good to talk to them.

395
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,910
Because

396
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,490
Without them,

397
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,540
no one would be like this.
I'll give you gifts and encouragement.

398
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,110
Thank you.

399
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,570
After talking to you,

400
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,700
I feel much better.

401
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,760
[Once I enter this circle,]

402
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,440
[there are many things I need to know.]

403
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,740
Have you heard of it?

404
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,610
You like him.

405
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,430
But did you make him like you?

406
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,340
No.

407
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,740
Think about it.

408
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,430
Come on.

409
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,790
Wow, Gun, it smells good.

410
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,820
Let's do it.

411
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,200
Here.

412
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,560
Thank you.

413
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,650
Who cooked? It smells good.

414
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,750
It smells so good.

415
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,320
Hey Pitch did you cook

416
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:28,600
No.

417
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,620
Gun made it.

418
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,730
Wow, really?

419
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:35,930
Gun.

420
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,150
Make me one too!

421
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,830
Brother Tony, no. We have an audition today.

422
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,910
We'll make it. I've calculated the time.

423
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,920
But Brother Tony,

424
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,340
There's still time. Trust me.

425
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,590
Let's go. Trust me.

426
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,270
But...

427
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,410
Gun made this.

428
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,430
Do you have an audition today?

429
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,620
Good luck.

430
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,960
Thank you.

431
00:33:59,090 --> 00:33:59,550
Let's go.

432
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:00,950
Let's go.

433
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,250
Wait

434
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,440
My tablet!

435
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:04,900
Brother Tony.

436
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,380
A tablet!
Take the tablet.

437
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,730
We're leaving.

438
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,010
Gun congratulated us. We'll pass the audition!

439
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,639
Eat slowly.

440
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,909
Because it's delicious.

441
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,290
Then

442
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,400
Do you have work today?

443
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:30,960
Yes.

444
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,690
Okay.

445
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,090
Wait for me on the rooftop after eating.

446
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:40,830
Sure.

447
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,250
Don't eat so fast or you'll choke

448
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:10,610
Pitch.

449
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,750
So what is it?

450
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,910
What would you do

451
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,830
what would you do?

452
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,280
I know you're not a bad person.

453
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,300
Are you that confident?

454
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:28,500
Yes.

455
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,520
But...

456
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,440
even if you're a bad person,

457
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,070
I want to hear you confess.

458
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,320
I have something to tell you.

459
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,090
I don't know.

460
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,950
When did that happen?

461
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,570
When I realized,

462
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,190
I've been looking for you.

463
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,310
I want you to stay by my side.

464
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,060
You mean...

465
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,660
I like you.

466
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,240
I like Gun too.

467
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,190
But...

468
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:48,680
But...

469
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,170
But what?

470
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,050
The family rules?

471
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,070
Or because of Oh

472
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,600
Well...

473
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,430
No.

474
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,380
I...

475
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,530
I'm not ready yet.

476
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,980
Can you give me some time?

477
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:15,380
Pitch.

478
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,090
I'm begging you too.

479
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,130
let me pursue you like this.

480
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:39,760
Of course.

481
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,910
I ask for permission.

482
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:41,610
Hello?

483
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,020
Give me a cup of coffee too.

484
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,730
Make it yourself.

485
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,060
Okay.

486
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,080
Can you make it for me? Just one glass.

487
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,150
Phawin.

488
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,200
Let's do it, okay?

489
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,270
What do you mean?

490
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,470
Last night, we...

491
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,760
Last night we just

492
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,670
to have fun

493
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,450
to satisfy each other, right?

494
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,260
But I already broke up with Minda.

495
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,160
I'm ready to treat our relationship seriously.

496
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,470
Serious?

497
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,970
Because you have no one left.
That's why I'm serious.

498
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,180
That's why you came back to me.

499
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,930
I'm not an object without life.

500
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,680
You fool me.

501
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,700
Minda and I

502
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,630
should be love.

503
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,630
But our relationship

504
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,820
is just a desire.

505
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,350
Do you think

506
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,810
just desire?

507
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,580
Are you saying

508
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,440
that's love?

509
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,530
Let me tell you.

510
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,970
The food you often eat

511
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,480
It's boring

512
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,020
Boring?

513
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:05,930
Phawin.

514
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,520
The script is fun.

515
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,240
I like it.

516
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,680
Thank you.

517
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:26,730
You like Gun, don't you?

518
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,510
Are you crazy?

519
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,010
He's my idol.

520
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:32,850
I like you, Pitch.

521
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,030
I like Gun too.

522
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,390
Hello?

523
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,560
Hello, are you Sin's family?
The patient is sick.

524
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,780
I'm going for an audition.

525
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,170
I'm going to the audition.

526
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,050
An audition?

527
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,310
Sin.

528
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,010
Oh, you're here.

529
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,190
Oh I'm going for an audition

530
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,120
I'm going for an audition.

531
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,680
You don't have to.

532
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,540
I'm going to audition.

533
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,550
You passed.

534
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,520
I have an audition.
Calm down.
I have an audition.

535
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,990
You don't have to.

536
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
We're all here.

537
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,760
Not yet.

538
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,140
I haven't seen Pitch and Lali yet.

539
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,320
Pitch's mother is sick.

540
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,420
So he's going back.

541
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:43,600
As for Lali,

542
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,690
she can't stay in this house

543
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,950
as an actress.

544
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,760
She will be my assistant and your manager.

545
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,530
Nice to meet you.

546
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:08,640
Host.

547
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:13,720
What is it?

548
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,540
I'm here to request to leave the house.

549
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,610
I came here

550
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,690
because I had a purpose at the beginning.

551
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,500
I know

552
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,910
I didn't want to be an actor.

553
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,190
At that time,

554
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,340
to get close to someone I like.

555
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,360
I want to.

556
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,380
Senior and the others

557
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,610
are closer than others.

558
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,150
I want to be the master.

559
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,050
I wanted to control it.

560
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,010
In the end, many people

561
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,120
because of me.

562
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,830
You're already in this house.

563
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,260
No matter what your purpose is,

564
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,360
won't you regret leaving?

565
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:14,930
No.

566
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,110
Now I want to support them.

567
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,910
I want to take care of them.

568
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,230
I really want to see them succeed.

569
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,350
I believe

570
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,470
whether you look at them closely

571
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,940
or from afar,

572
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,470
They can do it.

573
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,970
If that's what you want,

574
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,110
I'll allow you to quit the house as an actress

575
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,350
and be my assistant.

576
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,450
Miss Host, are you serious?

577
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,350
You want to take care of them anyway.

578
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,110
and see them succeed.

579
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,590
Why didn't you take care of them for me?

580
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,300
Can you do it?

581
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:32,790
Yes, I can.

582
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,710
I'll do my best as your assistant.

583
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,630
Thank you for giving me a chance.

584
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,190
You can go now.

585
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,100
I called you here today

586
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,320
I want you to know

587
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:54,300
I will continue to stick to Sussie’s efforts.

588
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,440
And I

589
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:59,200
take care of you

590
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,880
to take care of you.

591
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,330
Is there anyone who doesn't understand?

592
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,650
All the contracts we signed before are invalid.

593
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:14,650
Who wants to stay here? We'll sign the contract again.

594
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,620
But who wants to stop?

595
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:18,950
I won't stop it.

596
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,270
But I...

597
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,290
change this family again.

598
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:24,970
and make new rules.

599
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,520
and correct the mistakes you made before.

600
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:31,900
About the rules of this family,
You all have the right to say anything.

601
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,950
Then...

602
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:36,700
What about the rules for our family's dating?

603
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,770
This rule is cancelled.

604
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,000
I won't stop you

605
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:46,970
I won't stop you.

606
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:48,830
I'll stay here.

607
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,990
Calm down and think slowly.

608
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,110
Even without this rule,

609
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,430
there are other rules for you to obey.

610
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:57,790
Understand?

611
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,360
Then...

612
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:08,190
If anyone doesn't want to continue,
you can leave.

613
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,920
Thank you for still sitting here.

614
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,520
Thank you for trusting me.

615
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,380
Welcome back to Star House.

616
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,710
Yes, thank you very much.

617
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,220
Yes!
Hush

618
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,750
Okay, I'll upload the celebrities' schedules again.

619
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,100
Thank you very much.

620
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,960
Both passed, right, Brother Tony?

621
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,160
Both passed.

622
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:08,460
But...

623
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,660
But what, Brother Tony?

624
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,430
But your role is a robber.

625
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,340
And you're a cop.

626
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:16,870
Good.

627
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:19,360
I've always wanted to catch robbers.

628
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,040
And...

629
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:23,060
stubborn and rebellious.

630
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,010
You look much better these days.

631
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,220
You look more energetic.

632
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,420
Really?

633
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,980
Maybe because I have a vacation recently.

634
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,410
so I can have enough rest.

635
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,030
I'll have as much work as before.

636
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,410
Anyway, good luck, Minda.

637
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,320
By the way,

638
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,910
Where's Korn?
I haven't seen him lately.

639
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,680
We broke up.

640
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:57,390
Huh?

641
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,610
Really Minda

642
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,960
But no news came out.

643
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:06,110
I don't know.
That's why I asked some rude questions.

644
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,580
It's okay.

645
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,080
But it's really quiet.

646
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,930
I thought you just didn't get a job together.

647
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,290
But both of you have your own life.

648
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,410
I don't want to tell anyone that we broke up.

649
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,570
It's not a happy thing.

650
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,890
But this kind of thing

651
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,520
can't be hidden for long.

652
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,370
Anyway,
You'll find out one day.

653
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,590
Minda is really pretty and amazing.

654
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,760
I believe you will meet the right person.

655
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:37,810
Thank you.

656
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:39,830
By the way,

657
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,530
What happened to Sussie's death? Minda.

658
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,700
Let's wait for the press conference.

659
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,230
When the shooting is over,

660
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,510
Minda has a dessert press conference.

661
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,020
The schedule is over.

662
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,270
Okay, thank you.

663
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,000
Next,

664
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,270
I have more time to visit you.

665
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,250
[House of Stars]

666
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:58,260
[In the next episode]

667
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,240
This is the autopsy report of Miss Susie.

668
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,350
So what's the result of Miss Susie's case?

669
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,870
You know who the bad guy is, right?

670
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,050
Have you decided

671
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,620
You've made up your mind, right?

672
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,260
You don't have to worry about anything.

673
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,370
In your life,

674
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,100
in your life.
