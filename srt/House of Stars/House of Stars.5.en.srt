1
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,150
What have you done ?

2
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,540
What happened ?

3
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,780
Are you guys thinking of trying with me ?

4
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,200
Or want to sarcastize me

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,790
so you act dissolutely..

6
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,630
Miss Suzie..

7
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,670
Uhh.......

8
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,000
You too ..

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,650
I have tried very hard to push you

10
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,270
But you indulged yourself until the clip was leaked .

11
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,920
How lucky , it's just a nonsense clip.

12
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,840
Not other ...clip.

13
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,210
Miss Suzie. I'm so sorry..

14
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,000
It's all my fault .

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,870
Weha is stressed. So I want to take him out.

16
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,740
Even though you knew...that it wasn't right thing to do.

17
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,750
Yes

18
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,320
Then you're ready to bear the consequences.

19
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,420
Yes.

20
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,570
Miss Suzie.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,550
That clip is my clip.

22
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,450
So ....

23
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,910
punish me.

24
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,000
Wayu did nothing wrong.

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm a person who wants to go to a party

26
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,150
You don't have to worry

27
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,380
The two of you will definitely be punished.

28
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,000
Miss Suzie

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,870
There is an advertisement contacts me wanting Weha to be a presenter.

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,170
He saw the leaked clip and liked Weha's body shape.

31
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,000
And there are also a few more men's products. Contact me as well.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,690
tell them that we are OK. with the deal.

33
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,000
Book the day and lock the work schedule.

34
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,910
Yes, Madam

35
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:51,170
Although this clip will have a positive effect on you.

36
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,000
However, the two of you will have to be punished.

37
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,600
and don't let it happen again next time

38
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,100
Yes sir.

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,000
You..

40
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,710
Don't take Weha outside again.

41
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,480
without my permission.

42
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,540
Understand ?

43
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,820
Yes.

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,000
What have you done ,

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,030
It made me very disappointed.

46
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,000
I promise it won't happen again.

47
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,350
It's good for you to understand.

48
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,510
yes.sir

49
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,000
You can go now.

50
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,320
Ohh... Mintra is back?

51
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,900
Huh... I'm not here for a while. You look different.

52
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,210
Well...a little bit.

53
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,500
Where have all the others gone?

54
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,400
Wayu has gone out for shooting.

55
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,900
Zo didn't stay here.

56
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,000
Pitch..

57
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,050
went out since morning.

58
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,000
Lalit went out to run some errands in the morning.

59
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
Pawin probably....

60
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,430
I do not want to know..

61
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,800
How about Korn , where is he ?

62
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,050
Korn should be sleeping upstair.

63
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,270
Ok...here's a souvenir.

64
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,270
for everyone.

65
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,240
Thank you.

66
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,120
share it with others.

67
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,120
I have to leave now.ะ

68
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,440
Bro. Korn , Better stop

69
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,140
Mintra will be back soon.

70
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,670
a little more.

71
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,600
Or do not want.

72
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,880
you probably already know the answer.

73
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,740
What does this mean?

74
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,510
Can't you see it ?

75
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,450
I didn't ask you... get out.

76
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,210
No.

77
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
Get out!!!!!!!!!

78
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,800
Bastard...I trust you.

79
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,150
Did my trust come to do such a damn thing like this?

80
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,050
You're fucking stupid.

81
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,000
Why did you do this?

82
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
Ha!

83
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,940
Why ...why so bad...

84
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,850
Why did we come?

85
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,480
All thinh came out is like this

86
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,240
Isn't it because of you?

87
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,000
As you can see, I get the jewelry to wear to the event.

88
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,910
When the price dropped, I was embarrassed to wear it.

89
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,520
very disgusting

90
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,610
Who exactly is disgusting?

91
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,310
What you are doing is call disgusting.

92
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,360
Do you know that you are currently violating your contract?

93
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,000
I didn't violate.

94
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,090
We have not break up.

95
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,170
And in the contract did not say that..

96
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,700
Don't have anyone else.

97
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,800
But the rules say.

98
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,380
If you dosn't speak

99
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,940
Other people will not know...think carefully.

100
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,350
This contract belongs to both of us.

101
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,100
If this thing slips out.

102
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,780
Probably not just me alone.

103
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,000
that dishonor .

104
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,540
Yes...

105
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,610
Is mom okay?

106
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,110
Why did you do that?

107
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,020
So?

108
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,580
that you messed with Korn.

109
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,610
To annoy me , right?

110
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,350
I think you should stop messing with Korn.

111
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,000
Confident..too confident....

112
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,520
And the fact that I like Korn?

113
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,900
what it has to do with you?

114
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,580
But Korn is mine.

115
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,120
so?

116
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,000
Well, it's my preference.

117
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,290
You won't stop right?

118
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,700
Will you take it like this?

119
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,570
Yes.

120
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,070
I want it...will take it

121
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,900
You...!!

122
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,450
I'll tell you something.

123
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,270
There's no way you can intervene between me and Korn.

124
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,100
Remember this !!

125
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,470
Is this confident or blind?

126
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,000
you should have seen that..

127
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,580
All the things you said, it's not true.

128
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,050
And if you have time

129
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,820
to complain and acting like his wife.

130
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,500
Would you rather take the time to take care of yourself?

131
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,550
Ugh!

132
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,820
or...

133
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,770
You can try looking at the mirror.

134
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,190
There's a mirror behind you.

135
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,100
Take a look.

136
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,000
Wayu

137
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,320
Can you do me a favor?

138
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,550
Wayu Wayu Wayu Wayu Wayu Wayu.

139
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,950
Yes , What's up ??

140
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,000
Can you do me a favor?

141
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,710
Are you free ?

142
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,700
yes.

143
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,780
Really ?

144
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,840
Yes.

145
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,270
Is there anything I can help ?

146
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,040
Well...Bro.H ost gave me my product to take pictures on social media.

147
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,600
But... I can't do it.

148
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,570
Can you help ?

149
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,070
Yes , sure.

150
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,570
Let me help you guys.

151
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,270
So good..

152
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:44,050
[Chat] : (Pitch still not read.)

153
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,810
[Chat] : Haven't woken up yet?I will go there.

154
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,570
Bro.Korn, Win brought me some fruit.

155
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,170
Umm..

156
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,370
you're not going to say anything, are you?

157
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,480
take some fruit...I'll give you some to you.

158
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,380
Weha , The customer has sent the item.

159
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,099
Thank you .

160
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,270
Aow.

161
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,210
Wayu is back .

162
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,240
Yes...I don't have many scences today.

163
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,280
I see.

164
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,540
How about Te?

165
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,710
Te is........

166
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,040
Okay, don't forget to take a photo for the customer too.

167
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
yes.

168
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,820
What have you guys brought so much?

169
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,550
must have items.

170
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,170
I think it's better for Weha to take off the glasses.

171
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,990
I think he will look better.

172
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,000
Hmm, looks a lot better.

173
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,230
Hi..Zo

174
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,680
Hi.

175
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,000
Hello.

176
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,140
Hi Bro. Host , Bro. Te.

177
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,000
What are you doing ?

178
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,670
Weha just got a job to shoot the product.

179
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,000
So we are helping to take photos.

180
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,570
Really ??

181
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,330
Yes.

182
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,590
Congratulations.

183
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,000
Thank you.

184
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,550
Has Zo arrived?

185
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,000
How about Pitch ?

186
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,890
Didn't you come together?

187
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,870
No , Phich is not in the house?

188
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,620
Yes.

189
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,410
I have not seen him.

190
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,710
Pitch went to see Kan at the condominium.

191
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,550
Oh...

192
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,850
he has asked for permission from Mr. Susie.

193
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,980
So I let him go.

194
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,490
so strange..

195
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,380
both of them must have something

196
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,000
Are they ?

197
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,410
Staying together privately like that.

198
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,000
If it becomes gossip news again, what will you do?

199
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,510
calm down..

200
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,280
It might be nothing.

201
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,500
but..

202
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,620
I have to go..

203
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,600
I'm not sure.. there might be something .

204
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,340
Let's see the Ref. that customers want.

205
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,870
Yes.

206
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,870
what kind?

207
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,570
[CHAT] : Pitch is in Kan's Condo? why didn't you tell me?

208
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,350
[CHAT] : Where are you ?

209
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,320
[CHAT] : Can you pick up my call?

210
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,520
[CHAT] : When are you coming back, let me pick you up.

211
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:57,250
[CHAT] : Pitch is with him, is so busy that untill can not read my chat?

212
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,910
Why do you have be with him?

213
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,450
Zo..

214
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What are you doing here alone?

215
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,220
I just came out to talk on the phone.

216
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,000
You are also worried about  Pitch, right?

217
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,610
Yes.

218
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You know Pitch well.

219
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,000
I think...

220
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Pitch probably didn't do anything bad.

221
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,680
Pitch is not, but the other person....

222
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,000
May be....

223
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,600
Do you mean Kan?

224
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,810
seem to strict the rules.

225
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,960
even though he himself broke the rules.

226
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,190
I think..

227
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,620
If these two really really like each other.

228
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,000
It looks appropriate.

229
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,670
But it also depends on the house rules.

230
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,520
I'm afraid Pitch will be in trouble.

231
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,410
I get in the house now.

232
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,400
I must have liked Pitch very much.

233
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,480
Ah...hey, Weha, here it is.

234
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,220
Uh, just like that.

235
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,050
come...come come

236
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,050
Weha be careful  too close to the wall.

237
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,320
move a little One more step...ok

238
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,640
Bring your left arm up to your neck, catch it.

239
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,710
One..Two..Three...

240
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,910
It's beautiful. Let's try again.

241
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,840
do the same Same posture, left arm up.

242
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,540
Like this?

243
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,850
Like this, try it.

244
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,170
One..Two..Three.

245
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,500
I think it ok already.

246
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,270
Then let's change the background to the fountain.

247
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,900
Brother Te, please turn the light on a little bit.

248
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,560
OK.

249
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,600
Thank you.

250
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,410
Weha , are you OK ?

251
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,800
I am OK.

252
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,240
But...

253
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,160
I don't think we're going to be this serious.

254
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,000
Work has to be serious.

255
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,680
this is still little.

256
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,600
Thank you very much to everyone .

257
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,210
who come to help me.

258
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,720
This is my first product shoot.

259
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,210
I'm... very tense.

260
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,580
It's normal.

261
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,820
The first time was like this.

262
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,580
So... let's move on.

263
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,000
OK.

264
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,820
OK.

265
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,850
OK.

266
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,000
Like this...

267
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,000
Both of us have been laugh together.

268
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,680
Dare to look into each other's eyes, always together.

269
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:22,840
If there are somethings that do not understand each other. we are always ready to forgive.

270
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,110
not hurt much

271
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,610
awesome..

272
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,810
On Shoot day , you can do like this.

273
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,300
would be great .

274
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,080
YES.

275
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,510
let's pack up.

276
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,670
Today, I thank you you all very much..

277
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,280
Thank you so much.

278
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,910
Hey you ,

279
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,520
Since I followed Brother Kan.

280
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,870
I felt that I had absorbed many things.

281
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,750
I feel more concentrated.ะ

282
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Do you want to come together?

283
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,870
I don't have short attention span like Pitch.

284
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,400
Oh.... Uh, I don't talk to you anymore.

285
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,540
Well... I got... two theme park tickets.

286
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,140
Pitch ever said that you wanted to go.

287
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,170
let's go on this holiday?

288
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,920
Yeah, I've been wanting to go for a long time.

289
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,920
The costume team...

290
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,000
Please give me the accessories.

291
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,000
Yes

292
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,950
Lalit go for touch-ups, 20 minutes then back to shoot again.

293
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,110
Lalit...Anyone see Lalit ?

294
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,810
NO.

295
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,700
Lalit...Lalit

296
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,500
The set is almost ready, you can change the actor.

297
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,500
Miss Suzie..

298
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,880
Lalit disappeared from the set.

299
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,850
What 's up ?

300
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,080
Miss Suzie.

301
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,720
I have somthing to tell you .

302
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,180
Who allowed you in?

303
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,520
Excuse me.  Mintra need to go now..

304
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,580
What is she intending to do?

305
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,240
Don't make it a big deal.

306
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,020
And you think this is a small matter?

307
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:01,820
Do you know where this story started from?

308
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,660
I already told you

309
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,780
that if you and I  don't speak.

310
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,080
How will other people know?

311
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,820
you want me to keep us quiet

312
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,140
and accepting such things.

313
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,070
Well.. that's what it means.

314
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,780
So, you will choose him.

315
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,760
I don't choose

316
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,400
anyone.

317
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,850
you want me to accept

318
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,950
And living together as three husband and wife?

319
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
Eat shit and die

320
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,250
you go alone..

321
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,250
I will inform Miss Suzie for you.

322
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,400
we can...moving forward together.

323
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,940
Why didn't you protect me also?

324
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,870
What should I say?

325
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,500
Well, I don't like when you stay with him.ะ

326
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,680
he always acts like biting me.

327
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,070
and he seems to want you.

328
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,520
You're being stupid.

329
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,520
Korn!!

330
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,650
Do you know that you are currently violating the contract?

331
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,180
In the contract, I didn't say that ... I can't have other people.

332
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,480
You won't quit, right?...You'll take this, right?

333
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,580
Yes..

334
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,810
I want him...will take him

335
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,210
You....

336
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,500
Lalit , Where have you been?

337
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,320
Miss Sizie.

338
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,180
uh.....

339
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,980
I asked where have you been?

340
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,000
that is.........

341
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,220
Lalit have...I have urgent business.

342
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,550
what is you business?

343
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,620
Is it more important than filming?

344
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,470
uh...

345
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,240
Uh... is there something going on?

346
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,370
Pitch...Zo

347
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,880
I didn't come back beyond curfew.

348
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,000
I haven't said anything yet.

349
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,610
Where did you go?

350
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,670
We hang out together.

351
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,420
you guys should take a rest.

352
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,000
Yes

353
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,320
I don't know

354
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,000
How important is your business.

355
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,160
But my work also important.

356
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,480
How bad you leave your work like this? Do you know how much damage?

357
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,740
You know ??

358
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,000
The entire group had to wait for you .

359
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,360
and you disappeared without telling.

360
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,790
can't contact

361
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,070
your fame or money

362
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,570
I don't care.

363
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But you can't damage my house's reputation.

364
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,360
you have grown up

365
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:19,310
you must be able to think about what is important and what should or should not do.

366
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,000
I will improve myself.

367
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:30,870
You know that.. if something like this happens again

368
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:35,100
There won't be an opportunity like this.

369
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,000
yes

370
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,140
Hello everyone.

371
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,810
Can I hear your voice ?

372
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,140
Welcome to....

373
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,850
First Date My Dream With Zo & Pitch.

374
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:10,239
If you're ready, let's go see the first show from Zo & Pitch.

375
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,210
thank you.

376
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,910
more or less

377
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,720
it doesn't hurt much.

378
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:22,040
How patient it is... , I've never had tears.

379
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:28,820
Always be okay with yourself.

380
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:35,000
But I think it's lonely too.

381
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,320
talk less

382
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,180
I don't understand you at all.

383
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:51,640
Look far away, since the day we started to stagnate

384
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,280
Every time I miss you.

385
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:04,580
Do you ever miss me more than I miss you ?

386
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,150
I really like you.

387
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,500
I really really like you.

388
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:17,940
But lately you look like you ignore me.

389
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,140
It's strange that we're not the same.

390
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:30,320
What happened...why isn't it the same?

391
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:37,550
Before the change...the two of us still used to laugh together

392
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,540
Dare to look into each other's eyes, always together

393
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:47,050
If there are somethings that do not understand each other. we are always ready to forgive

394
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:55,070
not hurt much

395
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,420
We are not the same...what happened?

396
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,670
why not the same?

397
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:38,600
Before the change...the two of us still used to laugh together

398
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,100
Dare to look into each other's eyes, always together

399
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:50,170
If there are somethings that do not understand each other. we are always ready to forgive

400
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,920
not hurt much

401
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:27,780
ZO Pitch Zo Pitch Zo Pitch.

402
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,150

403
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,080
Oh, Do you like it?

404
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,540
Yes..

405
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,440
do you want some more?

406
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,020
Again Again..

407
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,100
Oh, the power of this fan club.

408
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,990
So overflowing, but

409
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,210
How about this side?

410
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,370
I  still can do it, but the other person...

411
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,450
seem not.

412
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,850
I'd like some oxygen.

413
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,690
Hey !! the team

414
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,750
He can't take it...

415
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,280
Call an ambulance.

416
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,980
He can't take it.. quickly

417
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,570

418
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,990
No, no, no, the team doesn't have to.

419
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'll handle it myself.

420
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,040
Hey, the team make it fast!

421
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:19,000

422
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,390
Pitch..

423
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,980
Has anyone called an ambulance yet?

424
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,600
Urgent!!!!

425
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,050
Pitch...

426
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,820

427
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,180
Pitch...Pitch....

428
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,050

429
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,410

430
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,410
Everyone will be able to watch our "My dream is happy season 2"

431
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,280
Ugh... I like that ..

432
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,370
Don't prep with me either.

433
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,780
I didn't prep with the host at all.

434
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,180
I prep it all..

435
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,310
Oh wow, I'm completely shocked.

436
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,000
thought that you are really syncope.

437
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,180

438
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,800

00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,110
Yes.

441
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,000

443
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,970

Well... like this, can you spoil the content a bit?

00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,800
Then the two of us will have .........

453
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,640
