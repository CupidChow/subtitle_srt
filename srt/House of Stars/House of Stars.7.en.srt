1
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,640
Damn it!!

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Her acting is awful.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,680
She got a damn poor memory.

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,400
Hmmm...

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,479
That was all she capable of?

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,280
I'm sorry for her .. umm let's ..

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,080
If she is not a girl from the investor. DAMN !!

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,200
Hey !!!

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,040
Can you rewrite the script to make her DIE ?!!

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,600
I am really sorry.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,160
Rewrite the script.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,840
I didn't mean it.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,320
Phewww.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,000
Pardon me.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,640
It's ...

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,000
I apologize.

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,040
Phewww.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,680
Keep fighting !!

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,800
You are good.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,440
May I have an interview with you?

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,400
May I have the interview with you.

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,240
Ummm ...

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,000
How was this scene, Cindy?

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,480
Ummm ...

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,720
That was really tough for me.

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,600
I got a very long long script.

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,720
By the way, big thanks to all the crews.

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,960
Including the director, who made this scene so smooth.

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
But you are so good in acting.

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,520
Yeah you are really good.

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,800
Anything else to leave to your fans?

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,080
Are you Host?

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,520
Yes.

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,759
What are you doing here.

35
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,759
Is there any talent from House of Stars coming to the scene today?

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,000
No.

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
I'm looking for some talent for the 'House'.

38
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,960
Is that me?

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,920
No, not you.

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,120
Hi there.

41
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,440
Are you interested to join House of Stars?

42
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,880
Me?

43
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,960
I really wanna know.

44
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
What would you do?

45
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,440
Huh !!

46
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,920
You want me to admit,

47
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,800
and live together as a three husband and wife?

48
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,400
Go fuck yourself !!

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,640
Do you know? You are now infringing the contract.

50
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,040
I didn't.

51
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,520
I didn't break up with you.

52
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,360
The contract don't state that

53
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,560
having someone else is prohibited.

54
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,840
Where are you?

55
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,120
I have some errand outside.

56
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,880
Errand ?!!

57
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,120
What's the errand?

58
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,880
Errand .. is errand.

59
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,280
Sighhhh ...

60
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,400
Are you with Pawin?

61
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,159
Wait what? .. you exposed go out together now?

62
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,200
Are you still seeing me right here?

63
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,200
Pawin brought me to the set, and you know what?

64
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,200
After I came back,

65
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,520
I felt damn good.

66
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,240
Everybody cares me.

67
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,280
respects,

68
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,480
Don't have to feel so cramped like just now.

69
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,880
This is today breakdown.

70
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
Thank you.

71
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,360
After next 2 scenes, it's your turn.

72
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,960
Excuse me.

73
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,120
Would you mind touching up Mintra's face?

74
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,320
Yes sure.

75
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,800
Pardon me.

76
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,000
Well ...

77
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,840
I haven't seen gone for a while.

78
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Is he busy?

79
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,080
Yes.

80
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,280
He is QUITE BUSY recently.

81
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,640
Oh.

82
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,440
Umm!

83
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,520
Excuse me.

84
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,360
Yeah?

85
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,840
Did you see Mintra?

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,400
Well ...

87
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,760
Mintra is changing the cloth. Can I help you?

88
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,560
Well umm ...

89
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,400
I would like to interview her about her pregnancy.

90
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,040
Pregnant ?!!

91
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, yes.

92
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,880
Who?

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,280
It's Mintra's scandal.

94
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,920
Don't you see? Really a big news right now.

95
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,680
Big news?

96
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,640
Mintra ...

97
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,360
It's me.

98
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Korn ...

99
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
Why you have to run?

100
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,120
You didn't pregnant as in the news.

101
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,240
Well ...

102
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,600
or ...

103
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,320
Are you dating with ...

104
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,600
No !

105
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,560
I didn't like him. In fact, I got nothing with him.

106
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,080
I don't understand. Why it came out like this.

107
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,080
I can't figure it out.

108
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,919
Well then ...

109
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,000
Would you be my girlfriend?

110
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,120
How is it?

111
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,560
The issue that I've assigned for you to manage.

112
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,240
Do you think I've never met someone like you before?

113
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,880
Someone who worst than you, I've also dealt with.

114
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,480
I won't take this serious.

115
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,880
But instead you have to follow my orders.

116
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,760
And you must stop this obsessive behavior too.

117
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
If someone else could caught you again.

118
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,600
I won't lend you a hand no more.

119
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,720
From I've kept watching him.

120
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,160
I feel that,

121
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,840
Pitch has so much changed from the past.

122
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,680
He seems focus, and more serious about what he's doing.

123
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,800
How to say ...

124
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,480
Seems ... professional that before.

125
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,760
But ... No offense, you got me right?

126
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,520
For ... Zo is just the same.

127
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,240
But ... one thing I've felt is,

128
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,680
There is more distance between both of them.

129
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,760
It's like their relation,

130
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,320
is only for just the job.

131
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,080
Okay.

132
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,040
You do a very good job.

133
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,080
You may go.

134
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,600
Yes.

135
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,920
Is that everything you are taking with you?

136
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,640
Yes ...

137
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,000
Umm .. Pitch.

138
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,520
We have to be there for a few days.

139
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,520
Umm.

140
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,360
Well ... where we're going is close to my place.

141
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,880
I think I will stay overnight at my own place.

142
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,200
Could I?

143
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,400
Sure.

144
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,600
Well ...

145
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,680
Can I stay with you too?

146
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,720
I want to see your mom.

147
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,800
Yeah, it's okay.

148
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,040
My mom wants to see you too.

149
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,040
Me?

150
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,400
Yes.

151
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,480
I told her so much about you.

152
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,800
Well ...

153
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
Deal?

154
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,520
Deal ...

155
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,440
Then may I ...

156
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,720
You have to stay with me.

157
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,840
I've booked the hotel.

158
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:45,880
But ...

159
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,600
Let's get in the car.

160
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,240
Let's go, Zo.

161
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,920
Everything is all set. Put yourself at ease alright?

162
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,200
Thank you.

163
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,440
Wayu !

164
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,200
Wayu !!

165
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,960
Wayu !!!

166
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,880
Weha, how did you get here?

167
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,760
Miss Suzie has banned me from sticking around with you, Weha.

168
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,880
But she didn't ban from an accidentally meet up right?

169
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,960
You are so cunning.

170
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,560
Well ...

171
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
How do you know that I'm here.

172
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,960
I asked Te.

173
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Te ...

174
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,760
Again ... so

175
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Can I help you anything?

176
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,320
Nothing, I meant to come and see you.

177
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,240
You intended to come?

178
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,480
Shall we sit down and have a little talk?

179
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,880
But I have to practice paddling.

180
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,240
I won't bother you that long.

181
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,600
Well then.

182
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,960
Wait a sec.

183
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,840
Alright.

184
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,080
Well ...

185
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
I supposed to tell you that ...

186
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,280
I feel really good ...

187
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,000
But I don't know how to explain.

188
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,280
Well I ...

189
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,640
like ...

190
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,560
like ...

191
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,080
like telling my family about my first job.

192
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,440
When I told them the story.

193
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,040
They keep spreading the story to everybody in the village.

194
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,000
Especially those photos that Wayu took it for me.

195
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They're still showing off that too.

196
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,480
Wayu !

197
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,280
Wayu !

198
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,540
Yeah?

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,840
Are you listening to me?

200
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,520
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,640
I diligently gathered my feelings to tell you the story.

202
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,520
Umm ..

203
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,840
Can you repeat that again?

204
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,790
Listen carefully.

205
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,760
Umm ..

206
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,920
Well I ...

207
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,120
told my family about my first job.

208
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,840
My parents, they keep spreading the story to everybody in the village

209
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,240
and those photos that Wayu took for me, they're still showing off until now.

210
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,760
Congratulations.

211
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,800
Thank you

212
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,840
Thank you kindly.

213
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,400
I think ...

214
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,720
I got to continue practicing paddling.

215
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,680
I have to do it for the next time of shooting.

216
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,800
Really?

217
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,920
Umm ..

218
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,680
Later then.

219
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,080
Wayu.

220
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,240
Yeah?

221
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
I can do the paddle.

222
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,720
Weha, do I hold it right?

223
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,880
Yeah .. That's good.

224
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,640
Okay.

225
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,840
Well ...

226
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,280
How about my gesture?

227
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,920
Yeah that's right, that's right.

228
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,160
Wayu you're ... a very fast learner.

229
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,680
Not at all, it is because of the teacher.

230
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,120
No, I'm not that good.

231
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,880
Wayu, may I ask you something?

232
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,280
Yeah?

233
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,280
Normally, are you always serious in improving yourself like this?

234
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,240
Not that much.

235
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,040
Why you're asking?

236
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
I don't know ...

237
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,440
You seem really serious. Just paddling.

238
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,920
I always be like this.

239
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,840
Many times ... everybody was expecting in me.

240
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,920
I didn't want to fail them or make them disappointed.

241
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,920
So ... I tried so hard to do my job,

242
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,600
with all cost.

243
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,320
That's why you took care of me.

244
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,840
Because of what Miss Suzie told you.

245
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,520
Umm ...

246
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,599
If it was earlier,

247
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,359
I just need to finish those jobs,

248
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,520
just to make everybody be happy. That's all I need.

249
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,880
But for now,

250
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,760
what I am doing,

251
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,120
is for ... myself.

252
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,840
Because I have someone who is really important to me.

253
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,320
Whom I really want to stay around. No matter ...

254
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,640
it is in a good time ... or a bad time.

255
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,160
I don't know how that person ... think about me.

256
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,640
That person may think I am talented.

257
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,200
Though in fact, I'm just an ordinary person.

258
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,400
If he see me as a skillful person.

259
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,320
I will become more skillful,

260
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,640
so I can stay a little longer beside that important person.

261
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,280
W..Wayu.

262
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,190
Cut.

263
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,400
Cut cut cut.

264
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,120
Hey !

265
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,960
Who let that man come into the frame ?!!

266
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,480
Melon what da! Melon!

267
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,050
What is it?

268
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,180
Hmm ..

269
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,080
It's a shooting set.

270
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,880
Yeah?! Sorry, I'm sorry.

271
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,280
(Suburb accent) Com'on leave the frame! or you would get killed.

272
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,190
Yeah?

273
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,320
Who! Who would get killed?

274
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,680
(Suburb accent) It's me idiot! Who would get killed, get out!

275
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
No matter how the real world is,

276
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,640
We care only for ... this moment.

277
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,320
The moment that we can stay together.

278
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,600
But we have to live in the real world, shouldn't we?

279
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,040
We are going to make our dreams come true.

280
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,000
Whatever you need ... name it.

281
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,560
I will fulfill.

282
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,990
I'm really sorry.

283
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,400
What's the matter?

284
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,880
I think I like him.

285
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,240
Let's break up.

286
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Cut ... very good.

287
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,360
Pitch, what have you been doing?

288
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,400
Your acting is so much better.

289
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,880
He've worked really hard ... isn't that right, Host?

290
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,200
Miss Host!

291
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,200
Miss Host!

292
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,720
Yeah ?!

293
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,160
I'm speaking to you that what have Pitch been doing? .. Ho~ .. his acting improves so much.

294
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,400
Oh ... yeah.

295
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,080
Thought he've learned a lot from Gun.

296
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,120
Gun ...

297
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,960
Oh .. Gorngun isn't he?

298
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,720
That's right.

299
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,840
Pitch has such a good teacher.

300
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,040
I've dreamed that I would have a chance to work with Gun someday too.

301
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,120
Well, pardon me.

302
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,560
Okay.

303
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,360
Go! Go! Let's .. go for the next scene.

304
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,040
Go!

305
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,600
Yo! Facility personnel, get in !

306
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,280
Miss Suzie.

307
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,800
Com'on just say it!

308
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,160
Well ...

309
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,160
Pitch is going to have a shooting in other city.

310
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,960
I knew.

311
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Alright.

312
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,360
I just need to tell you.

313
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,960
There is no other issue right?

314
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,000
No

315
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,240
Nothing.

316
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,640
Pardon me.

317
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,920
Cut! Cut! Next scene.

318
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,880
Oh! Pitch.

319
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,160
Umm .. you're done for today.

320
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,720
Are going leaving now? ... or waiting for Zo?

321
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,560
I think I will leave now.

322
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,360
I need to prepare the place for Zo to stay overnight.

323
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,840
Oh ...

324
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,000
Well .. I will stand-by at the shooting set.

325
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,880
Okay.

326
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,840
Keep fighting !

327
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,840
Pitch.

328
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,120
Yes, what is it Gun?

329
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,000
Are you done yet?

330
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,080
Your house is nearby? I will drive you home.

331
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Are you serious?

332
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,240
Umm ..

333
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,120
Definitely.

334
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,560
Is this place your home?

335
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,280
That's right.

336
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,240
This is my backyard.

337
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,280
It means that you've lived here since you were born.

338
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,680
I was born and grew up here.

339
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,680
When I was a kid, I love running around here,

340
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,880
collecting those vegetables and fruits.

341
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,960
Until my mom scolds me.

342
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,040
But I still love doing it.

343
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,040
You don't tell my mom alright?

344
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,520
Umm ...

345
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,040
I love it here much more than Bangkok.

346
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,440
Well ... why you chose to stay in Bangkok?

347
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,120
I've dreamed,

348
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,000
of being an actor.

349
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,680
So I need to do my best.

350
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,640
I have no idea how it ends.

351
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,600
But I will do the best out of every oppotunities that come.

352
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,920
I told you too much about me.

353
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,600
It's your turn to tell me yours.

354
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,600
Nahhh.

355
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,560
Boo ..

356
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,200
I don't know what to tell you bro'. (First time Gun called himself bro' with Pitch.)

357
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,240
Bro' ?!

358
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,160
Umm ...

359
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,600
I think, rain is coming. I can sense it.

360
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,760
It's going to rain. Shall we go back?

361
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,120
Right.

362
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,440
What's wrong?!

363
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,080
Dust in my eye.

364
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,000
Let me help you.

365
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,760
Open your eyes gently.

366
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,280
If we could stay like this forever,

367
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,360
It should be really good.

368
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,360
Gun, brother.

369
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,760
It's raining.

370
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,840
Pitch!

371
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,520
Pitch!

372
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,320
The car is here.

373
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,640
Oh .. really?

374
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,520
Why you sleep here?

375
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,040
Umm ...

376
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,160
I must've passed out.

377
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,640
Hmm ...

378
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,920
Well ...

379
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,600
I saw you sleep talking Gun's name.

380
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,880
Did you dream about him?

381
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,000
Well ...

382
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,280
Umm ...

383
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,160
Oh ...

384
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,520
The car is here right?

385
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,760
I will hurry go ahead and prepare a place for you to sleep.

386
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,200
Get to the car then.

387
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,760
Te.

388
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,320
Hmm ?

389
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,120
What are you doing here?

390
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,520
Well .. what am I doing here?

391
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,080
What ?!?

392
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,800
Nothing ... it's ...

393
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,760
We come to support you.

394
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,520
Ice Latte.

395
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,440
How the heck did you get here?

396
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,920
Can't you see?

397
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,440
I came to support the shooting set.

398
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,960
What do you want?

399
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Caramel macchiato,

400
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,560
no sweetener,

401
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,960
no sugar,

402
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,360
no cream.

403
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,400
Don't have.

404
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,760
Then I will go with ... americano,

405
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,400
no sweetener,

406
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,040
no more.

407
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,000
Zo, did you order yet?

408
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,720
Yes, I did.

409
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,440
Gun.

410
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,360
Can I get Caramel Macchiato with no sweetener.

411
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,680
Umm ..

412
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,480
So you came here on behalf of the 'House'?

413
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,160
But it wasn't Miss Suzie's order.

414
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,320
So what are you guys doing here?

415
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,720
Just supporting those boys. Do I need the permission from Miss Suzie?

416
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,960
No, you don't.

417
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,760
This is a good coffee.

418
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,480
Gun, tomorrow we have a shooting early in the morning.

419
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,040
Okay.

420
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,280
Cut! Good, next scene.

421
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,640
Well Gun, we may go now.

422
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,360
Gun, we should go now.

423
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,080
Okay.

424
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,600
Zo, let's get change.

425
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,920
Let's go.

426
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,520
Don't fool me like this.

427
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,440
It's not funny.

428
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,000
Sky !!

429
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,920
Can you please stop hiding like this?

430
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,880
Brilliant, let's call it a day.

431
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,200
Okay Let's ... pack up!

432
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,720
We do have an after party this evening.

433
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,160
Everybody let's hurry.

434
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,680
Yo Zo, it's quite a long day.

435
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,320
From the sun, to the rain.

436
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
It's alright. I do my best.

437
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
We have the party before heading back to Bangkok.

438
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,000
Would you come?

439
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,960
It's okay.

440
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,440
Pitch's mom should have waited and prepared a lot of foods for me.

441
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,480
Oh, really?

442
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,480
That's sad.

443
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,400
Well, it's okay.

444
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,440
Safe drive.

445
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,360
Go get change.

446
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,000
Come come take care of Zo.

447
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,960
Bring Zo to get change.

448
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,920
Thank you.

449
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,440
Excuse me.

450
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,600
Did you see Pitch?

451
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,639
Pitch?

452
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,520
He left for a while.

453
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:18,880
Okay.

454
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,679
Well ... do you know where he is heading to?

455
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,560
I have no idea.

456
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,000
But I saw him hurry left with Gun.

457
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,960
Thank you.

458
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,320
No at all.

459
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,159
How about Gun?

460
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,760
He left.

461
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,840
Anything?

462
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,840
Nothing.

463
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,960
You hurry get change.

464
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,800
Bye, see you.

465
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,720
Weha, you called me is there something?

466
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,320
Please sit down.

467
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,680
Well ... just a sec.

468
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,200
Umm ... I'll take this can.

469
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,000
Wayu you take another one.

470
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,680
Alright.

471
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,480
Umm, Wayu, what is this? You have it with you all the time.

472
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
This one?

473
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,880
This is the book which explain every characters' background in my series.

474
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,880
How do we read this?

475
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,000
Which word?

476
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,280
Grab the je-ni-ta-ria.

477
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:01,600
No, it's ... "Grab the genitalia just to make an excitement, but not too stress".

478
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,760
What does it mean?

479
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,440
You don't need to know this ... well ...

480
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,520
Weha, you called me. What is the matter?

481
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,160
Well ... At first, I want to bring you to,

482
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,800
the house that we went for the party that day.

483
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,320
But ... if we go there now, we would get kicked out.

484
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,360
I agree.

485
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,920
So I change the plan to this pool at this 'House' instead.

486
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,160
I ...

487
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,400
I feel,

488
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,320
that swimming pool,

489
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,480
it's like the place for my reincarnation,you know?

490
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,680
and at this moment,

491
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,520
I wanted to tell you that,

492
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,200
I'm already one big step further.

493
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,350
Everything ... you've taught me.

494
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,280
You've kept pushing me.

495
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,320
I can do it now.

496
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,000
Shhhh ...

497
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,720
How is everything Weha?

498
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,680
Wanna talk about the script?

499
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,160
Well yeah, my script, there is a love scene.

500
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,240
I've never been in a relation since I were born.

501
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,960
Well ...

502
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,400
By doing this, does it help you to get the feeling?

503
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,320
You just got back. Where are you going?

504
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,040
Oh ... I have an errand.

505
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,920
I just saw someone in the house.

506
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,880
or Miss Suzie recruited someone to help?

507
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,040
What are you doing here?

508
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,160
Hello, Te.

509
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,240
I need a food truck .. at the Zo-Pitch's shooting set tomorrow.

510
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,920
What ?! ... The food truck?

511
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,280
That's right.

512
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,400
I need it immediately. No matter how much it cost.

513
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,720
Wait !

514
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,480
May I leave this to you?

515
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,880
Thank you.
