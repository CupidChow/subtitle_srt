77
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,460

I already called him to wake him up.

81
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,070

00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,460

83
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,860
How is it? Am I late?

84
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:46,930
I'm not late.

85
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
I'll guarantee the prize,

86
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,450
but if you don't even have the concept of time,

87
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,290
don't think about staying in this industry for a long time.

88
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,730
Right.

89
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,900

Gun. Congratulations on winning the Best Actor of the Year.

94
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,140
I also want to congratulate Brother Gong

95
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,010
for winning the Best Actor Award of the Year.

96
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,160
Awesome.

97
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,110
Thank you.

98
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,220
You're welcome.

99
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,950
How do Peter and Seok feel?

100
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,800
We won the first show.

101
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,380
It's beyond our expectations.

102
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,910
I didn't expect the two of us to win the Best New Artist of the Year.

103
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,850
We are lucky to be a member of this big family.

104
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,890
Come to think of it, we are all very lucky.

105
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,310
But if we talk about who is the luckiest,

106
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,200
should be Gun.

107
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,030
Why?

108
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,110
Well...
Well...

109
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,940
Among us,

110
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,020
Gun has been with Su Xi for the longest time.

111
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,470
Seok, you're good at catching details.

112
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,660
Yes.

113
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,780
It's nice. You won an award on your first show.

114
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,730
Unlike some actors,

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,490
I've played a few series.

116
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,230
He didn't even appear on the candidate list.

117
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,980
You're right.

118
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,830
But I think It depends on the script we got.

119
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,480
If the script is not good,

120
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,770
no matter how hard an actor works,

121
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,220
no one will mention it.

122
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,170
As for Peter and Seok's drama,

123
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,980
I think the script is great.

124
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,070
That's right. I agree.

125
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,130
The drama Peter and Seok played

126
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,360
is interesting.

127
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,550
Anything can happen in a virtual world.

128
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,210
That's right.

129
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,650
The plot is great.

130
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,170
But compared to your script,

131
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,710
mine is very ordinary.

132
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,950
You and Gun have a great fight scene.

133
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,660
The whole drama has a thrilling scene.

134
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,380
Then these action scenes...

135
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,830
Did Kung do it himself?

136
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,990
Or do you have a substitute like those famous actors?

137
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,390
Act by yourself.

138
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,170
For the sake of the crew's convenience,

139
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,790
I think if we don't have a good script,

140
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,550
there's no need to go in person.

141
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,130
I like the story of Gun and Gong.

142
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,720
You lied that Gun died.

143
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,440
The plot was great too.

144
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,910
The heroine in the drama is cute too.

145
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,900
Every time Gun gets into the scene, I feel...

146
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,760
I never felt anything.

147
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,060
I just feel like I'm performing.

148
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,710
Don't you remember our rules?

149
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,000
Sorry.

150
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,220
Gun is our role model.

151
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,990
Learn from him.

152
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,480
I can get good scripts like Seok and Peter.

153
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,500
Do you have any official work to do?

154
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,800
Not yet.

155
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,240
But I think everyone will have their time.

156
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,010
Waixia will have their own time.

157
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,250
Yes.

158
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,910
You can even lecture me because you're experienced.

159
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,580
Although I'm not good at acting

160
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,800
It's so noisy. I can't even eat well.

161
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,610
The music is too loud.

162
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,590
Are you scolding me?

163
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,830
No.

164
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,830
I'm sorry.

165
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,210
Ms. Suxi,

166
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,620
I have something to report to you.

167
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,500
Excuse me.

168
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,020
Help yourself.

169
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,220
Where are you going?

170
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,680
Gong.

171
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,760
The crew is done.

172
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,790
of the last activity.

173
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,320
Did you catch him?

174
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,100
Not yet.

175
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,780
Not yet.

176
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,240
He covered his face, dressed up like other fans.

177
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,480
Nowadays,

178
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,860
Cute is cute

179
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,970
What's scary is that you can't handle it.

180
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,600
But if you had solved it that day,

181
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,320
you don't have to be so careful.

182
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,270
Yes.

183
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,710
Everyone is ready to go back.

184
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,230
Excuse me. What are you doing in this room?

185
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,290
I'm sorry.

186
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,020
Even if you make another mistake,

187
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,070
I won't keep you.

188
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,480
I understand.

189
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,240
What's wrong?

190
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,580
Why did you leave and come to the vent room?

191
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,830
I'm asking you. You have to answer me.

192
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,870
Am I telling the truth?

193
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,700
Or...

194
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,810
Let go of me.

195
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,910
[Camera]

196
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,690
[Camera]

197
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,690
[Camera]

198
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,660
You can even lecture me because you're experienced.

199
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,280
Although I'm not good at acting

200
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,660
Why are you sitting here so sadly?

201
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,780
No.

202
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,460
Don't tell me you're thinking about what Minda said.

203
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,210
Okay.

204
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,880
No matter what, we can't do it.

205
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,870
to make everyone like or satisfied.

206
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,640
Besides, if you're not good at acting,

207
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,550
you can't teach me.

208
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,030
Yes, you're right.

209
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,970
At first, your acting was stiff like a rock.

210
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,210
I admit it.

211
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,520
What about now?

212
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,710
Well...

213
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,120
Well...

214
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,040
Well...

215
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,850
Just...

216
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,350
A little better.

217
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,520
Just a little?

218
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,340
Yes.

219
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,450
Just a little bit.

220
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,080
At least you've improved.

221
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,910
In the future,

222
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,770
let's go eat what you like.

223
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,120
roasted chicken, green papaya salad, okay?

224
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,240
Sure. When are you going to tell me?

225
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,890
You answered so fast.

226
00:22:59,410 --> 00:22:59,910
Cut.

227
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,610
Peter, what I want is

228
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,190
to express more shy emotions and expressions.

229
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,960
But I didn't feel it just now.

230
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,480
One more time.

231
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,480
More emotions.

232
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,980
But I...
That wasn't good enough.

233
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,220
Try it. Put more effort into it.

234
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,680
Time is running out.

235
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,080
We have an interview later.

236
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,190
Okay.

237
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,580
It's okay. Let's try again.

238
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,420
Maybe I didn't perform well just now.

239
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
One more time.

240
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,630
Okay.

241
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,260
I want you to tell us

242
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,320
how you feel about winning the Best New Artist of the Year.

243
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,340
I feel proud.

244
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,960
I've already told you how I feel.

245
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,720
I don't know what else to say.

246
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,810
If I have to say, that is...

247
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,110
Thank you, fans.

248
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,330
for supporting us till now.

249
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,420
And thank the staff behind the scenes.

250
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,690
They're like our family.

251
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,920
Yes.

252
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,840
Since you two are so close,

253
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,050
Do you know what type of person he likes?

254
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,580
His type.

255
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,150
must be cute, playful,

256
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,400
and cheerful.

257
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,430
You mean yourself, right?

258
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,580
What about Peter?

259
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,450
His type.

260
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,870
should be someone with leadership ability.

261
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,810
And he can accept everything about him.

262
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,080
Is Seok that kind of person?

263
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,440
Kind of.

264
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,140
Thank you for coming to this event

265
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,710
and accepted our interview.

266
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,180
It's an honor. Thank you.

267
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,630
Thank you.

268
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,650
Gosh.

269
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,470
So many gifts from fans.

270
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,020
Every special day there are so many gifts

271
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,400
Special day?

272
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,950
Everyone won the prize.

273
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,900
I'm jealous. I want a job too.

274
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,200
Don't be upset.

275
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,580
They waited for a long time

276
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,970
for a long time.

277
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,670
I'll have a job too, right?

278
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,720
Yes.

279
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,170
Focus on your own first.

280
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,350
Yes.

281
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,990
I'll do my best in the next audition. Okay.

282
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,110
Good luck.

283
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,990
You'll get a job.

284
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,340
Thank you.

285
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,850
Hello, Mom.

286
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,330
Peter, how are you?

287
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,360
What are you doing?

288
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,100
It's good. I just finished the shoot.

289
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,700
Really? I didn't know you were busy.

290
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,480
I'll call you later.

291
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,020
Mom, it's okay.

292
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
Can we continue?

293
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,210
What brings you here?

294
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,290
It's about the debt.

295
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,380
The new payment will be due soon.

296
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,750
Okay, Mom.

297
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,720
I'll transfer the money.

298
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,470
By the way,

299
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,470
Well, there aren't many episodes left.

300
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,530
But

301
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,240
I borrowed money for investment again.

302
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,990
The fertilizer fee has increased.

303
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,770
I don't want to trouble you.

304
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:01,090
I told you I'll take care of the money.

305
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,590
You don't need to borrow money.

306
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,450
I'm working. I can handle it.

307
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,850
I'm sorry, kid.

308
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,430
It's okay, Mom.

309
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,480
I'll call you again.

310
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,250
About your family?

311
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,770
Yes.

312
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,330
Tell me if you need any help.

313
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,890
Actually, you can use my money first.

314
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,760
Are you crazy?

315
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,830
I'm serious.

316
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:43,460
If you're worried, I can hire you.

317
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,850
What?

318
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,850
Why don't we invite you to my place?

319
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,930
If you want a friend to go to your house, just tell me.

320
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,760
Don't pretend.

321
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,150
Okay. Are you going?

322
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,490
Sure, but you don't have to hire me.

323
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,300
Let's go get changed.

324
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:12,830
Let's go.

325
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,260
Hello.

326
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,660
Seok.

327
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,630
He's fine.

328
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,230
Don't worry about him.

329
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,150
What game are we playing today?

330
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,490
I won't play the last game.

331
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,030
It's too hard to pass.

332
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,520
No

333
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,510
Madam, I really didn't do it.

334
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,260
How dare you say you didn't do it?

335
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,590
I lost a basket of things.

336
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,060
I really don't know.

337
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,640
If you don't admit your mistake,

338
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,680
I'll whip you

339
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,460
until you tell the truth.

340
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,500
Hong! Bingzhong!

341
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,080
Tie him to the pillar.

342
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,930
Yes, come here.

343
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,210
Madam.

344
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,250
I really don't know.

345
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,970
Madam.

346
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,760
What is it?

347
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,710
You're so loud. I can hear you at the dock.

348
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,080
Hello, Mother.

349
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,270
I'm just punishing this thief.

350
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,070
You must be tired.

351
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,270
Go take a shower and make yourself comfortable.

352
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,490
A thief?

353
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,000
I really didn't do it, Young Master.

354
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,120
You still won't admit it?

355
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,440
Stop.

356
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,660
Stop. Stop.

357
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,550
The microphone is in the camera.

358
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,470
How did you raise your microphone?

359
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,680
Sorry, bro.

360
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,620
Gun, start with this line.

361
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,140
A thief? This one.

362
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:38,790
Okay?

363
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,240
Okay.

364
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,360
Let's count down when we're ready.

365
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,900
Three, two.

366
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,450
Action.

367
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,760
A thief?

368
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,390
I really didn't do it, Young Master.

369
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,010
How dare you say you didn't do it?

370
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,760
Please trust me.

371
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,920
I'm really not a thief.

372
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,530
Yes.

373
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,830
I think it must be a misunderstanding.

374
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,290
Tuude grew up in this house.

375
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,360
He knows

376
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,890
what he should and shouldn't do.

377
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,190
Yes.

378
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,460
Is that what you think?

379
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,210
Yes.

380
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,510
Don't worry.

381
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,120
I'll find someone who made a mistake to punish him.

382
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,920
If that person is Tuude,

383
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,980
I won't stop you.

384
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,590
Then let him go.

385
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,120
Thank you, Young Master.

386
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,350
Cut.

387
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,070
Okay.

388
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,130
Okay.

389
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,180
Get ready for the next scene.
Did you get hurt just now?

390
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,160
I'm fine.

391
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,300
Aunt and brothers can go get changed.

392

Good job.

Bye.

395
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,430
Bye.

396
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,810
You two did a great job.

397
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,590
Thank you, Brother De.

398
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,860
Let's go and get changed.

399
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,600
I'll take you home.

400
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,020
It's okay.

401
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,990
I have something to do later.

402
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,100
I'll go back by myself.

403
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,250

Okay.

409

It's five o'clock.

412
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,310
I have to go.

413
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,180
Otherwise, the curfew will be over.

414
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,770
Let me give you a ride.

415
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,080
No need.

416
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,100
If you give me a ride, you'll have to go back and forth.

417
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,030
I'll go back by myself.

418
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,240
You don't have to go back and forth.

419
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,990
I can sleep in a big house.

420
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,490
If I let you go home alone,

421
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,560
it'll be over the curfew time.

422
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,680
Okay.

423
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,850
Right.

424
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,640
Let's go.

425
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,360
Let's go.

426
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,400
[Couple] Are they a real couple or a screen couple? They're together.
Nothing is more real than this. Seok and Peter are a couple.

427
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,460
I know you two are close.

428
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,830
It's good for work.

429
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,590
But don't forget

430
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,489
not a real couple.

431
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,900
You haven't forgotten, have you?

432
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,820
But we're just playing games together.

433
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,620
Yes, we're really just playing games.

434
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,770
If you have time to play games,

435
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,350
instead of playing games.

436
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,239
Isn't that better?

437
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,719
I know you're worried about me.

438
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,760
But no matter what,

439
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,080
you have no right

440
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,230
Do you think I sent someone to follow you?

441
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,409
Who do you think you are?

442
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,630
An anonymous actor?

I hope your relationship

449
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,100
is just like what you said.

450
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,880
What is it?

451
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,000
It's fine. Go and rest.

452

453
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,100
I have an audition tomorrow.

454
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,130
There's an audition for a new movie.

455
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,620
Yes.

456
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,170
You can go.

457
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,250
Okay.

458
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:29,060
You're always so serious.

459
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,610
Is it too stressful?

460
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,390
Yes, Mom.

461
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,940
I'm fine.

462

464

Mom.

467
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,360
Right, Mom.

468
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,080
Hello, are you free?

469
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,860
Yes, Mom.

Tell me how much you borrowed.

471

Okay.

I love you too.

[What's with the comments?] Why are you getting in the way?

488
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,440
[I know you like it, but be rational.]

489

I don't think it's real. We're just open.

490
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,430
[It's just a screen couple.] Don't get too immersed. Wake up.
You won't be popular if you don't play a rotten drama.
