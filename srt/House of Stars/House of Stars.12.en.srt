Have you decided

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,130
Have you made up your mind?

11
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,310
Yes.

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,060
I'll say it at the press conference.

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,430
Are you sure?

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:50,600
Yes.

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,510
First, thank you.

16
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,190
Reporters, thank you for coming today.

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,630
I'm the CEO of House.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,930
I will answer your questions.

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,770
What's the result of the Susie case?

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,160
We got the test result, right?

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,410
I got it.

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,850
You know the culprit, right?

23
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,630
Really?

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,570
What is it?

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,310
This is Susie's autopsy report.

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,860
On the day of the incident,

27
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,170
Sussie had a serious food allergy.

28
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,730
I got in touch with alcohol.

29
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,830
So the symptoms worsened.

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,570
This may be the reason

31
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,990
fall into the water.

32
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,009
and eventually suffocated.

33
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,340
Does this mean he changed the food?

34
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,680
Is someone by the pool?

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,320
Really? Who is it?

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,250
Really?

37
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,270
Is anyone with you? Please answer.

38
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,320
Except me, the assistant of Sussie,

39
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,750
no one knows that Susie is allergic to food

40
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,410
or what Susie is allergic to.

41
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,460
In this case Host is the most suspicious person, right?

42
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,480
Really?

43
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,890
Not Miss Host

44
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,720
Right

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,350
Host sister won't do it

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,180
Because Miss Host loves her sister like she loves her mom.

47
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,690
Love doesn't mean she won't do it.

48
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,470
There are news about kids hurting their parents.

49
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,460
Yes.

50
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,920
Please answer

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,690
What is it?

52
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,870
Do you think you should ask that?

53
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,650
If it's me, I don't think I'll ask.

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,370
Host knows what Susie is allergic to.

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,810
It doesn't mean

56
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,090
she's the murderer.

57
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,200
Right?

58
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,410
The closest person.
The only one who knows.

59
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,430
We can all be witnesses.

60
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,480
Everyone here has recorded the testimony.

61
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,840
The police closed the case.

62
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,520
This case was an accident.

63
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,010
None of us

64
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,590
don't want this to happen.

65
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,720
I hope you understand.

66
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,650
Gun.

67
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,600
You don't have to do that.

68
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,550
Gun.

69
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,440
You don't have to turn yourself in.

70
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,090
I know

71
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,079
you've done everything you can.

72
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,070
You don't have to feel burdened anymore.

73
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,270
I don't need you to do that.

74
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,910
I also believe that you think the same way.

75
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,380
If it's not for me...

76
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,150
for the one who loves you.

77
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,910
Trust me, Gun.

78
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,130
Your life

79
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,150
in your life.

80
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,880
Don't end it right away.

81
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,520
What should we do next?

82
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,860
Don't worry.

83
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,890
I've prepared everything.

84
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,520
In that case,

85
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,540
what will happen in the future of House?

86
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,850
Will it close if Sussie is gone?

87
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,670
No.

88
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,540
The House will continue to run.

89
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,550
I'll replace Sussie as the person in charge.

90
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,100
Everyone sitting here

91
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,700
will help the House continue.

92
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,500
Where did Korn go?

93
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,640
Why didn't he come to the press conference today?

94
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,790
I know, right?

95
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,180
This is another thing we're going to announce today.

96
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,550
Many people must be confused about my relationship with Korn.

97
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,260
I came out today

98
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,380
I broke up with Korn.

99
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,580
Why? What happened?
Is it because of the third person?

100
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,260
Not another person.

101
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,220
We live in different ways.

102
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,050
We both understand each other.

103
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,010
we decided to break up.

104
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,070
Will we still work together?

105
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,800
Yes, will we cooperate again?

106
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,420
We answered all the questions today.

107
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,970

156

Yeah.

161
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,940
You should act like you need a beating.

162

163
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,200

175
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,420

182

190

192
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,380
The view is beautiful.

193
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,810
Who arranged the trip?

194
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,380
Who else?

195
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,240
Have fun.

196
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,190
Do you like it?

197
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,530
Gun?

198
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,050
I like something difficult.

199
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,600
You always treat me

200
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,770
But it's worth it.

201
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,510
Hello?

202
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,670
Yes, I am.

203
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,780
I called in the morning.

204
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,600
Okay, thank you.

205
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,730
Okay.

206
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,960
The view is beautiful.

207
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,720
Let's take a photo together.

208
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,500
We have a special guest today

209
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,120
Oh oppa

210
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,680
Yes.

211
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,950
Gun helped with the procedure at the hospital.

212
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,320
I come out with Sin once in a while to feel the air outside.

213
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,840
You may get better.

214
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,360
Congratulations.

215
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,360
Thank you.

216
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,140
I'll show Sin around.

217
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,570
In this case,

218
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,740
it means that...

219
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,650
I already invited him.

220
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,350
Isn't he coming?

221
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,410
I'm busy.

222
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,560
Let him be.

223
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,640
Let's drink according to the atmosphere.

224
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,820
Anyone wants to play water?

225
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,330
If you play, I'll play too.

226
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,760
Let's go.

227
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,940
Let's go.

228
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,960
Do you want to hang out, Gun?

229
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,950
Are you chatting with Pitch?

230
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,540
I didn't expect

231
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,230
Gun has such a side.

232
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,300
You look so pretty in photos.

233
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,319
It would be better if Pitch were here.

234
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,310
Right?

235
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,730
Yes.

236
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,160
Aren't you going to play?

237
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,520
Oh.

238
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,420
Gun.

239
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,140
Ah.

240
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,230
Gun.

241
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,270
Yes.

242
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,360
Later.

243
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,910
I'll go down myself.

244
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,570
What are you doing?

245
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,490
Wayu.

246
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,090
Come down

247
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,450
Oh

248
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,870
Do you want to hang out with everyone?

249
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,250
LaLI and I will take care of Sin for you.

250
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,940
Yeah, Soh. I'll help.

251
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,560
Thank you, Miss Host.

252
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,290
It's okay, Lali.

253
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,310
I can take care of it.

254
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,680
I can come out and relax sometimes.

255
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,460
Go play.

256
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,330
Are you sure?

257
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,380
Yes.

258
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,660
Let's go.

259
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,060
I think

260
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,860
romantic romance

261
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,050
Will it end with a happy ending?

262
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,060
A happy ending.

263
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,520
Yes.

264
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,390
Yes.

265
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,110
I like the happy ending.

266
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,090
A happy ending.

267
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,190
It's late.

268
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,480
You're still up?

269
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,610
The weather is nice here.

270
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,630
I'm sorry you didn't come.

271
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,470
We'll come alone next time.

272
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,620
[Okay.]

273
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,170
[Next time.]

274
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:52,810
Pitch.

275
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,480
[Yes.]

276
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,570
I miss you.

277
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,830
I really want you by my side.

278
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,720
What?

279
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,120
I'm begging you today.

280
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,220
Enough?

281
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,540
How much is it?

282
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,700
You don't understand me.

283
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,550
No one understands me.

284
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,160
But after seeing it, it's pretty.

285
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,790
The fireworks rushed into the sky

286
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,570
and shine brightly.

287
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,580
Just like us now

288
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,150
came to the end.

289
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,190
and chose a good start.

290
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,750
It's so touching.

291
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,570
Are you that sad when you act

292
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,910
No.

293
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,940
Just do whatever you want.

294
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,240
So pretty.

295
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,500
Yes.

296
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,310
Wayu.

297
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,540
Hello.

298
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,200
Yes.

299
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,240
Do you remember who asked you that?

300
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,990
What?

301
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,360
Grasp desire.

302
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,980
What does it mean?

303
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,710
What does that mean?

304
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,590
Wayu.

305
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,440
Yes.

306
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,620
Why did you catch me?

307
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,310
You want to know, don't you?

308
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,200
I'll show you.

309
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,500
Really?

310
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,760
Grasp the desire.

311
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,520
It means

312
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,070
Success reaching the shore.

313
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,410
Is that what it means?

314
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:15,700
Yes.

315
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,830
Wayu.

316
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,490
What?

317
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,670
But I've never

318
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,060
Uh.

319
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,520
You...

320
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,090
Don't you want to try?

321
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,770
But I haven't.

322
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,370
It's okay.

323
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,410
Wait, I'll teach you slowly.

324
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,790
Didn't you say to take it slow?

325
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,460
It's not that slow.

326
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,620
Hello.

327
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,660
Do you want to be in the front

328
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,820
or behind?

329
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,380
Let's say you're unlucky.

330
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,410
Police.

331
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,420
Who is the unlucky one?

332
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,710
Is that all you've got?

333
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,680
Come on.

334
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,370
I can't stand it anymore.

335
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,890
Why?

336
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,970
What's wrong?

337
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,970
It's Wayu.

338
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,060
I can't keep up.

339
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,410
What happened?

340
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,810
Did he run away from the crew?

341
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,440
No.

342
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,800
I mean Wayu and Wawa.

343
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,310
I can't keep up with them.

344
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,200
Oh, that's good. Isn't it?

345
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,070
I thought something happened.

346
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,890
That's it. I'm busy.

347
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,120
You said it yourself. Let me report to you if there's anything.

348
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,730
Cut.

349
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,780
It passed.

350
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,310
Not bad.

351
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,200
It's finally over.

352
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,190
Thank you.

353
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,320
I didn't expect

354
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,190
you can do so well.

355
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,580
And you, Wayu. You're usually a gentleman.

356
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,000
Being a gentleman doesn't mean you have to follow the rules.

357
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,530
You're good at pretending.

358
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,020
But you did a great job.

359
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,150
Thank you.

360
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,170
It was fun. It was fun and exciting.

361
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,490
It was a great scene.

362
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,520
Thank you.

363
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,300
Okay, let's get ready for the next scene.

364
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,130
Good job.

365
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,970
[Audition Room]

366
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,410
Hello, Sosh.

367
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,370
Korn

368
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,650
Hello.

369
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,140
Why are people like you here?

370
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,480
I'm not trying to say anything.

371
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,220
I mean...

372
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,370
You know, right?

373
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,390
This is an audition for a drama.

374
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:58,920
Yes.

375
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,570
I know.

376
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,660
Then why?

377
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,490
I know how many people brag about me.

378
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,080
I've been famous since I was a kid.

379
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,380
Up to now,

380
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,400
any famous works.

381
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,360
And I gradually became useless.

382
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,810
But I still have the ability.

383
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,590

00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,500
It won't end like this.

575
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,100
[Seven years ago]

576
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,950
[I don't care about anything.]

577
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,080
[I only care about myself.]

578
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,030
[Is that Gun's voice?]

579
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,580
[This means Miss Susie's death]

580
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,370
[It may not be an accident at the press conference.]
Really?

581
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,080
[How is it?]

582
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,160
[Please answer.]
Wait.

583
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,600
[Miss Lali]

584
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,110
Miss Host.

585
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,030
There's something in the dessert.

586
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,620
We apologize again.

587
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,790
You already told me.
Someone is allergic to the hawthorn.

588
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,810
It's okay.

589
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,250
It's only your mistake

590
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,730
to point out your mistake.

591
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,900
[or just an extra.]

592
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:42,370
[Will an allergy to fruit lead to death?]

593
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,190
[Don't waste yourself.]

594
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,370
Excuse me.

595
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,050
Today is my dear Happiness. The first shot of season 2.
So I came to say hello.

596
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,120
Okay.

597
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,790
I just got some sweet hawthorns.

598
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,040
A full car.

599
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,000
Let the kid get it.
It's okay.

600
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,130
Thank you.
I'll accept your kindness.

601
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,350
I happen to be allergic to the hawthorn.

602
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,510
Really?

603
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,050
What a pity

604
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,840
[Allergic to loquat.]

605
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,720
I wish you could have some.

606
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,760
[Gun is hiding something from us.]

607
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,760
[You knew everything.]

608
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,560
[Why did you keep it from me?]

609
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,950
[This is a person's life.]

610
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,820
[I hurt someone's life.]

611
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,380
[I hurt his family.]

612
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,640
[Please answer.]
Do you know Gun?

613
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:58,890
[Wait.]

614
00:43:58,890 --> 00:43:59,920
[Knowing about this]

615
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:00,870
[Miss]

616
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,320
[What do you think? Please answer.]

617
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,030
This house

618
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,790
is so interesting.

619
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,140
[Gun]

620
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,740
[What's the sound?]

621
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,930
Please answer.

622
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,120
What's going on?
Please answer.

623
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,720
Is it really your voice?

624
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,790
[Please answer, Gun.]

625
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,950
[What is it?]

626
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,560
[Is it true?]

627
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,080
[Gun]
