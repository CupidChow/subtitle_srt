1
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,840
Arghhhhh !!

2
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,240
Hey !

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,439
Mintra.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,520
Mintra !!

5
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,400
Korn ...

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,880
Uh ...

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,800
Acting like a heroine?

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:43,760
Hmm?

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,440
Arghhhh !

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,080
Win !!

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Arghhhh !

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:46,880
Enough ..

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,640
But she started first, Korn.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Why you have to do like this?

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,520
Com'on, get up.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,200
Double-faced.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,560
Korn ...

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,720
Oh, it hurts!

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,640
Fibber !

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,640
What happened here?

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
Tell me, what happened?

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,720
Pawin ...

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,960
Pawin ?

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,880
What Pawin ?

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,520
She did it herself.

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,680
Don't you guys see?

27
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,640
Host too.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,479
You don't have to look at me like that.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,479
Win.

30
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,160
You have to see Miss Suzie.

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,160
Host.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Ehh.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,920
Follow me!

34
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
Looks delicious right?

35
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,760
I made it for Korn.

36
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,240
What are you doing?

37
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
I'm asking what are you doing?

38
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Well, I'm doing like what you did.

39
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
Ill mannered.

40
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,000
Tut!

41
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,120
Just like you bitch!

42
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,920
I'm asking what the hell are you doing?

43
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,440
What the heck is wrong?

44
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,320
Are you crazy? Huh?

45
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,720
I am a bullshit.

46
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh ...

47
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,600
Looks so beautiful.

48
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,520
What the hell are you doing?

49
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,760
You wanna try me?

50
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,960
Hmm ..

51
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,920
Slap me ..

52
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,160
Com'on slap me !!

53
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,120
Go ahead.

54
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,800
Don't you want to slap me?

55
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,960
Why not ??

56
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,200
Are you insane?

57
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,040
Stop!

58
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
You out of your freaking mind?

59
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,920
Arghhhhhh !!

60
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,720
Are you hurt?

61
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,440
No, it's not.

62
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,160
Something else ...

63
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,040
Hurts me more.

64
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,720
Ouch!

65
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,360
You okay?

66
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,680
Bear it a little more.

67
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,560
It will get better soon.

68
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,280
What happened?

69
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,360
What have you done?

70
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,200
Done?

71
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,160
What have I done?

72
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,600
Win has done nothing yet.

73
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,520
Why would Win do that?

74
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,640
But if Win really did it.

75
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,200
Huh ..

76
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,559
She could be ended up worst than this.

77
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,720
You may haven't done this,

78
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,640
but something else,

79
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,760
don't you think that I wouldn't know.

80
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,400
You want something that is already occupied.

81
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
Once you get it ...

82
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,160
It will be a success on other people's sufferings.

83
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,040
And it was just a momentary happiness.

84
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,600
Don't make it any worse.

85
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,000
You may leave.

86
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,840
Get out !!

87
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,960
You've already known who he is.

88
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,200
But you chose to hide from me.

89
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,000
How can you do this?

90
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,120
I did what I should.

91
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,960
You did what you should?

92
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,400
I thought he's dead,

93
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,800
He's dead by me.

94
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,160
Do you know ?

95
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,760
I went to see him today.

96
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,880
How bad he is?

97
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,320
Worse than anything I've experienced in the past 7 years.

98
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,720
I ruined one's life.

99
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,240
Destroyed his future.

100
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,080
But you still do nothing ...

101
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,960
You are no different from those who seeks only benefits from me.

102
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,360
Do you still have a humanity?

103
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,040
A kid that act so dissolute like you.

104
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
How could you do anything?

105
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,880
If I didn't lend you a hand.

106
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,800
Will you still have your face to stand and complain me right now?

107
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,160
Oh!

108
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,000
Stop!

109
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,320
Stop all the fuss!

110
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,200
If you drink then you became a jerk like this.

111
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,160
No matter how much your value is.

112
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
I can cut you off instantly.

113
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,440
Go back to the House now.

114
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,360
No!

115
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,120
I'm an actor.

116
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,400
Not a slave.

117
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
What the hell are all these rules?

118
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,760
This is not a house.

119
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
This is a prison!

120
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,600
Whoever wants to stay, just stay.

121
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,200
But fucking not for me.

122
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,880
Heyyyy!

123
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,560
Report an emergency.

124
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,040
The car just crashed in front of the mall.

125
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,000
Please come quickly

126
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,440
Please go to the police station.

127
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,200
Please ...

128
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,760
At least ...

129
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,000
If I knew that he is still alive.

130
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,880
I can help him something ..

131
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,000
What will you do?

132
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,040
Look after him ?

133
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,800
Bow down?

134
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
Begging?

135
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,280
Apologize?

136
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,480
Say "I was wrong."... like that?

137
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,520
You still didn't know how to deal with your own life.

138
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,120
Do not show off with me.

139
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,360
Just do as I've managed.

140
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,200
Alas!

141
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,320
Get out now!

142
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,440
Why the heck you still here?

143
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,440
Or did you eavesdrop me?

144
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,760
Well ...

145
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,760
You just asked me to leave.

146
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,560
Didn't ask me to not listen.

147
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,040
Or ...

148
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,640
You got secret?

149
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,720
Gun

150
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,760
Gun

151
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,600
Are you okay?

152
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,600
You can talk to me if there's anything.

153
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,640
Bro !

154
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Are you hurt?

155
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,040
It's okay.

156
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,000
Just leave.

157
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But ..

158
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,480
But you ..

159
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,760
Stay out of my face ... Go !

160
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,080
I want to be alone.

161
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,520
I .. got it.

162
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,840
This house ... is

163
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,040
damn fucking fun.

164
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,840
How did you get into this room?

165
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,680
I just walked in.

166
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,240
Or I cannot enter this room?

167
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,839
Only me who can get into this room.

168
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,319
Miss Suzie

169
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,400
Hello ... sis'.

170
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,640
Never mind.

171
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,240
You are all here.

172
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,320
I've prepared some wine.

173
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,400
Shell we drink together?

174
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,560
You want some?

175
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,760
Don't you drink?

176
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,560
What exactly do you want?

177
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,080
I want to ruin everything.

178
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,160
Ruin people's lives?

179
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,600
You knew it all the time.

180
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,680
Why you keep hiding it to me all the time?

181
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,960
But this is one's life.

182
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,520
I destroyed his life.

183
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,160
Destroyed his family.

184
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,400
Why the heck you still here?

185
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,200
Or did you eavesdrop me?

186
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,160
You just asked me to leave.

187
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,240
Didn't ask me to not listen.

188
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,760
Or ...

189
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,680
You got secret?

190
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,440
Ruin people's lives.

191
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,600
I know your relation doesn't go well.

192
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,480
Would you make it better?

193
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
or make it worst?

194
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,160
Then you guys pack your things and get out from this house.

195
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,520
Good ...

196
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,320
Does it heal?

197
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,640
Umm.

198
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,560
Barely leave a mark.

199
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,600
I think ...

200
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,120
I got a very good care.

201
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,680
Now, our relation between 2 of us ...

202
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,120
is still the same?

203
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,240
What's done is done.

204
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,800
Don't you get it?

205
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,520
Then what you are doing right now? What is it supposed to mean.

206
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,120
I think I spoke clearly.

207
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,480
You're an idiot.

208
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,200
You see me as a sure thing.

209
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,360
When you eager to have me .. just come to have me.

210
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,760
Then throw away when you don't need me.

211
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,240
What kind of creature you see me as?

212
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
You thought that when you're not having me.

213
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,760
You could make it through?

214
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,720
Korn!

215
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,040
Is there anything wrong?

216
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,600
Yes, there is.

217
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,280
There is one thing I need you to correct.

218
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,960
The last one,

219
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,600
which is telling that ...

220
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,080
Me and Korn cannot be broke up.

221
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,360
I don't want to work with him anymore.

222
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,680
Am I look like playing like a child?

223
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,840
Rules are always the rules.

224
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,480
Start seeing each other, never breaking up.

225
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,680
They hired you.

226
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Because of the imagined couple between you and Korn.

227
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,360
You think you could've came this far?

228
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,600
Being on your own.

229
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
If you don't want to renew, you don't have to ...

230
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,840
I do.

231
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,880
Glad that you renew the contract.

232
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,920
Oh!

233
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,280
Totally forgot.

234
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
There is a new job coming,

235
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,280
just for you alone.

236
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,240
Interested?

237
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,040
Contact me just a minute ago.

238
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,800
Yes, I do.

239
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,960
Arghhhhh!

240
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,760
Korn.

241
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,960
Should we go out for a walk?

242
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,560
There's a newly open Japanese restaurant.

243
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,680
No.

244
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,640
What's the matter with you?

245
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,920
Not in a good mood?

246
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,800
I think ...

247
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,120
We shoull ... stop our relation here.

248
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,160
Actually, I'm just a coward.

249
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,440
Without Mintra,

250
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,800
I'm just finding a new toy.

251
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,960
What I'm doing right now.

252
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,480
It's no difference from riding Mintra's wave to become popular.

253
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,800
But ...

254
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,400
I never think you're riding my wave at all.

255
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,160
Korn, bro.

256
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,280
You listen to me.

257
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,040
Well ...

258
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,760
I've liked you.

259
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,160
I know ...

260
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,120
You may not like me now.

261
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,000
But ...

262
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,320
We can be brothers, what do you think?

263
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,080
We ...

264
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,720
can go out, watch movies, do anything we could.

265
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,640
Right?

266
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,440
Don't you think so~ ... Pleaseee.

267
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,960
I'm sorry.

268
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,040
I don't want to think about this anymore.

269
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,600
Wait, Korn.

270
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,720
Korn, bro'.

271
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,840
Ohhh~

272
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,560
Eventually, you are leftover.

273
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,120
At least,

274
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,920
I have more dignity than a falling star like you.

275
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,840
Away from luring those mens.

276
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,760
Seeing the news recently would be great.

277
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,720
You will know who is

278
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
the falling star.

279
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
Hey.

280
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,400
Huh? .. What it is?

281
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,920
I've heard that Pawin,

282
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,080
turn himself in exchange with a leading actor.

283
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,840
What ?! Really?

284
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,640
About to fall.

285
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,480
What?

286
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,280
A falling star~.

287
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,360
What are you talking about?!

288
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,960
Pawin, are you a feminine actor P.?

289
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,320
who is a sugar baby who turns yourself for the investor.

290
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,840
In exchange for a leading role?

291
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,720
Turned myself in exchange?

292
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,560
Sugar baby?

293
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,560
What are you talking about?

294
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,800
Pawin!

295
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,080
Stop!

296
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,080
I told you to stop !

297
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,760
Why you have to stop me?

298
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,320
I need to beat this bitch once!

299
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,480
Sighhh.

300
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,080
I know that you are mad.

301
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,120
But hold your temper for now.

302
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,320
Miss Suzie wants to see you.

303
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,520
Sighhh.

304
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,800
Don't you care about your life anymore?

305
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,120
You think that the issue you're facing is a big deal?

306
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,560
It's your choice.

307
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,120
If you want to stay here.

308
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,240
You must manage yourself.

309
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,200
Hey ...

310
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,400
Did you forget something?

311
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,080
What is it?

312
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,000
Cuttt ..

313
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Wayha.

314
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,840
I think you would be nervous.

315
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,280
Can we do it again?

316
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,120
Yes.

317
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,880
Sorry.

318
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,040
Okay .. slate, com'on, come.

319
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,680
F-Speed.

320
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,400
10/5 Cut 5 Take 2.

321
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,000
Marked.

322
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,080
Ready?

323
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,720
3 .. 2 .. and .. action.

324
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,120
Poy.

325
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,720
Did you forget something?

326
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,800
What is it?

327
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,200
Cuttt ..

328
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,320
Wayha!

329
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,760
I think it wasn't good at all.

330
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,280
It was not natural.

331
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,880
Can you do it more natural?

332
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,040
Yes.

333
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,480
Sighhh ..

334
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,840
I'm so sorry, director.

335
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,480
I think ..

336
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,120
Wayha could be anxious.

337
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,920
Because it is his first time in the shooting set.

338
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,280
Ummm ..

339
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,040
Give him a little break should be better.

340
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,960
May I speak to him?

341
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,760
Yeah?

342
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,320
Yes.

343
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,080
Okay, go ahead.

344
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,400
Thank you.

345
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,760
Wayha.

346
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,040
May I speak to you?

347
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,400
Okay .. touch up our cast .. com'on .. let's go.

348
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,720
Wayu.

349
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,480
Yes.

350
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,600
I didn't do well right?

351
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,920
Wasted everybody's time.

352
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,920
Wayu also wasted your time being friend with me.

353
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,199
Sighhh ..

354
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,000
Not at all.

355
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,280
I was also like this for my first time too.

356
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,480
But ..

357
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,400
I've tried so hard to study it from the computer.

358
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,040
Including watching series you gave me to watch.

359
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:49,960
At that moment,

360
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,840
I didn't feel that it is too difficult.

361
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,360
Hmm ..

362
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,560
As I act it myself ..

363
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,000
I don't know how to feel like.

364
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,240
When I do, it's not natural.

365
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,080
When kissing,

366
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,680
you have to feel it like this.

367
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,920
Well ..

368
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,600
Are you good now?

369
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,760
Umm ..

370
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,440
Let's break a leg.

371
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,400
Let's go!

372
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,360
Cut.

373
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Bravo.

374
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,600
Well done Wayha.

375
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,360
It looked so real.

376
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,360
I was worried about you.

377
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,840
Thought you can't make it.

378
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,920
I'm relieved now.

379
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,280
Well done, well done.

380
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,680
Our House of Stars has yet founded for 9 years.

381
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,280
I sincerely thank you everyone,

382
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,080
for putting so much effort,

383
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,320
and keep following the rules.

384
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,560
Even if there's someone,

385
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,680
who broke the rules,

386
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,640
until he almost get kicked out ...

387
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,680
from the house.

388
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,440
Oww! .. Miss Suzie.

389
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,160

Take care these boys.

394
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,000
“ Every single tear that dropped, every pain I've beared ”

395
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,600
“ No one stands right here with me now. ”

396
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,120
“ Even if I have to betray, I'm willing to do. If it leads me to the goal. ”

397
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,560
“ Exchange with anything, I would give everything. If I could accomplish. ”

398
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,120
“ A realm that everybody's searching for, a radiant lights with a frosty look. ”

399
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,120
“ Millions of stars painted in the sky, I will go grab it. ”

400
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:22,160
“ Fall down and scramble up half my life, found everything I could've asked for. ”

401
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:29,960
“ The realm that build from tears. I will not let it slip away. ”

402
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,840
Pitch, are you drunk?

403
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,120

It's all out.

407
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,640
I will go get one.

408
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,200
What took you so long?

409
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,320
Here Pitch ... you are such a bawler.

410
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,240
Let me.

411

Hey!

413
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,080
Gun, why you have to snatch my glass?

414
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,120
Stop drinking.

415
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,680
No, I'm not, bro.

416
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,360
Don't you see?

417
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,160
Zo has passed out.

418
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,280
Ohh!

419
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,200

421
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,440
Get back to your room.

422
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,800
I'll take you there. / No, to where? I'm not going, Gun.

423
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,600
Miss Suzie told us to enjoy to the fullest.

424
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,000
So tonight, if I'm not finished, I'm not quit.

425
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,800
Korn, bro. Help me.

426
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,200

Thank you.

431
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,480
Can I sit with you?

432
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,240
Com'on.

433
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,000
Cheers.

434
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,000
Well ..

435
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,520
Well?

436
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,560
I want to feel that way again.

437
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,080
That way?

438
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,840
Wanted to feel that way once again.

439
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,520
Wanted to memorize ... the memory.

440
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,880
I'm not sure that .. Wayha would feel the same?

441
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,280
But I wanted to kiss.

442
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,200
Well ..

443
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,640
We must have felt the same way then.

444
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,080
[INSANELY SCREAMING !]

445
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,120
[INSANELY SCREAMING !]

446
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,480
[INSANELY SCREAMING !]

447
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,000
[INSANELY SCREAMING !]

448
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,760
[INSANELY SCREAMING !]

449
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,160
[INSANELY SCREAMING !]

450
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,320
What the heck is happening? Miss Suzie?!

451
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,440
Due to the crime scene,

452
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,640
has a high possibility that it was an accident.

453
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,760
Then we have to invite all of you guys,

454
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,120
to the police station for the interrogation.

455
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,560
The reason why your brother became like this, it's because of me.

456
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,400
I drove the car and hit your brother,

457
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,560
then Miss Suzie keep it in the dark.

458
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,120
About Miss Suzie .. you are suspecting too right?

459
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,000
that is was not an accident.
