00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,000
What the heck has happened?

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,910
Hey! Miss Suzie!?

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,940
Miss SUZIEEEE !?!?!

ARGHHHHHH !?!?!

7
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,580
Te .. call the ambulance.

8
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,200
What the heck is wrong?

9
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,880
I don't know.

10
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,080
Hello? Yes.

11
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,810
Yes, yes.

12
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,920
I have an emergency.

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,500
There's someone died in the house.

14
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,730
How are you?

15
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,100
As you can see.

16
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,140
I'm still alive.

17
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,420
Don't think that you would come.

18
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,940
Mommy is sorry.

19
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,810
Why you have to act like you're being a good mom now?

20
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,770
I'm just like ...

21
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,140
I'm here to say goodbye.

22
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,220
Goodbye?

23
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,960
Where are you leaving to?

24
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,100
I'm going back to Thailand.

25
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,310
About the expenses ..

26
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,770
I will manage to send it to you here.

27
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,980
Have you ever see me as your child?

28
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,030
If you want to come, just come.

29
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,480
If you want to go, just go.

30
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,950
From now on ..

31
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,080
We live on our own.

32
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,770
You go wherever you want.

33
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,410
GO !?!

34
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,700

00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,510
GO NOW !!

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,190
What had just happened, sir?

37
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,640
What had just happened to Miss Suzie?

38
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,040
From the crime scene,

39
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,610
It has more possibility to be an accident.

40
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,770
Consequently, we have to ..

41
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,450
invite all of you guys

42
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,700
to interrogate for more information at the police station.

43
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,240
How about .. Miss Suzie.

44
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,980
From the dead body ..

45
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,010
there were no signs of being injured.

46
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,880
So ...

47
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,090
We have to send the body to a forensic laboratory,

48
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,100
to identify clearly,

49
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,510
and see what is the cause of the accident.

50
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,690
During this moment,

51
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,180
I beg your pardon,

52
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,420
do not enter the crime scene,

53
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,250
pick or touch anything at all.

54
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,440
Last night, from 7 PM.

55
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,240
What were you doing?

56
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,240
I participated in the party of the 'House'.

57
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,540
After the late night,

58
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,940
I saw Pitch very drunk.

59
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,810
So I helped Pitch to get back to his room.

60
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,700
Then I go back to sleep myself, separately.

61
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,410
Last night,

62
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,180
I was with Zo all the time.

63
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,810
Suddenly, Gun come across.

64
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,900
But after that, I was really drunk.

65
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,240
I can only remember that

66
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,130
I passed out on the table.

67
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,220
I ...

68
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,600
don't know the exact time I got back to the room.

69
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,630
Thought that it was Gun,

70
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,100
who brought me back to the room.

71
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,520
Last night it was me who organized the party.

72
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,920
That kept me busy.

73
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,740
When I got some free time,

74
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,950
to have a break. So ...

75
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,420
We were drinking together a little bit.

76
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,660
I was drinking with Te and Lalit.

77
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,700
I don't good at drinking.

78
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,990
So I was so so drunk.

79
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,500
I cannot remember anything.

80
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,450
After that,

81
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,280
I asked them for me to leave.

82
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,460
Because I was so tired from the whole day work.

83
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,110
Once I got my conciousness,

84
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,120
I heard the screaming.

85
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,850
So I ran to see.

86
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,909
I was with Wayha all the time.

87
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,970
Yes, I was with Wayu all the time.

88
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,050
We were drinking until very late night.

89
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,070
I got back to the room together with Wayha.

90
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,490
In the party, whom did you be with?

91
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,070
I didn't want to mess with someone else.

92
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,260
So I separated to drink on my own.

93
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,750
I don't know what time I fell asleep.

94
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,230
Yesterday, I ...

95
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,550
was not in a mood to drink.

96
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,820
So I went to bed early.

97
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,210
Honestly speaking sir,

98
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,040
If you ask me,

99
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,050
I think ...

100
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,700
the lady like Miss Suzie,

101
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,750
would've never .. fell down and drowned like that.

102
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,680
Maybe~ .....

103
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,630
someone did it for an intention.

104
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,730
As I can see,

105
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,650
today someone didn't come for the interrogation.

106
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,960
Who is that?

107
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,880
Well~ ....

108
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,690
The guy called Sun.

109
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,140
Everything alright?

110
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,740
Yes, everything alright.

111
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,020
Well,

112
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,430
We have to temporarily shut the 'House'.

113
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,780
You guys need to get rest at your own house.

114
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,820
But I don't have a house in Bangkok.

115
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,570
Zo: Then ...

116
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,500
Gun, brother ...

117
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,330
Could I ...

118
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,910
stay overnight at your condo?

119
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,630
I don't feel comfortable.

120
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,470
Wayu ..

121
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,280
I don't have a house in Bangkok too.

122
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,390
Well then ... let's ...

123
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,630
Stay overnight at my house.

124
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,150
We'd better get going.

125
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,820
There are reporters waiting.

126
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,990
Uh ...

127
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,070
Host ...

128
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,780
May I go to the restroom for just a moment?

129
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,240
Um, hurry back alright?

130
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,430
Okay.

131
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,940
How did that happen?

132
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,600
An accident of someone did it?

133
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,480
Right now we're assuming that it was the accident.

134
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,540
The accident?

135
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,470
Are you sure? That is was not a murder.

136
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,340
This case cannot be concluded too early.

137
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,310
If this truly was not the accident,

138
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,350
So we will continue interrogation.

139
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,420
Miss Host, what do you think about this?

140
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,970
What do you think? / Yes? / That's right?
Miss Host please answer.

141
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:10,050
Was there other member who entered the house?
Is there any further information? Miss Host.

142
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,260
I think so.

143
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,190
Excuse me !

144
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,920
EXCUSE ME !?!

145
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,780
What is it?

146
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,650
The incidence that happened,

147
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,890
We didn't expect that too.

148
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,170
Give us some time,

149
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,600
to get over it please?

150
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,460
We need to wait for the conclusion from the police.

151
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,900
If we could pick up something.

152
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,650
We will answer you later.

153
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,110
Right now,

154
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,940
Please let us go back and rest.

155
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,650
Excuse us.

156
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,400
Yes.

157
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,850
No, it's not.

158
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,780
This case the policemen didn't conclude anything.

159
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,450
Those medias keep stirring the news.

160
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,650
I assure you, that

161
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,370
Our kids will definitey not do something bad.

162
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,340
Let me check the contract, just a moment please.

163
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,210
[PHONE] But this news,

164
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,780
[PHONE] effects our product image.

165
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,770
[PHONE] I have to cancel the contract.

166
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,370
Please hold on ...

167
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,800
Te: Hello?

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,370
I got a call to cancel the job again.

169
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,810
How about yours?

170
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,750
Just the same.

171
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,200
The 5th call already.

172
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,250
If Miss Suzie's still here.

173
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,700
It would be great.

174
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,230
I understand,

175
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,760
what are you feeling right now.

176
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,310
I also have worked with Miss Suzie for such a long time.

177
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,550
You would've never known how I feel.

178
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,970
Let's hang up.

179
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,400
Sister, why there're a lot of reporter in front of my house.

180
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,030
What?

181
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,680
Hold on a sec.

182
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,710
Calm down.

183
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,240
Let's do it this way.

184
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,440
I'll let Te come to pick you up.

185
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,400
During this moment don't give any interview.

186
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,500
Okay then.

187
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,900
- It was just an accident. Too over stirring the news.
- Maybe someone set it up like an accident. #DrowningOrSetUp #HouseOfStars

188
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,750
- They could work together on seizing Miss Suzie's wealth.
She is so rich. #SomeoneKilledHer #HouseOfMurderer
- Or personal grudge? No one never had a fight especially between the stars and their manager.
- The lady assistant looks suspicious. She would need Suzie's position.

189
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,300
- Could not be Zo-Pitch. They are good kids. Didn't even slap an ant. #ZoPitchGoodBoys.
- Who knows? Not Gun as well. He had loved Miss Suzie so much. #GunGoodBoy
- Who knows? Stay the longest, Grudge the most.

190
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,680
Seriously?

191
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,910
There is a chance that one of us has killed Miss Suzie?

192
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,320
Still letting us stick together like this?

193
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,580
All of us would get killed too.

194
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,350
Recently, there are reporters keep stalking us.

195
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,200
I beg you guys to stay here.

196
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,100
I can manage easier.

197
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,210
About the news,

198
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,920
Don't prejudge by yourself.

199
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,420
That was because we cannot concluded if it was the accident or ... ?

200
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,180
How can I feel no scared?

201
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,680
Moreover,

202
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,560
This house would fit all of us?

203
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,220
This is my own house.

204
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,910
It's not as big as the 'House'.

205
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,340
But there are rooms for everyone.

206
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,700
Anyhow,

207
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,970
Wayu?

208
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,470
Could we sleep together?

209
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,640
I think ...

210
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,820
sleeping alone is ...

211
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,340
scary.

212
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,270
If Wayha is the one who ask then,

213
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,310
Yes, we can.

214
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,270
How can I make sure ...

215
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,620
that 2 of you haven't worked together as murderers, have you?

216
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,910
This is too much!

217
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,100
What would you do?

218
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,960
Hey!

219
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,110
Wasn't it you?

220
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,070
Who did this.

221
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,900
What do you mean?

222
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,210
You are the one who really required to cancel the contract.

223
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,580
Until you had a fight with Miss Suzie.

224
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,030
About the contract,

225
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,520
I finished speaking with Miss Suzie.

226
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,090
None of your business.

227
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,060
Everybody ...

228
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,060
Make it easy.

229
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,680
Gun's Voice : You've already known.

230
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,140
Gun's Voice : Why you keep hiding this from me all the time?

231
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,110
Gun's Voice : How could you do that?

232
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,320
Gun's Voice : But this is one's life.

233
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,010
Gun's Voice : I ruined his life.

234
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,820
Gun's Voice : I destroyed his family.

235
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,020
Gun's Voice : You're such a damn ...

236
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,140
Gun's Voice : I will go back to the 'House' and talk.

237
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,160
You are the one who did this?

238
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,110
I think ...

239
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,770
It could be a misunderstanding.

240
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,750
Was it?

241
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,230
Gun, brother?

242
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,160
Lalit haven't seen Sun recently.

243
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,600
Or ...

244
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,200
Enough everyone !

245
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,190
It was just the short clip, doesn't show that Gun is the murderer.

246
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,000
Go ahead and get some rest.

247
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,530
Fighting wouldn't get you any further.

248
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,200
I beg you.

249
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,680
Korn, brother?

250
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,700
Korn?

251
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,680
Ahhh~ ...

252
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,890
Tonight ...

253
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,800
Could I sleep with you?

254
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,540
Win can't sleep.

255
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,610
Pleaseee~

256
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,620
I want to sleep alone.

257
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,600
Oh please, Korn, brother?

258
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,319
Sawasdee ka.

259
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,980
Sawasdee krab.

260
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,280
I need your cooperation to come interrogate at the police station once again.

261
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,410
Sun has already gave an` interrogation.

262
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,319
Alright then.

263
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,020
What's your relation with the dead person.

264
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,680
I'm her son.

265
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,710
The real son of miss Suzie.

266
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,780
In the morning of the incidence's date,

267
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,710
Where were you?

268
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,580
I was hungry.

269
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,950
So I went out for some foods.

270
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,450
When I got back,

271
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,960
there's no one there.

272
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,230
Plus, there's a tape has blocked me from entering.

273
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,310
What should I do?

274
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,430
Have you ever seen this clip before?

275
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,870
Never.

276
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,340
Yes, I have seen it before.

277
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,190
Someone sent it to all of us yesterday.

278
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,810
Do you know?

279
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,930
What they were talking about?

280
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,130
I have no idea.

281
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,640
In this clip, what were you talking to Miss Suzie?

282
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,340
It's about the job.

283
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,240
Recently,

284
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,800
miss Suzie has loaded too much work for me.

285
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,190
Until I don't have a privacy.

286
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,070
So I outbursted.

287
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,170
Gun seems to be weird.

288
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,660
On that day,

289
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,290
I saw him had a fight with almost everybody.

290
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,110
Although I'm new here.

291
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,400
But I can realize,

292
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,310
that he was unusual

293
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,510
Really?

294
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,010
Yes.

295
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,560
How about you.

296
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,920
Have you ever had a conflict with someone?

297
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,850
What is it?

298
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,920
Me and Wayha never had a conflict with anybody.

299
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,010
Never?

300
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,550
Never.

301
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,040
With miss Suzie,

302
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,740
You never had a conflict with her too?

303
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,520
What are you doing?

304
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,090
Miss Suzie.

305
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,450
Well .. I ..

306
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,210
I am asksing what are you guys doing?

307
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,120
I .. I ..

308
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,090
Well we had a kiss.

309
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,700
Why you have to kiss?

310
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,320
Oh, well ..

311
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,970
I have an upcoming series.

312
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,070
Wayha: There's a love scene.
Wayu: The reason why I kissed.

313
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,880
Because I wanted to kiss.

314
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,340
No matter what you guys are doing right now.

315
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,530
Stop it.

316
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,670
Do you know the house rules well? Don't you?

317
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,040
I don't understand, Miss Suzie.

318
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,290
When we kissed each other,

319
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,870
when we love each other,

320
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,950
What the heck is wrong?

321
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,830
If I've ordered not to ....

322
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,840
Then it is final.

323
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,770
If you disobey,

324
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,230
then you have to leave this place.

325
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,600
Miss Suzie.

326
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,640
Wayha: We are so sorry.
Wayu: Well then ...

327
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,130
Got to go.

328
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,660
Wayu.

329
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,390
You and miss Suzie,

330
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,570
Ever had any conflict before?

331
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,020
Me and miss Suzie haven't talked much.

332
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,220
There was nothing for us to have a fight.

333
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,120
Miss Suzie.

334
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,770
Don't you think that you must give me some other jobs?

335
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,800
Why the heck that there's only Gun who got the good job?

336
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,500
How about me?

337
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,970
You are too drunk.

338
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,750
Let's talk about this when you are concious.

339
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,750
No !

340
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,790
I will talk today.

341
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,780
I'm so sick and tired of you being biasedly giving Gun the job.

342
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,720
Biased?

343
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,670
What do you think you are good at comparing to Gun?

344
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,540
When only keeping the simple house rules,

345
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,300
You still cannot make it.

346
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,940
I didn't do anything wrong.

347
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:16,200
How about the affection and love affair that happened in the house?

348
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,050
What was it then?

349
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,950
Don't think that I didn't know.

350
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,890
As you said that Miss Suzie didn't drown to death.

351
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,250
What was that supposed to mean?

352
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,210
Or you've known something?

353
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,400
Oh ..

354
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,520
No, it's not.

355
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,780
I was just wondering.

356
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,270
Well ..

357
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,650
Lately, those people in the 'House' seems unstable and erratic.

358
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,130
Such as ...

359
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,850
Mintra.

360
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,400
I didn't do it.

361
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,450
Why do I have to did this?

362
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,740
Perhaps,

363
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,550
These peoples could do something so stupid,

364
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,280
in finding the way to solve their problems.

365
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,450
Easy please.

366
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,350
It was just the assuming.

367
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,350
Was that bitch Pawin?

368
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,570
Who slandered me?

369
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,330
Oh ..

370
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,940
Win ... have loved miss Suzie so much.

371
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,590
Obeyed and kept following every rules.

372
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,890
Was that you?

373
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,920
Who has slandered me for killing miss Suzie?

374
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,790
If you didn't do anything wrong,

375
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,620
You don't have to be worried. Right?

376
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,400
I didn't worry.

377
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,970
The evidence said,

378
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,970
that who did this.

379
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,250
It's not precise speaking this way.

380
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,800
Only 1 clip.

381
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,360
Cannot concludes anything.

382
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,010
What if Gun is the one who did this?

383
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,150
Zo!

384
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,320
You don't trust me?

385
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,730
I trust you.

386
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,890
But I never trust ...

387
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,450
Everybody,

388
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,750
thought that Gun is the one who did. Isn't it?

389
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,340
I'm sorry.

390
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,190
Not at all.

391
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,740
I will go back to my condo.

392
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,160
Why is that, Gun?

393
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,570
Standing here,

394
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,370
wouldn't get any better.

395
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,770
Don't worry about the reporters.

396
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,710
I can handle myself.

397
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,620
Gun, brother, wait for me.

398
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,720
You don't need to follow him, Pitch.

399
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,310
But ...

400
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,370
Trust me.

401
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
Host, sis'.

402
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,730
What is it?

403
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,210
Uhhh ...

404
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,010
Well ..

405
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,840
If there is anything, just speak.

406
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,290
Umm ... May I ...

407
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,920
go outside?

408
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,890
Why you have to go out?

409
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,640
Miss Suzie is not here.

410
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,020
Doesn't mean that the house rules has discharged.

411
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,510
I know ...

412
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,820
So I'm begging you.

413
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,900
I want to see Gun.

414
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,200
See Gun?

415
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,930
Why you have to see him?

416
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,060
Well ..

417
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,120
As you can see that ..

418
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,150
recently, Gun looks really weird.

419
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,020
Plus, he has been suspected by our house members.

420
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,930
I'm worried for him.

421
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,600
You don't have to.

422
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,300
Gun has grown.

423
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,780
Gun can take care of himself for sure.

424
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,190
Host, sister.

425
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,250
I'm begging you.

426
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,890
Just this time.

427
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,280
I promise.

428
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,310
After this, no matter what's your order.

429
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,910
I will definitely obey without any argument.

430
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,790
Are you sure you can take care of yourself?

431
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,790
I'm sure.

432
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,860
Then promise me,

433
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,150
that when you've arrived you will swiftly take a photo to report me.

434
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,600
Yes.

435
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,490
You have my words.

436
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,210
Then it's fine.

437
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,410
Thank you.

438
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,020
Don't make me have to be worried.

439
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,640
Yes, ma'am.

440
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,800
What the freak are you doing?

441
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,840
Won't you tell anyone?

442
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,050
What are you talking about?

443
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,820
That you idiot drove the car and hit my brother

444
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,890
7 years ago.

445
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,730
Can't you remember?

446
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,420
I'm sorry.

447
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,510
Sorry?

448
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,970
Sorry then Could I recover myself?

449
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,500
You did this to me.

450
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,800
So I became like this.

451
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,790
Because of you idiot.

452
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,300
Because of you only.

453
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,880
YOU !

454
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,260
How did you got here?

455
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,920
You had a nightmare again?

456
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,270
Wayu.

457
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,960
Wayu think that ..

458
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,730
Would there be the criminal among us?

459
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,150
Why you have to ask like that?

460
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,360
Well ..

461
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,380
I don't like the vibes in the house recently.

462
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,610
Everybody keeps suspecting and blaming each other.

463
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,950
I know that in the past,

464
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,170
Everybody hasn't liked each other that much.

465
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,120
But ..

466
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,430
It seemed like we get along well more than this moment.

467
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,880
That's true.

468
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,740
But I think ..

469
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,900
There is no criminal among us.

470
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,940
As Wayha said,

471
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,950
Although,

472
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,270
we haven't like each other that much.

473
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,670
But there's no way that we could hurt each other.

474
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,120
Does TaoKaeNoi seaweed taste good?

475
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,270
It's good.

476
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,580
Then ..

477
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,630
Can I join you?

478
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,550
Wayha?

479
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,080
I have something to ask.

480
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,120
No matter,

481
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,170
It's not the right time to ask but ..

482
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,140
I need to know ..

483
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,040
I need to know that ..

484
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,930
that do we feel the same way?

485
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,720
Yes.

486
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,030
What you do?

487
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,520
I shot to report it to Host.

488
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,080
Don't you afraid?

489
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,790
That I would be the criminal.

490
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,310
I would hurt you, Pitch.

491
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,540
I don't believe that,

492
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,140
you would be the criminal.

493
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,100
Why do you think so?

494
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,050
Because I believe ...

495
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,020
that you are rational.

496
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,650
You wouldn't do such thing.

497
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,970
I'm not that kind of good person.

498
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,100
Maybe I'm not ..

499
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,080
that kind of person you've imagined.

500
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,380
If that so ...

501
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,990
Pitch, would you stay by my side?

502
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,100
In the past,

503
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,310
When I newly entered this industry.

504
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,740
Miss Suzie has set the rules.

505
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,220
Like everyone is following right now.

506
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,190
During that moment,

507
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,740
I did whatever I want.

508
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,800
Never think that who would be in trouble.

509
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,180
But then ..

510
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,400
On the day I was so drunk.

511
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,570
Until I got into an accident.

512
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,160
I made one's life,

513
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,900
has tumbled down.

514
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,740
Then ..

515
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,580
Miss Suzie has managed everything for me.

516
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,680
That incidence,

517
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,330
has engraved in my mind still.

518
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,530
If possible,

519
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,430
I would turn back time,

520
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,920
and fix what I've done it wrong.

521
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,450
As I've known about Sin.

522
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,850
Zo and Sin.

523
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,020
They are just 2 of them alone.

524
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,630
Because their mom died since they were young.

525
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,790
Moreover,

526
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,910
Their father was like ..

527
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,430
Keep busy doing his job.

528
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,840
Never go back home.

529
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,480
After the accident,

530
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,080
Zo now is on his own.

531
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,150
Besides, he needs to take care of Sin too.

532
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,740
I can't say ..

533
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,750
that it's not your false.

534
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,160
But I just need you to know ..

535
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,130
that I will be by your side.

536
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,110
Whenever you have a nightmare,

537
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,370
I want you to know,

538
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,010
when you're awake,

539
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,400
you will see me here.

540
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,800
Thank you.

541
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Pitch.

542
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,300
Tomorrow could you bring me to see Sin once again?

543
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,140
Yes.

544
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,710
Definitely yes.

545
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,360
Sin brother, sawasdee krab.

546
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,330
I'm Pitch.

547
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,250
So this is Gun.

548
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,170
He was here last time do you remember?

549
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,120
Zo~

550
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,199
have you ate something?

551
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,400
I didn't eat with you for too long time.

552
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,480
Mr. Sin

553
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,480
I'm Gun.

554
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,620
I'm the one who drove the car and hit you.

555
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,020
Zo~

556
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:48,770
do you have your homework for me to help you?

557
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,160
I'm terribly sorry.

558
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,400
For making you became like this.

559
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,130
I have no idea.

560
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,330
How to redeem all of these guilts.

561
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,010
I've never known,

562
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,640
who you are,

563
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,180
or are you still alive?

564
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,380
I've never hope that

565
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,330
You would forgive me.

566
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,710
But the reason why I'm here.

567
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,150
I just really really need to say sorry.

568
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,230
For everything you've been through.

569
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,370
No, you don't.

570
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,260
Don't cry.

571
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,420
Being a man,

572
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,240
you have to be strong.

573
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,620
Look.

574
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,140
There are so many peoples.

575
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,920
Don't you shy?

576
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,170
I do apologize Mr. Sin.

577
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,950
The fact that you have to be like this,

578
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,770
It was because of me.

579
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,980
I am terribly sorry from my heart.

580
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,980
Gun, brother.

581
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,350
Pitch.

582
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,760
Can I speak with Zo alone?

583
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,220
Sin, brother.

584
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,880
Have you ate something?

585
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,150
Zo~

586
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,290
do you have your homework for me to help you?

587
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,700
What would you like to speak with me?

588
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,390
7 years ago.

589
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,510
I'm the person who didn't care a thing.

590
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,990
Care only myself.

591
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,270
Having rules,

592
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,680
for breaking.

593
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,270
Then on that day,

594
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,120
I went out for drinking.

595
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,060
The accident happened.

596
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,970
I was the one who drive that car and hit your brother.

597
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,580
Gun, brother.

598
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,550
That day I don't know what to do.

599
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,100
I'm scared.

600
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,690
Scared for everything.

601
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,730
Then Miss Suzie came in to manage everything.

602
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,230
I thought that,

603
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,790
The person I hit has died.

604
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,350
Once I met Sin.

605
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,000
I knew it immediately,

606
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,940
that Sin is that person.

607
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,770
The person that I crashed.

608
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,840
I will never make any excuses.

609
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,480
If there's something,

610
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,590
I could redeem to you.

611
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,360
You can tell me.

612
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,890
You don't have to repay anything.

613
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,200
I believe that ..

614
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,720
Many years ago,

615
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,560
You've bared so much pain just like me.

616
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,840
I was with Sin when I was a kid.

617
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,550
I believe that,

618
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,640
he wouldn't be mad aswell.

619
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,900
Perhaps,

620
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,210
He would blame himself that,

621
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,880
He didn't aware himself.

622
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,180
So he got hit by the car.

623
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,820
Sin is very optimistic since he was young.

624
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,160
When we lost our mom.

625
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,530
Dad kept working.

626
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,220
Didn't care about us at all.

627
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,140
He is the one who soothed me.

628
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,080
That dad would need us to live happily.

629
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,490
And you know what?

630
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,180
Why I have to become an actor?

631
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,780
The one who've dreamt of being an actor is not me myself.

632
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,360
It was Sin instead.

633
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,540
He tried so hard.

634
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,230
Casted too many jobs.

635
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,250
Could be 10 jobs as I can remember.

636
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,830
Eventually,

637
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,820
He already became an actor.

638
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,930
Unfortunately,

639
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,230
he got into the accident.

640
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,770
I'm here to carry on his dream.

641
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,100
I wanted to live the rest of his life.

642
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,930
Someday, if he could recover,

643
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,830
I can tell him that,

644
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,120
how is the life he has ever dreamt of.

645
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,690
I am sorry.

646
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,050
Everything was my guilt.

647
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,560
I'm sorry.

648
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,130
You don't need to say sorry to me.

649
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,950
These days me and Sin are very happy now.

650
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,480
Gun, brother, please stand up.

651
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,990
Wait,

652
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,700
I need to bring Sin back to the room.

653
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,150
You and Pitch can go back first.

654
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,820
Having a conversation,

655
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,840
You feel better?

656
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,150
Umm.

657
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,090
Thank you.

658
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,640
For bringing me here.

659
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,520
After this,

660
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,360
I will turn myself in.

661
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,380
Turn in?

662
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,550
I will wait until Miss Suzie's case has done.

663
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,630
I will turn myself in.

664
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,580
A criminal,

665
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,020
should be punished.

666
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,110
Miss Suzie's case,

667
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,600
You are suspecting too right?

668
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,070
That is was not an accident.

669
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,320
I'm not quite sure yet.

670
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,760
Shall we go seek the truth.

671
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,850
Why do you come back?

672
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,160
I agree.

673
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,780
Did you said you would go back to your condo?

674
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,240
Why do you come back here then?

675
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,420
I've thought it through,

676
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,950
I didn't do anything wrong.

677
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,940
Why I have to escape?

678
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,350
Because you're really suspicious.

679
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,980
Or ..

680
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,820
Shall we separate Gun from us to another room?

681
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,920
Shouldn't we?

682
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,280
No need to.

683
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,350
We just need to force him to speak the truth. That's all.

684
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,110
What is he hiding from us.

685
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,290
The fact that Gun had a fight with Miss Suzie,

686
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,650
It was not what you are thinking.

687
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,410
It's okay, Pitch.

688
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,840
Well then,

689
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,650
Let's speak all of the truth.

690
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,050
I believe that everyone in this house,

691
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,940
also have your secret.

692
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,800
Don't we?

693
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,350
Enough alright?

694
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,860
I think we should stop blaming each otoher.

695
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,580
Doing this,

696
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,850
It's getting worse.

697
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,500
Actually,

698
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,390
Does this house have CCTVs?

699
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,030
We can go check it now.

700
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,520
If there is one,

701
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,670
now,

702
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,940
The policemen had taken all of it.

703
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,450
No, it's not.

704
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,270
Even us, we just notice that.

705
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,540
Then the policemen,

706
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,460
How would they know that we have the CCTVs here.

707
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,560
What have you known?

708
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,890
Should be that room !

709
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,370
The room that ..

710
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,280
no one could ever enter.

711
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,280
There must be something.

712
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
Umm.

713
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,800
The more you talk, the more it's suspicious.

714
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,320
There's nothing in there.

715
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,350
Just a storage.

716
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,930
You guys don't need to see.

717
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,210
If it is really the storage,

718
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,170
Why can we come in and check?

719
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,950
Bring all of us here to take a look.

720
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,630
Everyone has a right to see it.

721
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,880
Host, sister.

722
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,670
The fact that you wouldn't allow us to come in,

723
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,510
or actually,

724
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,780
That room has some ...

725
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,940
No!

726
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,430
I told you can't. So you can't.

727
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,080
Never saw someone came out from here.

728
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:14,170
Then ... where is the secret room located.
Host: Everybody, make way.

729
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,060
Host?

730
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,760
I will handle this.

731
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,960
We've come this far.

732
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,490
Keep hiding,

733
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,410
nothing is getting better.

734
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,950
Have you ever wondered?

735
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,500
Why I hate you so much?

736
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,600
I will go CAST !?!?!
Zo: Sin ?!?!

737
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:51,480
I have to go, I have to go for the casting, Zo !!

738
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,300
The fact that I've summoned all of you here.

739
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,300
Because I have to inform you that,

740
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,330
I will continue Miss Suzie's intention.

741
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:00,010
About Lalit,

742
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,820
You will not stay in this house,

743
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,330
as the actress.

744
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,750
You should stop overthinking about that case.

745
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,270
Now there's something else, you need to take more attention.

746
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,210
The hero's script of this movie.

747
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:48,450
