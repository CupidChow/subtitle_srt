Aren't you here because of the money?

6

Aren't you the one who laid down in the exhibition room, causing a riot,

7
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,940
and followed me to the hotel, scared that I would run away in the night without paying you?!

8

Also, coming here the first thing in the morning and pretending to care about me,

Tell me if I am wrong?

12

You know me well. Of course, it's for money. What else would it be?

13

You have many people to who you owe money.

You're a lot more valuable than you think.

- I mean... would a reporter make up something false?

He must have investigated it all before writing it.

I don't think it's Director Jang Tae Jin.

Oh, it's the guy who dropped her off in front of the museum!

32

Don't say things like that about someone who just experienced hardship.

Also, even if she was in a hurry, she's the director of Cheongsong Art Museum.

37
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,660
How could she go to a motel? Not even a hotel...

38

- Curator Song.

Yes.

41

The banner and poster drafts for this exhibition have come out, haven't they?

42
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,730
Yes, but they still need some modifications.

43

- I'll send the emails myself.

Because... of the news from today...

53
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,180
I think they're going to ask more about your personal life than about the art exhibition.

54
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,860
Why don't you hold the conference after things have calmed down─

55

- That's why I'm doing it.
- What?

56

It's sensational enough as well.

61

Did she hear what I said about being in a hurry?

62

You remember how much I liked the museum at this hour, right?

69
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,070
You said that even art pieces are most brilliant at this hour after they've had plenty of sleep.

Should I blacklist that reporter?

I can make it so the guy who made you this way gets caught and never sees the light of day again. Just say the word.

Can you... really do all those things?

- Do they seem like empty words?
- No.

I think you can really do them. It makes you look incredible and like a stranger.

As long as there are no issues during the exhibition, it'll only be a matter of time for word to spread.

158
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,670
The content is just so good for it not to.

159
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,100
Curator Song, what are you doing here?

160
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,950
We're so busy with all the art pieces coming in.

161
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,750
I was just about to go right now.

162
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,450
Director, you got this!

163
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,730
Let's go.

164
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,320
Am I not even allowed to do my job as a reporter without fear of getting sued?

165
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,010
What?

166
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,880
Okay. I'll head in after I take care of the situation.

167
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,690
Kim Si Hyung, you need to get your head on straight.

168
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,300
You can't underestimate that woman.

169
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,440
What? That was just blind luck. It's because she's lucky.

170
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,120
Reporter Song.

171
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,740
You haven't left yet?

172
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,910
I think you have something to tell me.

173
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,750
Isn't it enough that you used reporters to promote your exhibition? Now you want an apology, too?

174
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,190
Thanks to my article, you saved on marketing costs, so let's say that was me correcting the article and call it even.

175
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,530
Let's not go through the headache of pressing charges.

176
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,710
Come visit once the exhibition opens. I'll show you around.

177
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,130
Sure.

178
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,770
Excuse me.

179
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,580
Let's call it even, okay? No pressing charges.

180
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,260
Of course, don't worry. By the way...

181
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,260
next time you write an article, contact me directly.

182
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,060
So that you're not put in an awkward situation again because of a bad news source.

183
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,890
Okay, I'll do that.

184
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,830
That little...!

185
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:19,450
Director. Director, have you seen this?

186
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,720
What is it?

187
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,000
There's a huge commotion. "Kim Dali's necklace,"

188
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,650
"Kim Dali's dress," "Kim Dali's ring."

189
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,440
The internet is full of articles about Kim Dali.

190
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,190
Thanks to you, the exhibition is being promoted very well, too.

191
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,220
What's wrong with people?

192
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,390
How can they see a photo of a woman who got mugged

193
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,930
and care about her clothes and earrings? Psychopaths...

194
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,780
Was it not your idea?

195
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,220
What?

196
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,420
I mean, I heard you went to the art museum this morning.

197
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,830
It's no small feat to change public opinion in a matter of hours.

198
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,390
It requires skill,

199
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,380
so who else would come up with something like this, if not you? They'll have to be blinded by greed like you

200
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,800
to think this up.

201
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,430
Do I seem like that much of human garbage to you?

202
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,430
Someone who pushes an injured woman in front of the camera for gain.

203
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,630
Ah, I apologize if that's how it came off.

204
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,330
What I meant was, it was that desperate of a situation.

205
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,930
Both for you and Kim Dali.

206
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,420
All right. You can go now.

207
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,780
But...

208
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,260
Yes?

209
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,080
Doesn't it seem a little weird?

210
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,500
The article from this morning.

211
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,730
Isn't it a little too early for an article judging her ability as the new director?

212
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,300
In that time she held a funeral, disposed of her property,

213
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,800
and took office as the director, she probably didn't even have time to breathe.

214
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,260
The same goes for the banks and business partners.

215
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,570
Her financial situation was fine, and she had good credit too when I loaned her the two billion won.

216
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,700
What's strange to me also is

217
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,940
there were a lot of rumors going around saying the museum is an empty shell,

218
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,770
that they owed money to a lot of people, or that it was going to be sold off.

219
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,290
But once I looked into it, there wasn't any big change regarding their financial situation.

220
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:23,060
Considering it's privately owned, Cheongsong Art Museum still had quite a bit of money.

221
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,510
But as soon as Director Kim Nak Chun passed away,

222
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,310
the banks and business partners took a 180-degree turn in their attitudes.

223
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,380
As if they had it all planned out.

224
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,720
Even though all the companies did business with Cheongsong for 10, 20 years.

225
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,620
Is someone playing a game behind the scenes?

226
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,200
Assemblyman.

227
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,970
Hello, sir. Please come in.

228
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,690
This way.

229
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:51,760
There are a lot of downfalls in being a politician.

230
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,160
Whether it be eating a meal, I have to do it in secret like this.

231
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,660
Or if I want to say one thing,

232
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,680
I have to look to see if anyone is eavesdropping.

233
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,670
You're right.

234
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,560
Why should the moral standards be different for politicians and regular citizens?

235
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,570
Strictly speaking, this is discrimination, too.

236
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,200
Our country still has a long way to go.

237
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,830
A very long way to go.

238
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,770
I was wondering, when will the greenbelt restriction be removed?

239
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,940
What are you talking about, young man? Greenbelt? What is that?

240
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:39,760
Me, Ahn Sang Tae! A man of the highest integrity. The only belt I know is this leather belt I'm wearing.

241
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
How dare you try to frame me?

242
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,800
My apologies. It was my mistake.

243
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,410
Please, forgive me.

244
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,020
I'm sorry.

245
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,070
I've only sold gamjatang before, so there's still a lot I don't know about in the construction industry.

246
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,490
Please consider me as a child taking baby steps and forgive me.

247
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,890
Is there anything different about construction?

248
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:32,790
A soldier, about to go to war, only needs to pack a lot of bullets.

249
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,410
You can't be someone of low caliber if you're going to do something big.

250
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:45,860
Do you understand... what I'm saying?

251
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,130
Of course, Sir.

252
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,180
- Here.
- It's an honor.

253
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,660
This is Ahn Sang Tae, who works hard 365 days in good condition.

254
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,380
Oh, Sir! Is everything running smoothly in your district?

255
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:19,030
Ah, yes! Of course, yes.

256
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,020
What the hell happened?

257
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,560
It's been a chaotic mess all day.

258
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,120
Will the art museum close down at this rate?

259
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,030
Tell me about it. It's driving me crazy, too.

260
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,300
What about the thing?

261
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,800
I think the old man must have gotten rid of it.

262
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,740
Nothing will probably happen. It's not like it has anyone's name on it.

263
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,210
The heavens helped us once. Do you think they'll help us again?

264
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,440
What are you going to do if the police get a hold of it?

265
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,570
If it's revealed to the world, it's over for you.

266
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,640
Don't forget that.

267
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,620
What did you say? Are you kidding me?

268
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,530
Do you think I'm going to go down alone? I'm not afraid of anything now.

269
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:20,380
How dare you try to pin everything on me when you're the ones who planned it all?

270
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,750
So you just have to find it.

271
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,320
A gentleman like yourself shouldn't get so worked up.

272
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,090
Let's find a way.

273
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,100
Whatever. We just have to get that bitch to give up on the art museum.

274
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,970
Right?

275
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,520
Welcome back. Please eat.

276
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,360
What? Double?

277
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,030
Double or triple... What's the big deal?

278
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,810
We'll be in a pile of cash once development starts.

279
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:15,200
It's not easy to join at the last minute.

280
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,010
- Isn't that right, Ki Chul?
- Oh, yes, definitely.

281
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,080
Nobody really knows about it because it's all being done in secret,

282
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,010
but the scale is bigger than I expected.

283
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:33,530
Invest that much money without telling Moo Hak? That's impossible.

284
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,270
- Ask Moo Hak and if he says it's okay─
- Are you serious?

285
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,930
Is Moo Hak the chairman of Dondon F&B?

286
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,970
Why would you ask Moo Hak about a construction deal when all he knows is how to make gamjatang?

287
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,560
Only someone as smart as Ki Chul could've come up with a plan to expand the business.

288
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,000
Have you lost your mind, woman?

289
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,140
That's why I said we should introduce Ki Chul to Ahn Sang Tae's daughter.

290
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,410
Instead, you chose to send that ignorant kid and got rejected!

291
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,740
- What?
- Am I wrong?

292
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,750
If things worked out back then and we became in-laws with Assemblyman Ahn,

293
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:08,180
things wouldn't have been this difficult. Everything would've worked out smooth as butter!

294
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,260
- Listen, Moo Hak didn't get rejected─
- I don't want to hear it!

295
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,460
If you don't back Ki Chul up again this time, I'm going to divorce you and take half your money!

296
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,400
I'm going to do everything to back Ki Chul up with the money I get from you!

297
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,090
What are you talking about?

298
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,980
Back him up?

299
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,570
What did you do now...

300
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:43,710
Bath... I meant bath... That I was going to bathe him...

301
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,840
You little punk! Why won't you bathe yourself when you're a fully grown man?

302
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,920
- Go and wash up, immediately!
- Bathe? Yes, bathe!

303
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,820
Ah, yes. I have to bathe myself. Bathe, bathe...

304
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,010
Anyway, what brings you here?

305
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,690
Oh... last time you said,

306
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,070
"There are a lot of people targeting Cheongsong."

307
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,940
What did you hear and from who did you hear it from?

308
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,680
All right.

309
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,400
This looks so good.

310
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,650

It doesn't even cost money. That's not hard to do.

468
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,430
- What?
- Huh?

469
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,560
Director, there is a big problem.

470
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,450
I think you need to come with me quickly.

471
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,290
No.

472
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,150
Where did it go?

473
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,510
My goodness.

474
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,830
It can't even be recycled! Who the hell took all that?

475
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,880
My goodness! This is driving me crazy.

476
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,670
It's so strange.

477
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,570
Did you find it? No?

478
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,860
It's not there? It's not there?

479
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,850
How can somebody take just the Hong Ja Young artist's work?

480
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,210
And just the "The Living and The Dead" series?

481
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,490
That's the most famous piece here. It got a prize in the Biennale.

482
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:16,430
Is there any chance it's in the basement or supply room?

483
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,910
No, I checked there.

484
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,250
It's such a famous one, so nobody can even sell it. Who would take that?

485
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,840
I think it had to have been done by somebody in this industry.

486
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,100
Somebody did it on purpose to ruin our show!

487
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,860
- Gong Joo.
- Yes?

488
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,710
What did the security company say? You called them earlier.

489
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,110
They said there were no particular signs of anything.

490
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:40,680
They went on patrol as usual and didn't see anything suspicious.

491
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,450
What should we do? The artist will arrive soon.

492
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,780
You're doing great, doing a great job.

493
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,790
The museum is running very well!

494
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:02,580
You were all bragging about doing art, when did things go so wrong?

495
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,970
Is that how you take care of your artwork?

496
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,080
You said everyone in this show is a famous artist.

497
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,400
You said it's an art that an outsider like me wouldn't even understand.

498
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,270
You said it's an art piece that can't be converted into money!

499
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,230
Even our youngest kitchen assistant who cooks gamjatang takes better care of ingredients.

500
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,910
They check the expiration date every hour

501
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:35,310
and make sure multiple times that the cold storage is locked properly!

502
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,870
Are you still professionals after this?

503
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:41,360
How can you say you are worthy of your paychecks!

504
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,410
Excuse me.

505
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,910
How about if we check the CCTV?

506
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,310
I just finished repairing it.

507
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,930
What the─ !

508
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,950
Please don't step on it!

509
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,690
♫ Love is a rebellious bird ♫

510
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:40,350
♫ That no one can tame ♫

511
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:44,390
♫ And if you call for it, it'll be quite in vain ♫

512
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:48,580
♫ For it's in its nature to say no ♫

513
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:52,150
♫ Nothing, nothing, nothing ♫

514
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,890
What is it?

515
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:29,390
This is it! This is it!

516
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:43,160
I was trying to help since the museum was so dirty─

517
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,680
I mean, what kind of museum will leave trash in the exhibition hall?

518
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,870
Couldn't you think about it for a second?

519
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,640
No matter how one looks at it, this is just garbage!

520
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,670
Ask anyone walking the street if this is garbage or art.

521
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,500
Am I the only weird one? Are my eyes the only rotten ones?

522
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,200
Mister, you know what I mean. Right?

523
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,240
Tell me. Does this look like art to you as well?

524
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,350
No, that's not it.

525
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:19,790
Why can't you say that garbage is garbage?

526
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,460
What did you say about the Biennale prize-winning piece?

527
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,010
Garbage?

528
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,130
Why are you bringing up Vienna sausage right now?

529
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:29,910
Wow, you are incredible. And frustrating.

530
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,750
This is called an object! An object!

531
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,950
You don't know what conceptual art is?

532
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,990
Haven't you heard about Junk Art!

533
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,100
If you are ignorant, you should just not do anything. Just because you have some money...

534
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,120
You're so annoying!

535
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,130
Curator Song.

536
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:48,800
I don't know about anything else, but I can't tolerate people who mock art.

537
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,960
How did he get tied up with our Cheongsong!

538
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,070
- Calm down, calm down.
- Hold this for me.

539
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,550
Wow, you guys are saying a load of crap like crazy.

540
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,110
- What?
- Mr. Jin!

541
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:05,660
Art is something like this?

542
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,860
This is art?

543
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,870
If I knew art was this simple, I shouldn't be cooking gamjatang,

544
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:15,210
but I should have started art from the beginning.

545
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,460
No.

546
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:22,050
No. Now that I'm thinking about it, I was doing art while I didn't even know about it.

547
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,470
Come to my house. We have a lot of this.

548
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:29,520
Ripped clothes. Worn-out sneakers. Eaten piece of bone.

549
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,030
Should I make something for you now?

550
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,310
You saw this, right? It's art.

551
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,640
Should I make it again for you?

552
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,640
Should I bring a tissue after I wipe my ass?

553
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,220
Why? Shit won't work?

554
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,710
Please stop...

555
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,250
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

556
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,820
Something happened that shouldn't have happened due to my negligence.

557
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:02,880
I will do whatever I can about this situation─

558
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:06,350
What's going on?

559
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:07,880
Don't touch.

560
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,490
Yes.

561
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,930
I heard that Cheongsong has gone downhill, but I guess that's true.

562
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:40,750
Did you say it's garbage?

563
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,180
Ma'am.

564
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,170
Artist Hong.

565
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,950
Artist Hong!

566
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:00,200
Please. Please, don't be angry.

567
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,620
How... How can I apologize to you?

568
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:07,950
I know, no words will make you feel better, but please think about your relationship with us, Cheongsong─

569
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:10,540
- Miss Kim Dali.
- Yes.

570
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,950
I really liked your father.

571
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:17,910
He held my first exhibition here at Cheongsong.

572
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:22,420
And your father was the person who first introduced my work overseas.

573
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,340
Even if it weren't for those personal relations,

574
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:30,730
anybody in this country who's making their living as an artist,

575
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,560
everybody got helped by your father.

576
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,610
That's why even though the show got delayed more than a month,

577
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,100
everybody waited without saying anything.

578
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,980
I know very well.

579
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,750
Yes!

580
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,310
Once you open an exhibition, there are always changes.

581
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:52,070
But... isn't this really going too far?

582
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:58,640
What? An eaten bone? Ass-wiped tissue?

583
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,900
I really feel like

584
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:09,000
I got all the insults I'll get for the rest of my life at once today!

585
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:12,300
Don't say anything! Don't say anything!

586
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:17,550
The artwork, which is like my blood. My artwork, which is more precious than my life.

587
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:21,220
Pack it up exactly like how I sent it yesterday!

588
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:27,290
If any of the objects are different, this exhibition won't happen!

589
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:28,240
Artist Hong!

590
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,230
Don't do this!

591
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,960
Artist Hong! Artist Hong!

592
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,140
Artist Hong! Wait, Artist Hong!

593
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,430
Please, wait!

594
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,400
Artist Hong, I'm so sorry.

595
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,620
No.

596
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,700
Artist Hong!

597
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,800
- Please, forgive us.
- Don't leave like this!

598
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,260
Please, Ma'am!

599
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,900
Please forgive us, Cheongsong!

600
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,570
Artist Hong!

601
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,640
Artist Hong!

602
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:05,230
[Century]

603
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:09,000
Century Department Store got a lot of benefit from Miss Kim Dali.

604
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,280
Some people said we should hire her as a jewelry model.

605
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,780
That can't happen.

606
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,620
Of course.

607
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,840
Also, about the private moneylender, I mentioned to you before.

608
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,320
He wasn't a private moneylender,

609
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,540
but he's a director of a big food franchise called Dondon F&B.

610
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,050
I heard that he's practically the CEO.

611
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,200
Dondon F&B?

612
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,210
It's a company that's famous for gamjatang,

613
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:39,240
but they have recently grown rapidly and expanded their business.

614
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:48,530
By the way, don't put any ads in Jaeil Newspaper for the time being.

615
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,310
I'm sorry?

616
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:53,320
They harassed Dali, and they can't get away with just a correction.

617
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,470
I heard that Reporter Song, who wrote that article, is connected with Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae.

618
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:01,260
- Wouldn't that be an issue?
- Do I have to care about that?

619
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,900
Wait! You can't do this!

620
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,510
I'm sorry. She was so stubborn, so I couldn't stop her.

621
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,830
I'm Ahn Chak Hee from Gallery Mond.

622
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,550
She's the daughter of Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae.

623
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:24,870
Secretary Hong, please bring some tea for her,

624
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,240
and all of you can go back to your work.

625
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,290
Please have a seat.

626
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:40,790
I'm sorry. If I wanted to see you, I had to use my one and only ability.

627
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:42,500
Only ability?

628
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,340
People say being born to good parents is also your ability.

629
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,140
Nobody blocks my way when I tell them I'm an assemblyman's daughter.

630
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,510
It means none of your employees did anything wrong.

631
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:56,410
You're brave and thoughtful.

632
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,160
What brings you here?

633
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,700
I want to know why you suddenly terminated the contract when there was time still left in the contract.

634
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:09,360
I want to know if it's our gallery's fault, or you and my father's relationship went wrong.

635
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,240
Why do you keep talking about your father when you're talking about your work?

636
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,200
The reason you signed the contract with our gallery in the first place was because of my father.

637
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,630
Who said that?

638
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,170
- It's─
- What you just said...

639
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,330
Is your name Chak Hee?

640
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:28,490
Do you know how much you put him in danger, the person you said is your only ability?

641
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,950
I wanted to make a change since it's the anniversary of our foundation. The gallery has done nothing wrong.

642
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:38,100
Moreover, Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae has absolutely nothing to do with this.

643
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,980
Is that good?

644
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:44,920
If you say so, then that must be it.

645
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,010
If you don't mind, can I ask who you're going to contract with next?

646
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,870
I think our conversation is over.

647
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,310
By any chance, is it with Cheongsong?

648
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,880
I'm not sure. Why?

649
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,840
It's Miss Kim Dali, right?

650
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,740
No, I mean, well─

651
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:11,550
All the jewelry that Miss Kim Dali wore at that recent press conference is from Century's brand.

652
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:15,260
Are you two getting back together?

653
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,870
Oh, that's why!

654
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:19,950
No, it's not like that yet.

655
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,610
Why? Is she not really showing any sign?

656
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,860
No, it's more like─

657
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:31,560
That's weird! That's definitely a green light.

658
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,690
Green light?

659
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:36,000
Even though I don't know much when it comes to dating, I know it very well.

660
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,410
When women aren't interested in men, they don't even pee─

661
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,780
I mean, don't even turn their head.

662
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:46,950
So it's a huge green light that Kim Dali wore Century's jewelry!

663
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,150
Green light.

664
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:52,960
Yes!

665
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,470
So don't give up and go for it! Please!

666
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:59,730
Women like the guys who keep trying hard.

667
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:06,320
Why do I feel that this support is not for me, but for you?

668
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,260
Why does it matter who it's for?

669
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:12,460
As long as you and I both get who we love.

670
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,490
Fighting!

671
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,220
Green light.

672
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:44,490
The person you're trying to reach is not available.

673
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,260
Is she not picking up?

674
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,200
That artist has a temper.

675
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,550
Just leave her alone. If she doesn't do the exhibition, it's her loss.

676
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,010
Who wants to see garbage?

677
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,170
- Mr. Jin.
- Yes?

678
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:22,790
You said people know who's truly on your side when you hit rock bottom.

679
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:27,010
While I was going through a lot after my father passed away,

680
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:31,870
I thought this would be rock bottom, this would be it.

681
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,990
But I guess I didn't hit rock bottom yet.

682
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:39,260
I can't tell who's really on my side.

683
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,590
Mr. Jin, you told me this before.

684
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:47,440
You have to have something to get from you to call you a friend or relative.

685
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,780
If you look like you're going to make me lose mine, then nobody's going to be next to you.

686
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,330
That's how the world works.

687
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,600
What you said was very comforting to me.

688
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:05,330
Because the world is like that, but you stayed next to me.

689
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:11,180
Honestly, even if you're a debt collector or whatever,

690
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:16,390
you were the only person who said you wanted to save the museum.

691
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:26,300
But now I really don't know,

692
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:29,320
if you're on my side or not.

693
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,870
No, I mean...

694
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:37,730
Earlier I did that because I didn't know...

695
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:41,100
Hello?

696
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:04,030
Why don't you get in the car? I'll drop you off on my way.

697
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,000
I'm okay.

698
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:11,240
Just get in. There are cars behind me.

699
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:21,620
Then, thank you for your kindness.

700
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:27,550
You don't have to say that. Where are you going?

701
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:30,490
Please go to the Nambu Police Station.

702
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,220
Thank you.

703
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:10,910
I'll take care of the situation in the museum, so don't worry about it.

704
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,110
Why is she worried about me?

705
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:25,900
I said I didn't do it!

706
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,740
- It's not me!
- Be quiet!

707
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,440
You call yourself police? Do you have evidence?

708
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,120
How dare you do this to me!

709
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,140
Sit down, you jerk!

710
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,710
Is it okay for the police to do this? Without any evidence?

711
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,500
Hey, be quiet!

712
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,170
Where do you think you are! Don't play innocent!

713
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:52,450
- Hey!
- What's going on?

714
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:54,600
Hey! Hey!

715
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,670
You bastard!

716
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,190
- Let me go!
- Please, calm down!

717
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,520
Wow, you're going to hit me!

718
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,150
Hey, what?

719
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:03,340
Yes, why don't you hit me

720
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,520
and let me get some compensation money?

721
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:11,460
Whoever that woman is, the one who reported me, I'm going to kill her if I get her─ !

722
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:21,260
Say it again. What did you just say?

723
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,330
What did you say?

724
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:24,060
Mr. Jin! No!

725
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,970
Please don't do it.

726
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:33,650
I should've killed her at that time.

727
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:52,000
♫ Come close to me ♫

728

♫ Stay by my side with love ♫

730
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:14,600

[Dali and Cocky Prince]
~ Preview ~

734
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:34,050
She grew up her entire life in books and arts.

735
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,260
You're saying a load of bullshit!

736
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:38,770
Kim Dali. She's not that dumb person like you think.

737
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:39,720
You have something on your face.

738
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,380
- "My Won Tak?"
- Look at me!

739
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:43,590
It keeps bothering me.

740
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:48,480
If you care too much, it's not a favor, but you have a purpose.

741
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,650
I know everything you said is right, Mr. Jin.

742
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:54,810
I'm here to get rid of the shit.

743
01:02:54,810 --> 01:03:00,170
It's because I want to see you happy.
