[Episode 10: Do you know how to distinguish dogs from wolves at sunset?]

2
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,930
Dondon F&B is

3
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,870
randomly buying plots of land around the art museum.

4
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,940
Did you know?

5
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,050
What?

6
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,130
After your father passed away,

7
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,160
regardless of location or price, they are buying everything they can.

8
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,010
Recently, there have been rumors that they're taking over a construction company, too.

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,470
You're not going to go in?

10
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,080
- Where?
- The art museum director is here.

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,570
You know... with that pretentious bastard.

12
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,500
Oh, that Century, the Century guy.

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,060
I saw them for a bit when I went to give them food earlier,

14
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,920
but the atmosphere was no joke.

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,980
That man took care of

16
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,300
the director's chopsticks, spoon, and what not.

17
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,710
He took very good care of her.

18
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,210
I guess things are going well between them again.

19
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,790
- Don't you think so?
- Do your work!

20
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,650
- Yes. Okay.
- I said do your work.

21
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,960
You...

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,190
think that because you treat people with good intentions,

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,040
other people will also treat you with good intentions, don't you?

24
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,590
How much do you know about that man, Jin Moo Hak?

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,740
Is he someone you can trust?

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,470
Is he...

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
a good person?

28
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,070
The fried rice is here.

29
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,950
[Episode 10]

30
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,660
You should have told me earlier. I would have done more for you.

31
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,320
After all, at Dondon Gamjatang we always

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,090
provide the best service to all our customers.

33
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,110
Seems like you even work here personally in the restaurant.

34
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,690
It is hard to make time for this.

35
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,170
But I try to work here at least once a month.

36
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,960
That's how I hear what's going on in the store and remember where it all started.

37
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,740
Remembering where it all started...

38
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,720
That's admirable.

39
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,230
As expected, there is a place for everyone that suits them.

40
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,910
Right?

41
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,630
Thank you.

42
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,590
It's the best compliment to say that the way someone runs their business suits that person running a business.

43
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,780
This fried rice is the signature dish of our restaurant.

44
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,210
If you eat it once...

45
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,730
After eating all this meat and rice, you want us to have fried rice, too?

46
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,270
It's a very vulgar and lowly arrangement.

47
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,000
Oppa!

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,700
What kind of meat are you using that requires a sauce to dip into even after all this strong seasoning?

49
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,740
People are like that, too.

50
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,860
When a person has many things to hide, then their words and behavior become loud and extravagant.

51
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,350
Oppa, what are you saying? Stop it.

52
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,460
I just wanted to say that the food matches the owner a lot.

53
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,880
Even if you cover yourself from head to toe in luxury goods,

54
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,320
you can't hide where you come from.

55
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,680
Because whether it's people or food,

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,290
- what's important is the essence.
- I said, stop it.

57
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,580
I am sorry, Mr. Jin.

58
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,650
You don't have to be sorry.

59
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,330
Please taste it.

60
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,430
It might seem like it's lacking in terms of the arrangement,

61
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,020
but it is still the most popular dish among our customers.

62
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,230
And...

63
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,020
Mr. Jang Tae Jin, you must know since you are also a businessman like me,

64
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,950
the customers' standards these days are no joke.

65
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,810
You can't fool their taste buds just by using small tricks and without the best ingredients.

66
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,730
The seasoning and sauce are only helping to elevate the flavor.

67
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,530
As you said, the essence is more important.

68
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,230
Please rest assured and enjoy.

69
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,460
I heard that you're expanding your business to construction.

70
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,800
I also heard that you're buying a lot of land around the art museum.

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,510
Is that why you turned down my offer

72
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,170
to repay the two billion won?

73
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,670
I don't think this is the kind of conversation a customer and the owner of a restaurant should be having.

74
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,710
- Please enjoy the rest of your meal.
- We're done.

75
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,520
[One million won]

76
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,740
I think this will be enough to pay for this meal.

77
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,270
Don't try to avoid my offer while showing off your shallow work ethic.

78
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,090
Try to make an excuse at least, Jin Moo Hak.

79
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,980
Geez.

80
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,440
I usually don't like to become enemies with customers who tip very well.

81
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,500
I'm sure I clearly told you the last time,

82
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,660
but I'll tell you once more because your memory seems to be bad.

83
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,480
Stop interfering in the issues between Kim Dali and me.

84
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,490
Since when did a big company like Century have an interest in a tiny company?

85
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,230
How is it any of your business whether we buy land or a building?

86
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:11,800
Also, how did you know about the construction company's deal which wasn't even reported to me yet?

87
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,980
What will you do if it's true?

88
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,430
What does that have to do with you?

89
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,980
What is the reason for you to talk about something like that here?

90
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,660
You could say it's a warning.

91
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,710
A warning?

92
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,860
I don't know what idea you might be picturing

93
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,320
with only putting two billion won in the museum but forget about it.

94
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,520
It will never go according to your plans.

95
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,720
What can I picture with two billion won?

96
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,470
Whether I was painting with watercolors,

97
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,910
a portrait,

98
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,590
or the wall with shit!

99
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,380
I will do it, so you should just live your life!

100
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,040
And stop chasing after the woman you broke up with!

101
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,770
You bastard!

102
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,320
Oppa, stop it. Mr. Jin, you also stop.

103
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,580
Unless you want to go bankrupt,

104
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,980
it'll be better for you to get out of this business while I'm offering to pay a little more interest.

105
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,680
Do you understand?

106
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,630
That suddenly makes me interested in it.

107
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,710
I didn't really have any interest.

108
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,570
But if you're getting excited,

109
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,070
it seems like there is something for real.

110
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,820
And... you have to

111
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,900
pay at the counter.

112
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,420
Don't forget to take your change.

113
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,900
I don't know if I didn't know you at all or if you've changed.

114
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,330
Did you really have to go this far?

115
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,690
Can you still say that after seeing this with your own eyes?

116
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,410
Don't you know what he's planning?

117
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,470
He will act as if he's a good person, and then he'll target the art museum when it's suffering the most.

118
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,160
He'll use the act that he's the creditor, create a lawsuit, and put the museum on auction.

119
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,780
And then he'll buy the museum at a dirt-cheap price.

120
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,550
I'm telling you that the construction company and buying the land around the art museum is all for this in the end!

121
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,520
No way. That's impossible.

122
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,940
That's why you shouldn't trust just anyone because it's urgent.

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,400
Why did you come when we're about to sleep and start talking nonsense?

162
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,410
I'm asking what's this I'm hearing about taking over a construction company?

163
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,510
What do you mean by taking over a co-co-construction company?

164
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,050
So it must be true.

165
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,380
But where did you hear that? This was top secret!

166
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,580
- Father!
- Gosh, my eardrums!

167
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,290
It's not like you committed a crime.

168
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,540
Yes. We decided to take over a construction company.

169
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,500
How long do you plan on remaining a small business?

170
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,090
My Ki Chul put in a lot of effort for the future of Dondon.

171
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,120
- Do you think that anyone can do construction?
- What?

172
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,560
I'm saying, do you think all you have to do is put up a sign?

173
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,920
Construction isn't a business, it's politics. Politics!

174
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,980
You need local influence on your side and build political connections.

175
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,430
It requires a lot of strategies!

176
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,530
That is why I am making connections!

177
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:04,130
Do you think I am meeting all those people because I have nothing else to do?

178
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,290
I also have my own ideas and plans!

179
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,600
Of course.

180
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,330
Do you think that Ki Chul, who's a college graduate, would be any less than you?

181
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,690
That's right, Moo Hak. I looked into everything too and this deal's a sure deal.

182
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,830
These are trustworthy connections and information. So, you don't have to worry so much.

183
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,170
Is that why you were buying land around the art museum behind my back?

184
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,980
Is that what Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae told you to do?

185
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,330
Since when did I get excluded from Dondon's decision-making?

186
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,190
This damn company's security maintenance is no good...

187
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,410
I am telling you clearly, I have no interest in land.

188
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,040
I'm thinking of taking my hands off the art museum once I get back the two billion won.

189
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,220
Which is why...! You better forget about this construction nonsense.

190
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:57,100
If you do something like this once more, without me knowing, I really won't see you again, Father.

191
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
It's not an empty threat.

192
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,430
The greenbelt ban is about to be removed, you punk!

193
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,930
They said the announcement will be made within this month.

194
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,400
It has already been decided, they just haven't announced it yet.

195
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:21,020
Everything's ready now! You don't even know anything.

196
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,630
You... You're doing this because of the art museum girl, aren't you?

197
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,290
Just think that only the order has been changed.

198
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,850
Think about Dondon becoming a top 100 or top 50 company!

199
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,970
You think she'll reject you because we ruined her art museum then?

200
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,400
Did someone say they were going to turn us into a top 100 or top 50 company?

201
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,700
You think something like this is possible by just grilling an assemblyman?

202
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,900
We have more higher-ups, of course!

203
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,590
We're about to build a new city once the ban on redevelopment is lifted. What power would one assemblyman have?

204
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:15,320
From what I see... Ahn Sang Tae is just an errand boy, too.

205
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,090
Who's that higher-up?

206
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,780
That's what I don't know.

207
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:26,470
It seems like that punk, Ki Chul knows something... but he won't talk.

208
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,900
I looked into the land register because I had a hunch.

209
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,710
You know the VIP guests who came to the opening party?

210
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,010
I saw a lot of their names.

211

You're late.

00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,220
Did you wait for me?

213

It's nice to live in the same house.

214

You even wait for me because I'm late.

215
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,560
But is there anything more to say? I think I said everything I needed to earlier.

216
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,150
About earlier...

217
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,610
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,560
Why are you sorry, Ms. Kim Dali?

219
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,710
- Because—
- Did you think I was vulgar and lowly, too?

220
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,270
No, that's not it!

221
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:13,590
He's usually not such a rude person, but I think his emotions got riled up because of me.

222
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,540
I don't want you to take it to heart.

223
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,710
I'm going to go crazy.

00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,040
- What?
- Look here, Kim Dali.

225
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,450
Do you know what kind of people I experienced when I handed out plates and delivered alcohol at ten years old?

226
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,340
They say that you shouldn't even disturb dogs when they're eating.

227
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,300
That is an insult to dogs.

228
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,650
Do you know how many people in this world are worse than dogs? Jang Tae Jin from earlier?

229
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,590
What he did doesn't even come close to being rude. There's nothing for me to take to heart.

But! You staying up and waiting outside at this hour,

232
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,220
That's rude.

Don't you think this is wrong?

Then what about you, Mr. Jin?

235
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,770
Shouldn't you at least make an excuse or give me an explanation?

An excuse?

Are you saying that I did something bad enough for me to have to make an excuse?

239
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,030

242

I clearly told you from the beginning.

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,330
I'll take my hands off from the art museum as soon as I get my two billion won back.

If you're having trouble believing me then you can bring the money to me now.

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,940
Is it all over if she goes to study abroad? Does she think she'll never see us again in this industry?

313
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,170
This is crazy.
[Letter of Resignation]

314
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,910
- About the land near the Cheongsong art museum, the one that Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae has with borrowed-name.
- Yes.

315
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:37,800
Find out exactly what kind of relationship it has to do with Ahn Sang Tae and look into the people

316
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,940
who have recently transferred ownership.

317
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,800
Start with ones from five to six years ago.

318
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,300
No, look into the last ten years.

319
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,040
Yes, Sir.

320
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,180
Secretary Yeo.

321
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,060
I'm going to use that for an important matter, so there shouldn't be any mistakes.

322
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,070
Don't forget to cross-check it, okay?

323
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,090
Yes, Sir...

324
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,620
What the heck are you doing!

325
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,450
- How dare you touch this?
- W-What is this?

326
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,620
It says it right here! "The Living and Dead" no "period" one.

327
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,440
Isn't it number one? The number of the artwork.

328
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,290
Why did you put the soybean paste jar as well? Is this your collection?

329
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,710
Why did you come here?

330
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,190
Moo Hak.

331
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:14,960
I'm really confident that I'll do it well this time. Can you trust me this once and help me?

332
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,020
I thought we were done with that conversation yesterday.

333
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:27,050
You know how much I've been trying to become your father's real son, right?

334
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:31,700
As soon as the family law changed, I applied myself for permission to change my last name.

335
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,560
Do you think it was easy for me to change my last name from Oh to Jin?

336
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:40,030
It was denying my identity.

337
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,450
Even after I became Jin Ki Chul,

338
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,840
I still tried really hard to get recognized by our father.

339
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,090
But it didn't work, so what can I do?

340
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,750
I don't have a natural business skill like you.

341
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,520
I don't have a great ability!

342
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm also not that lucky.

343
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
Why are you talking about this all of a sudden?

344
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,650
But this time is really different!

345
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:23,040
They say you get three chances of opportunities in a lifetime, right?

346
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,260
The first time was becoming our father's son,

347
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:30,180
the second was getting involved with Cheongsong, and I think this is the third time.

348
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,520
This kind of opportunity doesn't come twice, Moo Hak!

349
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,060
Not Ahn Sang Tae, but who's on top of him?

350
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,980
What do you have to be this confident?

351
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,880
- You can't know about it. You'll be in danger.
- Oh, come on.

352
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,680
I'm not joking!

353
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,850
I'm saying it because it's really dangerous.

354
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:05,870
If this comes out, the world will turn upside down.

355
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:22,460
Also, they rummaged through the entire room as if they were looking for something specific.

356
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,510
And there wasn't a single thing that went missing.

357
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,430
I know you said we should just let it go, but I can't do that.

358
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,160
We're not just a regular company. It's an art museum.

359
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,220
You never know what might happen!

360
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,020
One day, I followed her quietly,

361
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:10,310
and her address was fake as I thought.

362
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:14,530
But she worked well!

363
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,740
She has good sense, too.

364
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:26,350
Oh! I-I think that's Gong Joo.

365
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,510
You can go back to work now. You have a meeting with artists.

366
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,410
Are you really going to be okay by yourself?

367
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,380
- Of course. I'll talk to her well.
- Okay.

368
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,870
- Hey, you ate my dumplings, didn't you?
- No.

369
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,500
- You're the one who stole my dumplings, aren't you?
- What?

370
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,990
I counted last night, and it was 17. But now there are only 8 left!

371
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,460
Also, you were the only one who stayed in this building the whole day.

372
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,520
Do you want to live like that?

373
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,960
Counting dumplings? It's so pathetic...

374
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,490
What? Pathetic? How dare you pretend to be superior?

375
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,780
- Let this go!
- What? An art museum?

376
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,950
- Everybody here knows that you worked in a bar!
- I said, let go of my hair!

377
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,870
- Do you want to die?
- Let go!

378
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:28,650
Let her go. I said, let her go!

379
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,630
- What are you doing to Gong Joo?
- Who the heck are you?

380
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,140
Oh, you're the one who ate my dumplings! Come here!

381
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:40,500
- How dare you eat it!
- Let her go!

382
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,590
How do you feel after seeing my rock bottom?

383
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,540
Are you happy?

384
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,130
I don't have to use honorifics anymore now, right?

385
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,830
Now that I quit the art museum.

386
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,830
I'm not interested in your rock bottom.

387
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,510
- What were you looking for in my room?
- What?

388
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:23,840
The director's office, roof-top house... and if my guess is right, my previous home before I moved, too.

389
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,950
What were you looking for so desperately?

390
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,750
I have no idea what the hell you're saying.

391
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,660
It's the house of an active duty detective.

392
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,690
CCTV, traces of your footsteps, and even an eyewitness. I didn't come here alone because I don't have evidence—

393
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,310
I said! I don't know what you're saying.

394
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,970
I just took a look around.

395
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,810
I was curious what kind of house the daughter of the Cheongsong family lives in.

396
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,670
Can't I do that?

397
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,650
Then report it.

398
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,100
- You think I won't report you—
- So, report me then!

399
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,440
I can just go on probation for trespassing,

400
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,040
but... what will happen to the Cheongsong family?

401
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:23,320
A drug scandal from a noble family... is it too cliché?

402
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,170
Things must have been really difficult.

403
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,360
Na Gong Joo. Who the hell are you?

404
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,880
Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to us—

405
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,160
You think!

406
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,810
You're so different from me, right? Wrong.

407
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:42,230
You could have been me and I...

408
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,850
could have been you.

409
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,280
You and me... we were just

410
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,760
dolls inside a claw machine game.

411
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,650
Ask Kim Si Hyung.

412
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,480
This is all I can tell you.

413
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,590
Ms. Na Gong Joo!

414
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,270
We're from the Seongdong police station.

415
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:12,130
I think... you'll have to go with us.

416
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,880
There!

417
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,280
The thing is...

418
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,780
I'll contact you as soon as the results come out.

419
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,450
Won Tak... this can't get leaked.

420
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,110
If they know something like this came from the art museum—

421
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,000
Don't worry.

422
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,420
Brother Si Hyung, please pick up.

You think...

you're so different from me, right?

You and I... we were just dolls inside a claw machine.

No, it can't be.

Oh, my. What's up with that girl?

435
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:17,380
She's not even using an umbrella.

Are you here to see me?

I'll stay like this for just a moment.

Yes?

00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,930
We just ran out of Pu'er tea.

What Pu'er tea?

451
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,570
I forgot to buy Earl Gray, too.

452
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,860
Your body got wet and it seemed like you were low on energy, so I made you a strong cup of coffee with two shots inside.

00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,630
Two shots?

454
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,050
Should I add one more shot?

It's fine. Thank you.

She said that a living national treasure drew it... It's most likely that she got fooled, right?

463
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,390
I'm not sure...

464
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,970

00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,560
superstitions, talisman, and shamans.

468
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,570
Anyways...

469
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,780
You can't be like this already.

470
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:40,410
- Pardon?
- I mean, you would've seen me soon once I got off work. But you couldn't even wait that much...

471
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,440
If you run through the rain and hug me in front of my company,

472
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,280
let alone do that in front of all my employees who were watching...

473
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,000
that makes me too... happy.

474
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,240
Gosh...

475
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,050
Is it because of what I said yesterday?

476
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,020
I was just... a little afraid.

477
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:19,590
I thought of you. And when I came to my senses, I was in front of your company.

478
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,360
I also had something to ask permission from you.

479
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:31,700
It's something that might... cause you damage.

480
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:42,270
Do you remember? How I said I'm going to help you protect the art museum?

481
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,360
Will I...

482
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,680
be able to protect the art museum?

483
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,560
No.

00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,810
If I help you, who knows.

485
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:10,380
I'm prudent and reserved.

486
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,300
Especially when it comes to money, I never talk about it lightly.

487
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,320
Go ahead and ask for my understanding.

488
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,080
You're not going to tell me properly?

489
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,620
I won't be home for a couple of days because of a business trip.

490
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,280
Kim Si Hyung's cellphone location came up.

491
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,750
What?

492
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:41,930
It looks like he's in Busan for now, but he's not using his credit card and his phone is off too.

493
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,100
I think it may take some time.

What about Na Gong Joo?

496
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,830
She's exercising her right to remain silent.

497
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,280
She's not saying a single word.

498
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,920
Do you still have no intention of making a statement?

499
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:24,430
Then I'll go on my business trip. Enjoy the bowls of seolleongtang in the meantime.

Stay for the entire 48 hours and then go back home safely.

Do you know why I hate people like you the most?

502

You give validity to the saying,

"Don't take in a black-haired beast".
(T/N: Ungrateful people)

504

The damn saying of, "Only kind people are fools,"

505
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:01,220
you make that saying seem plausible.

You've grown a lot.

Just because a good-for-nothing thug like you became a detective,

509

how dare you lecture me?

You really were perfect for where you came from.

I really... can't do this anymore.

Is that so? Then bring the money and I'll let you go!

524

Why are you still going on about my debt after all the money I paid back until now?

How long are you going to do this?

526
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,810
Hey! Are you crazy? You can't pay this debt back until the day you die.

If you can't do this anymore, then go die.

Ms. Kim Dali has been listed as one of modern art's most influential 100 people by the Art Forum.

He told me to look in to see if you needed help.

it's incredibly beneficial for Dondon.

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,670
We have to put all of these types of people to death–

626
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:19,020
An article came out about you.

627
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,320
What? What bastard did that–

628
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:27,840
Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae, who has been a member of the National Land Commission for more than seven years,

629
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,330
is a representative development theorist who advocates for releasing the green belt in the southwestern area of Seoul.

630
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,180
Assemblyman Ahn argues that the lifting of the green belt in the southwest

631
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:38,950
is an inevitable demand in order to resolve the housing shortage and create jobs,

632
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,050
but in reality, it is only a dirty justification to increase one's wealth.

633
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,510
- An article?
- I should have bought some land, too.

634
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,400
In fact, Ahn Sang Tae's family owns a significant amount of land in this area,

635
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:54,760
and the purchases of land coincide exactly with the time when Assemblyman Ahn was active as a member of the National Land Committee.

636
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:01,500
[Idiot]

637
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,840
I have no one to call now.

638
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:14,720
Then, who do I eat tteokbokki with now?

639
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,920
Are you saying Dali did it herself?

640
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,600
Yes, Sir.

641
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:57,620
♫ I can't help but smiling ♫

642
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,490
How is it?

643
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,030
It's good.

644
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:05,510
I told you. People don't know about this combination.

645
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:12,620
♫ From your eyes that are looking at me ♫

646
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,110
♫ My heart ♫

647
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,370
It's all over now.

648
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:21,200
These days, it's not like it used to be, so if the public's opinion is that intense,

649
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,350
you can't get rid of it recklessly.

650
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:26,160
They said they would investigate the people involved immediately.

651
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,470
And that the art museum wasn't going to be investigated.

652
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:33,460
The green belt can't be lifted for a while.

653
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:37,480
No, this isn't over.

654
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,170
Just as you said, if Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae is just an errand runner,

655
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:46,270
it means that the person behind him is much greater and scarier.

656
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:48,490
If they're that kind of person, they won't ever stop.

657
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:53,220
Or I might provoke them even more.

658
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,990
That's why I said I would post it.

659
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,360
It's my problem to handle.

660
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,780
My father and cousin were also involved. I don't want to burden you.

661
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:08,430
Above all, it involved my art museum.

662
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,460
Everything else is fine,

663
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:16,890
but I'm a bit worried about having to prepare for a fight without knowing who the opponent is.

664
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:23,810
It could be someone unexpected that is close to me.

665
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,370
I'm a little late because the damn reporters

666
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:12,510
kept tailing me so it took a while to lose them. I hope you understand.

667
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,580
You don't have anything to worry about.

668
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:20,890
It's good for politicians to be covered by the media

669
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:24,200
unless it's their obituary.

670
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,240
Do you think anyone can be the number one real-time search?

671
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,320
I'm going to be the next party leader, just wait and see.

672
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,350
I don't know if I can keep doing this with you.

673
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,200
What?

674
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:46,050
This man is... But who the hell caused this problem?

675
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:51,770
Are you saying that you're going to cut me off now?

676
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:55,580
If we did as we originally planned, closing the museum

677
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:59,100
and handing it over to Kim Si Hyung then it would have been all taken care of.

678
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:03,000
What's so great about that bitch, that would cause you

679
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:07,800
to put dating her before this important business?

680
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,490
Assemblyman.

681
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,500
I'm sorry.

682
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:20,730
I got worked up for a moment and said nonsense.

683
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:27,520
I apologize. Would I be like this if wasn't this frustrating?

684
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,220
It seems like things got more complicated,

685
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,060
after Kim Nak Cheon's death.

686
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,040
So do you have a workaround?

687
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,060
I thought this might happen, so...

688
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:16,820
When... did "our" Won Tak say he's coming back?

689
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:21,080
I think it will take two or three more days. Since he doesn't know anyone there.

690
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,900
My goodness.

691
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:27,130
I will throw this out, I can just put it in the recycling over there.

692
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,840
Then...

693
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:37,110
do you want to sleep at my place tonight?

694
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,840
Excuse me?

695
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,080
I mean, it's not another meaning.

696
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,150
But just like last time, I, the owner, will sleep in the living room with the TV,

697
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,470
and you can sleep in my bed.

698
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:54,000
I just want to be with you.

699
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:56,890
I'm serious, I won't do anything.

700
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:59,840
I won't put one finger on you, so don't worry.

701
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,030
If you're not going to do anything, then why would I sleep at your place?

702
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:09,470
- What?
- Why wouldn't you put a finger on me?

703
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:10,810
What?

704
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:14,680
You must be a bit conservative.

705
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:18,080
No... that's not what I meant.

706
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,270
It's okay, we don't need to rush.

707
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:24,080
Tell me when you feel comfortable and ready.

708
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,080
I can wait.

709
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,050
Who says I'm not ready?

710
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,740
I'm... I'm completely ready. Physically and mentally

711
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:36,500
I'm just... comfortable with all of it.

So, sleep as if you are dead. I don't even want to hear you breathing.
