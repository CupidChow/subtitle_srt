Give me my money!

00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,170
Before I burn every painting in here, return my hard-earned money.

Did you pick the ones with the right description?

7
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,650
First, I focused on the 2XLs.

8
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,750
- They're rough.
- I'll crush him.

9
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,680
Then he should go into the ground!

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,440
They're cruel.

11
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,110
I'm on the phone!

12
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,940
We selected them based on mean standards.

13

Give him his money!

14

Give him his money!

Mr. Jin?

16
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,470
That's not me.

17
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,730
Aren't you Mr. Jin?

18
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,670
Hold on. Wait.

19
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,280
You're Mr. Jin Moo Hak, right?

20
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,870
Do you know each other?

21
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,010
What?

22
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,920
(You two, do you know each other?)

23
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,010
(What?)

24
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,600
I'm sorry, it's my first day, and I'm not quite used to things yet.

25
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,620
I was so surprised to see you here again, Mr. Jin.

26
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,480
How can we have a connection like this?

27
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,280
No kidding.

28
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,020
I almost didn't recognize you.

29
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,760
Your style has changed so much.

30
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,010
Oh, you mentioned back then that you had an important contract,

31
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,380
did everything wrap up well?

32
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,430
Although it was because of a misunderstanding, I was worried that things might have gone wrong.

33
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,680
I can't listen to this anymore because it's embarrassing.

34
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,760
Why do you keep acting like we're close?

35
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,700
Did something happen between us?

36
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,280
Are we in some kind of relationship?

37
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,350
No, we're not.

38
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,910
Let's be clear.

39
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,950
You and I, we're debtor and creditor. Nothing more, nothing less.

40
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,670
Do you understand?

41
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,680
Why does this coffee taste like this?

42
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,640
It's not coffee. It's pu'er tea.
(T/N: fermented tea)

43
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,880
I couldn't find the teacups.

44
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,350
It doesn't taste like barley tea. Has it gone bad?

45
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,410
It's pu'er tea, not barley tea.

46
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,870
I'm fine! I'm fine!

47
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm not here to drink tea.

48
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,180
You saw it earlier, right?

49
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,260
When it comes to money, I am merciless.

50
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,350
Law? Honor? I don't know about things like that.

51
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,140
So don't try to break me down by saying things like we have connections or whatever.

52
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,670
Pay me back before you see me cause trouble.

53
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,620
This debt wasn't on the list the lawyer prepared.

54
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,910
So what?

55
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,230
That's not my problem.

56
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,770
I definitely lent the money and won't lose even ₩10.

57
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,950
So whether you sell your house, a painting, cornea, kidney, or even if you sell everything you can,

58
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,710
you better settle my money.

59
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,870
Oh, right. I'm saying this just in case,

60
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,880
but don't even think about paying me back with a painting or something ridiculous like that.

61
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,230
You know it must be a cash payment, right?

62
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,300
If you don't, I'll just set this whole place on fire.

Mr. Jin, you need to pay for your tickets before you go.

Please come this way.

73
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,250
I like art museums, but this was really good.

74
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,500
What bullshit, it wasn't good.

75
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,660
I didn't know what anything was.

76
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,190
You're so ignorant.

77
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,770
Not knowing what it is, is art. Get it?

78
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,070
Ah, is that so?

79
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,800
She was definitely different because she is from the Cheongsong bloodline.

80
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,880
She looked so elegant

81
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,900
and wasn't intimidated or distracted in front of these big guys.

82
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,730
Is that what dignity is?

83
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,110
Dig- what?

84
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,830
I told you not to use English in front of me.

85
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,350
Dignity? Grace?

86
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,810
No, no. I think there's something missing with these words.

87
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,060
In any case, she has something that you don't have.

how do you know the only daughter of the Cheongsong family?

90
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,370
What do you mean? I've just seen her around a few times.

91
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,820
Oh, so you have seen her around a few times like you see the aunties at the neighborhood market?

92
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,120
It's not to that extent.

93
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,930
We might be able to easily get back the 2 billion won.

94
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,790
- How?
- You know Century Group, right?

95
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,190
- Century?
- There is a rumor that she and Century Group's successor were once in talks to be married.

96
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,490
Apparently, they almost got married but Cheongsong backed out at the last minute.

97
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,230
We don't know why, but it means they didn't care about the money.

98
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,610
The guy must not have been that great.

99
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,200
Or... maybe he had no sense of humor.

100
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,080
Sense of humor?

101
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,550
What does that have to do with anything?

102
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,360
I felt this from when I first saw you, but you're really cra—

103
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,900
I mean, you seem like a really fun person.

106
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,900
Anyway, you're the most fun person I've met.

107
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,860
But you said they already broke up. Why would it be easy to get the 2 billion won?

108
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,890
The guy still has feelings for her and is hung up on her.

109
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,140
I heard that even for this funeral, he took care of everything so the bereaved family wouldn't have to worry.

110
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,700
And the woman he loves was confronted with these ignorant...

111
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,030
She is in such a bad situation,

112
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,400
so how can 2 billion won be a big deal to him when he's part of Century Group?

113
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
That's when you go in.

114

He's trying to buy a woman's heart with money now? That's cheap.

What?

116
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,400
So, if that happens, is she going to change her mind?

117
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,000
You said she was from the Cheongsong family, but she was this kind of easy woman? Being from a prestigious family is nothing special!

- What?

Right. You're not the type who would be easily scammed.

But... let's make one thing clear.

It's such a popular exhibition that the competition was intense,

313
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,420
I was going to arrange a meeting to greet the members...

314
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,550
Daerim Bank.

315
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,220
Yes, I'll get back to you after setting the date, then.

316
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,930
Yes, this is Kim Dali.

317
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,450
No, it was just a small issue because of a misunderstanding. It will be resolved soon.

318
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:48,000
If you have a little patience, we'll resolve it without issue. Yes.

319
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,640
Yes, don't worry. Of course.

320
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:56,190
Hi, Curator Choi! Oh, you saw it too?

321
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,410
No, it's not like that.

322
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,530
You all did really great today. Please, get home safe.

323
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,120
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

324
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,140
- Take care.
- Take care.

325
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:40,730
They're really going at her from her day one.

326
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,350
She should be able to handle at least that much.

327
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,180
What's with her...?

328
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,540
- I don't know.
- Oh, the day is so long.

329
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,690
You must have gotten the money, seeing as you're going home on time.

330
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,790
Are you all right?

331
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,050
Mr. Jin. Mr. Jin.

332
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,960
Ah, yes, yes.

333
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,690
Why did you come back here again?

334
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,330
I mean, I just heard it was a mess.

335
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,020
Did you come because you were worried about me?

336
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,760
What do you mean "worry"? I came to make sure you weren't going to flee in the night with my money.

337
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,440
Oh, right. You said we were nothing more or less than a debtor and creditor.

338
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,490
You told me not to act close.

339
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,130
You know well.

340
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,790
Now what? What's the matter?

341
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:23,680
Why...?

342
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,150
Why the hell do you wear those?

343
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,810
Are you trying to collect accident insurance money?

344
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:36,060
I don't even think these are pretty. They're just scary.

345
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:42,160
My luggage hasn't arrived from the Netherlands yet. These are the only shoes I have.

346
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:51,530
Don't worry too much.

347
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,830
What do you mean "worry"? Who's worrying? Why do you keep saying that?

348
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,910
Why would I worry about you? Whether the art museum's a mess,

349
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,800
- or you break your leg, why would it matter to me?
- No, I mean

350
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,370
I won't escape in the night, so you don't have to worry.

351
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,950
♫ Time will be on your side, and you'll be ♫

352
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,290
Just stay there for a moment.

353
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,250
♫ One day it'll be ♫

354
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,200
Wear these for now.

355
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,050
No, it's okay. I can just do this.

356
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,750
We're just debtor and creditor. I shouldn't do anything to owe you.

357
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,720
I thought you said that saying "thank you" was enough.

358
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,920
You said that in the Netherlands.

359
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,580
That when someone does you a favor, all you have to say is "thank you."

360
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,730
You really don't have to do this.

361
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,450
Did you hear the news about your father on that day?

362
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,890
That day?

363
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,400
You know, the day we said goodbye at the hotel.

364
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,470
I guess so.

365
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,730
Everything happened so quickly,

366
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,640
so I can't even tell what's forward or backward.

367
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,560
How I came to Korea? How did the funeral take place?

368
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,750
Oh right! We had said we'd meet at the art museum.

369
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,290
Did you wait long for me?

370
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,560
No, why would I wait for you?

371
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,750
I told you that my schedule was very busy that day.

372
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:15,750
I called to tell you I couldn't make time, but you didn't pick up.

373
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,250
I just thought "She must be busy" and moved on.

374
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,720
Very cool.

375
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,620
Did you know my phone number?

376
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,530
I called the library. No, I—

377
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:39,830
called the museum. I mean, I called the art gallery.

378
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,420
The art gallery gave you my personal phone number?

379
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,360
I told them I was your childhood friend and they gave it to me.

380
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,760
Oh, I see.

381
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,800
I'm a businessman, you think I wouldn't be able to do that much?

382
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,050
- But–
- It's true!

383
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,310
Do you think I would have hired a private investigator or something just to get your phone number?

384
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,930
It's not that. We're here.

385
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,820
You can drop me off over there. Thank you.

386
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,650
Okay.

387
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,970
Is it over there...?

388
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,090
Are you following me right now?

389
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,670
What do you mean? Since I'm at the department store, I am going to see if there is anything new.

390
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,340
I come here often. I'm diamond-level.

391
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,960
I even use the exclusive lounge!

392
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,530
I see.

393
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,540
♫ I keep getting excited ♫

394
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,240
♫ I love you, love you, love you, I’m only thinking about you again ♫

395
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,700
Was it on the third floor?

396
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,560
♫ I keep getting nervous ♫

397
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,230
♫ I like you, like you, like you. I wasn't like this before ♫

398
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:36,250
♫ I can see my reflection from your eyes ♫

399
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:44,250
♫ It shines like the moon that rises high in the night sky, yeah ♫

400
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:48,180
I told you I wouldn't try to escape.

401
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,190
No, I...

402
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,690
I was going to get my shoes. They're very special to me.

403
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:08,800
Okay, you can give them to me later. You must return them, okay?

404
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,180
What? What's the matter?

405
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,810
What? What? What is it?

406
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:23,950
What? What are you doing? What?

407
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,760
What are you— What the—

408
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,660
What are you—?

409
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,870
I'm sorry. You must be flustered.

410
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,660
You're not going to ask why I did that?

411
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,610
Am I supposed to be curious?

412
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,950
You can go now.

413
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,180
I feel like he's going to appear again. Is that okay?

414
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,330
It seemed like you might run into him again, and it would be a problem.

415
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,790
No, it's not like that.

416
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,860
Let's go. Since I'm here, I will cover you until you are done.

417
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,370
Here.

418
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,780
- This place is really expensive.
- Pardon?

419
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,570
I'm a regular here.

420
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,550
Oh my, you're here!

421
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,950
It hasn't even been a week, you don't have to overreact.

422
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,280
How long has it been?

423
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,410
Have you been well?

424
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,350
Thanks to you. When did you come back from the Netherlands?

425
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,740
Did you lose weight?

426
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,680
I'm a regular here.

427
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,420
One moment. Jeong Won, please escort our guest.

428
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,860
Why don't we go over there? It's a little noisy here.

429
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,040
Will you come this way?

430
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,390
Jeong Won, bring us some tea, too.

431
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,130
Yes, ma'am.

432
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,880
I see the manager has changed.

433
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,830
There's only one pair left in Korea.

434
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,040
It's a shame, this avant-garde is just your style.

435
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,430
What a load of crap.

436
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,170
I'll be wearing it for work.

437
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,890
I see.

438
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,040
It says this card is suspended. Do you have another card?

439
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,720
Oh, really?

440
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,170
I'm sorry.

441
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,140
Don't worry about it.

442
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,620
This card is also suspended.

443
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,000
That can't be...

444
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,780
Use this card.

445
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,790
Oppa.

446
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,390
Grab a couple of outfits with matching shoes and a bag. You know her size, right?

447
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,180
- Of course.
- No.

448
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,750
Don't do that. What are you doing?

449
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,090
You probably didn't even pack properly because you were in a rush to return home. Please, prepare it.

450
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,980
- All right.
- No.

451
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,030
Please don't.

452
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:19,320
This is none of your business and we don't have that kind of relationship.

453
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:28,390
Mr. Jin, what are you doing? We have to pay.

454
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:36,000
Everyone is waiting.

455
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:51,320
Right. I was distracted by the products. Let's pay.

456
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,810
Please ring this up.

457
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,360
Here you go.

458
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,720
Oh, right. Hold on.

459
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,230
Can we get the 5% off?

460
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,640
We can't accept that here.

461
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,220
Oh, it must be the store next door.

462
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,370
What's the total?

463
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

464
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,920
Can we talk for a second?

465
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,180
Not today, I have company. I'll go visit you next time.

466
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,410
I have something to tell you, too.

467
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,330
Let's go.

468
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,150
Yes, let's.

469
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,860
I'm sorry. I'm already a debtor to you. I'll be sure to pay you back for the card fee.

470
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:14,820
No big deal. It's late. I can take you home—

471
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,460
What? It's not like you weren't going to pay me back.

472
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,270
Oppa! Oppa, Oppa!

473
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:25,290
Why are you suddenly saying let's pretend none of this happened?

474
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:30,430
One week. Our wedding is in one week. Why are you doing this?

475
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,960
I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I'll fix everything.

476
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,420
I'll do everything you want.

477
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,110
Don't do this, Oppa.

478
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,100
Oppa, look at me. I'm begging you.

479
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,120
Please... Please...

480
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,880
Can you really do what I want?

481
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,780
I can.

482
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,010
Anything?

483
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,910
Anything.

484
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,100
Then...

485
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:05,390
This may be presumptuous, but can I say one thing?

486
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,090
Taking care of the funeral may be all right because there is a connection between your families,

487
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:14,990
but anything more than that can cause gossip. Especially today, there were a lot of people who were watching.

488
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,800
If I was afraid of that, then I would have never started to begin with.

489
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,040
I'm not the person I was five years ago.

490
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,840
The reason I could endure after hurting Dali like that

491
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,430
was because I believed I could get her back.

492
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,030
I will get Dali back.

493
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,980
Yes, Lawyer Cha.

494
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,620
Is that so?

495
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,460
I thought it would take some time. I'm glad it was sold.

496
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,750
Please proceed with it.

497
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,650
Excuse me? A provisional seizure?

498
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:18,700
Is that why my credit cards were suspended?

499
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,890
Could you tell me who did it?

500
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,190
I see.

501
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:35,600
Look... I would like to move up the date of the contract, if possible.

502
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:42,500
No, it's fine by me. I can move my things out tomorrow right away.

503
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,620
Yes.

How many days did you starve this time?

535
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,130
No, it's not like that.

536
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,500
What do you mean "no"?

537
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,170

Excuse me.

I'll go to the scene right away.

556
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,370
Excuse me for asking, okay?

557
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:04,480
Can I ask what you do for a living?

558
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,820
No.

559
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,460
Hey.

560
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,090
Seriously?

561
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,270
What do you want?

562
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:14,390
From what I saw in the morning, it seems like you're hanging out with low-lives.

563
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:16,880
If you don't mind, try to stay within the legal boundaries.

564
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,230
So we don't have to have any trouble between us.

565
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,840
What? Low-lives?

566
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,250
Legal boundaries?

567
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:28,140
When I see bad guys, my body gets goosebumps.

568
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,000
Here, take a look.

569
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,480
Goosebumps.

570
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,380
This means there's a 99.9 percent chance that you're a bad guy.

571
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,270
Be careful, okay?

572
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,220
Don't think I will be easy on you just because you're my landlord.

573
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,510
You should be careful before I kick you out.

574
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:54,060
I made it clear that two people can't live there!

575
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,980
If you bring in a woman again,

576
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,390
I'll double your electricity and water bills!

577
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,300
Got that?

578
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,800
That...

579
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,550
That jerk is the size of a rat.

580
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:31,370
What does he take the fighter of Majang neighborhood for?

581
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,540
Hey. No.

582
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,640
You're her creditor, and she's your debtor.

583
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,800
You're her creditor, and she's your debtor!

584
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,200
Get it together.

585
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,830
Get it together.

586
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:26,860
What the hell? Suck in your stomach. Is this a joke?

587
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,190
Big Brother is here.

588
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:32,970
Did you get a good night's rest, sir?

589
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,420
What was that?

590
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,710
They're back to normal, right?

591
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:52,780
They thought they looked too weak yesterday, so they must have practiced a little.

592
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,170
Good job. Good job.

593
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,890
Are we going to go again today?

594
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,020
What are you talking about?

595
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,420
You told us not to skip a day until you get back your 2 billion won!

596
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:08,400
I mean, what about their kitchen?

597
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,550
Don't you guys have to run a business?

598
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:14,620
Don't worry, we already prepped everything early this morning.

599
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,830
You don't have to work so hard like that.

600
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,760
I've also been told that they've seized the bank book, too.

601
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,670
Seized the bank book?

602
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,970
Cheongsong's bank book.

603
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,310
We have to do it before she uses it somewhere else.

604
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,240
What?

605
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:38,600
It says this card is suspended. Do you have another card?

606
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,440
Oh, really?

607
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,680
I'm sorry.

608
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,960
Don't worry about it.

609
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,280
This card is also suspended.

610
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,810
They say you should strike the iron while it's hot.

611
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,430
We have to push her to the very edge.

612
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,790
That way, we can return to business as usual,

613
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,470
and that's how we'll keep moving forward.

614
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,290
Yes!

615
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:09,940
Why are you doing something that I didn't even ask you to do?!

616
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:15,190
All right. Let's get going.

617
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:17,090
Let's go.

618
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,550

of course I would want to go there.

00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:03,160
I think we should make this look more comfortable.

632
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,330
What do we do? The people from yesterday came back again!

633
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:10,170
These people, seriously!

634
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,870
Curator Han, what are you doing? Go out there.

635
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:15,140
Me? By myself?

636
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:19,000
Why don't you guys go there first? I'll report it to the police.

637
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,320
What are you doing? Hurry!

638
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,920
Where did Mr. Hwang go to? He was just here.

639
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,310
- Curator Han?
- Yes?

640
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,150
- Don't call the police.
- All right.

641
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,040
Hold on there. You know you are going to get into big trouble trying to deal with those kinds of people.

642
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,570
You should just leave it to the police...

643
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:36,580
Director, no,

644
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,470
What do we do now?

645
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:43,730
Mr. Hwang! Let's go out, hurry!

646
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,050
I don't know. You do as you see fit.

647
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:48,520
- Director.
- What? You called them!

648
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,480
♫ Heartbeat growing faster ♫

649
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,580
Give me back my money, my money!

650
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,740
Give me back my money, my money!

651
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,960
Give me back my money, my money!

652
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,100
Give me back my money, my money!

653
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,070
Give me back my money, my money!

654
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,280
Give me back my money, my money!

655
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,220
Give me back my money, my money!

656
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,300
Give me back my money, my money!

657
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,370
Give me back my money—

658
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,300
♫ Go forward, forward, straight ahead ♫

659
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,560
♫ Go forward, forward, straight ahead ♫

660
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,680
♫ I have no intention of stopping, moving ♫

661
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,790
♫ Yeah, gotta go for all of it ♫

662
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,640
We bought tickets today!

663
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,980
Thank you for coming to visit us again.

664
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:50,730
It's great to appreciate art lying down like this, but how about seeing it in a different way today?

665
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,580
What?

666
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,780
Another way?

667
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,030
♫ One, two ♫

668
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,190
♫ One, two, three, four ♫

669
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,780
Wait. Wait.

670
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,680
Yes, we will look at the art in a different way today,

671
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,340
instead of lying down like this...

672
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:17,190
♫ He fell in love with her ♫

673
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:25,980
♫ The prince comes just in time, whenever she get's in trouble ♫

674
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:50,990
♫ The prince came, oh, darling ♫

675
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:53,670
♫ He fell in love with her ♫

676
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:56,240
I hope all of you have a great time looking at these pieces.

677
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,680
♫ The prince came, oh, darling ♫

678
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,040
♫ But darling, fall in love with ♫

679
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,160
Excuse me, Miss?

680
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:09,410
What do you mean by "Miss"?

681
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:12,450
It's Miss Barista, you punk!

682
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:13,420
I am right, am I not?

683
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,860
It's "Curator."

684
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,740
Do you have any questions?

685
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,080
What did they paint here?

686
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,140
What do you see in it?

687
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,830
Overall it's red,

688
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:43,230
and sometimes I see dark blue, too.

689
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,750
Isn't it spicy dakgalbi?
(T/N: dakgalbi - spicy stir-fry chicken dish)

690
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,610
With seaweed flakes on top.

691
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,740
You can indeed see it like that too.

692
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,110
Isn't this a flower though?

693
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:55,430
No matter how I see it, I think it's a flower.

694
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:01,950
Now that I see it, that's true too.

695
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:04,480
So long then.

696
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:10,030
It kind of looks like pizza, too.

697
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,170
What was that? Did she look down on us?

698
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,760
That barista just belittled us, didn't she?

699
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,240
No, that's not it. That Ms. Barista

700
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:23,040
also does not know what the painting is, isn't that so?

701
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,200
Ah, I see. That barista also did not know.

702
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:32,240
What does it matter even if we don't know? It's just nice to look at.

703
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,000
I want to eat dakgalbi.

704
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,930
Why do you always want to eat?

705
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:37,470
It's definitely not dakgalbi.

706
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,460
- It's a flower.
- It looks spicy.

707
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,320
It looks spicy.

708
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,800
Let's go and eat some dakgalbi.

709
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:04,710
What do you mean by having fun? I am working right now.

710
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:09,340
They said they prepared everything for the store early in the morning and then came out. Don't worry.

711
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:13,300
I don't know... I am telling you I will get the money back.

712
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,630
Yes, I won't even leave ten won out!

713
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:17,390
I am hanging up.

714
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:20,630
Ah, this old man, seriously!

715
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,720
Mr. Jin.

716
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:34,740
Did you get home safely yesterday?

717
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,240
Yes, thanks to you.

718
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:44,700
What is this?

719
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,020
The card payment.

720
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,850
I am sorry and thank you again.

721
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,900
Well, it's not a big deal...

722
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,830
I keep having to owe you.

723
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,930
I will try to repay the rest of the money as soon as I can.

724
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:07,170
I know you will be anxious and upset.

725
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:12,480
I know this is shameless of me, but can't you wait a bit more?

726
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:17,240
It's just that... it's because the issue is not that simple.

727
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,460
I will agree to all the repayment conditions you put forth.

728
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,490
I will accept any conditions you put forth.

729
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:25,310
If you just wait a bit more...

730
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,920
Tell the director to come out!

731
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,490
- You can't be like this here!
- Tell her to come out!

732
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,950
I am sorry, please excuse me.

733
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,450
What is going on?

734
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:40,230
Give me my money!

735
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:42,760
Why are you doing this?

736
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:46,060
What are you doing?

737
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,860
Why are you doing this?

738
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,170
President Jeong, it's not even the date for payment. Why are you doing this?

739
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,450
You can't just leave out paying us just because we are a small business!

740
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:54,990
Can you?

741
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:58,350
What are you guys doing? Pick up whatever looks like it will make money.

742
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:59,530
Don't do this.

743
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:03,270
Don't do this. Our art museum is not going under!

744
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:06,450
What are you talking about? The rumors have spread everywhere about this place!

745
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:10,220
Even if you take all this junk, it's only good for recycling!

746
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,760
We should take away things that have actual monetary value!

747
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,840
You are right! The paintings here are money.

748
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,560
Let's take away the paintings before they are taken over by the bank for auction.

749
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,590
- Don't do this!
- Let go!

750
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:26,000
What are you doing? Stop this right now!

751
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,820
Who are you? Get out of my way!

752
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:31,460
Na Gong Ju, call the police.

753
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:34,790
- Excuse me?
- What are you doing? I asked you to call the police right now!

754
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:36,730
Yes.

755
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:39,760
The police? We should be the ones to call the police right now.

756
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,470
Seriously!

757
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:45,320
That hurts! Who are you?

758
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,110
That hurts, hurts, hurts! Let me go.

759
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:51,600
You have to let go of her first for me to let you go.

760
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,990
Let's resolve this by talking.

761
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,440
By talking.

762
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,840
This is an art museum, isn't it?

763
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,200
Let me go, you bastard!

764
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:23,750
Do you know how much this costs?

765
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,700
Who are you?

766
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,860
What kind of person are you?!

767
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,630
Me?

768
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:32,940
I am the new director of this art museum.

769
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,390
Just how much amount are you guys making this fuss over?

770
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,180
Director, here it is.

771
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:52,780
Three hundred...

772
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,430
four hundred fifty...

773
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:56,400
two hundred eighty...

774
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,450
six hundred ninety...

775
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:04,990
I can just pay for all this. So, what's the problem?

776
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:12,980

Can you sell your father?

791
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,610
This art museum is my father.

792
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:53,880
What the crap are you talking about?!

793
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,750
Do you have the money?

794
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:58,920
I just have to pay you back, right? I will make sure to pay you within a week

795
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,560
- Hey.
- You can't take that money!

796
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,040
Get lost.

01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,870
I am saying I will be by your side like this when you need any help.

798
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:07,850
Ah, it bothers me.

799
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,930
What do you think makes you qualified to be the director of this art museum?

800
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:13,350
I know how to make money really well.

801
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:15,310
Such a money grubber.

802
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:17,490
But you are still handsome.

803
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:18,980
♫ Go forward, forward, straight ahead ♫

804
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:21,020
♫ I have no intention of stopping, moving ♫

805
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,800
♫ Yeah, I need to go faster ♫
