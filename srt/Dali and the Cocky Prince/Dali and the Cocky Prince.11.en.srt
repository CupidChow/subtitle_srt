00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,350
[Episode 11]

3
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,070
Oh.

4
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:01,190
When... did "our" Won Tak say he's coming back?

5
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,910
I think it will take two or three more days. Since he doesn't know anyone there.

6
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,330
My goodness.

7
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,450
I will throw this out, I can just put it in the recycling over there.

8
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,180
Then...

9
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,270
do you want to sleep at my place tonight?

10
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,540
Excuse me?

11
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,380
I mean, it's not another meaning.

12
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,510
But just like last time, I, the owner, will sleep in the living room with the TV,

13
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,880
and you can sleep in my bed.

14
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,180
I just want to be with you.

15
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,330
I'm serious, I won't do anything.

16
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,190
I won't put one finger on you, so don't worry.

17
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,210
If you're not going to do anything, then why would I sleep at your place?

18
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,110
- What?
- Why wouldn't you put a finger on me?

19
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,150
What?

20
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,080
You must be a bit conservative.

21
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,300
No... that's not what I meant.

22
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,720
It's okay, we don't need to rush.

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,390
Tell me when you feel comfortable and ready.

24
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,250
I can wait.

25
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,660
Who says I'm not ready?

26
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,200
I'm... I'm completely ready. Physically and mentally.

27
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm just... comfortable with all of it.

28
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,580
I'm saying there's no need to wait.

29
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,370
♫ I like this moment between us, so special ♫

30
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,520
♫ The way you're looking at me ♫

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,180
♫ Your dazzling self has filled me up ♫

32
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,440
♫ I only want you by my side ♫

33
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,960
♫ Ringing throughout the streets ♫

34
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,660
♫ Is a song from our past, I want to listen to it with you, yeah ♫

35
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,080
Just a moment! Just a moment!

36
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,310
I asked her to come in ten minutes.

37
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,550
♫ I only want you by my side ♫

38
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,450
Chak Hee.

39
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,460
What happened to your face? Did something happen?

40
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,420
Your neighborhood sucks.

41
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,140
I was wandering around in a taxi.

42
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,100
Why is that woman here?

43
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,200
Don't tell me... are you two living together?

44
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,930
Why would we be living together?

45
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,870
She's staying in the rooftop apartment for a while because of a situation.

46
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,240
What situation?

47
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,110
You don't need to know.

48
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,100
I asked you what happened to your face? Did someone hit you?

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,850
I can stay here for a few days, right?

50
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,430
Hey, where are you going in?

51
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,480
Wow. Seriously...

52
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,270
You have ramen, right? I'm hungry.

53
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,810
This girl.

54
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,310
Why do you want to eat ramen at someone else's house in the middle of the night?

55
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,810
How did that happen to you? Who did that?

56
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,730
Hurry up and tell me!

57
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,180
I had a fight with some girl at the market.

58
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,970
I picked up the last grapefruit first,

59
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,210
but she insisted that she picked it up first. So annoying.

60
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,460
What?

61
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,330
Don't worry because I won.

62
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,420
She got a nosebleed.

63
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,100
Did you go to the market like this? You did?

64
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,420
Should I wear a suit to the market then?

65
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,020
Where's the grapefruit?

66
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,580
About that...

67
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,450
She even got a nosebleed, so I have to yield.

68
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,980
I gave it to that girl.

69
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,800
But what is all of this?

70
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,040
Oppa, were you going to do something?

71
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,770
What? Do what?

72
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,700
Hey. Hey. Do what?

73
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,720
Me?

74
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,380
Us?

75
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,710
I mean, me.

76
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,700
I don't know! I wasn't going to do anything!

77
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,420
But why did you follow us in? This is my Oppa's home.

78
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,860
- I was just worried.
- About who?

79
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,700
- Me or Oppa?
- About Mr. Jin...

80
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,280
Of course, I was worried about you.

81
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,050
It's late, won't your parents be worried?

82
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,810
I think we should at least call them.

83
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,460
Didn't you hear me earlier?

84
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,810
I'm going to stay here for a few days until my bruise heals.

85
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,920
Because my parents might get worried.

86
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't know if it's okay for a young lady to stay at a young man's house.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,720
If your parents knew, I think they would be really worried.

88
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,640
Mind your own business.

89
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,990
Even though I don't know what's going on, why don't you stay with me in the rooftop apartment?

90
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,370
Just us women. I think that would be good.

91
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,820
I don't want to. I'm going to stay with Oppa.

92
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,090
That's why I came here!

93
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,250
Chak Hee... hurry and get up.

94
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,750
When I say, get up, hurry and get up!

95
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,300
I mean... why should I leave my house and sleep on the rooftop?

96
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,280
I'm seriously so ready, though!

97
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,780
Ready for what?

98
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,400
I don't feel like sleeping while facing you.

99
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,140
And you sleep in the room with the TV because you pay the rent.

100
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,810
I...

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,030
will sleep over there.

102
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,890
Do you want to die?

103
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,700
I mean... as you can see,

104
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,600
I grew up so beautifully

105
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,220
that I can't sleep on hard places like this.

106
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,140
Okay?

107
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,640
I asked, do you want to die?

108
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,930
Seriously!

109
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,120
Here–?

110
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,520
It smells like Oppa Moo Hak.

111
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,630
It's not right to do that on someone else's bed when they're not here.

112
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,730
It's not like he's your boyfriend, being ridiculous.

113
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,490
What are you doing? You said it's not right to do this on someone else's bed when they aren't here.

114
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,040
I have a herniated disc.

115
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,990
So annoying!

116
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,490
♫ Can’t someone ♫

117
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,350
♫ Love me, though I’m good for nothing? ♫

118
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,160
Yesterday and today, I had bad luck.

119
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,680
Probably not as bad as mine.

120
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,200
I want to grab anyone passing by

121
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,470
and grab them by the collar.

122
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,740
Probably not as much as me.

123
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,280
So, just sleep as if you are dead.

124
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,850
I don't even want to hear you breathing.

125
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,600
If I hear you snoring, I'll just–!

126

♫ I don’t want to surprise your gentle heart ♫

127

What? What?

128
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,970
What are you going to do? What are you going to do?

129
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,220
How am I supposed to sleep without making the sound of breathing?

♫ But I think I love you ♫

131

♫ My days are sad, but I have a dream ♫

132
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,590
Do you want to die?

133
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:49,900
♫ Can’t you love me? ♫

134
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,510
Sleep well.

00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:10,700
♫ I want to give all of my heart to you ♫

136
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,760
This is all because of that bastard Jin Moo Hak.

137
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,310
If it wasn't your younger brother, then who was it?

138
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,030
How did that bitch figure out that information?

139
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,430
I heard that Jin Moo Hak helped her out

140
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,150
with the exhibition and with the supplies.

141
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,880
I mean... are they dating?

142
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,030
Anyway, I can't just let this go.

143
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,530
I spent so much time and money.

144
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,000
And he's going to ruin everything we worked on?

145
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,240
I'm saying, whatever happens to that punk, what does it have to do with you?

146
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,800
After all, you're not even slightly related!

147
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,870
What does that mean?

148
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,770
What about Moo Hak? What are you going to do to him?

149
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,670
You dumb girl.

150
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,380
What have you done as a daughter?

151
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,390
I tried my best to connect you to Jang Tae Jin, but you couldn't even earn yourself a place.

152
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,210
Then you said you liked an ignorant punk, so I just let you be.

153
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,820
But you couldn't even snatch that punk away, so you bring us to this situation now?

154
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,910
I got you into good schools. I got you a job. I got you achievements.

155
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,710
Until this day, I made you look like a human being with my money,

156
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,480
so you should at least be able to bring home a decent guy!

157
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,400
Did you do all of this for me?

158
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,860
What?

159
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,010
You made it so you can market your daughter.

160
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,750
Not for me, but to meet your clients' standards and your greed!

161
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
Th-This wench...

162
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,090
Who would like someone like me?

163
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,290
Even my parents, who gave birth to me, won't treat me like a human being.

164
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,270
Who would like or love someone like me?

165
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,330
You wench!

166
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,020
You're really not going to go to work?

167
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,440
Then you should at least call in sick. You can't just stubbornly not go like this.

168
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,130
Everyone will be worried.

169
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,660
I got this job through connections, so it's fine. Nobody cares.

170
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,900
What a good life.

171
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,450
Then get up, I'll drop you off.

172
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,090
I don't want to.

173
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,130
Chak Hee!

174
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,830
I said, I'm not going, that I'll be staying for a couple of days.

175
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,200
After what you did to my dad, this is the least you can do for me!

176
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,920
Don't tell me, this happened to you because of me?

177
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,820
From your father?

178
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,330
Chak Hee.

179
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,420
You know, Oppa?

180
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,390
My dad is a bad person.

181
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,170
He's a corrupt politician and double-faced, too. It's all correct.

182
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,230
It's all correct, but...

183
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,190
where there's my father, I'm there.

184
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,380
Did you think of me even once?

185
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,030
Were you reminded of my face for even a brief moment?

186
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,700
That's what I was... to you...

187
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,120
How miserable.

188
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,390
My gosh. They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. She's Ahn Sang Tae's daughter?

189
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,720
Anyway, he won't sit back and do nothing.

190
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,430
I mean, Ahn Sang Tae.

191
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,530
I did it knowing the risks. Anyway, it bought us some time.

192
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,780
Right. What happened to Si Hyung? What do you mean he disappeared?

193
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,710
Just as I said. I don't know how he knew we were coming, but he had already run off,

194
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,510
leaving all his stuff at the place he was staying at.

195
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,410
He should be fine, right?

196
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,750
- Hey, come here.
- Hey, hey.

197
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,350
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

198
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,660
- Damn it...
- Hey, hey!

199
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,500
Ouch! What are you doing so early in the morning?

200
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,840
You little... I'm Cheongsong's eldest son, Kim Si Hyung!

201
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,490
Who is this?

202
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,530
It's Mr. Ahn Sang Tae.

203
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,500
You came here to take me out, right?

204
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:34,380
365 days, always in good condition! Ahn Sang Tae!

205
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,160
Vote for me! Ahn Sang Tae!

206
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,040
Your condition right now... isn't good.

207
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,820
- What?
- Kim Si Hyung, you...

208
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,150
Did you know that they found the item or not?

209
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,660
They found it?

210
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,470
- Where? Who?
- Right now,

211
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,760
the police are trying to catch you,

212
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,670
going around without a wink of sleep.

213
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,740
I, of course... have no thoughts to hand you over.

214
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:11,370
Hey, do you want to quietly disappear from this world,

215
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,350
or...

216
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,260
will you do as I say?

217
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,160
You'll get contacted around 2:00 p.m. Get him washed up and be on standby until then.

218
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,030
Yes, Sir.

219
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,660
What do you think?

220
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,430
If we do this, I think we can turn the public opinion around,

221
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,420
and we can close the art museum down quickly.

222
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,280
The most important thing out of everything,

223
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,950
is that Dali can't get hurt, no matter what.

224
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,320
Think of another way.

225
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,830
You don't see every aspect of things.

226
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:18,140
It's hardships and adversities that strengthen the bond between a man and woman.

227
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,080
Use this opportunity to properly show Kim Dali,

228
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,520
what kind of place the world is,

229
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,850
and also that in that kind of world,

230
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,050
the person who can protect her is you.

231
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,660
Jang Tae Jin.

232
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,420
That way, she'll never act arrogantly like this again.

233
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:52,840
Arrogant wench. How dare you come after Ahn Sang Tae?

234
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,380
In our country's folk art,

235
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,940
there are earnest desires of things like long life or wealth and honor in them.

236
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,120
So, depending on the material it's expressing, the meaning is different.

237
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,910
The peony flower means wealth and honor,

238
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,820
and pomegranates mean prosperity of one's descendants.

239
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,960
Then what about ducks?

240
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,970
Harmony between husband and wife.

241
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,430
Husband and wife?

242
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,260
Most of the birds in Korean folk art represent domestic peace or harmony between husband and wife,

243
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,260
so they always draw one male and female as a pair.

244
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,650
Wait, then...

245
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,310
was she trying to make me die as a bachelor?

246
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,200
It's all good now, right?

247
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,700
Jin Moo Hak is inside, right?

248
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,780
- Director! Direc─!
- Let go!

249
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,230
What do I do?

250
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:26,480
Hey. How could you do this to me?

251
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,680
Huh? I...

252
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,700
pleaded with you like that.

253
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,260
How could you stab me in the back, you bastard?

254
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,680
What are you saying?

255
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,910
What am I saying?

256
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,100
You think I don't know

257
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,720
that you handed all the documents over to Kim Dali, right?

258
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,180
You ordered Secretary Yeo and sent over the land registry!

259
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,560
Are you doing this because the Greenbelt ban being removed is no more?

260
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,900
How dare you bastard try playing innocent until the end?

261
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,240
I'm the one who's supposed to be angry!

262
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,820
CEO.

263
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,560
I was the one who asked her to bring the land register.

264
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,690
What about it? Do you expect me not to look into the matter with such a huge sum of money involved?

265
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,540
I handed it over to Kim Dali?

266
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,880
Who says that? Why do I need to do that?

267
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,510
I am Jin Moo Hak.

268
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,580
I don't care about anything else but money!

269
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,140
Who are you trying to pass the blame onto, after making paper companies out of land and construction companies?

270
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,560
This bastard won't budge until the end!

271
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,050
Is it really not you?

272
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,010
- I am telling you, it's not me.
- No, Father!

273
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,720
There is no way for it to leak other than Moo Hak! Assembly Ahn also looked into it. It has to be him!

274
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,630
Jang Tae Jin also knew about it.

275
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,060
Jang Tae Jin is the one who told me that you two bought land without my knowledge,

276
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,750
and took over a construction company.

277
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,070
Are you certain that "Greenbelt" was confidential?

278
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,010
If not, how was Jang Tae Jin aware of it?

279
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,490
Father...

280
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,430
You cannot believe him.

281
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,100
Really.

282
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,690
He came to our store and grabbed me by my collar. How can you not believe me?

283
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,510
He told me not to even dream about having the art museum or the women.

284
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,910
Are you still sure that it's me and not him?

285
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,520
What the hell happened?

286
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,920
I am telling you it's not like that, Father!

287
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,780
Jang Tae Jin could not have done that.

288
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,490
Who is the person above Ahn Sang Tae?

289
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,140
- What?
- Who is the one at the very top?

290
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,690
Shouldn't we know that, to understand how to solve this mess?

291
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,270
That...

292
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,470
So, you are saying it's not you. Right?

293
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,420
- I am telling you, it's not!
- If I do find out it was you,

294
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,380
I am going to kick you out without anything but your body.

295
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,540
You are going to say goodbye to Dondon forever.

296
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,540
Can you promise?

297
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,890
Do as you wish.

298
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,520
Jin Ki Chul.

299
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,970
Yes, Father.

300
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,610
Do you really...

301
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,930
have something up your sleeve?

302
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:37,490
Yes, of course. Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae said he would take care of this right away.

303
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,110
We have not seen the end of Greenbelt yet, Father.

304
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,590
If you really mess up again this time,

305
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,840
it's the end of your relationship with both, Dondon and me.

306
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,290
You will go back to being Oh Ki Chul from Jin Ki Chul.

307
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,690
Do you get it?

308
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,550
Yes.

309
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,550
This punk.

310
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,000
This punk, Jang Tae Jin.

311
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,310
What the hell is he thinking?

312
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,820
What are you going to do later? You should have just come out with the truth.

313
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,920
Look into the people Ahn Sang Tae meets up with.

314
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,480
- What?
- Also, because we cannot be sure,

315
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,930
see if Jang Tae Jin and Ahn Sang Tae are connected in some way.

316
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,100
Jang Tae Jin and Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae?

317
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:53,670
Is it our director on the petition notice board of the Blue House?

318
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,540
How could you kick away such good luck that rolled your way?

319
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,800
Just the land must cost tens of billions.

320
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,640
Then you are okay with the art museum closing down, and some apartment built in its place?

321
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,800
It's because you can rebuild the art museum somewhere else.

322
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,580
Somewhere else?

323
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,470
Where?

324
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,260
What place sounds good?

325
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,080
Somewhere you can go on public holidays and weekends?

326
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,220
Somewhere with good restaurants, where you can drop by the art museum on the way to a restaurant?

327
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,630
Somewhere where there are more squirrels and birds than visitors because there are no subways or buses?

328
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,250
That's not what I am saying.

329
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,950
I am just saying it will be better if we think from the director's perspective.

330
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,010
Truth be told, generations can live and not work off of that kind of money.

331
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,160
Can you understand that, Curator Song? I sure don't.

332
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,050
That is why they say that blood is thicker than water.

333
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,070
Like father, like daughter.

334
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,910
How could they be so similar?

335
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,530
Is her strategy to "hold out"?

336
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,580
I mean, the land won't rot and the value of the land will go up as much as she holds out.

337
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,830
What?

338
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,610
If that's not it, then...

339
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:12,560
does she plan to make a Century Town after marrying Jang Tae Jin?

340
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:19,800
But, it looks like the director likes Director Jin more than Jang Tae Jin.

341
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,780
- That Director Jin?
- Yes, Director Jin.

342
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:35,380
No, during the Frog restaurant,

343
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,870
did you not see sparks flying between them?

344
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,180
Their eyes were oozing honey.

345
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,690
Why are you trying to put them together randomly?

346
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,090
Well, Mr. Hwang is really funny sometimes.

347
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,610
Ah, seriously.

348
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:02,230
- I am telling you, they look good together.
- Where exactly do they look good together?

349
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,770
I am telling you they do!

350
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,510
Is that so?

351
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,520
Do I look good with Mr. Jin?

352
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,110
These are ideas to monetize the art museum business.

353
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,920
And this is the edited version of the next exhibition plan.

354
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,180
I have taken a different direction with it. Please give them a look.

355
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,030
Mr. Hwang kept saying useless things.

356
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,120
You are not offended, right?

357
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,080
Why would I be offended? He said I look good with a great guy.

358
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,560
I would think you'd take offense...

359
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,380
Mr. Jin is knowledgeable, good-looking, and gentle.

360
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,870
And he is popular with women.

361
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,710
I am a bit lacking compared to that.

362
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,490
Director.

363
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,070
Being overly modest merits cursing.

364
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:55,820
If Director Jin hears that, he's going to really think it's all true.

365
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,360
He'll really think it!

366
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,080
Enough.

367
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,400
We can post the notice to recruit a new intern today, right?

368
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,210
Sure, go ahead.

369
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,100
[Lawyer Cha]

370
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,780
Yes, Lawyer Cha.

371
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,960
[Inheritance Tax]

372
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,990
[Sum to pay - ₩285,673,000]

373
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,440
I went through it in detail. But you should still have a look at it.

374
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,220
The sum is quite larger than expected.

375
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,840
That's right.

376
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,260
Do you have any way to prepare the money?

377
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,710
I have to look into it.

378
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,760
Why did you have to mess around with Greenbelt?

379
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,060
It was rash of you.

380
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,910
Thanks to what happened, the bank thresholds are going to become more difficult for you.

381
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,570
If you sit around gawking without a plan, it may get auctioned off.

382
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,970
- What?
- I will look around, but I advise you to go to the elders in the family

383
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,870
and beg them for help in any possible way.

384
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,430
They surely cannot be worse than strangers?

385
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,410
Hey, let's write the Idol Fashion article later.

386
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,930
Follow me quickly.

387
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,190
You are professor Kim Heung Cheon, right?

388
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,130
I heard that you didn't even attend your older brother's funeral, because of the bad relationship between you two.

389
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,700
Why are you here?

390
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,770
Is it because of the development project at the art museum site?

391
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,270
Director Kim Dali did a huge thing this time,

392
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,480
befitting the successor of the Cheongsong family.

393
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,310
The successor of the Cheongsong family?

394
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,540
I am reporter Song Chang Wook from the Culture section of Jaeil Daily.

395
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,080
I know Kim Si Hyung quite well, too.

396
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,250
It looks like you have a lot to say.

397
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,600
Please,

398
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,480
speak comfortably.

399
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,460
He left thirty minutes ago, so he'll be there anytime now.

400
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:47,570
I contacted the reporters, too.

401
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,460
So, the public opinion will go our way.

402
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,630
We should return to our original business.

403
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,640
What is this?

404
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,170
Kim Heung Cheon?

405
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,810
Kim Dali of the Cheongsong art museum

406
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,690
is not the biological child

407
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,800
of the late Director Kim Nak Chun.

408
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,710
She's an adopted child who doesn't have a single drop of our family's blood in her.

409
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:38,250
Are you watching the video right now?

410
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,300
The heavens are most definitely on our side.

411
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,410
They haven't abandoned me, Ahn Sang Tae.

412
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,850
She's just an adopted child. How dare she act so arrogantly?

413
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,530
Stop this immediately.

414
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:04,710
What do you mean stop?

415
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,590
She has to get beat down properly, for her to not get back up.

416
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:17,410
Don't tell me you knew she was adopted and─

417
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,100
Do you not understand me? Turn Kim Si Hyung's car around immediately!

418
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,620
Hey, stop, stop!

419
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,120
- Why? We're already here.
- He said to just turn around.

420
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,900
What? What the hell?

421
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,330
- Quickly tell them to take down the news report.
- But that─

422
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,770
Get some other provocative news up or release a scandal!

423
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,850
- Do whatever you can.
- Yes, Sir.

424
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:54,040
- Where is professor Kim Heung Chun? When did he come back to Korea?
- Well, that's─

425
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,050
[Oppa Tae Jin]

426
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:08,370
Hamilton's ink-and-wash painting series is almost impossible to get.

427
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:12,350
- We'll wrap up all of Artist Mun's artworks.
- All right.

428
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,230
The market has been struggling, so we won't even cut close with this much.

429
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,230
In addition to the inheritance tax, I need to pay back Mr. Jin's money, too.

430
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,720
Artist Shin Sang Woo's artwork, where is it?

431
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,700
- Shin Sang... Artist Shin Sang Woo's artwork, too?
- Oh, there.

432
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,130
Oh, my babies.

433
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,080
- Gently. Handle them carefully, please.
- Yes, Ma'am.

434
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,130
- Oh, you really have to handle this one carefully. Carry it together, please.
- All right.

435
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,090
You have to handle them carefully. Yes, yes. Be careful not to scratch them, please.

436
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:45,620
Watch out for the corner. Please be careful of the corners here.

437
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,970
What a shame that you had to give the best out of the best.

438
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:55,260
You can't even put a price on those pieces.

439
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,740
Hey! Stop that right now!

440
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,800
Uncle.

441
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,990
Who are you calling "uncle"?

442
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,720
You rootless and lowly thing. How dare you

443
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,410
try to steal our Cheongsong family's assets!

444
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:17,320
What are you doing? Put them all back. Hurry!

445
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:23,760
These! These have been decided as a provisional attachment.

446
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,040
If you take these, you will all be charged with theft.

447
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,730
I said it clearly! Cheongsong family's assets will never leave this place.

448
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,550
Not even a single pencil!

449
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,360
Did you know, Curator Song? That the director was adopted?

450
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,410
Wow, how did they hide it so well all this time?

451
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:02,040
Wait! Then, what's happening to us?

452
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,770
- Who can we rely on?
- Oh, come on.

453
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,860
Can you hear them?

454
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,870
After kicking Si Hyung out and taking over the art museum,

455
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,420
does it make you think that you've really become a member of the Cheongsong family?

456
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,930
Even a beast, who can't talk, knows to be grateful to those who take them in.

457
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:39,380
It hasn't even been that long since my brother passed away, but the first thing you do is sell the house?

458
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,600
Now, you are getting your hands on the art museum's storage?

459
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,160
Where did you learn this kind of behavior?

460
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:52,700
- Uncle, that's not it─
- If we brought a rootless and lowly girl like you in

461
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,690
and raised you up this much, you should do the least a human being can do.

462
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,270
What great thing were you doing,

463
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,900
where you didn't even know that your father was sick?

464
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,560
You let him be discovered as a corpse on the cold living room floor.

465
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,550
You call yourself a human even after doing that?

466
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:18,750
This is why blood is important.

467
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,090
This is why, I was against it... bringing you in.

468
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:29,370
Even when bringing a puppy in, you have to consider these things.

469
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:35,060
Just how unlucky was your fate that even your biological parents abandoned you.

470
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:42,370
What good has come to Cheongsong after we brought you in?

471
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:45,030
My sister-in-law, who was perfectly fine, passed away.

472
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,310
Us brothers, who were known to have a great relationship,

473
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,120
became worse than strangers.

474
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,650

You also didn't answer the phone all day.

However angry you are, are you trying to see me get upset?

Chak Hee is just a friend I know.

641

There's nothing going on between us. She came over because of a situation.

I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you everything later.

It's not that I can't tell you because it's something suspicious.

It's because it's her private matter. Really.

The inheritance problem? You don't have to worry about that.

649
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,830
You're his daughter, so what right does your uncle have to say that the inheritance is invalid?

650
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:18,730
It'll take some time and be a hassle, but you'll get your inheritance. Don't worry.

651
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,810
It's not that.

You didn't hear that I was adopted?

655

You don't care?

657
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,610
Should I care?

658
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:52,530
Actually, my older brother isn't my biological brother either.

659
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:55,770
He's the son of the person who lives with my father.

660
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:58,240
Still, he's my brother.

661
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:08,240
I mean, but if you're adopted, does that mean you're not still Dali?

662
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,180
Was that the only reason you didn't answer my calls all day?

What about Moo Hak? What are you going to do to him?

678
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:32,970
And a son said that even though his biological father was alive and well,

679
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:36,180
he changed his last name to become the son of a rich family.

680
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:41,770
You know how much I've been trying to become your father's real son, right?

681
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:46,740
As soon as the family law changed, I applied myself for permission to change my last name.

682
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,240
Do you think it was easy for me to change my last name from Oh to Jin?

683
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:55,970
It was denying my identity.

No matter how good the money is,

688
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,620
would you sell your father?

689
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:22,550
The art museum is my father.

690
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,820
It's my dad.

691
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:37,490
What I mean is, in this world,

692
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,300
there are many types of parent and child relationships as there are paintings.

693
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:50,230
We don't have to share the same blood

694
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:55,670
to become the ideal parent and child relationship we think of.

695
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:06,980
And I kind of suspected that.

but you look nothing like him.

700
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:36,560
There should be at least a little bit that looks like him, no matter how much you look like your mom, it doesn't make sense.
