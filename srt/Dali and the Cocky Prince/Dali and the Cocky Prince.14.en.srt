2
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,690
Mr. Jin.

3
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,170
Mr. Jin, how did you know I was here?

4
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,900
Mr. Jin.

5
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,270
What happened? What's wrong?

6
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,000
It's all my fault.

7
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,240
I'll do whatever you want.

8
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,060
Don't go anywhere.

9
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,140
Stay by my side.

10
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,400
Mr. Jin.

11
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,440
I love you.

12
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:29,120
♫ So that you won't be able to see how I feel ♫

13
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,980
I love you.

14
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,090
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,880
I can't be with you anymore.

16
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,690
♫ Will you think of me ♫

17
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,340
Not as a debtor and creditor relationship.

18
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,450
I want to love you shamelessly as equals.

19
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,760
I love you, too.

20
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:24,130
♫ The heart that no one knows is hidden behind it  ♫

21
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,680
♫ Will you think of me again ♫

22
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,590
♫ At night? ♫

23
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,590
Thank you. We will work hard on the exhibition not to bring any shame to your reputation.

24
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,820
I'm doing it because I'm concerned about him. Even though I told him that it's not a dangerous road and that you'd be fine,

25
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,410
he became so pale. What will happen if the exhibition fails?

26
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,440
When did I...?

27
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,270
But you two...

28
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,890
No, I shouldn't have asked.

29
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,820
It's late but slowly look around.

30
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:49,190
♫ Come close to me ♫

31
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:56,510
♫ Stay by my side with love ♫

32
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:04,210
♫  You made me laugh with your pure smile ♫

33
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:11,530
♫ I've never felt this way before ♫

34
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:18,950
♫ Even if it’s not a beautiful story like a poem ♫

35
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:26,350
♫ When your scent gently spreads around me ♫

36
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:32,220
♫ Everything in the world is  ♫

37
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,140
♫ Beautifully colored in pink ♫

38
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,280
♫ This feeling is getting deeper ♫

39
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:48,650
♫ It's strange how we met ♫

40
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:55,890
♫ How did I fall in love at first sight? ♫

41
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,250
♫ It must be a fate ♫

42
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,670
♫ That is not easy to explain ♫

43
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,280
♫ I'm the only one for you ♫

44
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:14,200
♫ I'll give you this love ♫

45
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:27,360
♫ Like calm music, it keeps lingering  ♫

46
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,820
♫ I kept wanting to listen to your shy voice ♫

47
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,560
♫ Do you know how anxious I feel? ♫

48
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,390
♫ As if today is the last day  ♫

49
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,630
♫ I will come to you day by day ♫

50
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:56,910
♫ It's strange how we met ♫

51
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:04,270
♫ How did I fall in love at first sight? ♫

52
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,480
♫ It must be a fate ♫

53
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,930

♫ When you look at me ♫

60
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,420
♫ When our lips touch ♫

61
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,950
♫ I feel like I'll stop breathing ♫

♫ Try to forget it will better ♫

65
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:05,610
♫ Don't take that he says he will be better ♫

66
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:17,310
♫ You always have a lot of ways, even if he's wrong ♫

67
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:24,640
♫ Well, a good time doesn't last long ♫

68
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,980
♫ Don't take it so hard ♫

69
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,830
♫ Like a strawberry scent that goes away ♫

70
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:43,850
♫ Don't need to try to turn back his mind ♫

71
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,940
♫ Time will be on your side ♫

72
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,250
♫ You need to come around to yourself ♫

73
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,670
♫ One day it'll be ♫

74
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,350
♫ Don't take it so hard ♫

75
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:29,180
♫ Like a strawberry scent that goes away ♫

76
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:38,260
♫ Don't need to try to turn back his mind ♫

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,270
♫ Time will be on your side ♫

78

♫ You need to come around to yourself ♫

79
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,800
♫ One day it'll be ♫

80
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,510
♫ Time will be on your side ♫

81
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:08,620
♫ You need to come around to yourself ♫

82
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,770
♫ One day it'll be ♫

83
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,160
Did you wake up because of me?

84
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,560
Then get ready and come out, so we can eat.

85
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,210
♫ I love you, love you, love you.
I’m only thinking about you again ♫

86
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:07,950
♫ I like this moment between us, so special ♫

87
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,230
♫ The way you're looking at me ♫

88
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,990
♫ Your dazzling self has filled me up ♫

89
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,390
♫ I only want you by my side ♫

90
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,730
You have met my dad before?

91
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,910
Do you think I would lend him money without meeting him?

92
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,440
That's right.

93
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,400
What is this?

94
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,430
Seeing how they do business...

95
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,530
That's why the art museum doesn't have any customers.

96
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,840
An art museum is not a place to do business.

97
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,320
What's wrong with doing business–?

98
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,790
If one needs something, you give it.

99
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,800
And receiving that amount of compensation, then that's business.

100
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,380
It seems like you don't like the painting.

101
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,840
Well, I don't know what I'm looking at.

102
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,980
At a restaurant these days, people don't only go to eat.

103
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,290
What?

104
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,400
They enjoy the ambiance, brag, and like to be pretentious.

105
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,270
Isn't it the era of evidence? SNS (Social Media).

106
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,550
Ah, you probably don't know much English.

107
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,250
Anyway,

108
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,310
I'm saying that it's an era where one must show proof for it to be a real experience.

109
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,980
With such a great environment to be pretentious and brag,

110
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,390
you are only doing business like this.

111
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,240
But who are you?

112
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,470
Ah, you must be someone who works here.

113
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,170
I'm Kim Nak Chun, the art museum director,

114
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,810
who isn't great at business.

115
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,220
I'm sorry that I didn't recognize you.

116
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,020
I am Jin Moo Hak from Dondon Gamjatang.

117
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,790
- Please enjoy.
- Sure.

118
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,920
From the side that is lacking,

119
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,280
I should be visiting you.

120
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,330
I'm sorry for making you take a long trek to come here.

121
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,250
I heard that if you don't get invited to Cheongsong's end of the year party,

122
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,610
you aren't really upper class.

123
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,480
Is that true?

124
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,120
That...

125
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,680
was probably just gossip made by busybodies.

126
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,640
Are you interested in that?

127
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,090
I'm saying this just in case.

128
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,370
- I reject.
- Huh?

129
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,810
So, don't waste paper and send me an invitation.

130
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,440
And don't ask for a gamjatang sponsorship

131
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,210
for the end of the year party.

132
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,610
Gamjatang sponsorship?

133
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,470
I believe that nothing is free in this world.

134
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,710
They say that in order to do business, personal and school connections are important.

135
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,960
But I have never done business with that.

136
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,160
And I don't intend on doing that in the future.

137
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,440
And I don't even know if there is a real upper class in our nation, either.

138
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,960
As a special request from my brother,

139
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,580
I will lend you money. I don't need anything else,

140
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,630
but you just need to properly calculate the bank interest.

141
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,170
I'm saying that you must not be late on the bank interest while saying that you will provide a favor

142
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,560
or introduce me to someone.

143
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,950
These are the terms of the contract. Will that be okay with you?

144
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,260
When...

145
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,360
can we have a meal together?

146
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,000
You won't be able to do that either?

147
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,050
I want to hear more about doing business, as you mentioned earlier.

148
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,070
I wanted to make the art museum more and more accessible,

149
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,030
but I haven't been able to find the solution, so I have been worried.

150
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,480
But if I talk about it with you,

151
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,720
I think a solution will come out.

152
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,250
You will be buying, right?

153
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
Sure.

154
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,160
Then, I will head back.

155
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,310
Director Jin.

156
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,640
Do you perhaps have a girlfriend?

157
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,860
I know of a nice girl.

158
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,930
I think she will fit well with you.

159
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,090
It's not because she's my daughter,

160
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,530
she's a really great person.

161
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,800
But she knows nothing else but studying.

162
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,440
I want her to meet someone like you, whose principle of the world is bright.

163
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,080
I see.

164
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,680
Perhaps...

165
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,240
Of course, she looks like me, so she is very pretty.

166
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,920
Oppa.

167
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,280
More than looks, I find personality important.

168
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,290
I can't say more about her personality.

169
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,390
Ah right, I even have a picture.

170
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,510
Jamanchu!

171
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,240
- What did you say?
- Actually, I am "S.N.E."

172
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,840
I am someone who prefers "seeking natural encounters."

173
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,960
It's unfortunate, but I will reject this artificial meeting.

174
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,850
- Really?
- Yes.

175
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,710
Then, well...

176
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,170
there's nothing I can do about that.

177
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,720
No way. My dad really did that?

178
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,380
You're lying.

179
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,590
Why would I lie about that?

180
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,950
My dad drives me crazy.

181
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,640
Wait, but what's wrong with my dad?

182
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,190
When my dad was younger, he was very handsome. His eyes were bulging, too.

183
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,770
I didn't say he wasn't.

184
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,280
I'm just saying that he wasn't my style.

185
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,030
You know that my style is Dali.

186
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:35,100
But truly, my dad must have liked you.

187
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,760
You know, the pottery that you kept there... the one where you kept the soy bean paste.

188
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,350
Chamber pot!

189
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,710
It's just a pot of soybean paste. It's soybean paste.

190
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,630
I'm worried it'll smell too much.

191
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,630
That gift, made by the artist Kim Chang Ki,

192
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,240
it's pottery that my dad only gives to people he really likes.

193
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,090
It was a gift from my dad, right?

194
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,850
Yes.

195
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,080
It's a free pass award for a family meeting,

196
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,220
so I tend to be really liked by older people.

197
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,590
Of course with younger women, it works a bit more...

198
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,790
it works just a little more.

199
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,830
- Eat.
- You should eat too, Mr. Jin.

200
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,320
How long are you going to call me "Mr. Jin, Mr. Jin"?

201
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,070
Why am I your teacher? What did I teach you?

202
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:42,420
I should call Mr. Jin, Mr. Jin. What else would I call you?

203
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,260
Honey. Darling. Oppa.

204
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,240
Dear. Sweetheart.

205
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,300
There are so many nicknames in the world that give people goosebumps and make people go crazy.

206
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,700
But of all things, breaking the ambiance,

207
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,380
why "Mr."?

208
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,670
Then, what do you like, honey?

209
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,620
I just...

210
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,450
Honey, tell me what you want me to call you. I'll call you whatever you want me to call you.

211
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,240
♫ Clouds, rain, then comes a rainbow ♫

212
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:26,000
Well... Honey... Wow.

213
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:32,020
If it's something my honey wants, this honey is fine with it, too.

214
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,260
Honey, do you like "honey," too?

215
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,760
Honey.

216
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,700
♫ That's ordinary love ♫

217
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,400
♫ One step closer, two steps closer ♫

218
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,640
♫ Will you come closer and hug me? ♫

219
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,100
♫ That's ordinary love ♫

220
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,040
What are you doing?

221
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,570
It's all over.

222
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,900
I'm being chased by the police.

223
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,850
- Send me abroad.
- You have a travel ban.

224
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,690
That's why—

225
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,340
Either get the travel ban off or smuggle me out of this place.

226
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,820
Why should I?

227
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,290
Are you kidding me?

228
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,640
It'll be better for you to not have me here.

229
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,820
If I open my mouth...

230
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,920
You know...

231
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,310
I have no idea what you mean.

232
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,830
Do you think I care about anything right now?

233
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,460
Shall I reveal to the world what happened that night?

234
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,820
Shall I tell them what kind of person Jang Tae Jin of Century Group is? Should I go to the police right now?

235
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,220
Go ahead.

236
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,440
- What?
- Should I take you?

237
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,930
Or I could report you now from here.

238
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,790
Bastard!

239
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,840
Take this opportunity to turn yourself in and get treated.

240
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,930
You're unfit and this is your first offense, you'll only get probation.

241
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,910
At this rate, your delusion might get worse, Si Hyung.

242
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,160
What? Delusion?

243
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,890
There are no witnesses or evidence.

244
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,890
But if you keep saying that you saw something,

245
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,460
people call that a delusion.

246
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,350
That could be possible if you go through something big.

247
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,100
But you shouldn't rely on drugs. If you receive treatment,

248
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,520
I will compensate for what you had to go through.

249
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,550
Whether it be Cheongsong Art Museum or a stake in the redevelopment.

250
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,950
Director.

251
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,080
Director, are you there?

252
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,400
Yes.

253
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,790
Hey, considering my relationship with Dali,

254
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,470
would I ever ignore you?

255
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,670
Stop that bullshit.

256
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,750
You better come up with a plan to save me.

257
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,750
I'm never going to a hospital or prison.

258
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,290
Delusion?

259
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,590
Even if it's a delusion that an insane person blabbers, I'm sure someone will hear it.

260
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,230
Let us see.

261
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,880
How long you can bear it.

262
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,110
- Director, are you all right?
- It's okay.

263
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,520
He's a friend of mine.

264
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,890
It's nothing, so don't worry. Get back to work.

265
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,520
I apologize.

266
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,030
Did you get rid of the CCTV footage and dashcam footage from last time?

267
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,020
Of course, Sir.

268
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,250
You can't miss a single one.

269
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,680
Don't worry.

270
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,800
Even if there's one that we missed, it's already been so long

271
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,580
that you don't have anything to worry about.

272
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,640
Erase all the traces of contact I've had with

273
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,390
Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae.

274
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,760
Sorry?

275
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,370
It seems like Assemblyman Ahn's plans fell through.

276
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,750
Make sure to get rid of

277
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,420
every little thing.

278
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,330
Yes, Sir.

279
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,350
I need to avert people's attention.

280
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,750
There will be a deal between Dondon and Ahn Sang Tae.

281
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,510
Hire an appropriate company and proceed with a lawsuit.

282
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,160
Whether it will be illegal political funds or bribes,

283
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,050
the more news it'll create, the better.

284
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,710
Yes, Sir.

285
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,880
This is Century, leading the times.

286
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,530
Customer, what can I help you with?

287
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,600
I'd like Director Jang Tae Jin's phone number.

288
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,460
Sir, can you repeat yourself, please?

289
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,280
This is not a prank. It's really important, so hurry and transfer my call.

290
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,800
If you don't transfer my call, you'll get in trouble.

291
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,320
I'm busy. Hurry up, damn it!

292
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,360
Would you please hold?

293
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,500
How many hours do they want me to wait?

294
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,580
Who's waiting for what?

295
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,370
It's nothing.

296
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,180
Are you heading out to work?

297
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,350
- Did you make an appointment?
- Sorry?

298
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,170
Oh, of course.

299
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,680
Make it clear.

300
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,600
If they don't add Dondon to the Namseo area greenbelt development, we'll reveal everything.

301
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,090
Get the confirmation, their seal stamped, and get it notarized.

302
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,760
If you don't, then you know what happens. Right?

303
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,820
Of course. Don't worry.

304
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,060
Should I come with you?

305
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,040
Oh, Father. Please leave it to me.

306
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,130
I'm Jin Ki Chul.

307
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,880
Your son, Jin Ki Chul.

308
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,180
Honey, you go ahead.

309
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,580
Ki Chul has something to do with me.

310
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,470
I do? What?

311
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,190
You know, that thing from last time.

312
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,860
What thing from last time?

313
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,810
What? What?

314
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,390
- Oh, that thing!
- Yes, that thing.

315
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,210
What are you up to again?

316
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,250
What do you mean? There's a new store at the Euljiro Shopping Center,

317
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,050
so I want to go with Ki Chul.

318
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:35,060
You old man are getting more doubtful as you get older.

319
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,320
Go on. Go on.

320
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,050
Go on.

321

Why are you telling me that now?

Because your dad would've flipped out if he found out.

He might really kick us out this time.

He's really upset this time, I tell you. Like he was just now.

Wasn't she dating Moo Hak? Why is she marrying Jang Tae Jin?

That bitch, I guess she was two-timing.

What if Jang Tae Jin does something?

You just have to say that Director Kim Nak Chun

was different from usual on the days the artworks came in. There's nothing hard about it.

Can you postpone the work for the country because you want to?

00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,220
But I got kicked out of school and I won't be able to get a job.

484
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,480
It's okay.

485
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,550
Anyone can make a mistake. Just don't ever do it again.

486
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,880
Father

487
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,290
told me that I dirtied Cheongsong's name.

488
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,000
He said he never wants to see me again.

489
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,170
And I'm not his son anymore.

490
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:11,730
No matter how important Cheongsong's reputation is,

491
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,480
it's not more important than you.

492
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,530
You just have to start over.

493
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,050
Si Hyung.

494
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:28,620
No painting is complete with one stroke of a paintbrush. It takes dozens, hundreds,

495
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:34,300
no, thousands of strokes to finish one painting.

496
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,070
The same goes for life.

497
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,440
Uncle...

498
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,270
I've already crossed the point of no return.

499
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,510
You have no idea what I did.

500
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,840
I will help you.

501
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,110
Whatever you did, you're my son.

502
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,380
If your late uncle finds out you're like this—

503
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,980
He passed away because of me.

504
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,790
What?

505
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,040
My uncle...

506
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,980
I...

507
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:34,390
Hey, what are you saying?

508
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,920
You were right about me.

509
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,410
I'm not even a human.

510
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,230
So...

511
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:48,930
Pretend you don't have a son and go back.

512
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,470
Let's go.

513
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:05,180
- Kim Si Hyung.
- Hey, let's go.

514
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,700
Let's go!

515
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,250
Hey!

516
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,940
Go away!

517
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,920
You jerk!

518
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,980
Let me go, you bastards!

519
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,100
Let go of me!

520
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,400
Kim Si Hyung, you know, right?

521
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,530
Even bastards like you have the right to remain silent!

522
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,510
I'm innocent!

523
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,690
What you said could be used against you in court.

524
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,160
You just keep blabbering with that mouth.

525
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,950
Honey! Honey!

526
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:10,360
Honey! Honey!

527
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,440
What did you just say?

528
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,430
What? Honey?

529
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,320
W-Well...

530
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,360
Who's your honey?

531
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,280
What I meant is...

532
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,150
Am I your honey? Who's your honey?

533
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,300
Look at this man! Are you deaf?

534
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,450
When did I say "honey"? I said excuse me.

535
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:44,340
If you have bad hearing, go see a urologist. Don't accuse an innocent person!

536
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,620
Why would I go see a urologist for bad hearing?

537
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,210
You haven't eaten yet, right?

538
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,840
Why did you buy three boxes?

539
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,770
Because I didn't know what flavor you like.

540
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:19,960
How is three boxes of pizza a lot?

541
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,060
I'm rich. I always eat like this.

542
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,210
Good for you.

543
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:28,400
Won Tak, why did you get so much? Is one–

544
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:33,150
Did you buy one for Mr. Jin?

545
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,820
Me?

546
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,510
Why would I get one for him? There's barely enough for me.

547
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:42,040
It's all for me. I'm going to eat it all.

548
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,930
That's true, our Won Tak is a big eater.

549
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:49,430
He moves a lot and works out often, he never gains weight, no matter how much he eats.

550
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,320
Four chickens aren't a lot.

551
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,930
I always eat five whole chickens plus three bags of ramyeon.

552
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:08,110
Three bags of ramyeon? I eat three bags of ramyeon plus two rolls of gimbap.

553
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,590
I work in the food industry.

554
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,090
Do you know how much I eat developing food?

555
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:16,190
My average portion is on a different level from an ordinary person's!

556
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,450
I'm a policeman. A cop!

557
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,180
I have a different measuring unit compared to civilians.

558
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,590
I shouldn't say this... When we're on a stakeout,

559
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:28,240
I eat five bowls of jjajangmyeon, three whole chickens, five hamburgers,

560
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,590
and then drink 1.5 liters of cola in one shot

561
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,180
- to go arrest the culprit.
- Fine! Fine!

562
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,220
You eat a lot. You win. Happy?

563
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,750
If you eat a lot, then you'll poop a lot.

564
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,590
Damn it.

565
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,700
I'm eating.

566
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,600
Why does he keep coming to our house?

567
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,320
Aren't you going home?

568
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,430
You have a house. You have a nice big house. Why do you keep coming to our house?

569
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,010
Well...

570
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:56,490
What do you mean well, well?

571
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:00,720
Even though you're the landlord, while I'm paying rent, this is my house.

572
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,090
If you're done, go home. You're shameless.

573
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,140
I'm still eating. I'm not done yet!

574
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,490
I'll pack it up. I don't care if you eat it at home alone or not. Get up!

575
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,770
How can you eat alone?

576
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,210
I said, get up!

577
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,490
Get up!

578
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,870
You're standing your ground? Seriously?

579
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,990
Arm Bar!

580
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,300
- Let go!
- Go home!

581
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,760
Go home! Go home!

582
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,690
- Go down.
- We're dating!

583
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:26,870
What?

584
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:31,420
Mr. Jin Moo Hak and I are dating.

585
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,220
Hey, you...

586
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:42,610
Kim Dali, are you nuts?

587
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,260
I was going to tell you when the art museum and the issue with dad were all settled.

588
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,390
But I thought I should tell you before that.

589
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,680
No, what...?

590
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,810
The timing is not the problem, but the subject is.

591
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,420
Hmm?

592
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,160
Will you really be okay?

593
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,860
About what?

594
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,980
Can you communicate with him?

595
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,620
We can communicate very well.

596
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,450
- What's the capital of India?
- Indonesia.

597
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,400
- Who established Joseon?
- Yu Dong Geun! (an actor)

598
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,800
- Ever?
- Eternity!
(T/N: "Ever-lasting")

599
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,150
- A horse without legs...
- Are sick.

600
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:18,120
- What's UFO in English?
- Slan... I don't know English. Pass!

601
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,530
And you can still communicate with him when he's like this? Like this?

602
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:25,540
Won Tak, I like everything about you, but you don't have a sense of humor.

603
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,690
Mr. Jin is making dad jokes right now.

604
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:32,210
You have no sense of humor.

605
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,070
You lack a sense of humor.

606
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:36,210
A horse without legs...

607
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,790
Are sick.

608
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,690
Isn't he cute?

609
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,600
Aren't I cute?

610
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,260
Aren't I cute?

611
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,380
Aren't I cute?

612
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,750
Hey.

613
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:05,010
Gosh, that jerk. If it wasn't for my honey...

614
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,940
What is it, Mr. Won Tak?

615
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,200
Let's do that.

616
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,570
Wow, the view is...

617
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,570
nice.

618
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,480
You must be so happy, right?

619
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,700
You must be ecstatic, right?

620
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,340
Yes.

621
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,670
I'm ecstatic.

622
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:56,410
You may be smiling now, but Jin Moo Hak, your happiness is over and hell is about to start.

623
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:03,370
If you make Dali upset, you're dead.

624
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,750
If you make Dali worry, then you're dead.

625
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:12,520
If you make Dali cry, then you're really dead.

626
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,330
Should I die now?

627
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:18,370
Do well if you don't want to die. Or else, I'll just hit you!

628
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,410
That jerk. How many times is he killing someone?

629
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,730
And he says he's a cop.

630
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:34,400
Don't worry! That's not happening!

631
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,160
Si Hyung did?

632
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,240
He seems totally different from last time.

633
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:56,070
All his former attorneys resigned, and he's rejecting to see his father.

634
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:59,630
He won't even say a word when we show him the evidence.

635
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,960
He keeps asking for Jang Tae Jin.

636
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,480
- What? Tae Jin?
- Yes.

637
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,410
Were they close?

638
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:13,900
They're the same age, the family's close, and they went to the same school.

639
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,560
But they weren't close.

640
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,260
They hung out with completely different groups.

641
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,250
Yeah?

642
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,280
So, what did Tae Jin say?

643
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,990
It's not as if people like us can get a hold of Century Group's heir.

644
