[Episode 13]

3
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,060
You just have to say that Director Kim Nak Chun

4
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,970
was different from usual on the days the artworks came in. There's nothing hard about it.

5
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,810
It doesn't make sense.

6
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,310
He bleached his hair and removed his body hair.

7
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,670
The case is being transferred.

8
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,280
Transferred?

9
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,990
- Damn it. Seriously! Let me go!
- Where are you going?
- Hey!

10
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,620
Hey! What then? Are you going to indict a dead person?

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,410
The case will be dropped anyway. So stop being noisy.

12
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,510
They're trying to end this by transferring it to a different department,

13
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,340
- that's what it is.
- Drop it? Why would we drop the case when Kim Si Hyung, that punk, is the culprit?

14
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,360
The Cheongsong family also wants the case to be quiet.

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,590
What?

16
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,290
Honestly speaking, this will ruin their reputation.

17
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,560
In the Cheongsong family, Ms. Kim Dali isn't the only one. There's even a video.

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,860
What if it gets leaked? It will be a game over for them.

19
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,690
To just say that the deceased had a chronic disease and thought it was pain medication.

20
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,180
It's better to let it blow over quietly like that for the Cheongsong family, too.

21
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,010
That's right.

22
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,680
Anyways, that's how the people from the Cheongsong family and the higher-ups are discussing this.

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,030
Just know that's the case and wrap it up.

24
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,240
Let's have some soju.

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,670
- I'd like that.
- Hyung...

26
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,930
This is "Snowflake". Out of all the products, it's the best methamphetamine product!

27
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,360
350 million... no, this quantity can get up to 500 million.

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,560
An old man smuggled it for pain medication? It doesn't make any sense!

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,820
Hey, you punk! I also—

30
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
Hyung, what was the date you said the video was taken?

31
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,460
What?

32
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,880
Where did you say the artworks came from that day?

33
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,120
- Try finding it.
- No, why—

34
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,060
- What do you want me to do?
- Mr. Won Tak?

35
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,610
Hello... yes...

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,230
I normally look like this... besides when I go to work.

40
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,950
Oh, really? I never knew that fact.

41

- Have some coffee.
- Oh, yes, thank you.

- Your welcome.
- Thank you.

"On the day the artwork arrived from abroad,

44
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,470
the director's actions were a little suspicious," if I just say that,

45
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,360
he said he'll arrange the director's position for Jeil Newspaper's Art Museum.

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,920
My mother's nursing home too...

47
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,420
To me, he offered my Eun Yul to study abroad

48
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,370
and to give me the head curator position at the National Art Museum.

49
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,560
Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae did?

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,490
Why would Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae...?

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,930
Did he have some sort of resentment against director Kim Nak Chun?

52
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,660
Last time, our director Kim Dali,

53
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,070
put a petition into the Blue House regarding the real estate issue.

54
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,240
Maybe he's holding a grudge against her for that?

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,700
To see this as a personal grudge... doesn't the budget seem too big?

56
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:27,280
No matter if he's an assemblyman... he was going to handle the fees to study abroad and a nursing home, too?

57
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,870
Perhaps you have anything that can be used as evidence? Phone call record with Assemblyman Ahn or a recording?

58
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,720
The thing is... he inspected my phone as soon as we met.

59
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,090
Also... the phone number,

60
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,700
I think it was a burner phone.

61
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,420
The number you have dialed is not in service.

62
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
No way!

63
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,450
What... Why is our director here?

64
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,740
Normally,

65
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,000
when an artwork arrives from abroad, does the director handle them himself like that?

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,890
No. Why would there be a reason for him to do that?

67
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,670
Even if we say that was the case, there's no way we wouldn't have known.

68

[Special Exhibition Room]

69
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,140
Normally when an artwork arrives from abroad, without exception, we unwrap it under the supervision of three employees.

70
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,410
- It's because there are cases where the artwork comes in scratched or damaged while it was delivered.
- Careful, careful.

71
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,120
Oh, also, we record each one of the artworks with a camera.

72
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,380
If there was something like this in the frame, it would have been obvious.

73
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,680
When was this?

74
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,510
It was that day. The day before the director passed away.

75
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,460
Yes.

76
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:04,550
Director, the work that came from New York yesterday is strange. I think someone tampered with it.

77
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,070
What do you mean? I checked everything before I left.

78
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:14,200
Hold on! Hold on! Where did you say it came from?

79
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,430
New York? The New York in the USA?

80
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,300
Yes, New York, USA.

81
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,530
Are you sure it's the USA, not China or Southeast Asia?

82
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,030
Yes, it came from the USA.

83
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,450
Try to look for it... the recording file of the unwrapping from that day.

Oh, this one, this one! Here, here, here! Artist Cindy Gustan, right?

Oh, this is right, yes...

87
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,100
It seems.... similar...

88
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,030
It also seems like it may not be...

89
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,390
- It's different.
- Oh, that scared me.

Kim Si Hyung, that man.

137
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,390
He was a customer in the store I worked at.

138
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,800
What store?

139
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Of course,

140
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,280
he knew that my resume was fake,

141
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,510
and at first, pretended not to know.

142
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,320
Later, he threatened that he would tell all if I didn't listen to him.

00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,450
What did he make you do?

144
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,460
He asked me to take out paintings from the museum's storage.

145
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,110
Are you saying that you stole paintings that were registered in the art museum?

146
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,410
That's why... I felt something was off in that storage.

147
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,660
So?

148
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,390
What do you stealing paintings from the storage have to do with this video?

149
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,330
The art in this video,

150
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,830
I was the one who switched them, too.

151
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,590
With the same method that I took out the painting in the storage.

152
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,700
If we just take them away, they'll find out immediately, so

153
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,620
we switched them with a fake piece of art.

154

00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,540
What was different that time was...

156
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,860
Kim Si Hyung asked me to put back the original painting.

157
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,610
And bring back the fake painting that Director damaged.

What about my uncle?

159
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,580
Did he say anything?

160
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,480
He just said the frame accidentally got damaged.

161
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,480
He didn't look for me?

162
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,850
Yes.

163
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,250
Why isn't he saying anything?

164
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,480
But...

165
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,240
Why are you asking me to put this back?

166
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,830
Aren't you going to sell this?

167
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,750
You should just do what I say properly. Don't poke your nose around.

168
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,070
So nosy!

169
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,110
He asked you put the original painting back?

170
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,390
If he was going to put it back...

171
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,400
Why did he ask you to do something so complicated?

172
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,690
If we put things chronologically,

173
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,630
Kim Si Hyung asked you to switch the original painting with the fake one containing drugs.

174
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,240
And you recorded the video of the director looking for it.

175
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,740
After the video was recorded,

176
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,020
you put the original painting back in place.

177
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,590
Right?

178
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,220
So their goal was the video.

179
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,900
♫  Everything was crumbling down, a little strange  ♫

180
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,700
♫  So bitter. Just a little much  ♫

181
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,640
♫  That is when you came into my life  ♫

182
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,060
♫  You're just like me  ♫

183
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:19,730
♫  And with you, I know there be more  ♫

184
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,900
♫  I'll show you all the best of me  ♫

185
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,610
♫  You can be the rest of me  ♫

186
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,910
♫  And baby, in time  ♫

187
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,680
♫  You can be mine  ♫

188
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,820
♫  Never going to let you go, and I swear to you that something  ♫

189
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,550
♫  You will be loved  ♫

190
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:46,100
♫  That you will be loved by me  ♫

191
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,970
Oppa.

192
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,210
Why are you here early in the morning?

193
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,150
Let's talk on the way.

194
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,310
I don't have time.

195
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,620
Get in first.

196
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,620
Don't get in.

197
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,160
Don't get in. Take my car.

198
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,920
I'll drop you off so let's take my car.

199
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,130
Mr. Jin.

200
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,330
Talk with me first. You have something to tell me, right?

201
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,140
Let's...

202
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,420
talk while eating breakfast together.

203
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,950
It's because I have something to tell you.

204
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,070
Till when are you going to listen to this nonsense?

205
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,070
I'll contact you after I get off work.

206
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,560
I also have something to tell you.

207
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,140
The Gallery Mond has managed this.

208
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,600
The contract period is going to end soon.

209
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,360
You take over.

210
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,340
You can rent from the art museum's collection,

211
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,130
or if it's not enough, you can buy new ones.

212
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,340
Design it according to your preference.

213
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,590
- Excuse me, Oppa.
- This.

214
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,130
Chatnoir collection?

215
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,380
These days, art museums are hosting more high-end exhibitions.

216
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,270
You can't leave the exhibition hall empty like that.

217
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,210
And it would look sad

218
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,340
to fill with the collection you have right now.

219
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,370
You should show that Cheongsong is still going strong.

220
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,480
An exhibition can't be maintained just because you want to do so.

221
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,980
I already made a deal with Chatnoir.

222
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,660
You just have to decide and it's done.

223
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,870
- Oppa—
- How are you going to call your lawyer?

224
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:47,360
- I think it's better to hire a new lawyer who's more specialized in this instead of Lawyer Cha—
- I heard you met up with my uncle.

225
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,360
Did the professor say that?

226
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,360
I don't know what my uncle said but don't worry about it.

227
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,080
- It's just that the situation is not so good in many ways, so it's confusing—
- I am not worried about that.

228
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,260
That's good.

229
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,110
From now on, I'll just talk about us two.

230
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,380
I was wrong, Dali. I'm sorry.

231
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,540
Oppa.

232
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:45,630
I should've said it when I saw you again, but I couldn't.

233
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,150
I couldn't think of anything.

234
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,420
May he rest in peace.

235
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:08,180
That's when I knew that you're the only woman in my life.

236
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:14,430
In the past, now, and in the future, forever.

237
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,500
- Why are you saying that?
- That's why I regret so much about my decision five years ago.

238
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,600
Because I was young. Because my position in the group was in jeopardy.

239
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,290
Because I was afraid to face the prejudice of a society that emphasizes blood relations.

240
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,490
No matter what excuse I think of,

241
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,690
it's hard to forgive myself for making a decision that cannot be reversed.

242
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:44,880
- Wait, Oppa.
- But I've decided to stop blaming myself and regretting it.

243
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,630
Give me another chance.

244
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:58,690
The mistakes I've made, I will make them up to you

245
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,920
and repent for the rest of my life by your side.

246
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:09,080
And... you should come into my care now.

247
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:16,970
The things you would like to protect, Cheongsong, your father, the art museum. Protect them by my side.

248
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,630
I will not let anyone bother you ever again.

249
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,830
Let's get married.

250

[Cheongsong Art Museum]

251
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,900
[Mr. Jin]

252
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,810
Are you all right?

253
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,210
[Cheongsong Art Museum]

254
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:21,330
You know the risk my director is willing to take by handing over this material to you, right?

255
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,470
If you use someone like that and then abandon him, then you're a really bad person. You'll be punished by the heavens.

256
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,060
Hey, you bitch!

257
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,850
Who do you think you are to ruin my son's life?

258
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,390
Do you think you're so great? Why did you tell on Ahn San Tae?

259
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,930
My gosh! How are we supposed to do our job if they even take the hard drives?

260
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,000
How are we supposed to prepare for our next exhibition?

261
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,570
They even took my name cards and my notebook.

262
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,320
And they took the lunch menu. Why did they take the menu?

263
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,650
Goodness, so why did you leave the office empty without telling?

264
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,710
Do you know what the director and I went through? Oh, Director.

265
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,250
You're already going through a lot. Sorry for adding on to that.

266
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,100
You must've been worried.

267
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,000
I apologize.

268
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,930
What happened? There's a rumor that you're going to a different museum.

269
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,710
- That's...
- That's...

270
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,820
How can a human do that to his own uncle?

271
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,300
So? What are we doing about President Kim?

272
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,020
Don't we have to arrest Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae and President Kim right away?

273
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:56,620
Since I testified as much as I know, the police will take care of everything.

274
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,520
I should've reported him right away. I'm sorry.

275
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,160
It's okay. It must've been hard to reject that kind of offer.

276
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,630
Thank you for testifying.

277
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,700
I... also have something to tell you.

278
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,620
I have something I need to ask for your understanding on.

279
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:31,370
I'm planning to hand over the Basquiat exhibition to another museum.

280
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,820
I know very well that you and my father worked hard for this exhibition.

281
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,290
But I'm not competent enough.

282
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,580
I'm sorry that this was the only choice I could make.

283
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,520
I will look for a museum to hand it over to.

284
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,930
Anyone would take the Basquiat exhibition.

285
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:10,310
And... pieces for the auction will be taken away soon.

286
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:14,190
My uncle withdrew the lawsuits.

287
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:22,990
Director, if it's because of our pay,

288
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:27,590
- I think we can survive for a few more months.
- He's right.

289
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,980
We're a family here, so we should share the pain.

290
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,570
No need. We need to prepare for our next exhibition

291
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,130
and to start a profitable business, we need surplus funds.

292
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,730
We also need to pay off the debt.

293
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,700
Are you settling with Dondon?

294
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,430
Then, are we saying farewell to Director Jin?

295
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,620
Who are you?

296
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,910
Oh? Aren't you the cooks from Dondon?

297
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,050
Oh, that's right.

298
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,840
Are you all right?

299
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,950
I'll call you when I get off work. I have something to tell you.

300
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,850
You're like gamjatang. If you get near it, you become dirty and smell bad.

301
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,070
- What is it?
- Let's go.

302
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,830
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

303
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:30,180

308

That's what you say every time

when our employees skip their meal.

310
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,170
You even cook for them.

311
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,730
It's because of Jang Tae Jin, right?

312
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,670
What did he say?

313
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,030
- Did he tell you to give up on Miss Kim Dali?
- It's nothing like that.

00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,950
If it's not that then...

315
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,520
Then, what is it that makes you look so down like a rain-soaked puppy?

316
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,580
That it even makes you skip a meal which you never do?

317
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,610
What's so great about Jang Tae Jin anyway? He's in Century, so what?

318
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:38,520
We're Dondon! Come on now!

319
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,710
You're embarrassing me.

320
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:46,300
Look at you looking all horrible.

321
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,420
I don't do this to anyone but for you. Look at me.

322
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,700
Open your eyes straight.

323
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,170
Goodness, look at those wrinkles.

324
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,430
Goodness. From a woman's point of view,

325
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,990
I think you're comparable.

326
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,340
You're very handsome.

327
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,990
You're rich, you can make a living, your academic—

328
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:25,470
Well... that's not going to feed you.

329
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:30,210
Your family— Well, you just need to be successful.

330
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,060
Your intellectual—

331
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,600
Intelligent conversation isn't that important.

332
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,750
You've seen soap operas.

333
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,520
Even if you meet conglomerates,

334
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,780
you only get in trouble.

335
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,830
They treat women like gold diggers because they have some money.

336
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,140
You know, right?

337
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,270
And future mothers-in-law throw

338
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,240
water on your face.

339
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,700
And she grabs your hair, shakes it, twists it, and hits you.

340
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,980
Rather than being treated like that,

341
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,720
it's better to meet a guy who's a little lacking.

342
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,100
I'm telling the truth.

343
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,020
Goodness.

344
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,180
You should eat.

345
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,920
Director.

346
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,790
Did I do something wrong? I'm telling you, I'm right.

347
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:25,520
Director! Gosh!

348
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,250
Moo Hak, your thing...

349
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,560
That jerk.

350
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,420
Hey! Hey, Moo Hak.

351
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,010
Hey. Hey!

352
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,130
I'm calling you. This jerk.

353
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,550
What did you mean yesterday?

354
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:04,350
Father will look for his way to live and you'll look for your way?

355
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,880
Are you saying you'll cut family ties with us?

356
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,620
Is that what you're saying?

357
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,270
Can you cut family ties because you want to?

358
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,200
I wish I could do that if I could.

359
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,180
So what are you saying?

360
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,910
You said that you don't like being the son of a gamjatang place.

361
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:27,870
Take the construction company with Father. I will take care of Dondon Gamjatang.

362
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:33,680
Look at this jerk. Who does Dondon F&B belong to?

363
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,160
The president is Father and the executive is me!

364
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,130
You're a mere director.

365
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:45,950
Then I'm sure you know very well that Dondon Holdings which rules Dondon F&B is owned by me, a mere director.

366
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,120
- What?
- Gamjatang...

367
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,220
You used to hate that it smelled and other people looked down on you. So what's up with you all of a sudden?

368
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,170
Let's separate the companies. I'll give you the construction company.

369
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,990
Stop dreaming!

370
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,260
Do you think this will make it work out with Kim Dali?

371
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,820
You... know who's eyeing Kim Dali, right?

372
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,500
I'm sure you noticed when you were going in and out of the museum.

373
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,520
Moo Hak.

374
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,130
No.

375
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,460
It won't work.

376
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:39,590
I'll tell you this as your brother regardless of separating companies or construction companies.

377
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,680
Don't mess with Jang Tae Jin.

378
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,460
We can't manage it if you mess with him.

379
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,080
It'll only take a second for Dondon to collapse.

380
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,030
Is Jang Tae Jin the person above Ahn Sang Tae?

381
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,470
- What?
- What do you have on Jang Tae Jin?

382
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,980
Is it his corruption?

383
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,940
What are you talking about?

384
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,970
What would I be holding?

385
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,840
It's Century.

386
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,040
Don't you know that whether it be a politician or judiciary, they'll crawl for Century?

387
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,160
And there's nothing good about a smaller company like us messing with the big companies.

388
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,960
That's why I'm saying this.

389
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,790
That's why, you punk.

390
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,950
Hold on. Wow, look at the time.

391
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,970
I have a meeting so I'll get going.

392
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,630
I clearly warned you.

393
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,440
Don't mess with Jang Tae Jin. Never.

394
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,560
I want it to be more special. Nothing common like these.

395
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,090
You're not satisfied?

396
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,830
Then...

397
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,460
It's a square mixed cut diamonds.

398
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,810
It's a rare design for a wedding ring...

399
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,160
Then could you wait for a moment, please?

400
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,050
We'll bring out different wedding rings.

401
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,910
[One of a kind ring that Director Jang Tae Jin of Century Group chose]

402
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,740
It's the perfect wedding ring.

403
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,470
Look at the size! It's got to be at least five carats.

404
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,450
- How much?
- Price of a condo.

405
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,570
Who's the bride?

406
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,020
I envy her so much.

407
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:56,240
The museum was fun like doing the frog restaurant.

408
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,320
We got memberships.

409
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,360
We can go every time there's an exhibition and workshops.

410
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,510
But what do we do about our director?

411
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,840
What about him?

412
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,920
Haven't you noticed yet?

413
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,920
Our director has a thing for the art museum's director.

414
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,320
A thing?

415
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,190
Yes! A thing like that for her!

416
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,350
So he got in a fight with Jang Tae Jin and stuff.

417
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:26,210
If Cheongsong settles our director's money,

418
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:31,050
then he won't see the museum director anymore. I don't know what he'll do.

419
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,720
They say out of sight, out of mind.

420
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,940
Jang Tae Jin even got a wedding ring already.

421
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,940
It's game over now.

422
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,340
Out of sight who?

423
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,380
Goodness!

424
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,420
You're here.

425
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,560
What did you just say?

426
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,150
Other artists want to wait and see the result of the investigation.

427
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,050
They were so stubborn.

428
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,460
I couldn't even say a word.

429
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,000
But I think if we go see artists Yoo Yong Sun, Paki, Bu Jae Yeon personally,

430
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,370
I think if we explain our current situation, they might let us present their work.

431
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,810
Then let's start with what we can do now.

432
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,890
Since Artist Yoo Yong Sun and Paki's studio is in the countryside,

433
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:22,900
Curator Song and I will go since we have a car.

434
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,330
Artist Bu's studio is also remote, so it'd be hard to find.

435
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,370
Under who's authority are you clearing up?

436
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:41,710
It's cleared up if you decided to clear it up?

437
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,540
You felt it too, right?

438
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:07,350
That look wasn't between a debtor and a creditor but of lovers, right?

439
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,580
I think you're right.

440
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,680
I think Engineer Hwang's hunch is right.

441
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,090
What hunch?

442
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:21,120
Just now, Director Jin ran into the exhibition room

443
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,740
and so boldly... He was so bold.

444
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,670
Right? Do you know what he said to the director?

445
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:29,230
You're Director and I'm Director Jin.

446
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,950
He came.

447
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,490
"Under whose authority are you clearing up?"

448
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,530
"It's cleared up if you decided to clear it up?"

449
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,890
What a load of crap!

450
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:46,470
"Mr. Jin... I'm not going to clear it up."

451
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,960
There you go. Just like that.

452
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,790
Seriously, you guys.

453
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,220
We shouldn't do this but...

454
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,720
Is there something we can hear better?

455
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,950
I can hear everything.

456
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,080
What do you have now that you can afford to pay me back?

457
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,840
Especially with the exhibitions taken down.

458
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,620
Is this the time for it?

459
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,080
We can by handing over the Basquiat Exhibition.

460
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,940
And put our art pieces up for auction.

461
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,620
If you could do that, you would've done it sooner.

462
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,780
But there must have been a reason you didn't.

463
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,300
It was because of my greed.

464
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,300
What?

465
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:55,190
My greed not wanting to sell a nice piece for cheap. My greed to hold a good exhibition in our museum.

466
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:01,480
Because of that greed, I didn't think of the damage it could cause you.

467
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:08,840
Thank you!
[Dondon Gamjatang]

468
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,820
You ran and delivered food in the busy markets.

469
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,560
Counting money one by one with your small hands.

470
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,690
And then running again because you got another order. When I think about your childhood,

471
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,710
my heart hurts.

472
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,780
♫ From my sad gestures  ♫

473
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,330
That is why your money felt more of a burden

474
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,730
than the other creditors' money.

What do you mean by that?

476
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,040
I mean, I was very selfish all this time.

477
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,380
I only thought about my situation

478
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,520
and I did not consider your point of view.

479
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,200
You suffered a lot of financial damage because of me.

480
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,460
You were also probably in a very awkward situation at home or at work, too.

481

I want to pay back at least the money that I borrowed.

482

I decided this and already got permission.

You only did what you had to do, Dali.

484
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,610
Is it because of the person who lives with my dad?

No, it's not like that.

486

487

- Mr. Jin.
- I heard Jang Tae Jin was searching for a ring to propose to you, is it because of that?

488
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,200
No.

489

He is insecure about that bit of connection disappearing.

508

Tell me about it. If he knows so much about love,

512
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,870
why did he live like that all by himself?

513
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,540

There are rumors saying he got a huge wedding ring made.
