Why is the Director so obsessed with Dali?

5
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,510
Because... without having to lift a finger,

6
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,150
the director gets the finest research papers from Dali, time and time again.

7
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,760
Not only that but Dali's from a wealthy family.

You're surviving on sweets, again?

16
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,250
Well, science says that humans store about 160,000 calories in their bodies.

17
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,600
If you calculate that the average human requires about 1,600 calories per day,

18
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,010
this means we can survive at least three months on stored energy.

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,110
[Father]

159
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,450
Yes?

160
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,970
Are you playing with money behind my back?

161
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,770
What do you mean by "play with money"? Out of nowhere.

162
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,880
Did you loan money to some art gallery or a museum?

163
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,430
I'm telling you I never done that—

164
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,430
Do we have an infinite well of money? I would be crazy to lend money to a place like that.

165
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,040
Then, why is Cheongsong Art Museum sending you this kind of chamber-pot crap?

166
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,940
When I asked them about it, they said they sent it to thank you for loaning them money.

167
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,040
Gosh, so unnecessary...

168
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,240
I said I don't know. There must be some kind of misunderstanding.

169
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,820
Don't break someone else's chamber-pot crap

170
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,060
and leave it with Secretary Yeo. I'll send her over now.

171
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,920
I don't want to hear it. Where are you right now? You're still at the company since there was a new menu tasting, right?

172
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,630
I'm not at the company. I'm at the airport!

173
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,240
I have a business trip today for the Netherland Pig Raising Association contract.

174
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,980
Postpone that business trip and get back here! Come back and–

175
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,300
Father! Father! They're telling me I need to hang up because the plane is departing.

176
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,750
He-Hello! He-Hello!

177
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,070
What the hell?

178
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,110
Damn it.

179
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,410
This punk...

180
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,930
Why, you!

181
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,260
Hey!

182
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,980
Move!

183
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,270
Stop right there!

184
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,440
You punk!

185
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,780
Hey! Stop right there!

186
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,630
I'll go and earn my keep.

187
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,120
You won't have a penny when you get back, you punk! What are you doing? Take this out!

188
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,020
- Yes, Sir!
- Hurry up and get it out!

189
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,780
It won't budge!

190
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,760
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable right now.

191
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,630
Why isn't he answering the phone?

192
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,680
Art museum?

193
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,620
It's not an ordinary art museum, it's Cheongsong.

194
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,750
You know, right? If you don't get invited to their year-end party, even if you're a conglomerate,

195
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,990
you get looked down upon.

196
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,370
Why is that kind of place borrowing money from me?

197
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,850
Technically speaking, it's an investment.

198
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:09,250
If Cheongsong sells even one of their paintings, they get an enormous amount of money. Why would they be in debt to us?

199
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,830
Then tell them to sell a painting!

200
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,820
You punk... Seriously?

201
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,660
How long are you going to be looked down upon for being the son of a gamjatang restaurant owner?

202
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,670
What?

203
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,620
Just having money doesn't mean you're in the upper class. What we need is status.

204
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,130
And that's why we need Cheongsong.

205
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:35,160
So... you're saying that, if we lend money to Cheongsong, then our status will rise immediately to conglomerates?

206
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,850
Who uses the word "conglomerate" these days? They call it "inner circle."

207
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,130
Now, that's how you build a network.

208
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,790
That's how business works. The Republic of Korea has always been like this.

209
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,150
That's enough. If you're going to talk about something like that, I'm leaving.

210
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,110
Are you doing this because I'm not your biological brother?

211
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:02,400
- Brother.
- If I was Father's real biological son, then

212
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,260
I wouldn't be asking you for such a pathetic favor.

213
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,490
It's because this is such a good opportunity, Moo Hak, right?

214
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,830
The person you are trying to reach—

215
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,530
I don't know. I lent my own money,

216
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,730
so what can Father do about that?

217
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,250
Call the General Affairs Department right now and tell them to cut off all of Director Jin's cards!

218
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,680
Excuse me? The director is leaving on a business trip to the Netherlands right now–

219
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,280
Stop the business trip to the Netherlands, too!

220
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,320
- Hurry up and go!
- Yes, Sir!

221
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,290
I told you to finish before the audience comes, what are you doing here?

222
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,160
Mr. Hwang.

223
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,710
Mr. Hwang!

224
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,710
It's beautiful.

225
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,790
It's how I can withstand this place, even though I'm getting paid a small salary.

226
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:12,270
Would jjajangmyeon be good or jjamppong?
(T/N: black bean sauce noodles and spicy seafood noodle soup, respectively)

227
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,510
Excuse me?

228
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,110
I'm talking about lunch.

229
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,750
Oh, right. Curator Song, have you decided?

230
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,510
Wait, then you weren't just appreciating the art?

231
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,830
It's too difficult to choose what to eat for lunch.

232
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,580
It's the conundrum of life.

233
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,940
In some ways, it seems like you've succeeded at life,

234
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,610
if your hardest conundrum in life is what to eat for lunch.

235
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,550
Oh, Gong Joo, the general manager hasn't come to work yet. Right?

236
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,290
I don't think so.

237
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,380
Who did this?

238
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,010
Yes? This is Kim Nak Chun.

239
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,000
What? What did you say?

240
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,020
You, can you take responsibility for what you said?

241
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,140
Oh! Director!

242
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,600
You already came to work?

243
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,920
Did you stay here all night?

244
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,990
I had something to take care of.

245
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,260
I said you didn't have to do that, but you're still doing it.

246
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,380
Thank you.

247
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,850
That's dangerous. You need to be mindful due to your age.

248
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,190
- Have you eaten?
- What?

249
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,130
O-Of course.

250
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,430
You haven't eaten. Hurry and go eat, that way you can take your medicine.

251
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,400
Why do you think Doctor Han requested me to take care of you?

252
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,260
The things most harmful to the heart are stress, overworking, and forgetting to take your medicine.

253
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,520
Your nagging is worse than my daughter's.

254
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,670
But why are you here so early in the morning? What are those blueprints?

255
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,570
Oh, right. You know, Writer Na Ru.

256
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,690
He said the work had to hang from the ceiling.

257
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,170
The whole thing weighs about 100 kg.

258
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,720
Will the gallery's ceiling

259
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,890
be able to endure this?

260
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,680
Yes?

261
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:27,170
Director, the work that came from New York yesterday is strange. I think someone tampered with it.

262
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,730
What do you mean? I checked everything before I left.

263
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,090
Oh, that... I went because I had to check something

264
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,150
but I made a mistake.

265
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:42,870
That work is fine, but I think the frame needs to be fixed.

266
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,250
What exactly were you checking that you made a mistake like that?

267
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,410
Oh, since I'm getting old

268
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,530
the strength in my legs just sometimes gives out.

269
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,110
I will hurry and go get that fixed.

270
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,840
Will you do that? Okay.

271
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,390
For this, ask the Safety Department of Facility Management

272
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,970
and then we can come up with an idea with Mr. Hwang.

273
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,460
All right.

274
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,010
All right then.

275
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,040
Mrs. Koch?

276
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,500
What are you doing here? You said you were going to the airport.

277
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,840
I just got a call that my mother collapsed. I'm on my way to the hospital.

278
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,060
Oh, no.

279
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,840
Thankfully, she's in stable condition,

280
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,060
but Dali, I'll need you to go to the airport for me.

281
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,140
Me?

282
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,740
The important guest today is Jin Hitonari,

283
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,850
a world-famous Japanese collector.

284
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,530
Korean-Japanese, I believe.

285
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,580
Anyways, his knowledge on art could give any expert a run for their money,

286
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,960
so I can't trust anyone but you.

287
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,940
He has such great influence on the arts association that,

288
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,340
without him, there will be no exhibition for us this year.

289
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,260
You get how important he is?

290
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,760
Okay, don't worry about anything else. Just kiss up to him.

291
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,910
You know how crazy rich people are.

292
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,560
Except you, of course.

293
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,640
Here's the keys to my car, right there. Okay?

294
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,420
Oh, but wait...

295
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,350
You're not going to the party wearing that, are you?

296
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,140
Yes. I just got here.
[Amsterdam Airport]

297
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,030
Well, I just slept a bit.

298
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,220
Oh, really?

299
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,000
It is indeed far, right?

300
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,150
Don't touch it!

302
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,380
- How dare you try to steal from me.
- What...

303
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,770
Leave it! Leave it!

304
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,400
Okay. Okay.

305
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,980
That old man's temper.

306
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,800
It was nothing.

307
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,930
Did you buy a pair of shoes?

308
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:36,140
Don't worry. I brought an extra pair to wear at the hotel.

309
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,390
But the party it's nothing too fancy or extravagant, right?

310
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,260
It's something similar to a welcome party on a farm, so you don't need to worry too much.

311
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,980
Still, you know that getting a contract is easier when

312
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,860
you build close relationships with people.

313
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,940

Excuse me?

344
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,400
It's ridiculously expensive because it's first class.

345
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,860
It isn't that different from economy.

Even if you succeed in the future, don't ride in first class.

You can buy some gamjatang with that money instead. That's more worth it.

I'm sorry?

350
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,010
How many bowls of gamjatang could you buy with that money?

351
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,680
First-class is around ₩20 million and the economic ones are ₩1 million...

352
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,830
Since it's ₩30,000 for a two-serving bowl of gamjatang... three six...

353
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,880
That would be 633 bowls, rounded up.

What?

355
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,350
If it's for one person, that would be 1,266 bowls.

I apologize. I also didn't realize I started to calculate–

No, not at all. That's a great attitude.

358
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,580
You have to get in the habit of calculating everything immediately,

359
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,990
so that not even one ₩10 coin is wrong.

Is ₩20 million nothing to you?

Even if they all pretend as if they're dignified and elegant,

371
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,230
it's about money in the end. Money.

Oh, it's a modern reinterpretation of a farmhouse built in the 1700s.

376
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,620
Isn't it beautiful?

377
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,090
Well, it must have cost a bit.

378
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,270
Are these low-class people usually this extravagant or vain?

379

Excuse me?

380
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:26,640
This is more of a party to show off their money than a welcoming party.

381
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,830
And why are these paintings hanging here? It's distracting.

382

Although it's a bitter fact, money and art go hand in hand.

Indeed, I have. I don't know whether to call it a relief.

I've heard so much about you.

412
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,890
This is Grunberg, the chairman of the association. He says it's an honor to meet you.

413
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,250
It's my pleasure.

414
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,250
This is Mr. Schultz. He says it's nice to meet you.

Do you have any free time tomorrow?

418
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,600
She wants to know if you're free tomorrow.

419
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,760
She says welcome.

420
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,820
It's such a pleasure.

421
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,690
You're so handsome.

422
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,440
Okay. Okay. That is quite enough, everyone. You know, it's not every day we get to invite such a distinguished guest.

423
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,950
We must take this opportunity to hear what he has to say about my collection.

424
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,740

The collection? My thoughts?

00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,580
All of a sudden?

428
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:06,410
Just share a few words about a piece of art that you like.

429
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,640
Still, you know that getting a contract is easier when

430
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,230
you build close relationships with people.

431
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,150
I can't get used to this part.

432
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,100
Okay.

433
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,800
All of the pieces of art are big...

434
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,600
have pretty colors and are beautiful...

435
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,910
Madam Bronckhorst boasts a fine collection, full of high-quality artworks

436
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,650
that are no less important than great collections seen in galleries.

437
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,180
Among them...

438
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,160
The artworks are bold, imposing, grand, and majestic,

439
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,110
with a dazzling feast of colors capturing...

440
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,220
and exhibiting the essence of art.

441
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,730
- Among them...
- Which, in my opinion, clearly displayed...

442
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,400
the sophisticated feature of the collection's owner.

443
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:18,120
Among them, my favorite piece is...

444
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,440
When it comes to art no work is greater than another.

445
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,610
However, the one that has caused a stir in my heart is...

446
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,640
That painting of a pig.

447
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,650
The picture of a pig.

448
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,500
- What?
- The pig?

449
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,320
The pig?

450
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,100
Really?

451
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,010
Now.

452
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,500
If you look at the white fur, long body, and droopy ears,

453
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,150
they are typical of the Landrace pig breed,

454
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,490
but as you can see, their backs and thighs are...

455
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,520
thicker than normal Landrace pigs.

456
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,390
I presume these are Dutch Landrace pig breeds.

457
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:56,990
The white bristles, long body, and droopy ears would make you think that this is your typical Landrace breed.

458
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,640
But if you look at the back and the thighs,

459
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,860
You'll see it's thicker than your common Landrace. This means,

460
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:08,330
I suspect, is a Dutch Landrace pig.

461
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,060
There's something we shouldn't miss here.

462
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,570
A special aspect of this painting that we must not miss...

463
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,830
This pig here.

464
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:26,760
- Is this pig right here. It looks especially lethargic, right? The other pigs are feeding on food,
- It looks especially unwell...

465
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,170
but it's the only one that's lying down and lethargic. In additionally,

466
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,810
this red and black tar-like feces

467
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,060
that are dirty around the anus,

468
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,950
Its anus.

469
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:44,320
- this poop is...
- This poo.

470
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,970
- Poop?
- Poop?

471
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,520
It's proliferative enteritis.

472
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,130
Proliferative enteritis.

473
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:57,830
When the feces reaches this point, it means that they will die soon. Die.

474
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:02,980
When the excrement is in a state like this, it means it's on the brink of death.

If you quarantine it immediately so that it doesn't spread the virus to the other pigs,

477
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,840
you will save yourself from losing

478

even a single penny.

479
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,230
The owner must isolate this pig from the others

480
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,400
so it cannot infect the rest of them.

481
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,340
That way, the owner can minimize the damage.

482

If this is genuine, I'd say at least 120 million.

That makes no sense. How could this be worth ₩120 million?

No, not won. Euros. It's €120 million.

505

Wait, if this is €120 million, then in Korean won, it's...

506
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:03,060
It'll be about ₩160 billion.

Nonsense. That can't be.

523

At first glance, it looks like a painting by Modigliani,

but if you look closer, it appears to be...

525

No, it must be a forgery by Elmyr de Hory.

Absurd. Do you have any idea how much I paid for this painting?

527

Did you purchase it legally from a respectable dealer?

528
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:00,840
Of course, I did. What do you take me for? Why would I purchase it illegally?

Then, may I take a look at the back of the canvas?

530

Unlike other forgers,

531

Elmyr always hid his signature on the back.

00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,450
Um... I'm sorry but do you have another card, Sir?

628
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,980
I'm saying, this is a black card...

629
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,850
Do you have another card?

630
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:17,970
Geez.

631
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:26,690
- Very good. Thank you.
- It is a black card though.

632
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,240
If you freeze my card when I'm on a business trip, what do you expect me to do?

633
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,780
I have no cash and the business team arrives tomorrow.

634
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:51,670
So, forget about what the chairman said and unfreeze it right now. Otherwise, I'll...

635
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,470
Manager Kim. Manager...

636
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,420
Manager Kim, you son of a...

637
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:06,120
- Is there a problem?
- Excuse me?

638
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,200
No problem. Everything is worked out,

639
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,020
so you can go now.

640
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,190
- Thank you for today.
- Are you really all right?

641
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:19,760
Of course. You can go. Go.

642
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,630
You go in first.

643
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:27,820
Then, shall I?

644
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,970
Thank you.

645
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,960
Go.

646
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,440
Thank you.

647
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,750
You scared me!

648
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:24,730
Is it too far to walk to the airport from here?

649
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,580
I've been meaning to have a meeting with Mr. Jin

650
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,630
to talk about the cafe.

651
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,020
I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you.

652
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,930
Forget about the cafe. That's not the problem right now.

653
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,580
- I need you to give back the investment money.
- Pardon?

654
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,820
My father found out about the money I lent you. He's going crazy.

655
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,050
This is a disaster.

656
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,930
Why did you have to send that useless chamber pot? Damn it.

657
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,940
What do you mean?

658
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,550
Excuse me for a moment.

659
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:24,620
How dare you come here?

660
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,180
You can't. You can never, Uncle.

661
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,600
Still, I can't bury the truth.

662
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:58,360
If something is rotting it must be carved out. If there's been a mistake, you have to fix it right away.

663
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,700
I said I was fine. I can't put a poor international student in an awkward position...

664
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:29,510
You aren't poor...

665
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,200
What's going on?

666
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:35,990
Mrs. Prinsen is on vacation, so the house is a mess.

667
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:37,710
You're living off someone.

668
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,370
Oh, I thought...

669
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,770
You can sleep here.

670
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:45,490
The bathroom is over there. There are enough towels so you can use whatever you need.

671
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,210
Do you need anything else?

672
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,020
I'm fine.

673
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:53,430
But don't do this again. You don't even know what kind of person I am and you let me enter your house.

674
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,120
Especially without the owner of the house.

675
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,730
Do you know how dangerous the world is?

676
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:03,300
Unable to speak English, with no money, and cards cut off. Do I just leave a person like that?

677
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,910
When others do you a favor, just saying thank you is enough.

678
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:12,240
What kind of naive person would say that nonsense?

679
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,770
My father.

680
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:18,820
Your father is an admirable man.

681
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,480
Okay, then...

682
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,550
Wait.

683
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,190
Since you already did it, could you do one more favor?

684
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,870
Aren't you hungry?

685
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:32,570
I ate a little at the party, but you didn't eat anything all day.

686
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,500
You're right.

687
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,320
♫ What should I say about going ♫

688
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,220
♫ on a path that didn't exist? ♫

689
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:51,460

00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,720

♫ It's the moment I've been waiting for ♫

692
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:02,190
What is this? Is the owner a hotel chef?

693
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,350
♫ I wonder how great it would be? ♫

694
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:07,390
Is there anything special you can't eat?

695
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,020
No.

696
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:12,140

Miss Dali,

707
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:41,700
- the salt...
- I'm worried since I can't get in touch with you.

708
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,020
I would appreciate it if you could contact me as soon as you get this message.

Excuse me, Miss Dali.

713
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,630
Julien, I'm sorry for calling so late.

714
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:00,770
Didn't you do business with Jin Hitonari last year?

715
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:04,450
Do you happen to know where Hitonari might have stayed in Amsterdam?

725
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,430
Dear Nakamura Sumire. This is Kim Dali from St. Müller Art Gallery.

726
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:37,080
I was supposed to pick Jin Hitonari at the Schiphol Airport this afternoon.

727
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,810
But there must have been a slight misunderstanding as I was unable to pick him up.

728
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:45,070
I cannot reach him, and he didn't come to the hotel he was supposed to stay at.

729
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,360
If you get a call from Mr. Jin—

730
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,250
Let's eat first. Eat first.

731
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:53,480
Studying and making money are all done so that we can eat and live.

732
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,890
I'm sorry.

733
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,520
A rich or poor person,

734
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,480
good or bad,

735
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,720
one thing that is common to all is eating three meals a day.

736
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,020
You have to make sure you eat well and don't miss a meal.

737
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,940
Eat up.

738
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,590
It tastes really good.

739
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:26,400
How could it taste like this?

740
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,230
I was able to get merchants in the market to spend their emergency money on my food at the age of eleven.

741
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:34,030
This much is just being modest.

742
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:37,400
If this were my kitchen, I would have made a perfect meal.

743
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,590
No, this is... this is totally perfect.

744
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,010
Are you studying while working part-time at the art museum?

745
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,390
You could say that.

746
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:54,460
It's nice that you can see art and earn money.

747
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,550
Do you like art?

748
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:01,060
Of course.

749
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,420
Is there anyone who hates art?

750
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,780
We have a nice and big painting hanging in our living room, too.

751
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,010
And I admire it every day. Morning and night.

752
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:12,390
What kind of art is it?

753
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,450
How can people live only on food?

754
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:24,990
We should also live by the smell of money.

755
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:27,290
Oh! It's so pretty.

756
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:31,110
This is art. Is art anything special?

757
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,210
How many hours has it been?!

758
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:41,300
You're making it impossible for me to admire my art!

759
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,330
You're so unbelievable.

760
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:48,770
You won't know it. It's an Oriental painting.

761
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:52,190
When I was an undergraduate, I majored in the history of Oriental art.

762
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,050
If you tell me who the artist is–

763
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,930
Does it matter who painted it or how much it costs?

764
00:59:56,930 --> 01:00:02,770
If the viewer is satisfied and happy, I think that makes it a great work of art.

765
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:09,240
It's really hard to have your own aesthetic standards without being influenced by the current trend or the market.

766
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,520
You must really love that painting.

767
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,890
Very much.

768
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:17,730
Then if you have time after work, please visit our art museum.

769
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:21,440
Although it's a small gallery, we have quite a few works by artists that Koreans like,

770
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,660
such as Gogh, Seurat, Cézanne, Gauguin.

771
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,170
Koreans?

772
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:35,400
Oh, right. Impressionists are popular not only in Korea but also around the world.

773
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,660
Of course, it won't be as good as your food, but the cafeteria food at the museum is pretty good.

774
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:45,090
If you have time, please stop by. I'll show you around.

775
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:51,490
A museum and a cafe...

776
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,720
It sounds like a date.

777
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:03,950
I felt this from the first time I saw you, but you're cra–

778
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:07,410
I mean, you seem like an interesting person.

779
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:08,630
I do?

780
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:12,660
Your shoes, the way you calculate everything by bowls of gamjatang,

781
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,760
and earlier at the party too.

782
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:20,720
Anyway, you are the most interesting person I've ever met.

783
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,880
♫ You made me laugh with your pure smile ♫

784
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:31,020

♫ It's strange how we met ♫

792

♫ How did I fall in love at first sight? ♫

793
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:23,750
♫ It must be a fate that is not easy to explain ♫

♫ I'm the only one for you ♫

795
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:33,490
What's going on?

796

What's going on now?

01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,660
Miss Dali?

798
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,560
Miss Dali.

799
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,670
What's going on?

800
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:52,170
What happened? Where are you?

801
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:59,720
Miss Dali. Miss Dali.

802
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,490
Miss... Dali.

803
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,580
Miss Dali.

812
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,400
That watch is very important to me.

813
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,380
I will definitely be there, so you have to wait for me.

814
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:28,490
You dared to betray Jin Moo Hak?

815
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,450
You die!

816
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,400
I'm looking to liquidate my assets except for the art museum.

817
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,120
I will find you no matter what!

818
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,550
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

819
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:43,330
Do you want to find that watch or that woman?

820
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:47,460
I can't do this. If I just sit around, I'll get betrayed again.

821
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,060
Give me my money. My money!

822
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:52,070
Mr. Jin?
