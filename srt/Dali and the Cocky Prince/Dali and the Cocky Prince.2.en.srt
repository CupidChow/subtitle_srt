You cooked delicious food and are even washing the dishes.

You really don't have to do this.

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,160
Usually, cooking begins with preparing the ingredients

- Sorry?

How can you make a joke with such a serious face?

16
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,770
I wasn't joking though.

17
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,680
I'm a serious and reserved type of person.

All of this feels weird. It's like a dream.

♫ How did I fall in love at first sight? ♫

165
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,970
♫ It must be a fate that is not easy to explain ♫

166
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,410
I did it!

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:30,630
♫ I'm the only one for you, I'll give you this love ♫

168
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,670
Where did she say the art museum was?

169
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,160
I don't even know her number.

170
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,310
Oh! Just a moment. Sorry, sorry.

171
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,370
Miss Dali.

172
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,160
Woah! Watch where you're going!

173
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,810
Miss Dali!

174
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,680
Miss Dali!

175
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,720
Miss Dali!

176
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Here.

177
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,400
Here.

178
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,710
How can you find someone without even knowing if it's their real name or fake name?

179
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:53,180
You also said you went to her house. What's the name of the town?

180
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,960
I drove there in the middle of the night, how would I know that?

181
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,150
It is in Amsterdam, right?

182
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,630
That...

183
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,260
Did you perhaps dream all this?

184
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,750
No!

185
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,520
No, I—

186
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,820
even cooked for her and had fun talking.

187
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,090
Right, I went to a party and put a hole in a painting worth 160 billion won.

188
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,990
1,600 won?

189
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,600
Seriously? I said it was 160 billion won. 160 billion won! Billion!

190
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,800
Miss Dali!

191
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,890
So, it was a dream.

192
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,600
Wait, Director.

193
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,030
Where's your watch?

194
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,140
What?

195
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,530
Your wristwatch.

196
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,520
- I told you to leave it because it's so valuable.
- She's wearing a hat with crow feathers.

197
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,930
Oh, that.

198
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,130
No, why? What's the matter? She could have passed by!

199
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,500
Don't tell me it was that girl.

[National Museum]

201
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,880
- She has a hat with a crow feather on top.
- I'm sorry, I don't–

202
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,500
She only says incredibly smart things that are hard for you to understand, right?

203
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,860
How did you know?

204
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,140
And she laughed at everything you said.

205
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,030
Yes.

206
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,510
She doesn't seem like it, but she can calculate things really quickly, right?

207
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,750
Yes, that's what happened.

208
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,350
In technical terms, we call women like her thieves.
[St. Müller Kunst Galerig]

209
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,660
- You're saying she left?
- I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

210
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,460
Does it make sense that she'd quit her job and disappear because of one watch?

211
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,520
She could if the watch was worth several hundred million won.

212
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,180
But she was crying in front of the hotel.

213
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,120
That's acting, of course!

214
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,470
No, she isn't that kind of person.

215
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,250
There has to be some kind of reason.

216
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,160
There's no such thing as an merciless thief in this world.

217
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,390
Mr. Jin, you are so funny.

218
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,920
When others do you a favor, just saying thank you is enough.

219
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,680
It wasn't any sort of fate.

220
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,610
According to the Mahayana Buddhist Vinaya Sutra, three thousand kalpas have gone by for us to meet.

221
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,050
That's how precious our connection is.

222

How dare you deceive Jin Moo Hak?

223

[Director Kim Nak Chun of Cheongsong Art Museum dies.]

228
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,400
At Cheongsong Art Museum Director Kim Nak Chun's funeral,

229
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,280
mourners lined up today as well.

230
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,920
As the eldest son of Cheongsong Art Museum, the deceased, who has always practiced true noblesse oblige throughout his life,

231
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,200
has dedicated his entire life to expanding the future and base of Korean art,

232
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,050
by providing support for artistic activities to culturally marginalized children.

233
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,520
There is no way to contain my sorrow at the shock of losing a giant in the art world

234
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,640
and the eldest member of our family...

235
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,400
Just a moment, please.

236
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,690
I'm...

237
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,880
I'm sorry.

238
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,530
There is no way to express the sadness and shock of losing

239
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,580
the eldest member of our family overnight.

240
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,350
However, I, Kim Si Hyung, as Cheongsong's eldest grandson and as the representative of the bereaved family,

241
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,630
will run the Cheongsong Art Museum with the unwavering support of my uncle,

242
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,300
- and will carry out the cultural welfare projects he has been doing so far–
- Oh! Isn't that...

244
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,880
Century Director Jang Tae Jin?

245
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,000
Oh, I think that's him.

246
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,100
- Jang Tae Jin!
- It's Jang Tae Jin!

247
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,170
I didn't... I didn't finish talking!

248
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,350
- Are you Director Jang Tae Jin?
- How do you feel?

249
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,290
Please say one word!

250
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,020

Palda Auction.

252

I heard that Cheongsong Art Museum is having a hard time these days.

253

We will offer you much better options than the other auction companies.

254
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,520
- Please feel free to contact me if you have any collections that you want to get rid of. Just a moment–
- Excuse me.

255
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,920
Who is being so unreasonable...?

256
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,260
"I pray for the well-being of the deceased."

257
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:20,060
That is what you say when you can't think of condolences to say to the bereaved family in grief.

258
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,880
If you don't know, memorize it.

259
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,290
I'm sorry.

260
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,060
I pray for the well-being of the deceased.

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,460
Thank you for coming.

That's Century Group's Director, Jang Tae Jin, right?

263
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,330
How dare he come here.

264
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,420
Why? Did something happen?

265
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,880
He was going to marry the director's daughter...

266
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,960

267
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,100

268
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,530
It's a lie, right? Tell me it's a lie.

269
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,240
Tell me it's a lie...

270
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,420
It's okay.

271
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,610
It's okay.

272
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,130
It seems that more mourners will be coming in. Please take care of it so that the family does not have to concern themselves about it.

273
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,410
Yes, I will take care of it.

274
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,110
Also, I would like to know more about the financial situation of the Cheongsong Art Museum.

275
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,470
Discreetly.

- Father.
- What are you thinking about that's making you lose your mind?

280
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,540
No, it's just that...

281
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,030
I have lots of things to think about.

282
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,010
Moo Hak hasn't come to work yet.

283
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:04,630
He must've felt fatigued. He's been so busy preparing for the Netherlands.

284
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,820
Don't worry too much. He said he'll be back to work tomorrow.

285
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,470
Which art museum was it again?

286
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,110
- Pardon?
- I'm talking about the one Moo Hak lent money to.

287
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,630
- Cheong...
- Why are you asking about that place?

288
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,890
It's a legit place, right?

289
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,260
I'm sure Moo Hak will look into it and take care of it.

290
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,300
You know, Moo Hak is quite meticulous when it comes to money.

291
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,260
Well, you're right.

292
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,380
- Goodbye.
- Yes, yes.

293
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,100
Three thousand eons?

294
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,970
What a load of crap.

295
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,130
Are you going to be fooled,

296
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,480
after being captivated by Buddha Confucius?

297
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,900
Even with just the minute hand on that watch costs...

298
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,420
how many bowls of gamjatang (Potato and pork stew) is that?

299
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,130
Seriously, come on!

300
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,250
No... no, no, no.

301
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,050
In times like these, you have to eat and cheer up.

302
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,170
Even if she's hiding in the North Pole, I'll strangle a penguin.

303
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,430
And if she's hiding in the South Pole, I'll hit a polar bear in the stomach.

304
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,380
I will undoubtedly find her. Undoubtedly!

305
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,790
Polar bears live in the North Pole and penguins live in the South Pole.

306
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,810
You scared me!

307
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,700
Did you follow your sick boss home to point that out?

308
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,230
I thought you couldn't even drink water

309
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,490
because your voice sounded like it was dying, so I brought these for you to drink–

310
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:38,070
Did someone die? Why would I starve?

311
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:44,340
You're right. Why did I uselessly worry about you?

312
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,290
- It looks good.
- How is the Netherlands thing going?

313
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,040
About that...

314
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,560
I mean, we paid so much for the deposit

315
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,150
and the private investigator can't even find one person?

316
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,280
That's how it is in the Netherlands.

317
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,610
It's a place where they don't live in a fast-paced environment.

318
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,200
Contact the private investigator again,

319
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,650
and tell them if they find her, we'll give them ten times the deposit.

320
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,440
All right. What?

321
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,200
Ten times the deposit?

322
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,540
I can't even bother him about it because I'm not there,

323
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,620
so that amount of money will incentivize him to get to work. Right?

324
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,900
I'm asking because I'm really just curious,

325
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,970
but do you want to find that watch or that woman?

326
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,390
Of course, it's...

327
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,420
the watch!

328
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:57,220
Of course, it is. I misunderstood.

329
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,620
Have you asked the bank about postponing the loan repayment date yet?

330
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,190
About that... everyone was so busy,

331
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,500
so I decided to go back again today.

332
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,110
So far, this is the status of the loan we identified.

333
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,230
This financial situation is much worse than I expected.

334
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,130
I've heard that running an art museum is like pouring water into a bottomless jar,

335
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,440
but I didn't think it would be this bad.

336
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,190
He gave all his wealth back to society,

337
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,630
but he was actually confined to a museum full of debt.

338
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,620
And in this big house, he didn't hire anyone to help out with it.

339
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:09,410
He was my friend for 40 years, but

340
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:14,390
I don't know whether to respect him or say he's a fool.

341
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,030
He was such a foolish person.

342
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,060
I'm thinking of dissolving all of my assets except for the art museum,

343
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,340
including this house.

344
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,080
Lawyer Cha, if you could find the right buyer...

345
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,020
Trying to sell real estate with development restrictions won't work.

346
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,420
Besides, all of that was already secured by the bank.

347
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,500
The inheritance tax will come out soon. Do you have any countermeasures for that?

348
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,680
If it comes to it,

349
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,440
you might have to give up your inheritance.

350
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,650
Where are you going when you're still sick?

351
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,520
I have to stop by the hospital, and I have things to take care of at the bank.

352
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,670
If it's an errand at the bank, you could just tell me to do it.

353
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,320
It's my personal business, so why would I tell you to do it?

354
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,540
How would I trust you?

355
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,370
I'm doing this out of urgency.

356
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,830
The repayment date is coming up, but I haven't been able to see him or get in contact with him.

357
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:46,380
If you let me know where he is, I will go find him myself. I'm begging you, please.

358
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,440
- The branch manager is not in Korea right now.
- Pardon?

359
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,830
He went to South Africa to attend the International Financial Symposium, so he won't be back here for a while.

360
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,930
You see, he's going to Stockholm right after his stay in South Africa.

361
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,820
Because of the global economic forum.

362
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,190
Also, he said he was going to New York for his daughter's wedding,

363
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,100
so I also don't know when he'll be returning.

364
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,380
Sir.

365
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,110
Dali!

366
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,120
When did he return to Korea...

367
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:37,630
So far, we've never been late on our interest and my credit rating is not bad.

368
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,970
If you ask me to repay you so suddenly...

369
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,350
Please help me this one time.

370
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,980
I'll do whatever I can to resolve it quickly, so—

371
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,330
Sir!

372
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,770
Let me ask you for a favor, Dali.

373
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,390
Please save me.

374
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:02,080
I think I'm about to die right now because of your father.

375
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,190
The credit rating is not the problem. Your father was your credit.

376
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,790
But your father died! Without telling me.

377
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:16,090
There are rumors that the Cheongsong Art Museum is being handed over.

378
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,870
Even if we put everything else aside, let's address our bank issues first. Okay?

379
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,250
We have to do that no matter what!

380
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,300
Dali... are we strangers?

381
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,270
I'm your father's friend.

382
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:40,850
Dali... please, please save me.

383
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,180
Did you come to the bank to update your bankbook?

384
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,720
I said to turn your head away.

385
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:16,460
In a world where one bank app can do transactions, account transfers, and currency exchange,

386
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,550
what are paper bankbooks?

387
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,130
Money is only money when you can touch it with your hands,

388
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:27,080
see it with your eyes, and stamped it with numbers.

389
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,110
And if I get hacked, will you take responsibility?

390
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,380
How can someone who is so suspicious and wary

391
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,130
fall for an unknown woman and lose that expensive watch?

392
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,410
What do you mean, I fell for her?

393
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,090
All right.

394
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,360
I didn't get the monthly rent again!

395
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,920
Was she pretty?

396
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,290
What?

397
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,790
I'm asking if she was pretty, that Netherlands woman.

398
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,280
I keep telling you it wasn't like that.

399
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,140
That means her body must've been amazing.

400
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,730
I told you it wasn't like that!

401
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:37,510
If it's not that too, were you drugged with something like sleeping pills?

402
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,540
Really?

403
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,890
Then, what is it?

404
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:44,210
How the hell does someone get set up

405
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,550
to lose their watch and not even know it?

406
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,450
As long as you're not crazy,

407
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:53,070
you probably wouldn't have put it on her wrist yourself. Right?

408
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,420
Then, goodbye.

409
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,820
Wait.

410
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,100
Mr. Jin?

411
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,530
This watch is very important to me.

412
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,270
So make sure to bring it with you when we see each other again.

413
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,310
Make sure to bring it, please.

414
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,520
That's... right.

415
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,140
As long as you're not crazy...

416
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:31,660
♫ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J ♫

417
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,250
♫ K, L, M, N, O, P ♫

418
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,780
♫ Q, R, S, T, U, V ♫

419
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,150
What is it?

420
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,080
It's nothing. It's nothing.

421
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,310
I thought I saw something.

422
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,600
Do you think that woman could be in Korea?

423
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,110
No way.

424
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,000
If you're going to flee, it's best to flee abroad.

425
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,800
That's true.

426
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:04,690
Detective, he hit me first after getting drunk.

427
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,160
Detective!

428
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,930
That punk–

429
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,200
You always do this

430
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,300
when you drink.

431
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,250
Quiet down!

432
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,960
Do I look like a married woman to you?

433
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,030
Sit down!

434
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,880
Aren't you a married woman?

435
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,310
- What is he saying?
- That's enough.

436
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,760
I'm here to see Joo Won Tak.

437
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,790
BE QUIET!

438
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,090
What did you say?

439
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,560
- I'm here to see Joo Won Tak.
- Oh.

440
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,170
Detective Joo is off duty today. Did you come without calling him?

441
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,620
I don't have his contact information. I just heard that he works here.

442
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,500
Come back tomorrow.

443
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,250
Or leave your contact information here.

444
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,480
Excuse me.

445
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,390
Try getting in touch with him here.

446
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,410
He hasn't been eating or sleeping since the director passed.

447
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,740
He might die at this rate.

448
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,320
- Thank you.
- Sure.

449
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,550
How can you give away his information when you don't even know her?

450
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,020
You punk.

451
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,100
Look.

452
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,120
Oh, this is her? That goddess?

453
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,660
That's right, punk.

454
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,890
Wow, she's pretty!

455
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,520
Sir, please sit down.

456
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:08,950
Why didn't you get an IV vitamin treatment while you were at the hospital? It doesn't cost that much.

457
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,810
I didn't get it because I don't need it.

458
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,950
Do you think I wouldn't get it because of the cost?

459
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,810
I think that's exactly why you didn't get it.

460
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:23,130
Then again, you did lose an incredibly expensive watch, so you should be saving every penny.

461
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,630
Why do you need to keep bringing it up? It's annoying.

462
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,430
I'm going to find it!

463
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,390
Even if I have to go to the end of the world,

464
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,610
I'll find it no matter what!

465
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,100
Drop me off up here and go home.

466
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,000
Why? I can drop you off at your house.

467
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,970
No. I need to stop by the pharmacy.

468
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,340
[Don't be late on rent! Don't forget the rent! Remember the rent!]

469
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,380
It's you again?

470
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,670
How is it that a student like you is at the police station

471
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,690
more often than at school?

472
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,440
Taxpayers made it possible

473
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,560
for you to receive food and shelter at the children's home.

474
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,810
You should be grateful and live quietly.

475
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,170
It's because of kids like you that

476
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,130
orphans get a bad reputation.

477
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:19,250
That you end up like this because there's no one to teach you any better.

478
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,150
Ha. Look at this orphan bastard's eyes.

479
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,710
- Lower your eyes. I said, lower your eyes!
- Hey!

480
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,860
Who are you?

481
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,300
Knives aren't the only things that can cut people.

482
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,490
The wounds made from words don't even heal.

483
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,700
- It stays embedded in your heart forever.
- What?

484
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,820
Why are you hurting him? Won Tak didn't do anything wrong.

485
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,540
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5!

486
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,390
If it's 5 against 1, obviously the 1 is the victim.

487
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:54,550
If 5 people attack at once, you know it's not just a simple assault but a special assault, right?

488
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,620
Detective, you just subjected a special assault victim

489
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,210
to physical, mental, and verbal attacks.

490
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,920
Don't erase the CCTV.

491
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,540
I have it all recorded on my phone anyway.

492
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,400
- Who the hell is this psycho?
- She's my daughter.

493
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,920
Isn't he from the Cheongsong family?

494
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,690
The Cheongsong family's Kim Nak Cheon?

495
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,160
And this kid is my son.

496
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,010
Hearing the situation,

497
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:35,950
it seems these students were bothering a disabled student.

498
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,780
My son saw that and tried to stop it, resulting in a fight.

499
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,060
Is that right?

500
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,740
I taught him that.

501
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,580
That the fist is for defending the weak.

502
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,540
Did I teach him wrong?

503
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,360
I apologize, I didn't know who he was.

504
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,000
I apologize for my actions.

505
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:09,170
- Would you like to have a cup of tea over there with me?
- That's not right.

506
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:12,380
You should be apologizing to my son.

507
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,830
If you sincerely apologize, my son will

508
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,600
accept it.

509
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,320
Sorry...

510
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,130
about that.

511
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,330
You must be hungry. Eat this.

512
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:43,990
I told you not to meddle in my life. Why did you have to call the director and cause a fuss?

513
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,910
We're family. How can I not care?

514
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,680
If I'm getting hit by other kids, will you pretend not to notice?

515
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,730
Yes! I'm going to act like I didn't notice!

516
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,500
- Liar.
- I'm not lying.

517
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,860
♫ So many things that I want to say ♫

518
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,840
♫ What I will give to tell you that ♫

519

520
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,990
Woah!

521
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,900
That's so cool!

522
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,530
What is?

523
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,620
Men look best in uniform, right?

524
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,070
[2010 Police Officer Recruitment]

525
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,070
Cool? Yeah, right.

526
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:37,210
It would look so much cooler if Won Tak wore it.

527
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,810
Right, Won Tak?

528
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,840
Right, Won Tak?

529
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,710
Be quiet.

530
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,450
What is it?

531
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,050
So annoying.

532
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,020
Did I wake you?

533
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,470
What? No, no. How did you find this place?

534
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:23,650
I went to the police station, and they told me because I couldn't get in contact with you.

535
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,020
Can I go inside?

536
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,680
Of course, come in!

537
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,810
You can't go in!

538
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:34,700
I mean, Dali, can you give me five, no, just ten minutes?

539
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,220
Just 10 minutes! You can't come in, okay?

540
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,510
Damn it!

541
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,970
Oops.

542
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,070
What the hell? They're home!

543
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:48,410
Wait, I thought it was a man, not a woman.

544
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,960
Sorry for making you wait.

545
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,700
Come in.

546
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,700
Tomorrow is recycling day.

547
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,930
This was stuck on your door.

548
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,130
"Don't be late on re..." This crazy bastard.

549
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,280
- What?
- What?

550
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,830
No, it's nothing.

551
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,860
This psycho, I mean, the landlord, lives downstairs.

552
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,010
I think he has some mental issues.

553
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,830
It was worth taking the day off today! Right?

554
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,590
Here.

555
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,000
What is this?

556
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,420
It's a roll cake. I know you like them.

557
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,420
What's this?

558
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:22,460
It was my dad's desire to not accept condolence money.

559
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:28,230
Thank you for being with me and being sad together as I sent off my dad.

560
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,340
I'll just accept the gesture.

561
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,460
Director...

562
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,640
was a father to me.

563
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,680
He wasn't just a supporter of the children's home.

564
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:46,960
Or maybe I was being presumptuous on my own?

565
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:55,770
Dad would have been really happy to hear that.

566
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,740
You know that, right?

567
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:01,300
Dad thought of you as his son, too.

568
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,500
That's why I think I'm going even more crazy.

569
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:17,490
"I love you. I respect you." I held these words to myself.

570
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:20,390
I never said them out loud.

571
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:24,710
I should have at least given him a hug.

572
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,350
Or held his hand.

573
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:35,350
Before he passed, he asked me to visit him.

574
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:40,040
What was I so busy for?

575
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,580
I can't even call myself human.

576
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,820
There's so much we leave unsaid to our family, right?

577
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:57,120
We delay and assume that they'll understand.

578
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,520
Dad would have understood too. He knew how you felt.

579
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,230
He was always proud of you, too.

580
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:22,730
Hey... who's consoling who?

581
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,120
Is anyone home?

582
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,460
I'm from downstairs. I have something to talk to you about for just a moment.

583
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,880
- Is anyone home? 
- You're not going out?

584
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,930
Hello? Is anyone home?

585
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,290
Is anyone at home?

586
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,990
Is anyone home?

587
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,020
Is anyone ho─

588
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,440
I'm busy now, so let's talk later.

589
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,070
This guy. What do you mean, talk later?

590
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:56,710
I'll get to the point. When are you going to give me this month's rent?

591
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,900
Get to the poi...? Oh, get to the point.

592
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,200
Yes. When are you going to give me the rent?

593
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,230
Rent, rent, rent.

594
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:12,370
Speak quietly, since my ears work fine. I'll deposit it by tomorrow. We're done, right?

595
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,600
How can I trust you? It's not like I've been fooled once or twice.

596
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,120
Daehan Bank, account number 178421-44-3860. By 10 a.m. tomorrow.

597
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:24,170
If it's not deposited by then, you can come to Song Dong Police Station, Violent Crimes unit. Okay?

598
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:27,750
We don't need to go to the violent crimes unit over late rent.

599
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,770
Okay?

600
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:32,620
Well, okay.

601
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,670
But weren't you living alone? Do you live with someone?

602
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,080
Whether I live alone or with someone, what's it to you?

603
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,030
Why wouldn't it matter? It does matter!

604
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:47,160
Do you know how much the utilities cost for one person versus two?

605
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,830
What are you looking at?

606
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,750
I thought something was off.

607
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,960
The washing machine running all night

608
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,030
and the water bill suddenly went up by 10,000 won.

609
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:03,130
I said that's not it. I live alone.

610
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:07,600
What is it? What's going on?

611
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:20,030
Is it the landlord?

612
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:22,190
You must be hungry. I'll make you something good.

613
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,530
- What should we eat?
- Damn it.

614
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,820
Why on a day like today?

615
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,940
Get in, I'll drop you off on the way.

616
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:04,050
No, it's okay. You said it was an emergency. Go ahead.

617
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:06,980
I won't be late even if I take you home.

618
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:10,010
It's because I have to meet someone.

619
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:13,140
- At this hour?
- Yeah.

620
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:19,370
♫ The moment I saw you walk in my life ♫

621
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:25,020
♫ I was happy to have you here ♫

622
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:31,390
♫ The scent of you near beside me ♫

623
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:36,570
♫ And every smile you shared, I was happy just to be with ♫

624
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,200

625
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:46,390
♫ U hoo hoo U hoo hoo ♫

626
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:53,390

628
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,730
♫ Yeah U hoo hoo ♫

629
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:07,220
Dad.

630
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:13,170
I was too late, right?

631
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:16,570
♫ U hoo hoo ♫

632
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,390
♫ U hoo hoo ♫

633
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:23,210
What do you mean, the director of the art museum died?

634
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:27,250
Is that true? Did he really die?

635
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,100
Yes.

636
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,640
But why am I only hearing about this now?

637
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,330

I apologize.

639
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,190
Wait.

640
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,750
You should go.

641
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,560
Now that you're making some money, 2 billion won is a joke to you, right?

642
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:58,210
What kind of crazy person doesn't know if the guy he lent 2 billion won to is dead or alive?

643
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:01,690
The bank has already heard the rumors!

644
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:05,250
And you raise your head high, saying that you run a business?

645
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:10,000
Money never stays with those who don't know its value.

646
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,710
What are you going to do now?

647
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,790
How are you going to recover the 2 billion won?

648
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:18,770
Just because someone died doesn't mean their inheritance disappears.

649
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:24,900
Cheongsong is a prestigious family. Do you think they would steal from us because they can't afford 2 billion won?

650
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,950
They can earn so much by selling just one painting!

651
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,170
Everyone knows they haven't had any assets in some time.

652
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,930
What do you mean prestigious?

653
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:34,050
They didn't just borrow money from one or two places!

654
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:37,680
The art museum is also about to be auctioned off soon!

655
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,210
You said you were not 100% but 200% positive they were dependable.

656
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:47,550
You said it was a connection worth not 2 billion won, but 20 billion won!

657
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,400
Then I'll take responsibility!

658
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,740
What? This scumbag!

659
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,810
Don't raise your blood pressure over useless things.

660
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,910
I'm your son Moo Hak.

661
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,320
Jin Moo Hak!

662
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,420
Have you ever seen me swindled out of money?

663
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,040
I never do business if it's going to be a loss.

664
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,810
I'll collect it with interest, so stop worrying

665
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,740
and lower your blood pressure!

666
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,120
What? Do you have a plan?

667
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,870
Father, you know what kind of person Moo Hak is.

668
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:22,390
He isn't one to lend 2 billion without some countermeasures in place.

669
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:24,650
Right, Moo Hak?

670
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:33,280
And even if you tremble, being too afraid of money,

671
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,960
money will ignore the person!

672
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,250
20 billion won!

673
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,680
It's about time we stop being so afraid of money.

674
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,170
It's not even that much.

Are you all right?

677
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,090
I'll be okay, right?

678
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:19,390
This was such an unexpected death,

679
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:23,060
so the bank is in a mess as well.

680
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,680
He must have family.

681
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,960
His wife passed away over 20 years ago, and he has one child.

682
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,020
From what I've heard, she's quite incredible.

683
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,290
Of course.

684
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,590
Right. What makes her so incredible?

685
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:42,650
After she graduated from Seoul National University, she completed her Master's and Ph.D. at the University of Tokyo.

686
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,240
She was the youngest to obtain the degree and received the best thesis award.

687
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:50,260
She was also the first Korean to be scouted by a European art museum and is currently working as a senior researcher.

688
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,930
So what?

689
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:58,810
It may be because you don't know much about this field, but this is a really incredible achievement.

690
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:03,680
It's similar to getting the very best cut of a Spanish Iberico pig.

691
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,520
It's that level.

692
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,190
What a load of crap!

693
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:11,490
To put it simply, she has no actual skills to make money,

694
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:15,090
and has only studied off of her parents' hard-earned money?

695
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:17,650
Is that how you interpreted it?

696
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,320
This won't do.

697
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:26,970
The dividend ranking for bonds is also low, but if I let things be, I'll lose all that money and then some.

698
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:29,080
What are you going to do?

699
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:34,040
Right. It's possible that

700
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:39,110
this method might work better on her because she's a naive nerd who only knows how to study.

701
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:41,350
No way.

702
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:44,460
Is there a better idea in this situation?

703

Our timing is important. We need to end this quickly.

719

It would be better to sell it at a decent price and live peacefully.

Do you think maybe Mr. Kim knows something?

He's still the director's nephew.

He probably doesn't know.
