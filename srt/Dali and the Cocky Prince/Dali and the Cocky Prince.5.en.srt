Kim Dali!

3
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,570
Kim Dali, are you in there?

4
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,650
Kim Dali!

5
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,210
It's me.

6
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,140
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

7
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,990
Something didn't feel right.

8
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,190
Why are you here in the middle of the night if I dropped you off at the hotel?

9
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,240
About that...

10
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,840
What? You can't pay for the hotel?

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,970
You said you sold your house.

12

About that...

13
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,270
It's because I have work left to do.

14
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,090
The exhibition is just around the corner. I need to work on the plans,

15
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,880
and there's a lot to prepare to convene a donor group meeting.

16
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,010
Do that work at the hotel.

17
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,180
Sorry?

18
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,030
If you work here all night, will you pay the electricity and water bill?

19
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,410
Electricity bill?

20
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,180
Even if the art museum is under your name,

21
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,120
won't the electricity and water bills be under the operating expenses of the art museum?

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,980
Why do you have to spend the operating expenses of the art museum to do what you couldn't do during business hours?

23
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,490
This is what personal use is. Personal use.

24
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,890
Personal use?

25
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,460
Why can't you tell the difference?

26
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,680
Hurry up and get your luggage. I will take you back to the hotel now.

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,560
No, Mr. Jin. I really have work to do today.

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,280
Those who are not good at studying always stay up all night and cram.

29
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,550
People who can't work are trying to work overtime.

30
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,730
You have to lead by example, starting from the director. Unnecessarily working overtime.

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,090
What's going on? She didn't even turn on the lights?

32

Mr. Jin.

35
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,050
You just need to take this, right?

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,240
About that ...

37
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,510
Were you going to stay here?

38
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,630
To save money on the hotel bill?

39
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,600
No. I have money.

40
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,370
What are you doing? Let's go.

41
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,980
How did you know I was at the art museum?

42
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,480
Do you have somewhere to go other than the art museum?

43
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,440
You don't have friends to drink with. It didn't seem like you have any relatives who stop by.

44
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,240
Put in your phone number.

45
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,790
My phone number?

46
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,320
I realized I was too complacent.

47
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,490
Somehow, the creditor still doesn't know the debtor's phone number.

48
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,240
Why aren't you entering it in?

49
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,030
Can you press the call button on the bottom?

50
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,270
Don't erase it

51
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,000
and save it. If I call you answer right away.

52
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,730
It's not because there's another meaning behind this.

53
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,850
You're saying that it's because you're afraid I'll run away.

54
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,780
As you said, I have no friends

55
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,970
and no relatives to take me in,

56
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,180
so where would I go? You don't have to worry.

57
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,180
When my father was alive, I thought I had a lot of friends

58
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,620
and relatives that I had too many to count,

59
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,650
but now it's become so simple.

60
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,360
That's how the world is.

61
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,040
People stick around when they can benefit from you.

62
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,200
If they make a mistake they might lose their benefits.

63
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,600
Did you think they would stick around?

64
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,360
Don't be too disappointed.

65
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,700
So, on a day like today,

66
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,070
you just get a good night's sleep in an expensive room and don't think about anything.

67
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,220
You already owe billions of won,

68
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,300
so if you pay for a hotel, it won't make a difference to your debt.

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,670
Aren't you cracking down on these illegal motels lately?

165
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,660
What the hell were you doing on patrol that a robbery happened while you're cracking down on these motels?

166
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,760
Are you doing your jobs properly?

167
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,960
And how is the crime scene still under investigation?

168
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,940
Let go!

169
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,880
- Are you okay? I'm sorry...
- Why are you taking it out on us?

170
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,380
It hurts.

171
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,450
She's hurting!

172
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,620
I'm sorry for troubling you when you're busy.

173
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,110
I had to pay the bill to be discharged, but my whole purse was stolen.

174
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,140
You called me because of the hospital bill?

175
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,380
You wouldn't have called otherwise?

176
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,790
What?

177
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,610
Mr. Kim and you, both.

178
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,980
Why do you keep making me out to be an ungrateful jerk?

179
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,110
When I had nowhere to go,

180
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,710
you were the first ones to take me in.

181
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,300
And you were the ones who patiently believed in me without giving up.

182
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,230
So for me,

183
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,530
when I'm feeling angry, happy, or hopeless, I don't think I'm alone.

184
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,660
I think of you and Mr. Kim first.

185
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,510
But how come you don't do the same? Why?

186
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,580
How could you not tell me anything even when you're about to live in a motel?

187
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,100
- Get in.
- Okay.

188
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,470
I'm sure you know since you've come over,

189
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,690
I can't say it's better than a motel,

190
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,630
but it's safer at the very least, for now.

191
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,440
For now?

192
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,820
What?

193
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,870
Can't I stay a little longer? "For now" is too cold.

194
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,560
How about "for a while?"

195
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,250
- Just get in.
- Okay.

196
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,590
Just wait until you get caught. I'll kill you.

197
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:31,110
- Good morning.
- Good morning? You just came from a lunch meeting.

198
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,110
Is it important what time it is? It's still a good morning for me.

199
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,150
Why?

200
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,030
Because I just came to work.

201
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,360
Okay.

202
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,220
Why is the entry fee for an elementary school music camp so expensive?

203
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,570
World-renowned pianists are giving private lessons.

204
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,850
So that much is cheap.

205
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,680
I believe you need a professor's letter of recommendation to get in. Not everyone can get it.

206
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,190
That's right. How do you know that, Gong Joo?

207
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,350
I went to an art camp there when I was young.

208
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,820
As expected, it's different being from a rich family.

209
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,190
You must be having a hard time living paycheck to paycheck.

210
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,060
I heard your wife had to quit her job to look after your child.

211
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,920
If we want to raise the next Cho Seong Jin, then we have to endure it.
(T/N: South Korean pianist)

212
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,990
Speaking of which, there won't be any issues with our paycheck today, right?

213
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,640
There shouldn't be. I don't know about anything else, but it's our paychecks.

214
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,790
No way.

215
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,440
I really like the fact that

216
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,160
the art museum staff here

217
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,540
have a strong sense of economy.

218
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,660
Whether the art museum closes or not because it's ruined,

219
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,240
whether the director sells her house to prevent that or not,

220
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,770
none of that matters. Right?

221
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,770
As long as you get your paycheck, that's all that matters.

222
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,170
That's commendable.

223
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,180
That's commendable.

224
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,200
It's selfish,

225
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,770
shameless,

226
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,450
and very humane.

227
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:22,780
It's beautiful. It's artistic!

228
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,620
Don't you think so, Mr. Han?

229
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,130
I didn't mean that.

230
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,510
But are we really closing our art museum?

231
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,600
Why are you asking me that?

232
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,360
You should ask the director!

233
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,820
Where's Kim Dali right now?

234
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,060
Earlier...

235
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,950
Well...

236
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,790
You don't know?

237
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,060
Didn't Kim Dali come into work today?

238
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,450
I called her earlier because of the meeting, but she didn't answer.

239
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,140
- Is that all?
- Pardon?

240
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,430
If she didn't answer, you should be calling until she does.

241
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,690
What are you doing? Call her again.

242
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,090
Yes, Sir.

243
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,670
The phone is turned off.

244
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,390
It's said the phone is turned off.

245
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,590
Try again.

246
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,010
Forget it. I will do it.

247
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,340
Over there...

248
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,230
That looks like the director.

249
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,180
Who's that guy?

250
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,030
Could it be her boyfriend?

251
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,040
What?

252
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm a little late because I had an external schedule.

253
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:19,800
I was going to ask for your opinion on the exhibition, but since it's not urgent, let's talk about it at the next meeting.

254
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,360
You may go back to work.

255
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,350
Are you going out again?

256
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,440
No.

257
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,250
Do you have something urgent to go to?

258
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,760
Why do you ask?

259
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,020
If you do, cancel it.

260
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,870
My agenda is really urgent.

261
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,030
Sit down. Let's have a meeting.

262
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,170
Excuse me, Mr. Jin.

263
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:47,380
You said you would do whatever I wanted if you can't pay me back within a week. Are you going to pay me back?

264
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,340
Go ahead.

265
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,400
"A rescue plan for stabilizing the business operations of the Cheongsong Art Museum"?

266
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,980
What are you doing?

267
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,050
Sorry?

268
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,560
Aren't you taking your sunglasses off?

269
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,160
Well, it's—

270
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,280
- I think that's a good idea.
- What?

271
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:50,520
We do need a rescue plan. Especially one for stabilizing the business operations of the Cheongsang Art Museum.

272
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,380
I don't think an important agenda like this should be taken lightly and skimmed over.

273
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,270
I will take it and review it carefully.

274
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,060
Underlining without missing a single letter.

275
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,180
- I mean, you can just do that here–
- That's all for today's meeting.

276
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,010
But... this is a bit odd.

277
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,460
No working overtime. No charging your cell phones.

278
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,590
You are only allowed to use two sheets of toilet paper?

279
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,660
There's this too. Turn off the lights in the exhibition rooms when there are no guests.

280
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:32,510
What kind of rescue plan for stabilizing the business operation is this?

281
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,420
Are you serious?

282
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:49,620
You're right. You can't stabilize a business just by saving a little bit of money like this.

283
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,590
I agree with you.

284
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:56,800
We should at least fire half of the staff.

285
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,750
And turn the rest of the employees into temporary workers!

286
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,620
In order to share the burden, we'll reduce the salaries!

287
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,620
That's the only way to feel the burden.

288
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,320
Don't you think so, Mr. Han?

289
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,280
I think that's too much burden.

290
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,270
We're already running with the minimum amount of staff. How can we fire more?

291
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,890
We need to be squeezing dry mops right now!

292
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,210
It's not squeezing dry mops.

293
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,480
It's squeezing dry towels!
(T/N: It means there are ways to improve cost-cutting)

294
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,660
I'm sorry.

295
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,510
Mops or towels, it's the same thing!

296
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,690
That's enough, Mr. Jin.

297
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,580
Shouldn't the staff know what situation the art museum is in right now?

298
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,360
- You running around everywhere by yourself, that–
- I said I would review it.

299
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,400
I'll go over it carefully and come up with a proposal by tomorrow.

300
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,650
That's fine, right?

301
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,460
Whatever you want.

302
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,350
Mop?

303
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,550
I'll make sure to use the toilet paper sparingly.

304
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,890
I forget to tell you this, but–

305
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,330
How can you come in without knocking?

306
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,900
I'm sorry.

307
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,720
I didn't see anything.

308
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,390
What's this about?

309
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,160
Well...

310
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,490
Since I will start working in earnest, I thought I would need an access card.

311
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,160
If I'm going to go back and forth between the gamjatang restaurants and the art museum, I'll likely have to come in early,

312
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,570
or come in after everyone gets off of work.

313
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,200
I'll let Ms. Gong Joo know.

314
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,190
- Two cards. One for me and one for secretary Yeo.
- All right.

315
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,300
If you don't have anything else, then goodbye.

316
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,150
Did something happen?

317
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,810
No.

318
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,480
Your phone was turned off.

319
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,200
It's broken, so I'm having it fixed.

320
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,840
It was working fine last night.

321
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,490
I dropped it this morning.

322
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,450
Aren't you uncomfortable in those?

323
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,170
It's due to a personal matter. If you're done with your work, then–

324
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,200
What personal matter?

325
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,310
When someone does not explain something and says it's personal,

326
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:00,640
doesn't that mean that the person does not want to disclose a particular situation or maybe is not in a condition to disclose it?

327
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,560
It's a sty.

328
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,710
I want to get to work now.

329
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:19,660
Are you looking for a new place? You can't keep staying at the hotel.

330
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,370
So I looked into it.

331
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,900
I found a place.

332
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,980
- When?
- This morning.

333
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,730
- Where?
- My friend's house.

334
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,660
- What friend?
- Do I need to tell you?

335
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,210
- You said you had no friends.
- I do.

336
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,020
A woman?

337
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,710
A man?

338
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,080
What man?

339
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,140
- Was it the guy who dropped you off earlier? That jer–
- Mr. Jin.

340
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,220
I mean, as a creditor—

341
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,200
Is it your right to know my workplace, number, and temporary residence? Isn't that an invasion of my privacy?

342
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,190
An invasion of privacy?

343
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,750
The world is a dangerous and horrible place, so I am just—

344
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,530
trying to protect my asset.

345
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,010
Do you think I want to invade your privacy?

346
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,030
If something happens to you, then what about my money?

347
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,180
Will you take responsibility?

348
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,560
Is he trustworthy?

349
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,690
I have to work.

350
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,050
Is he trustworthy? You can tell me that much.

351
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,270
Do you have personal reasons for not sharing that as well?

352
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,940
Yes, he is trustworthy.

353
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,190
Trustworthy, my foot.

354
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,280
There's no man worth trusting in this world. What a naive woman.

355
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,530
- What did she say?
- My gosh!

356
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,330
What do you mean?

357
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,520
Didn't you go in there to ask her who that man from earlier was?

358
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,440
You went in so desperately, like a guy who found out the girl he likes has a new boyfriend.

359
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,140
Who? Me?

360
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,330
Like who?

361
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,580
Is it not true?

362
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,770
I am Jin Moo Hak.

363
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:00,940
Me? Like that woman, who's drowning in billions of debt of all people?

364
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,000
Did you hit your head?

365
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,740
- Forget it then.
- What?

366
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,960
Why were you so easily persuaded?

367
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,290
I wanted to check just in case.

368
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,450
Just in case of what?

369
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,240
You know, you two are...

370
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,220
So, we're what?

371
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,810
I... you know... um...

372
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,920
Do I have to say it in words for you to understand?

373
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,530
Yes, tell me in words because I can't understand.

374
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,390
So... I... uh...

375
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,200
So...

376
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,860
What? What did you say?

377
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,860
Say it louder. I can't hear you!

378
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:58,970
Chak Hee, I have plans so I was wondering

379
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,380
if you can deliver the art piece on your own?

380
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,890
We just met, but we seem to just understand each other.

381
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,150
We must be a match made in heaven.

382
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,970
Where should we meet next time?

383
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,650
Excuse me, Chak Hee. Chak Hee.

384
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,160
Is it someone you know?

385
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,110
Chak Hee?

386
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,820
- Do you really think we get along well?
- What?

387
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,410
I couldn't even understand half of what you were saying.

388
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:45,590
I understand that you're trying to show off by using difficult words that you picked up after studying so hard.

389
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,090
But isn't it etiquette you at least brush your teeth before a first date?

390
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,490
Why does your mouth smell like a bathroom?

391
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:56,160
Damn it my mouth... Hey...

392
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,460
Chak Hee?

393
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,000
The lady in the Seongbuk neighborhood isn't very particular,

394
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,070
so all you have to do is position the artwork. The driver will do the rest.

395
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,570
Chak Hee?

396
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,620
All right. He's leaving at 3:00 p.m., so I just have to be here before then. Right?

397
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,040
Chak Hee, this...

398
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,950
[Gallery Mond]

399
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,550
I'm on my way, so come out.

400
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,820
What now? I'm busy. Eat on your own.

401
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,990
It's regarding Cheongsong Art Museum.

402
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,160
Cheongsong Art Museum?

403
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,010
What about Cheongsong Art Museum?

404
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,940
Is there some kind of problem? What's the problem?

405
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,960
What's your relationship with Cheongsong Art Museum?

406
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,390
You were the gangster at Cheongson Art Museum from that time, right?

407
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:10,770
What do you mean, "gangster"? We got involved due to a business problem. It's nothing important.

408
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:15,620
Your business is not my concern, but why were you at a hotel with Kim Dali?

409
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:21,400
- You know Kim Dali?
- Is there anyone who works in arts that doesn't know her?

410
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,780
Oh, she's that famous?

411
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,880
I'm asking why you were at a hotel with that girl.

412
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,220
What do you mean? I just dropped her off because she was drunk.

413
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:37,050
- How did you know that, though?
- I was at the hotel at the same time.

414
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,690
Then why didn't you say hi?

415
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,950
You really don't have any relationship with that woman?

416
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:55,120
Whatever relationship we have or not, why is that your concern?

417
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,750
I'm busy. Did you call me here to ask me that?

418
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,960
You know that I'm very sharp when it comes to dating, right?

419
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,160
- Oh really?
- I can tell who likes who and who's dating each other.

420
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,510
I'm really good at seeing when someone likes someone.

421
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,000
That's why I give a lot of dating advice, too.

422
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,930
If you have that kind of talent you should work at a marriage bureau.

423
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:18,560
Why are you working at a gallery where you are getting bullied?

424
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,290
I'll take an iced Americano.

425
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,820
When I saw you at the hotel, I was reminded of the saying "A monk can't wash his own head".
(T/N: She meant the Korean saying "A monk can't shave his own head" meaning, you can't help yourself out)

426
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,920
I see. I'm always curious about this though...

427
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,100
Why can't a monk wash his own head?

428
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,510
What? What's wrong with being curious?

429
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:42,100
The monk needs hair to be able to wash it. How can monks wash their hair if they're bald?

430
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,260
Oh... That's why...

431
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,120
That's not what's important. Are you stupid? Do you not understand what I'm saying?

432
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:54,360
I, Ahn Chak Hee, am confessing that I have feelings for you, Jin Moo Hak, a guy who sees nothing else but money!

433
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,960
You have no sense, you are ignorant, you bully people, and don't even know any idioms,

434
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,890
but I still like you, you idiot!

435
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,990
All right, Chak Hee. Sit down.

436
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,710
I'll persuade my dad somehow.

437
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,860
I'll make sure you don't get hurt.

438
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:16,210
So, don't let me see you at a hotel with another woman ever again.

439
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,660
I have to go to work.

440
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:27,970
What's with her all of a sudden? My mind is complicated as it is.

441
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:36,710
What? You want me to grant you another loan and you'll put up the artworks as collateral?

442
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:42,090
Dali, do you have money saved up in our bank or something?

443
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,640
Unlike real estate mortgage, which increases over time,

444
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,000
artwork will only pile up dust and sell for nothing.

445
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,120
It's also a pain to take care of,

446
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,750
and it costs money too!

447
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,910
Why is this girl not getting the message?

448
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:28,100
Hello, sir, this is Dali. You remember me, right?

449
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,370
It's been a while. The reason I called is...

450
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,920

00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:45,660
Hello, this is Kim Dali. Kim Dali. I'm not sure if you remember me.

453
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,670
But the reason I called is to ask a favor...

454
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,430
Are you going somewhere?

455
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:16,400
Oh no, I... I'm sorry. Are you all right?

456
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,310
I'm okay. I was caught up in my thoughts.

457
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:31,100
Here.

458
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,070
Thank you.

459
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,720
What?

460
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,680
That one's having issues, too?

461
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,960
Yeah, I think it's too old.

462
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,780
It's been worrying because the office and storage seemed to have been broken into.

463
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,240
The CCTV is giving us trouble too.

464
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,480
I did some repairs, but I think we'll need to replace it with a new one.

465
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,120
Okay, let's replace it.

466
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,660
I have something to tell you.

467
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,800
Please come to my office. Mr. Hwang, you too.

468
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,720
Me too?

469

What? You're pushing back our pay?

470
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,920
That won't work. How am I supposed to pay my credit card bill this month?

471
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,330
I have loan interest for my apartment to pay along with my kid's tuition and living expenses.

472
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:32,710
I have to send my kid to camp this month, too.

473
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:36,230
Why are you all so quiet? Am I the only one that's desperate?

00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,280
Am I the only one living month-to-month?

Say something, Curator Song.

476
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,700
You have your mom's hospital bills and caregiver to pay, too. Don't you have more bills than me?

I'm sorry. It's because of my negligence.

478
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:55,780
I'll do whatever it takes to prepare your pay as quickly as possible.

479
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,220
Do you really not have any money?

480
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:08,990
- I'm sorry?
- I'm just having a hard time understanding.

481
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:15,620
- Gong Joo.
- The clothes on your back, your sunglasses, shoes, and bag.

482
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:22,150
Are worth more than enough to pay for three months' salary for all of us. You know that, right?

483
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,580
Three months?

484
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,450
You're covered in designer clothes,

485
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:31,590
yet you don't have enough to pay our measly salaries.

486
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,620
You're telling us to believe that right now?

487
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,290
That's really outrageous.

488
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:42,240
I think there's a misunderstanding. I wouldn't lie to you.

489
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,810
These clothes and this bag are several years old.

490
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:50,040
I wouldn't buy these while not paying your salaries.

491
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:57,830
Those shoes are from this season.

492
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,090
With only three pairs in the country.

493
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,820
These shoes... so...

494
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:13,110
For you, the money is less than the price of a pair of shoes,

495
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:18,960
but for ordinary people like us, it's what lets us feed, clothe, and care for our families for an entire month.

496
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,760
And whatever little is leftover we put into savings.

497
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,660
That money is our lifeline.

498
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,640
How despicable.

499
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,540
Gong Joo.

500
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,920
Seriously.

501
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,750
Take a look all the way behind Cheongsong Art Museum.

502
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:20,540
It's a Restricted Development Zone, but there's been a lot of deals in this area starting five to six years ago.

503
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,950
Here, here, and here.

504
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,910
Do you know whose land it is?

505
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:31,670
It's under a borrowed name, but it actually belongs to Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae.

506
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,180
Ahn Sang Tae?

507
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,690
You know, the family of the girl Moo Hak went on a blind date with.

508
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,770
The girl that turned Moo Hak down for being too ignorant.

509
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:45,520
- Moo Hak said he rejected her.
- What?

510
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,970
Anyway, this man has been a council member at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport Committee for seven years.

511
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:56,830
Why would he buy all this land in the Restricted Development Zone?

512
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,110
So, what? Are they removing the restriction?

513
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,910
Bingo!

514
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:06,390
Really? They're really removing the restriction?

515
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,440
You can't tell anyone yet.

516
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,810
You know what'll happen if word gets out. It'll be a mess.

517
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,400
You really can't even tell Moo Hak.

518
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:23,740
I'm saying that we shouldn't try to just take over the Art Museum and sell the land right now.

519
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,250
We should start a construction division in our company,

520
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,740
and jump into this project, Father!

521
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,040
But even if they really remove the restriction... will there be room for us to join?

522
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,520
They probably planned everything out amongst themselves already.

523
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,490
We can make room... if there isn't any room.

524
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,090
What?

525
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,170
I'll go and make room for us.

526
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,940
You just get the money ready, Father.

527
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,290
Let's keep it between us for the time being.

528
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:28,140
You can't bury the truth.

529
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,310
Did he say he'll get it ready?

530
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:45,190
I told you to wait in the room. Why did you come here?

531
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:48,680
I was preparing to rip that old geezer's hair out if he said no.

532
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,490
He better not leave you out in the cold again this time, or else...!

533
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:57,230
How could he? Not after knowing what I have up my sleeves.

534
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:02,130
What is it that you have that's making you so confident?

535
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,070
It's...

536
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:10,120
Forget it... It's so big that it's dangerous.

537
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,460
I'll tell you later, Mom.

538
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,400
What is it? What is it!

539
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,750
Go ask Professor Kim to write up a talisman.

540
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,440
One that will work wonders.

541
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,810
Okay? Okay!

542
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,699
Talisman? Okay!

543
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,600
She used to work overtime a lot before,

544
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,080
but because I told her off once, she went home right on time.

545
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,250
Where the hell did she go... I can't even get in contact with her.

546
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,630
Let go!

547
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,970
Hey, are you sure you looked for it properly?

548
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,140
Where could it be if not at his house or the art museum?

549
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,840
Where else would the old man have left it?

550
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,030
If you don't believe me, search for it yourself.

551
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,770
- This little..
- I'm going to quit my job.

552
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:42,020
Why would I stay when Mr. Kim's no longer here and I'm not even getting paid.

553
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,650
You didn't get paid?

554
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:49,830
So stop harassing me and find the documents or bunch of stamps by yourself!

555
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,470
Who says you can quit?

556
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:58,140
Don't be cocky. Shut up and stay put until I fire you.

557
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,960
Who are you to tell me what to do?

558
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,950
Me?

559
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,890
I'm the one who knows what kind of person you are,

560
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:08,500
and knows all about what you've been doing.

561
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:21,210
You must think that you had become a real curator because you worked at an art museum.

562
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,170
Should I expose to the world everything you've been up to since coming to Cheongsong?

563
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,140
Those are all things you made me do.

564
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,490
Well...

565
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,300
Would people believe the word of an orphan bar girl?

566
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,910
Or would they believe me, the Cheongsong family's eldest son?

567
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,640
You must've experienced this all your life.

568
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,410
Are you stupid? Why can't you take your experiences and learn from them?

569
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,370
Excuse me.

570
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:05,490
What's going on?

571
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,360
Are you okay?

572
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,380
It has nothing to do with you so go on your way.

573
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,640
She's my employee, why would it have nothing to do with me?

574
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,520
Right? You work at our art museum?

575
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,950
"Our" art museum?

576
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,240
This is driving me crazy!

577
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,750
You little beggar!

578
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:39,800
"Beggar"? Does he know how much this suit is?

579
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:45,770
Are you all right? I can escort you if you're scared.

580
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:47,860
I'm okay.

581
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,400
Where the hell did he put it, then? The old fart!

582
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,300
[Reporter Song of Jae-Il Newspaper]

583
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,800
Reporter Song!

584
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,840
The bed will arrive this week. It might be uncomfortable but just wait a little longer.

585
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,350
I'm not uncomfortable at all. Don't worry.

586
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,140
You look extremely uncomfortable. How long are you going to keep those on?

587
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,220
But if I sleep here, where will you sleep?

588
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,190
I can sleep in the living room, my car, or anywhere.

589
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:49,900
In the car?

590
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,690
I'm always working late or on a stakeout.

591
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:56,040
I just come here to change. I mostly sleep in the night duty room at the station, so don't worry.

592
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,580
Then I'll sleep in the living room.

593
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,480
Hey!

594
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:07,050
I pay the rent so I should get the room with the TV. Have you no conscience?

595
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,960
You don't think the landlord will say something?

596
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,490
Who is he to say anything? It's my home until the lease ends.

597
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:21,350
He seemed a little fussy last time.

598
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:25,040
Fussy? I think he's a little weird.

599
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,030
He seems young too, but he won't stop talking about the electricity and water bills.

600
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,610
Anyway, he's not normal.

601
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,960
What?

602
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,520
He just reminds me of someone I know.

603
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,760
- You know someone like that too?
- Yes.

604
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:42,380
What is this?

605
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:47,290
I was going to give it to you later for making me worry about you.

606
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,620
We caught the culprit.

607
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,480
What?

608
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,380
We're lucky we were able to identify him so quickly.

609
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,280
Otherwise, we wouldn't have caught him in time before he used up all the money.

610
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,210
See? This is the class of Korea's police force.

611
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,930
Why aren't you saying anything?

612
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,870
Dali?

613
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,940
What's wrong?

614
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,760
It's because I am happy.

615
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:46,800
It's such a relief. Right, Won Tak?

616
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:53,310
I could not show how I felt throughout the day.

617
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,830
I had a really hard time today.

618
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:11,280
My employees cannot pay for their credit cards or send their children to prep schools because of me.

619
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:17,920
No matter where I called, because I am so pathetic and useless,

620
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,230
no one would come to help.

621
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,060
But...

622
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,150
I am glad it turned out like this.

623
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,330
I am really relieved.

624
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,620
Isn't it a bit boring?

625
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,110
I think it's time to change them.

626
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,130
Yes, Sir.

627
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:17,780
Don't just change the ones in the executive offices, change the ones in the lobby, cafeteria, etc.

628
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,530
The employees should also be able to see them.

629
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,670
I will let Gallery Mond know that.

630
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,730
I told you they're boring.

631
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:27,790
Sorry?

632
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:32,030
If we want to change the ambiance, we have to change who we buy from.

633
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:35,020
