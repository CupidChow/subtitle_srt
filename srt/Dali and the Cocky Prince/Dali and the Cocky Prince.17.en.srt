Hello, I am actress Hwang Bo Ra, who plays Yeo Mi Ri,

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,360
and the host for the sweet and ignorant gamjatang recipe, Dali and the Cocky Prince special.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,110
Hello! It's nice to be here, everyone!

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,470
Since this is a special, we invited two of the lead characters.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,960
Please introduce yourselves to the viewers.

Hello, my name is Park Gyu Young, I played the role of Kim Dali in Dali and the Cocky Prince.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,860
I'm very happy to be here for the special.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,400
Hello, I'm Hwang Hee, who played Joo Won Tak in Dali and the Cocky Prince. You thought last week was the last time, right?

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,540
It's good to see you again.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,220
But I don't see someone here. Where's that ignorant man? My boss!

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,490
- Where did Moo Hak go? Moo Hak!
- Moo Hak...

15
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,850
- Why are you coming, Moo Hak?
- Where did Moo Hak go?
[Making a fuss]

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,420
- Where did he go?
- Moo Hak is actually here.

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,360
- He's here? It's a special...
- Yes.
[Moo Hak is already here?]

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,380
- but he's always late.
- Oh, it's a video call.

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,010
Hello, Dali and the Cocky Prince viewers, I'm Jin Moo Hak. It's nice to see you.

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:18,290
But please explain why you are saying hello through a video call today.

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,620
I have a meeting abroad with a buyer for Dondon Gamjatang.

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,600
I also have to see Artist Hong Ja Young's artwork. So I couldn't be there, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,170
Oh, is that so? Do you know the nickname that the viewers gave for Dali and Moo Hak?

24
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,180
- Of course, I know it. 
- What is it?

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,370
Brave rice grains and jellyfish.

26
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,820
What does that mean? It's really confusing.

27
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,730
It's brave rice grains

28
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,600
because Dali looks like that.

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,580
She looks like rice grains? How?
[Seems like a precious grain of rice(?)]

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,170
She looks like this. And?

31
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,240
- And for jellyfish,
- Yes?

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,620
because Jin Moo Hak's emotions are so transparent.

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,900
I have a question. Our drama has many sweet scenes.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,800
Did you ever actually have a moment when your heart fluttered while filming? Be honest.

35
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,910
[Answer carefully]

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,500
What are you doing?
[You got caught]

37
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,100
I remember my heart fluttering in all the romance scenes. [Soulless]

38
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,940
Which scene made your heart flutter the most?

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,850
For me, it wasn't the first kiss but...

40
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,580
- Yes?
- There was one where you really felt it.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,200
You said you felt it until the next morning.

42
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,190
The first kiss scene particularly made my heart flutter, since it was the first kiss scene.

43
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,390
Was that your first-ever kiss scene?

44
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,830
- No. No.
- Oh, it wasn't?

45
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,800
Then, out of all the actresses, was Dali the best?
[Cornering the jellyfish]

46
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,230
All right. You have to answer this within three seconds.

47
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,660
Secretary Yeo or Kim Dali? One, two, three!

48
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,160
- Kim Dali!
- Hey! Oh, what did he say?
- Kim Dali!

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,560
Anyway, thank you so much for today.

Please say goodbye to the viewers.

Now, Dali and The Cocky Prince is famous for being really fun.

- Is it fun?
- Yes, it's fun!

I will push you. One! Two! Three!

full of high-quality artworks that are no less important than great collections.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,640
- Miss Dali, the salt...
- I'm worried since I can't get in touch with you.

68
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,670
I would appreciate it if you could contact me as soon as you get this message.

Lyso, what?

They say that tears are merely a product of human emotions.

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,740
But actually,

74
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,880
they have a greater function of protecting the eyeball.

She's not crying. She's protecting her eyes.

I knew it. I knew this would happen.
[But...]

Something didn't feel right.

Why are you here in the middle of the night if I dropped you off at the hotel?

79
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,830
About that...

[Only has one suitcase left]

But how come you don't do the same? Why?

82
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,340
How could you not tell me anything, even when you're about to live in a motel?
[Has nothing to say]

83
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,920
Get in.

84
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,360
I'm sure you know since you've come over. I can't say it's better than a motel,

85
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,290
but it's safer at the very least, for now.

86

For now?

87
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,460
What?

Can't I stay a little longer?

89
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:08,070
"For now" is too cold. How about "for a while?"
[That's a relief. She has a place to live...]

Who's this now?

91
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,800
There are many other ways to stab someone besides using a knife.

92
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,460
There is no cure for the wounds you inflict with your words. It remains with you forever.
[She cannot tolerate injustice ever]

93
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,390
- What?
- Why are you hurting him? What did my Won Tak do?

94
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,830
One, two, three, four, five... five!

95
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,870
- Dali had a very tough side like this too, right?
- Yes.

96
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,200
She was confident and straightforward as a kid.

Mr. Detective, just now, to a special violence victim,

98
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,550
you used physical, emotional, and verbal abuse. The CCTV!

99

Don't erase it because it has all been recorded on my cellphone anyway.

100
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,900
Jang Jin Goo, you shut your mouth!

101
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:58,200
I'm clearly telling you, with every word you say from now, your sentence will increase that much.
[Sometimes with her words...]

102
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,610
But where's my money? There's probably some leftover?

103
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,030
- Well, that...
- Don't tell me you used all of it?

104
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,240
Gosh... oh! If the detective came even just a minute later...

105
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,500
The next card was a "Pal-Gwang"! Detective, you saw the "Sam-Gwang" that was in my hand, right?

106
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,370
If those two come together, it's a perfect "Sampal-Gwang"!

107
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,710
- That right there is just art!
- Be quiet.

108
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,920
Hey!

109
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,610
- Dali may seem like she doesn't know about the real world, but if you see her in times like these, she's very strong.
- Right.

110
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,120
- I think that was another charm of hers.
- Yes, for me too.

111
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,840
It makes me feel so good.
[Sometimes with her feet...]

- Was your arm all right at that time?
- Yes, it was.

113
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,520
I got muscle aches right after I filmed that.

Load of crap— Excuse me?

00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,620
What is gamjatang?

125
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,510
It's food that is filling, inexpensive, and that represents the common people's food.
[He was raised only with gamjatang pork bones...]

126
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,880
That's what gamjatang is.

127
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,330
It's cheap, has large portions, and your stomach becomes full!

128
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,310
But what did you say? Iberico? Caviar?

129
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:45,270
Why are we talking about Spain and a lonely bullfighter when we're sucking on a pork bone?

130
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,750
About the "Czar" earlier.

131
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,180
Who is this cheap jerk who eats all the caviar by himself?
[Others are ignorant though...]

132
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,830
Well... he's a Russian emperor, not some jerk.

133
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,340
Russian emperor?

134
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:09,320
Then they could have just said Russian emperor. They always use English to look smarter.
[There's nothing he finds uncomfortable]

135
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,790
It's not English, it's Russian.

I know. I know. It just came out!

137
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,010
It must be Russian, since he's a Russian emperor. Would it be English?

138
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,120
Czar! Even the pronunciation is Russian.

00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,570
I don't know where you live, but until the day we meet again, watch your mouth.

452
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,420
- Be careful of the noise between the floors.
- What?

453
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,770
Hey, Dal...

454
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,540
Excuse me.

455
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,750
Whenever I see you...

456
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,700
you seem like a good person.

457
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,270
I wonder if it's because you're a Korean police officer.

458
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,510
About Ms. Kim Dali.

459
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,910
Did she say anything when you

460
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:07,430
- were taking her home last time?
- About what?

461
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,550
For example...

462
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,420
- about me?
- She didn't

463
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:16,200
- Don't respond right away, think back on it a bit─
- I said she didn't!

Wow. Our Won Tak

You don't save water or electricity, but I guess you save a lot of energy when you speak.

What? What? I'm saying you're not talkative, but speak in a friendly manner.

If you make Dali drive one more time,

469
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
I'm going to kill you.

Yes. I'm flying.

If you upset Dali

478
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,350
you're dead.

479
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,740
If you make Dali worry, you're still dead.

480
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,440
If Dali sheds a tear, then you'll...

481
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,060
really die.

482
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,210
I think I'm going to die now.

483
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,850
Do a good job if you don't want to croak.

484
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:48,310
I want to just blast you away. Gosh!

- Then... should I call Interpol?
- Interpol?

497

She could be an international criminal. One who targets and steals from Koreans.

498
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,890
You have to catch criminals like that, throw them into prison, and feed them prison food for life.

499

Your body got wet, and it seemed like you were low on energy, so I made you a strong cup of coffee with two shots inside.

503
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,890
Two shots?

504
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,690
Should I add one more shot?
[She always keeps another shot with her]

505

- Take it so that it looks like there's a lot of people! Take it! Take it!
- Okay... cut!

Cut!

If the heavens don't do it, I will even perform an exorcism.

509
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,670

Since when did our family visit exhibitions at art museums? Why are you all here?

How can we not check on them when we loaned them so much money!

517
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:30,520
Also, we have to start getting used to going to parties.
