2
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,620
♫ So that you won't be able to see how I feel ♫

3
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,520
♫ But always see the same face in front of you ♫

4
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,430
♫ The heart that no one knows ♫

5
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,710
♫ Is hidden behind it ♫

6
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,800
But seeing you cry,

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,780
you do kind of look like him.

8
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,040
♫ Will you think of me again at night? ♫

9
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,350
Go ahead with things...

10
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,480
as planned.

11
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,180
A success? This exhibition was really that big of a success?

12
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,210
Of course. You probably know from the number of visitors,

13
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,560
it has also been chosen by critics as a must-see exhibition.

14
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,050
Good reviews and popularity, it's so hard to get the best of both worlds,

15
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,490
so the result we got is truly an incredible success.

16
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,210
Along with that, our art museum's café has blown up, too.

17
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,290
It has even been mentioned in a magazine as a romantic date location.

18
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,100
I mean, what is this? Is it our art museum's second renaissance or something?

19
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,200
- All right, all right. Let's keep on with this momentum and make our next exhibition a success, too!
- Of course!

20
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,500
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- What?

21
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,580
One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred...

22
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,750
Again.

23
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,470
One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand...

24
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,470
Aren't we missing a few zeros?

25
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,580
Seven hundred and fifty-six thousand.

26
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,480
7,560,000 won ($7,760)?

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,140
Is this really correct?

28
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,710
It seems to be correct.

29
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,890
You're saying this is a success?

30
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,070
Is there some sort of problem?

31
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,610
Well...

32
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,990
we planned and prepared for months while losing sleep.

33
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,010
For example, let's say talk about the labor cost.

34
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,390
Insurance fee, delivery fee, installation fee,

35
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,210
and the amount of money I dropped just for the promoting fees. And it's 7,560,000 won...

36
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,460
You're saying that this is a success right now?

37
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,250
We're saying it's a success!

38
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,050
Right, we normally earn about 80,000 won ($80).

39
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:37,600
Hey, Director Jin. It's probably because you don't know too well about an art museum's reality,

40
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,760
but there are many times when not even a single person comes, Director Jin!

41
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,610
Then why do you do this,

42
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,980
when it doesn't make money and nobody cares about it?

43
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,960
- People will care about it now, I guess...
- So─

44
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,470
So...

45
00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:01,800
that's how it normally is with art. It's not a field where the input and output arithmetically match.

46
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,500
So, it's like one of many dandelion seeds,

47
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,480
that flutters in the wind and blossoms,

48
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,280
and lives with that sense of calling to become that one seed─

49
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,510
What a load of crap!

50
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,410
Mr. Jin!

51
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,650
It's crap again?

52
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,590
That damn crap, crap, crap, crap!

53
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,910
I suffer from constipation. I'm a person whose dream is to have regular bowel movements.

54
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,400
But why do you keep mentioning 'crap' to me? Did you see me take a crap? Did you?

55
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,770
I mean, did I say something wrong, right now?

56
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,740
There are gazillions of people who are watching with bloodshot eyes, attacking us to close the art museum down.

57
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,150
But, what? How privileged of you to talk about "dandelion seeds."

58
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,530
"Input," what? How do you intend to pay my money back and gain independence with this attitude?

59
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,140
All right, all right! Good for you for having a lot of money! Good for you for having a lot of money and being ignorant!

60
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,680
- Yeah!
- Is there anything you did for my ignorance?

61
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,910
I said, is there anything you did for me?

62
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,970
- What did you do?
- What─

63
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,280
- Right now, I'm─
- Damn...

64
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,120
- Let's end this! Let's put an end to this today!
- Let me go!

65
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,980
You can't do this, Director! Director! You can't do this!

66
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,020
You can't do this!

67
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,600
What? What is it?

68
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,590
What are you doing?

69
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,800
Hurry and go after her.

70
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,540
You said you like her.

71
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,690
You're not going to go after her?

72
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,600
Are you mad?

73
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,760
You just did your job, Mr. Jin.

74
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,130
But starting this month, we've established a corporation for profit-making business, so there will be a lot of improvement.

75
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,250
I'll try to pay your money back as fast as I can, too.

76
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,260
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,030
Why are you sorry to me?

78
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,120
I was wrong... don't be mad anymore.

79
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,500
Curator Song, Curator Han, and Engineer Hwang...

80
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,910
they're all people I'm grateful for, who are protecting the art museum in hard circumstances.

81
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,250
It doesn't pay well and nobody cares about it but because they like their job

82
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,730
and somebody has to do it,

83
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,490
they're working with that sense of duty.

84
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,430
I'm telling you that there are people like that too.

85
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,310
I got it.

86
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,760
It's scary when you get mad like that.

87
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,830
Next time when I speak, I'll think about it once more and then say it.

88
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,420
I'll listen carefully to what other people say, too.

89
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,120
I'm not mad.

90
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,320
Not mad? Yes, you are.

91
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,180
What do I need to do for you to not be mad?

♫ A, B, C, D ♫

96
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,190
Are you forgiving me?

97
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,030
Then what was that?

98
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,150
Just... because you're cute.

99
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,230
If you're going to do it, you should do it properly, we're not kids.

- Through your nose.
- Relax.

101

Relax, relax.

102
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,360
I think I've done this job for too long.

103
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,920
I have to deal with that beggar loser. My goodness.

104
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,590
That was so beneath my standards.

105
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,770
I'm so embarrassed, seriously.

106
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,860
It's not the first time that Director Jin rambled on about crap.

107
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,850
Why are you being like this? It's unlike you.

108
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,670
That's right. Just let it go, Curator Song.

109
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,590
What did you blabber on about that punk, Engineer Hwang?

110
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,230
What nonsense about our director's feelings?

111
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,300
I guess I was mistaken.

112
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,900
You did, yes...

113
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,580
Hold on.

114
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,810
Is that punk causing a ruckus with our director right now?

115
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,250
She probably already has a lot on her mind because of being adopted and her uncle.

116
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,590
- You're going to go again?
- Let's go together.

117
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:28,280
- You can't use violence, please don't use violence.
- I don't think this is right.

118
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,990
That guy is in the director's room, right?

119
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,010
Don't fight. Please don't fight!

120
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,390
Are you all right, Director?

121
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,810
Don't even talk to that guy! You avoid poo because it's dirty, not scary!

122
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,730
This isn't right─

123
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,230
- My goodness.
- W-What? What?

124
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,090
Are you that kind of man?

125
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,600
- Can you let this go─
- How could you talk like that to our Curator Song?

126
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,890
- Ms. Dali, let this go first─
- Apologize! I said apologize! I won't just let it go anymore!

127
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,300
- Let th-this go.
- Director!

128
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,380
- Let this go.
- Director!

129
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,060
- Why... Dali...?
- Director? Let go─

130
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,440
I'm fine.

131
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,420
- I-I'm not mad anymore. I'm not mad.
- You're not mad anymore?

132
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:25,100
What in the world did you do that the director is acting like this?

133
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,180
I mean, I just─

134
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,470
I was trying to do something properly and...

135
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,990
I can't stand it anymore. I can't!

136
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,430
The director is someone who endures most things.

137
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,260
I should have held it in, but I couldn't.

138
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,880
You have to live with endurance! How can you live according to your temper?

139
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,510
I also have these urges that come up multiple times during the day,

140
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,000
but I just endure it and live.

141
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,660
Well... hurry up and apologize, Director Jin.

142
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:15,520
Also... let it go now, Curator Song.

143
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,470
About earlier, I'm sor...

144
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,160
Well, I...

145
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,220
didn't do anything right, either.

146
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,030
Okay, yes. How heartwarming, yes?

147
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,700
You two made up, right?

148
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,160
To feel better and also to celebrate the success of our exhibition,

149
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,650
- how about a team dinner today?
- Wow!

150
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,810
- You really like team dinners, I see.
- Yes.

151
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,850
We haven't had a team dinner once, since the director took over.

152
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,950
Right, right! The art museum happens to be closed today because it's Monday, too,

153
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,700
and I... what was it, I also know a famous restaurant. They say it's really delicious.

154
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,200
- Oh, that's a relief. Okay.
- Yes, yes.

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,080
- Enjoy!
- Thank you!

157
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,320
Wait. Does this restaurant belong to you, too?

158
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,540
- Yes.
- Wow.

159
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,770
It looks like you plan to dominate all parts of a pig.

160
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,710
We're piloting these at a few places right now. Please enjoy yourselves

161
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,100
and assess them harshly.

162
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,030
- Sure, we got it.
- Enjoy.

163
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,690
Thank you for the food!

♫ What should I say about ♫

165
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,510
♫ Going on a path that didn't exist? ♫

166
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,950
Wait, wait, wait! Not that.

167
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,550
Put that down.

168
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,260
Here, have this instead.

171
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,330
If you are the director,

172
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,640
you should eat the less popular stuff and give the tastier stuff to your employees.

173
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,310
This tasty and chewy outer skin

174
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,490
is for our Engineer Hwang who works so hard.

175
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,690
- Please enjoy.
- All right.

176
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,570
Wow, this looks good! I like the skin.

177
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,670
As for this,

178
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,480
it's for Curator Song.

179
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,020
- Here.
- Wow, the bone!

180
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,580
The bones are especially tasty, aren't they?

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,460
For Curator Han,

182
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,310
this looks good. The claws.

183
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,650
The claws.

184
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,390
How did you know?

185
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,490
I love claws the most.

186
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,330
- I can impale with this too... Roar!
- Roar!

Please give us a soda over here.

190
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,420
You said you were dieting these days. I see you're doing the soda and high-fat diet.

191
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,740
You meant LCHF (Low carbohydrate, high fat) diet, right?

192
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,550
Come on, start eating everyone.

193
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,920
As a joke, I may scratch you with the claws, roar!

194
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,250
Oh, the perilla leaf is fresh.

195
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,530
- It's really, really good.
- It's so good.

196
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,900
- It is really good.
- Yes, it is.

197
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,910
We get to have a team dinner thanks to Director Jin and Curator Song.

198
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,090
- It's delicious!
- It's tasty!

199
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,860
The skin is really tasty, too!

200
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,840
- It's so good!
- When eating this,

201
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,650
- you should have leaf mustard kimchi with this.
- I will let you know of some extremely disgraceful news

202
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,270
regarding Cheongsong Art Museum.

203
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,850
- Isn't that Mr. Kim?
- I am very sorry about it.

204
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,750
My eldest uncle,

205
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,590
I am referring to

206
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,810
the late director of Cheongsong, Mr. Kim Nak Cheon,

207
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,190
did drugs for a long time

208
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,340
and used the Cheongsong Art Museum

209
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,480
to bring in those drugs.

210
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,880
What? Drugs?

211
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,140
Our director?

212
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,840
I apologize to the public

213
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,350
on behalf of Cheongsong.

214
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,300
- Director!
- Director!

215
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,350
- Director!
- My gosh!

216
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,920
You crazy bastard!

217
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,950
What did you say about the director?

218
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,720
Habitual drug offender? Smuggled drugs?

219
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,800
How dare you lie like that?

220
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,830
Can you still call yourself a human after this?

221
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,070
Are you human?

222
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,700
Mr. Kim is not a suspect. He is here to testify.

223
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,140
If you keep up this rude behavior, we won't cooperate anymore.

224
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,120
Testifier?

225
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,760
Who is a testifier?

226
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,660
If you call reporters and tell people that it was not you but your uncle, does that turn you into a testifier from an offender?

227
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,640
What do you take the Korean police for?

228
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,460
This is the video from the crime scene.

229
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,050
Keep this in mind.

230
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,500
This is not a deal, but

231
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,160
the last opportunity

232
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,480
that we are giving you.

233
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,010
No,

234
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,120
this is not a deal or a last opportunity.

235
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,500
This is a fight between me and Dali.

236
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,170
A real fight between Cheongsong and Changson (the eldest male son in a family)

237
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,870
with that shallow girl!

238
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,700
I kept on telling him to quit it, but he would not listen.

239
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,480
So, I took a video, to persuade my uncle.

240
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,250
But I could not persuade him in the end.

241
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,020
And he died like that.

242
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,810
I am also sad about it.

243
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,450
But what do I do?

244
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,270
Do you think I am lying to defame my late uncle?

245
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,820
Do you want me to hide the truth like this? Do you think uncle would want that?

246
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,200
No.

247
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,270
To uphold justice, you have to cut out what's rotten, regardless if you're related or not.

248
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,320
That's how the Cheongsong family can be reborn into a family that's respected by all people, don't you think?

249
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,910
I'm going to make it that way.

250
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,140
The real successor of the Cheongsong family... Me!

251
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,780
My eldest uncle also

252
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,540
would be wanting that.

253
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,680
The late director, Kim Nak Chun, of Cheongsong Art Museum,

254
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,810
has been taking drugs regularly for a long time.

255
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,110
Si Hyung, this punk!

256
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,890
What in the world is he doing right now?

257
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,870
On behalf of the Cheongsong family,

258
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,330
I would like to apologize to the people.

259
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,240
You?

260
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,840
Man, what a shame.

261
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,830
I just love getting Brazilian waxing done.

262
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,760
When my hair grows back,

263
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,750
I'll reach out to you.

264
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,590
Let's go! Let's go.

265
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,500
He bleached, dyed, and waxed his hair... he really came determined.

266
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,860
Wow, you thieving wench! You have some nerve coming to the police station yourself–

267
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,830
You're crazy!

268
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,410
You bastard.

269
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,990
You mess with my dad just so you can live? My dad?

270
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,730
If you don't let go of him immediately, we'll sue you for assault!

271
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,850
It's a national rule that you don't mess with family.

272
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,720
Much more, he's tearing up her father who passed away, and you want her to do nothing?

273
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,010
Is that what educated people do? Then sue her for assault, damn it.

274
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,200
Dali, let go of him.

275
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,760
- Gosh, these little beggars─
- You monstrous, drug-addicted bastard.

276
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,350
- What?
- You're out of the Cheongsong family.

277
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll make sure to make it that way, so just wait.

278
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,720
All you can do is talk, you lowly adopted kid!

279
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,650
Hey, Won Tak! Hey!

280
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,960
What is this?

281
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,590
This...

282
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,430
You're saying this is really my brother?

283
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,240
It has already been handed over to the police as evidence,

284
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,640
and it's only a matter of time that it leaks to the media.

285
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,780
There's absolutely no way my brother would do this.

286
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,560
It seems like you don't understand the situation.

287
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,600
The problem...

288
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,800
is not the truth, but what the people saw.

289
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,820
Isn't it more powerful than the truth?

290
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,100
Also...

291
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,230
This?

292
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:46,110
I saw it at the Japanese collector's house and took the picture myself.

293
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,430
- What?
- The fact that you can't trade collections from the art museum's collection list,

294
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,990
you know that very well, yes?

295
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,020
That's why you get tax benefits, too.

296
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,130
No.

297
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,100
There's absolutely no way he did that.

298
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,290
No matter how short on money my brother was,

299
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,430
there's no way he made a backdoor deal with collections from the list.

300
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,170
What I'm trying to tell you right now...

301
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,150
is not who did this,

302
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,920
but the crisis that Cheongsong is in.

303
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,540
Cheongsong Art Museum, which has been receiving tax benefits,

304
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,540
has been used as a warehouse for smuggling drugs,

305
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,800
and collections from the list have been traded illegally overseas. If that all comes to light,

306
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,110
do you think that the Cheongsong name will be able to be maintained?

307
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,030
Aside from the legal punishment,

308
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,570
Cheongsong Cultural Foundation, Cheongsong Park, Cheongsong Scholarship Foundation...

309
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,880
All of Cheongsong's signage hanging across the nation,

310
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,770
will have to be taken down.

311
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,300
Along with Cheongsong's honor,

312
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,760
which has been passed on for generations.

313
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,760
Also, it won't end with anyone else,

314

Drugs? What kind of absurd nonsense is this?

316
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:12,040
Curator Song, now that I give it some thought, wasn't the director a little strange that day?

317
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,210
- That day?
- You know, that day...

318
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,200
Director, the work that came from New York yesterday is strange.

319
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,500
I think someone tampered with it.

320
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,850
Oh, that... I went because I had to check something, but I made a mistake.

321
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,720
What exactly were you checking that you made a mistake like that?

322
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,170
Oh, since I'm growing old,

323
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,410
the strength in my legs just sometimes gives out.

324
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,660
Even still, there's no way...

325
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,930
He wasn't someone to make that kind of mistake, though.

326
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,930
It's probably not true, it's not.

327
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:57,350
You people! What are you thinking right now?

328
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,080
- My gosh.
- Just to be sure.

329
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,140
There are things to say and not.

330
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,360
Yes, hello?

331
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,970
Pardon?

332
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,860
Hold on.

333
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,510
Hello?

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,780
Yes, I'm Han Byung Se.

We often met when I was in the Educational and Cultural Committee.

337
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:42,960
Although I have changed to the Culture, Sports, and Tourism Committee now, how long have you been at Cheongsong?

338
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,530
It's been over 20 years.

339
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:50,300
But the reason you wanted to see me was?

340
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,870
I heard that your son is really good at playing the piano?

341
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,570
Yes.

Children are the future of the country.

But... why me...

Mom! Lift it up like this.

and plan a proper exhibition this time, too, Curator Song.

354
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,570
Right now at Jeil Newspaper's art museum,

355
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,590
the director position is vacant. Right?

356
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,340
We're trying to train him to become the second Cho Seong Jin with his God-given talent.

357
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,770
Is there something wrong with that?

358
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,870
You just have to say, that Director Kim Nak Chun

359
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,910
was different from usual on days the artworks came in. There's nothing hard about it.

360
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,890
How long are you going to stay for you to pack this much?

361
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,310
I'm going to stay at the station until we wrap up the case.

362
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:06,050
Oh, right... Did you try contacting the school that Si Hyung went to?

363
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,340
There must still be records of it if it was enough for him to get deported back to Korea. It's drugs, not something small.

364
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,250
They said I can't see it because it's personal information.

365
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,760
They probably already did something about it.

366
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,880
I heard that Jae Soo from Sa He Distributions got caught together, too. They hung out again in Korea,

367
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,420
- so I'm sure they─
- They told me he left the country... yesterday.

368
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,330
What?

369
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,630
All the friends that you told me about, too. As if they made a pact.

Gong Joo. She definitely knew something.

371
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,940
- I'll go see Gong Joo and─
- She already

372
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,900
changed her phone number and disappeared.

373
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,870
Kim Si Hyung. He doesn't have a single strand of hair on his body and his urine test came out clean, too.

374
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:53,760
We didn't even have a warrant, but seeing that he voluntarily took the test, they probably prepared for everything.

375
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,540
I can't tell you because it's details about the investigation, but the other side already handed over a video, saying it's conclusive evidence.

376
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,060
Don't worry.

377
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:10,270
No matter how much he tries, he can't bury the truth.

378
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,560
What a totally naive thing to blabber about.

379
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,610
Instead of that punk, did you ever think that he may have someone with incredible power behind him?

380
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,600
What's up with you? Why are you here again?

381
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,980
He doesn't just have any lawyer, but it's PS Law Firm.

382
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,290
He's a puppet boss of a coffee shop at best,

383
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:33,040
but he was able to influence a foreign school, help rich kids flee overseas,

384
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,640
and backed himself up with the country's best lawyers?

385
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,590
He may have been disowned, but he's still the eldest son of the Cheongsong family.

386
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,350
If he suddenly passed away, he probably got an autopsy. Can't you check with that?

387
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,900
Whether he did drugs or not?

388
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,780
The family representative of the deceased wanted to send him off peacefully, so they didn't want an autopsy.

389
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,080
- Then what about the body?
- Cremated.

390
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,830
Isn't something strange?

391
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:06,960
They didn't do an autopsy and cremated him when his daughter didn't even come yet as if they foresaw it?

392
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,420
I can't say for you to not push yourself too hard, but make sure to eat your meals.

393
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,570
Don't worry.

394
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,420
- Don't get hurt either, okay?
- Okay.

- Why?
- Don't follow us out.

Why? What's the reason?

402
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,520
W-Why?

403
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,630
What the? Why do you keep holding my hand?

404
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:56,600
Seriously, gosh! I tolerated you because you're Dali's friend, but seriously─

405
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,130
Let me ask you one favor.

406
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,250
F-Favor?

407
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,630
Keep a close eye on Dali and look after her... please.

408
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,560
Dali's a person of interest in the case, so I don't think I can contact her.

409
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,980
I'm asking because you're the only person I can ask.

410
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,590
Dali, that girl... she won't show it even if she's struggling.

411
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,350
If she focuses on something, she'll forget to eat too–

412
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:30,420
Seriously. Why are you saying something that's a given on such a serious and grand scale?

413
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,130
Don't worry. My girl─

414
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,360
My neighbor who's next to me... I'll take care of them well on my own.

415
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,450
Won Tak, you should just focus on the investigation.

416
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,920
You need to do my tax money's worth, right?

417
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,550
Then, please.

418
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,900
What do you mean by search and seizure? You know that the director isn't someone to do something like that!

419
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,350
- Seriously, damn it.
- Then, what do we do?

420
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,710
- We have a witness, there's evidence, and even a warrant has been given.
- Dali...

421
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,720
Right now, she's really...

422
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,740
Bro.

423
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,060
Just think of it as part of the procedure, okay? If he's not someone to do that, we won't find anything even if we rummage through everything.

424
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,560
Please...

425
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,160
We'll go by ourselves, okay?

426
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,940
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

427
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,630
Won Tak! You can't call, okay?

428
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,510
You know, right?

429
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:04,580
What's going on? Both of them aren't picking up as if they made a pact.

430
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,940
- They're not people who would do this.
- The number you have called is unavailable.

431
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,730
Do they happen to have schedules outside?

432
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,170
- All right, all right, be careful!
- Yes, Sir.

433
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,320
You have to wrap it up well, okay? Wrap it well.

434
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,950
What have you been doing until now? Hurry on up!

435
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,910
This is all you could do? It's been hours.

436
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,980
Artist Jeong! No, I mean, Artist Kim!

437
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,730
No, no, Artist Jin! Wait, wait!

438
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,440
There are visitors here, what are you doing right now?

439
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,070
How could you take down pieces that are on exhibit?

440

We can't leave our artworks at the hub of drug distribution!

441

What will people say? We might be misunderstood as the same type of people.

442

- Pardon?
- Everyone, stop!

443
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,520
Put that down.

What's going on?

445
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,030
We're from Seongdong Police Station.

446
00:31:54,030 --> 00:32:00,790
This search and seizure warrant, issued on July 13th, 2021,

00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,960
we'll be enforcing it.

- What in the world?
- Move over, please.

451
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,700
I wasn't sure, but I guess it was true.

452
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,670
Go on in.

453
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,770
Split up and put everything in.

Hello.

It's a brand that recently came in. Would you like to test it out?

00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,860
You don't have a product that erases your memories?

457
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,320
Excuse me?

458
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,080
Just like how the wrinkles become faint when you put it on like this,

459
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,640
I also want my memories to become faint like this, too.

460
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,570
Oh, we don't have a product like that yet.

461
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,330
Give me ten, please. I'll have to erase my wrinkles instead of my memories, at least.

462
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,020
Yes, Ma'am.

Why are you calling me out here and there and making my feet hurt?

465
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,750
If your feet hurt coming from there to here, why would you wear heels like that then?

466
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,400
Wear sneakers.

467
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,320
Why would I waste my talent?

468
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,580
Waste your talent?

469
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,190
My beautiful legs.

470
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:28,530
It's so hard to have dangerously sexy legs like these, so why would I hide them with sneakers?

471
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,870
I need to go around showing them off.

472
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,360
Don't laugh. I'm still mad at you.

473
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,170
Did you go back home then?

474
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,470
Don't pretend like you're worried.

475
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,430
I was worried. I'm still worried now.

476
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:56,030
What do you think about moving out from home? You're at that age now anyway.

477
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:01,210
I guess you think a gallerist's salary is a lot because I go around dolled up like this.

478
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:05,240
It's a salary that makes it tough for me to even keep up with my appearance without my family's support.

479
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,260
Move out, my foot.

480
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,030
If you need help, I can help you, too.

481
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,370
Then love me.

482
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,590
Chak Hee...

483
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,420
If it's not something like that, don't step out of line like that.

484
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,060
I'm from a family that everyone envies, foreign cars, luxury bags...

485
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,280
Do you think anybody can just enjoy all that?

486
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,350
Getting hit sometimes? That's okay.

487
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,970
Do you know what they call people like you, who succeed from the bottom?

488
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,050
A myth. Why?

489
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,230
Because it's impossible for most people.

490
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:54,040
I'll just think that I won the lottery for having successful parents.

491
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,360
The remaining misfortunes... I'll consider them to be my payment.

492
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,110
There's no happiness you can enjoy to compensate for getting hit.

493
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,360
What are the "remaining" things? They are all misfortunes.

494
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:18,650
- No way! Cheongsong Art Museum got a search and seizure warrant!
- I heard that the artists are taking their artworks away, too?

495
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,310
I don't think you should be worrying about me right now.

496
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,780
I think there's someone else who's really unfortunate.

You wench, come here.

Go to Ahn Sang Tae and beg for forgiveness.

Leave, and it'll be good for you to think hard about how you're going to take responsibility for today,

604
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,990
because I'm not going to let this go.

605

All right, I'll get lost.

00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:07,520
I'll get lost. I'll definitely get lost.

610
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,620
All right.

611
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,740
What brings you here?

612
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:54,490
I heard about the search and seizure and that they took the artworks away.

613
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,200
I'm really terrible, aren't I?

614
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,610
I was up on my high horse in front of you.

615
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,670
Everything blew up all at once, without a chance for you to get it together. How could you handle that?

616
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,670
You're doing good just by the fact that you're hanging on.

617
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:21,210
About Si Hyung...

618
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:25,490
It's not my dad. You believe it too, right?

619
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,210
Of course, that's a given.

620
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,040
I'm gathering evidence to overturn that punk's claims.

621
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,350
I'm looking into the school that Si Hyung went to,

622
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,990
and those punks in the gang, Jae Soo, Hyung Woo, Yong Jin... I'm pursuing them, too.

623
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:46,550

I...
[Formal Written Accusation]

783
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:00,050
must have gone crazy for a moment.

784
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,540
You don't have to worry about the lawsuit.

785
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:09,600
I'm going to withdraw everything.

786
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:18,030
Forgive me. I apologize.

787
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,350
Did something happen?

788
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:29,670
Dali, please save our Cheongsong.

789
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,110
You're the only one who can save our Cheongsong.

790
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:39,220
From our ancestors for generations, we were respected and lived virtuously, and protected our Cheongsong.

791
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,010
How can I destroy it with my hands?

792
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:45,020
At least do it for your father, all right?

793
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,700
Dali, okay?

01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,620
can't you start over with him again?

I will... I'll beg you like this!

799
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,730
Yes, Dali? You just need to make up your mind.

800
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:23,910
The art museum? Cheongsong's honor? Your father's injustice, too!

801
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:27,680
We can solve all of it.

you can do that much, right?

806

Come on! You're a member of our Cheongsong family, too!

Wouldn't it just make it harder for him?

817
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,720
The things you want to protect... protect them by my side.

818
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,440
What money does the art museum have to pay me back now?

819
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:59,040
Unlike other people who say, "money this, money that"... I feel the weight of your money, Mr. Jin.

820
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,610
We have to step on them, so that they can never get back up again.

Ahn Sang Tae's higher-upper is Jang Tae Jin?

822
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,920
Don't get in. Talk to me first, we have something to talk about.

823
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,920
Until when are you going to listen to this pathetic talk?

824
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,730
I'm really sorry that this is the only decision I could make.
