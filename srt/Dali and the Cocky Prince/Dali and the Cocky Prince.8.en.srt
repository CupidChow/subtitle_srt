[Episode 8]

9
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,820
The moon is very bright.

10
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,420
It's the streetlights.

11
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,810
It is the streetlights.

12
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,690
Then, goodbye.

13
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,680
Oh, goodbye.

14
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,750
What are you doing? Where are you going?

15
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,790
I'm going to take a bus.

16
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,590
Are you telling me to send a woman by herself to take a bus at this hour?

17
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,510
After the incredible thing...

18
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,180
we just did...?

19
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,840
What... incredible thing...?

20
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,850
Hurry up and get in the car. Don't make me look weird.

21
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,460
It's because the bus is comfortable. I'll just take the bus today.

22
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,210
No!

23
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,480
The bus stop is just around the corner. Don't worry.

24
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,100
I drank.

25
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,230
- What?
- Are you going to let someone who drank drive?

26
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,890
Then,

27
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,160
you will get caught for aiding and abetting.

28
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,430
To turn on the navigation.

29
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,130
Okay.

30
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,270
Where is the friend's house that you live with?

31
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,030
Why?

32
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,140
Let's go to your friend's house first.

33
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,450
And then I can call a designated driver.

34
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,390
Okay.

35
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,050
- Where is–
- You don't have to put it in. I know the way.

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,400
It's not like I'm attacking you...

37
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,420
- Excuse─
- Excuse─

38
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,890
You can go first.

39
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,000
No, you go first.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,050
It's Ladies Bust.

41
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,850
What?

42
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,460
No, no. Ladies Fur.

43
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,700
Ladies First! First!

44
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,940
You can go first.

45
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,860
Your lips─

46
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,220
L-Lips? What about my lips?

47
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,730
You should wipe them because lipstick got on you.

48
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,750
We're here. You can get out.

49
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,550
Thank you.

50
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,170
How...

51
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,350
How did you know this was my house?

52
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,480
You said you live with Won Tak.

53
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,260
Didn't you say you don't know where he lives?

54
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,860
About that...

55
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,060
Won Tak! Hello.

56
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,810
I see you came out to throw away the trash.

57
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,670
What's going on?

58
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,270
Mr. Jin drank and I drove instead.

59
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,820
What?

60
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,650
No, no.

61
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,620
I wanted to bring her home, since it's dangerous.

62
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,140
Speaking of which, I want you to take me home.

63
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,500
I have a friend that I'm staying with for a while.

64
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,940
Friend's house.

65
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,180
That's okay. Our Won Tak can rest at home.

66
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,460
Let's go. I'll take you home.

67
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,790
No, Mr. Jin, you drank, so you have to go in and rest.

68
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,480
Our Won Tak can take me home. Right?

69
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,700
Yes.

70
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,960
Goodbye.

71
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,750
That...

72
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,220
What?

73
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,580
"Our" Won Tak?

74
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,490
"Our" Won Tak?

75
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,270
No. She just kissed me on my lips,

76
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,370
and now she's linking arms with another man and going home?

77
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,700
I wasn't going to brush my teeth today.

78
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,160
♫ I keep getting excited ♫

79
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,280
♫ I love you, love you, love you. I’m only thinking about you again ♫

80
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,190
♫ I keep getting nervous ♫

81
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,660
Why did I do that?

82
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,600
Why did I do that?

83
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,800
♫ I can see my reflection in your eyes ♫

84
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,470
Because of hormones?

85
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,030
Ovulation?

86
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,430
♫ It shines like the moon that rises high in the night sky, yeah ♫

87
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:04,080
Did his tears awaken my motherly instincts?

88
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,840
No, no.

89
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,630
♫ Your dazzling self has filled me up ♫

90
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,400
♫ I only want you by my side ♫

91
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,240
Then maybe?

92
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,530
Can I come in for a second?

93
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,210
Yes, you can.

94
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,100
Are you going somewhere?

95
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,290
It's an emergency, so I have to go out now.

96
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,190
I see...

97
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,740
Is there really nothing going on?

98
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,470
Nothing is going on.

99
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,050
If something happens, don't keep it to yourself and talk to me.

100
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,600
Last time at the police station and earlier, too.

101
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,680
Anyone can see something is weird between you two.

102
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,240
What's weird?

103
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,030
Are you, perhaps...?

104
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,340
Perhaps?

105
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,670
Are you being threatened?

106
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,520
What?

107
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,950
Threats can be simple.

108
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,950
Whether it's physical or mental, if they put pressure on you to feel fear, that's a threat.

109
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,230
There should only be financial obligations and rights between a debtor and a creditor.

110
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,710
It doesn't mean that the creditor can make unreasonable demands.

111
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,200
Why are you driving a drunk guy's car─?

112
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,100
Creditor... Debtor...

113
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,510
- What?
- Right.

114
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,090
- Are you listening to me?
- Sorry?

115
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,010
Yes. I'm listening.

116
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,440
Anyway, even if he is a creditor,

117
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,040
make sure you are clear with him what the expectations are and don't let him take advantage of you.

118
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,590
If you can't, do you want me to take care of it?

119
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,230
No, I'll take care of it.

120
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,070
And I'll tell you if anything happens.

121
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,990
Get yourself together, Kim Dali.

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,980
Oh my goodness.

123
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,630
Are they really in line to see our exhibition and not here to get debt?

124
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,420
I even called the Korea Meteorological Administration and asked if the sun rose from the west today?

125
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,630
Hello, everyone...

126
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,820
Director.

127
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,060
Congratulations.

128
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,370
There's a line outside! It's crazy!

129
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,600
Yes!

130
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,160
But...

131
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,090
Who do you think invited all the celebrities and influencers?

132
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,280
They probably just found out somehow.

133
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,050
I'm sure they must have heard about it.

134
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,810
There was so much buzz after the director's press conference.

135
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,950
That's right. Everyone was going crazy researching what dress and jewelry she was wearing.

136
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,090
It was my first time seeing a celebrity!

137
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,540
Do you really think those people would come for nothing?

138
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,140
They have the influence to increase a brand's sales just by uploading a picture of themselves holding their bag.

139
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,060
It's all about money.

140
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,990
Money.

141
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,540
Gong Joo. A person in the arts shouldn't be so obsessed with money.

142
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,170
I understand that the world is under the rule of capitalism,

143
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,260
but there are so many things in this world that can't be calculated with money.

144
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,010
Keep that in mind. Okay?

145
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,030
In any case, we were able to bring all those expensive celebrities here,

146
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,430
without even having to pay for their travel expenses, thanks to the director's press conference!

147
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,240
Is this what it means when they say one person is worth a hundred men?

148
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,500
You are truly our art museum's lucky charm.

149
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,220
No, I'm not.

150
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,940
Kim Dali!

151
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,740
- Kim Dali! Kim Dali! Kim Dali!
- Kim Dali! Kim Dali! Kim Dali!

152
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,440
Why are you doing this?

153
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,850
All I did was finalize the deal that was already set and done by you all.

154
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,910
Well, if you're going to be this humble, then we'll have to praise you even more. One more round!

155
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:48,310
- Kim Dali! Kim Dali! Kim Dali! Kim Dali!
- Kim Dali! Kim Dali! Kim Dali! Kim Dali!

156
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,070
- Kim Dali, Dali!
- Kim Dali, Dali!

157
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,440
- Kim Dali!
- Hey!

158
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,180
- Kim Dali!
- Hey!

159
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,640
Hey! Oh!

160
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,010
Hello, Sir.

161
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,030
Let's go have our meeting.

162
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,640
- We had a meeting today?
- Yes, let's go.

163
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,380
Oh, really?

164
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,020
Where's...

165
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,900
Where's my notebook?

166
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,550
Oh, hey!

167
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,990
Why are you pushing me?

168
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,580
Then we'll prepare the Cheongsong Art Camp program with Dondon F&B,

169
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,930
and we'll send all the necessary documents to Dondon once they're ready.

170
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,510
I'll visit the orphanage we'll be working with myself. What's next?

171
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,300
Next is about services for the visitors.

172
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,090
We have an idea about creating a kid's café in the art museum,

173
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,770
for parents who are exhausted from raising their kids to be able to enjoy the museum more peace─

174
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,600
We can't do that.

175
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,000
Even though the world may be less conservative now, we can't have a kiss café.

176
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,980
Why do people need to kiss at the art museum?

177
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,790
Kids café. K-i-d. Kids.

178
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,410
Was my... pronunciation that bad?

179
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,230
I said, '-d-s'. Kids café.

180
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,520
Not kiss. Kids café.

181
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,570
The next agenda point is to get in touch with Keith Ha─

182
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,440
How can you kiss without touching?

183
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,260
Are you that skilled?

184
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,900
It's the painter's name. Painter. Keith Haring.

185
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,650
Keith Haring.

186
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,870
Why is the painter's name like this?

187
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,200
Is it even his real name?

188
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,630
The workshop that'll be resumed next week is "Poems and Masterpieces."

189
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,030
It'll discuss the romantic poets Wordsworth, Byron...

190
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,460
K-ea-ts.

191
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,060
K-eats -eats.

192
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,290
K-ea-ts.

193
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,950
T. T.

194
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,090
T. T.

195
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,320
T. Oh, I'm sorry.

196
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,390
T. T.

197
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,440
T? T... I got it.

198
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,500
Correct.

199
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,770
Okay, carry on.

200
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,210
Did you get home safely yesterday?

201
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,960
What's wrong?

202
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,840
What is it now?

203
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,220
Mr. Jin.

204
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,860
Tell me.

205
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,460
Why are you really doing this?

206
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,110
What did I do?

207
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,600
If it's because you feel uncomfortable about what happened yesterday, then─

208
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,850
What's there to be uncomfortable about? It's not like we're teenagers.

209
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,950
Adult men and women can do that.

210
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,070
You see... My guard came down after a long day,

211
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,870
I was tired, and the mood must've gotten to me. It was a mistake...

212
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,200
A mistake?

213
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,410
Discourtesy?

214
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,470
Discourtesy?

215
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,200
- An accident?
- An accident?

216
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,590
Whatever the case... I'd like to apologize.

217
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:42,900
Would it be possible to go back to our amicable creditor-debtor relationship like before, as if nothing ever happened?

218
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,760
Like you said, since we're adults with dignity.

219
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,080
What would the employees think? We also have so much work to be done─

220
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,290
Are you the type to kiss a guy by accident?

221
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,380
I never make a mistake when it comes to my mouth.

222
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,810
Eating... talking...

223
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,050
and also the thing we did yesterday.

224
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,590
Plus, who makes a mistake that passionate─

225
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,510
It wasn't passionate.

226
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:17,880
♫ From your eyes that are looking at me ♫

227
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,770
♫ My heart is filling up with you ♫

228
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,190
It wasn't a mistake for me.

229
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,610
So, Kim Dali, you should think about it again.

230
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,760
Whether the moment we shared yesterday

231
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,460
was a mistake or not.

232
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,810
♫ And I swear to you that someday ♫

233
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:49,000
♫ I promise you, I'll always make you smile ♫

234
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,500
Oh, man.

235
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,410
I'm sorry, sir. The path is a little difficult.

236
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,220
It's all right.

237
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,900
This way.

238
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,180
It's that house.

239
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,830
This is the house?

240
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,540
The one on top of the building?

241
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,210
Yes, Sir.

242
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,320
That's Joo Won Tak's home.

243
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,410
And Dali is living here?

244
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,790
Yes, Sir.

245
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,120
Also...

246
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,560
There's more?

247
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,090
The building's owner is Jin Moo Hak.

248
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,190
Gamjatang?

249
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,950
Seeing that he's been living here for a long time, I don't think it was on purpose.

250
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,010
It seems to be a coincidence.

251
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,090
A coincidence?

252
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,520
He's a bothersome man in many ways.

253
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,540
We can't do that.

254
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,080
Even though the world may be less conservative now, we can't have a kiss café.

255
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,500
Why do people need to kiss at the art museum?

256
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,430
How can you kiss without touching?

257
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:22,290
♫ Can’t someone love me, though I’m good for nothing? ♫

258
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,640
♫ Oh oh oh ♫

259
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:32,980
♫ From my sad gestures ♫

260
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:39,810
♫ to my poor soul ♫

261
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,630
♫ Oh oh oh ♫

262
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,180
♫ I don’t want to surprise your gentle heart ♫

263
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,480
It wasn't a mistake for me.

264
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,910
So, Kim Dali, you should think about it again.

265
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,470
Whether the moment we shared yesterday

266
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,830
was a mistake or not.

267
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,780
♫ But I think I love you ♫

268
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,530
Tae Jin?

269
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,680
Why are you here?

270
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,930
I have more things to ask you─

271
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,980
Damn. If your dog pooped, then you should clean it!

272
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,880
What is it?

273
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,350
What's going on?

274
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,150
My goodness.

275
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,610
What is it?

276
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,990
Sir, please start driving. Go.

277
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,700
Please start driving.

278
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,220
You can sit up now. We turned the corner.

279
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,920
How did you find this place?

280
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,970
Which one do you think is harder? Understanding this situation

281
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,200
or finding Won Tak's house?

282
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,230
A Support Association?

283
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,650
It's a group of young executives to gather to ride yachts and play golf.

284
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,040
And those kinds of gatherings love to have a reason to gather.

285
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,270
They loved it when I said it should be the Cheongsong Support Association.

286
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,540
If there's a good cause, they will open up their wallets for it. So you should make a good program for it.

287
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,960
It was really hard for me.

288
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,120
While I was preparing for this show, I went around a lot to find sponsors.

289
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,690
Those were also all of my father's connections.

290
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,970
But they all said, "The economy is bad, or they don't have time."

291
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,070
It was difficult for me to get a meeting.

292
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:41,130
For them, the reason for funding wasn't the art but your father.

293
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,410
They probably lost the motivation to open their wallets after your father passed away.

294
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,300
While you were living abroad, a lot of people in this industry changed.

295
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,720
I'll slowly introduce them to you.

296
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,910
You're free this weekend, right?

297
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,380
- This weekend?
- Yes.

298
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,400
Yes, come to this weekend's gathering. It'll be good for you to meet them naturally.

299
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,230
Why? Do you have something to do?

300
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,400
I feel pathetic.

301
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:19,820
Was I this incompetent? Was I not able to do anything by myself?

302
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,470
I keep having to owe you.

303
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,930
It makes me hate myself.

304
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:32,350
Why does it make you incompetent when you took the biggest responsibility during the most difficult time after your father passed away?

305
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,900
You gave up your favorite studies and you cleared out your estate.

306
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:42,380
Nobody can give up the things that you gave up to save the art museum.

307
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,660
You're doing great.

308
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,440
But where are we going right now?

309
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,730
What are we doing here?

310
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,860
I don't know if you remember it, but the passcode is still the same.

311
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,150
Let's talk inside.

312
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,640
I couldn't sell this apartment because we chose this place together.

313
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,030
But also, I can't move in here by myself.

314
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,690
Besides Secretary Kim and me, nobody in my family nor company knows about this place.

315
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,080
That means it can be kept in complete secrecy.

316
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,270
Kept as a secret?

317
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,830
You don't have to make it complicated. It's just an empty apartment.

318
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:22,480
You can stay here whenever you need to, and you can leave whenever you want to as well.

319
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,770
But if you don't leave, that will be better.

320
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,050
Dali.

321
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,350
Then, what should I do?

322
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,700
How can I just let you live in a place that doesn't even look like a house?

323
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,240
I'm not buying a new house. Can't I at least do this much for you?

324
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,720
Everyone else can do it, but you shouldn't.

What?

326
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,700
Just a couple of days before the wedding,

327
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,910
you dumped me in the rain as if I were a contagious disease patient.

328
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,670
But how can you bring me here as if you're kind when I have no place to go?

329
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,310
To our newlywed apartment?

330
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,800
Are you saying this is being thoughtful?

331
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,420
Did you think I'd be touched if the passcode is the same?

332
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:15,160
How can you be cool like this? How can you be... so fine?

333
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,490
If I were fine,

334
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,840
I would've not let you be like this.

335
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,030
I wanted to take responsibility for you as the deceased's family when I saw you again at the funeral!

336
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,350
I tried my best not to hurt your feelings, for you not to run away,

337
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,010
so I was being careful, restless, and hesitant. Didn't you know?

338
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,210
It's not because my love for you is small,

339
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,630
but because I didn't want to use your situation in my favor.

340

Let's get back together.

In the past five years, I never forgot about you.

343
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,410
Because of the choice I made,

344
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,200
every day was painful.

345
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,360
You didn't forget me as well, am I wrong?

346
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:17,610
You're right. I never forgot about you, either.

347
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,990
How can I forget about it when I hear something like that?

348
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:30,290
But... could something that wasn't possible five years ago

349

be possible now?

I just like this neighborhood a lot.

00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:48,080
It has a playground, and the convenience store is close by.

Also, the view from the rooftop house is amazing.

Is there a neighborhood that's not like that?

So you should come home and sleep there.

393

You always sleep in the night-duty room because of me, saying that you are working overtime, or you have an emergency.

If you keep doing that, then I can't stay here.

Right, if you eat at home, it's a home-cooked meal.

But do you have to do a taste test at home?

00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,480
♫ Who never said a word ♫

483
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,530
If you're lonely, you should get married.

484
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,130
Married? To who? Ahn Sang Tae's daughter?

485
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:20,660
What's so special about being an assemblyman? The one who has money has the power.

486
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,450
Oh, it looks like Hawaii!

487
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,780
Here you go.

488
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,830
Thank you.

489
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,160
It's like summer.

490
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,600
There's something on you.

491
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,720
Let me wipe it for you!

492
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,160
I'll do it by myself!

493
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,350
I'll get it. It's gone, right?

494
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,170
You know, about marriage.

495
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,990
You should marry a woman who you love,

496
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:07,070
not the one who loves you. Don't you agree?

497
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,910
What are you talking about right now?

498
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,940
He's just talking nonsense.

499
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,390
Hey! Hey!

500
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,470
Take this with you.

501
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,350
[Jokbal Night Market]

502
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,450
We bought one more for you to eat at home.

503
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,270
And take this as well.

504
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,650
Is it soybean paste?

505
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,700
It's soybean paste from a 100-year-old family. Make some soup out of it.

506
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,210
You should've wrapped it in some cloth! You're ruining my style.

507
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,890
Hey.

508
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,360
How long are you going to leave the art museum like that?

509
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,540
What do you mean?

510
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,350
While you're hesitating, what are you going to do if someone comes out

511
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,700
and says they'll pay back the 2 billion won and tells you to get out?

512
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,780
Kim Dali can't protect the art museum anyway.

513
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:03,060
Stop exhausting the poor girl by giving her false hope,

514
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,560
and just tell her that Dondon will take over.

515
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,570
What are you talking about?

516
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:12,380
You weren't planning to leave with just getting the 2 billion back anyway.

517
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:18,230
If you're going to take it... take it now.

518
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,790
Before all sorts of other people start getting involved, okay?

519
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,480
There was something on your jacket.

520
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,000
You should get going.

521
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:05,840
Yes, Secretary Yeo. I need you to look into something for me.

522
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,830
My brother?

523
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,330
He bought this land? Why?

524
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,350
You didn't know either?

525
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,840
It's quite a large amount of land.

526
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,690
Are there any redevelopment opportunities or something?

527
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,670
It's a restricted development area.

528
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,900
There shouldn't be any deals, to begin with.

529
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,180
Or that's what I thought. But that wasn't the case.

530
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,780
About five to six years ago, they secretly started making deals,

531
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:40,320
and it picked up again very recently. Do you know when that happened?

532
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,070
It was after director Kim Nak Chun passed away.

533
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:50,590
You told me once that a lot of people are after Cheongsong Art Museum.

534
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,600
Just what exactly did you hear and from whom?

535
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,220
Director Kim Nak Chun was like a thorn in the sides of those eyeing the land.

536
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:05,480
Not only was the art museum's land in the way of the most important location

537
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,640
but he also had a lot of social influence, and he was completely against the land being redeveloped.

538
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,130
Apparently, he worked with non-governmental organizations and was adamant about it.

539
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,440
Kim Dali can't protect the art museum anyway.

540
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,430
If you're going to take it... take it now.

541
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,430
Before all sorts of other people start getting involved, okay?

542
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:32,210
But... I looked into the land register because I had a hunch.

543
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,440
You know the VIP guests who came to the opening party?

544
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,740
I saw a lot of their names.

545
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,710
There are many reporters here.

546
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,110
- A goshiwon?
- Yes.
(T/N: 'goshiwon' - accommodations for students who usually study for national exams)

547
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,130
Why does someone like you want to know about a goshiwon?

548
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,880
I was just curious how much those places cost.

549
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,970
It depends on the condition,

550
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,940
but you can probably live in one for three months for the price of the scarf you're wearing.

551
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,440
Ms. Gong Joo.

552
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,540
Did I make a mistake with you?

553
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:22,770
Why do I feel like you're always very short with me?

554
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,890
Did you ever think that it's maybe not me being short with you,

555
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:30,020
but instead, everyone around you is overly friendly to you?

556
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,100
Excuse me?

557
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,930
Am I wrong?

558
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:39,160
Everyone is always dying to help you, they make a big deal out of nothing, they praise you and worship you.

559
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,040
Think about this exhibition, too.

560
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,610
All you did was finalize the deal that we prepared everything for,

561
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:48,270
but you took all the credit for yourself.

562
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,630
I envy you.

563
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,530
The world is your oyster thanks to the power of the Cheongsong name.

564
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:57,900
I'm truly sorry if you felt that way, Ms. Gong Joo.

565
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:03,570
But Ms. Gong Joo... Not everything is what it seems.

566
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,530
You're right.

567
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,760
Not everything is what it seems.

568
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,220
You're here!

569
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,900
The director and Secretary Yeo are going to be a little late,

570
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,880
so they said they'll be joining later.

571
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,160
All right.

572
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,890
Let's go in.

573
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,610
The "Three Frogs Restaurant" is not a program to feed children,

574
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,900
but it's to help them understand Da Vinci's world of art by participating in making his recipes.

575
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,570
That's the purpose of this─

576
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,560
So, we should work on a more realistic recipe─

577
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,420
Yes, Curator Song? What is it?

578
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:53,460
I think there might have been a mistake, but I was told that Ms. Ham Yeon Ji's transportation fee was left out.

579
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:58,520
After I looked into it, they were from a company that specializes

580
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,040
in inviting celebrities to launch events or opening events to have them post on their social media for marketing purposes.

581
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,210
They were apparently contacted by Dondon.

582
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,860
How should I take care of this?

583
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,980
The area is restricted from here to here.

584
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:14,870
- Come in.
- This is the key location.

585
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:17,310
- Director.
- Yes?

586
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,950
The meeting's already over? I was just about to make my way there.

587
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,080
Should I get some tea or something...?

588
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,390
I'll do it myself. The two of you can leave.

589
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,870
Yes, Sir.

590
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,110
Take a seat first.

591
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,330
What is it?

592
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:57,510
What happened? Why is your face so pale?

593
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,330
Mr. Jin.

594
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,540
Talk to me.

595
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,540
Did you happen to

596
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,760
call a PR company for the opening event?

597
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,910
All the idols, YouTubers, and influencers that we didn't invite...

598
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:14,280
That's right. Yes, I called them.

599
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,760
Excuse me?

600
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:23,510
I thought something really bad had happened.

601
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,280
My gosh.

602
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,420
We can't ignore how important the opening is.

603
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,850
Whenever you release a new product or open a store,

604
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:35,600
you have to blast it everywhere by calling some people,

605
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,770
and make them spread the word, too.

606
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,760
Even if it costs some money,

607
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,760
I was willing to risk it for the opening to be a success.

608
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,410
That's how you make a profitable business.

609
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:50,240
Look what happened. The exhibit is full of people!

610
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,290
Then the visitors from the first day also...

611
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,880
Oh, right, yes. That didn't cost a lot.

612
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,840
It's no use if only word gets spread. Whether it's a picture or a drawing, there needs to be evidence.

613
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,570
All we needed was a few people lined up,

614
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:05,760
and take a good picture of them, and it'll look like a lot of people─

615
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,390
Seriously, why are you doing this?

616
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,600
What do you mean, "why"?

617
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,280
It's all so that we can make money.

618
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,260
Do you think I'm doing this with money growing from trees?

619
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,400
And even people selling snacks in front of elementary schools use people to draw attention.

620
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,300
It's the most basic tactic.

621
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,470
You're making it seem like I used some sort of grand tactic─

622
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,660
An art museum is not a business.

623
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:32,030
Why not? You sell tickets for money.

624
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:36,450
What? Does it sound lowly and degrading because I called it a business?

625
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:39,400
Does it hurt your pride because it has to be elegant, noble, and look good?

626
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,370
That's not what I'm saying.

627
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,930
This is an action of deceiving the visitors.

628
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,160
- What a load of crap!
- Mr. Jin.

629
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,410
I thought you came to your senses, but you still have a long way to go.

630
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,320
All right, fine.

631
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,370
You lived your entire life never having to worry about money, so I'll let that go.

632
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:58,970
But what are you going to do about all the art or artworks that you live for?

633
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,070
Is it enough with just having you people pretend to be noble,

634
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:05,060
party, and drink wine?

635
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,700
You don't need visitors?

636
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,770
You're okay with people not seeing the art?

637
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:13,110
You said that artists torment themselves for years to create them.

638
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,090
You said that people who work at the art museum like you,

639
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,280
prepared it while losing sleep!

640
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,310
Then shouldn't we try to show it to even one more person?

641
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:28,770
This piece was done by the artist, Choi Jeong Hwa.

642
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:33,090
You can see here that it's been made with everyday trash.

643
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:36,020
Over here...

644
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:49,450
How is a dark and empty art museum,

645
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:52,010
different from a crypt?

646
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:56,840
I know that everything you're saying is right.

647
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,300
But why don't I want to admit it?

648
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:04,750
I know I should try everything in order to show these good pieces to at least one more person.

649
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,710
And, of course, I'll need money, too.

650
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:13,490
But I can't accept everything being done solely by money.

651
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:18,620
And that's not because of my pride or because I'm noble.

652
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:24,930
I hate that all the hard work my employees put in got dismissed because of money.

653
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,520
I feel ashamed towards other art museums, too.

654
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,860
If it had been done fairly

655
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,130
then you probably wouldn't have hidden it from me either. Isn't that right?

656
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,730
It's not that it was unfair

657
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,200
but what if it was because I wanted to see you happy?

658
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:58,960
Like in the Netherlands, to see you smile without a care for at least one day?

659
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,190
Then you should've found another way.

660
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,720
Come here, you bastard!

661
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,980
Damn it!

662
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,250
You punk!

663
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,170
Let me go, you bastard!

664
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,430
Let me go, you bastard!

665
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,800
Do you not know who I am?

666
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,390
I'm Kim Si Hyung! Cheongsong family's eldest son!

667
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:12,250
Exactly. Why would the great Cheongsong's eldest son

668
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,780
borrow money and disappear from the grid?

669
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,450
Are you trying to piss off us common folk?

670
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:19,310
That money is nothing.

671
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,630
Do you know how much the art museum's land is worth?

672
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:26,430
How can common folk like us know that?

673
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:30,710
All we know is that you've been cut off from your family.

674
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,480
What did you say, you bastard?

675
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,700
You have a week.

676
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:39,570
Whether it's money, possessions, or your will...

677
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:43,470
you'll have to bring at least one out of the three options, do you hear me?

678
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,480
Move it. Move!

679
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,680
This is it?

680
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,260
Hey, we have to order more coffee beans and other materials for this month.

681
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,830
Did the money for the operating expenses not come in yet?

682
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:04,590
I was told that the museum is going to manage the orders and sales personally from now on.

683
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:07,420
He took the ledger, card statements, and everything.

684
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,680
Who did?

685
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,580
Who? The new director.

686
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,240
Has she lost her mind?

687
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,740
Where is it?

688
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,860
Where did you hide it!

689
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,660
Where is my café ledger!

690
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,480
Hey. Who do you think you are to take my ledger whenever you want?

691
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,480
Who are you to arrogantly manage the café yourself?

692
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,330
What's wrong with you, Mr. Kim?

693
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:45,010
Stay out of this, Mrs. Song! This is between family!

694
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,630
Watch your mouth!

695
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:48,270
What?

696
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,650
You can leave, Curator Song. It's all right.

697
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,070
Okay.

698
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:08,010
In principle, the café is one of the art museum's business departments.

699
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,440
What's the problem with me personally taking care of a department with poor results?

700
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,580
The café... was put under my care,

701
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:18,440
by my uncle personally, so that I can learn how to operate the art museum.

702
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,280
Instead of you, who abandoned your father, art museum, and everything else because you were dumped by a guy!

703
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,010
Do you think you know everything?

704
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:29,790
This art museum was supposed to be all mine!

705
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:32,670
That's very different from what I heard from my father.

706
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:35,790
After getting kicked out of school because of drugs, and your father kicking you out from home,

707
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:40,320
he told me, "It may help him if I let him take care of the café instead of wandering around Korea with nothing."

708
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,950
That's what he told me.

709
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,920
- What?
- The operating costs are given monthly,

710
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,600
but the ledger that's supposed to record how and where that money has been spent, and how much the revenue is,

711
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,910
was a complete mess, and it hasn't even been reported.

712
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:55,420
That was my father. He probably let you off the hook because you're his nephew. But I won't allow it anymore.

713
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,900
You can leave the museum if you have a problem with that.

714
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,930

The art museum is struggling.

717
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,900
This isn't just my problem. It affects you and our family, too.

718
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,280
Help me. Yes?

719
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,330
Who else can I trust and rely on in this situation?

720
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:25,400
That's why I'm saying just leave it to me and leave.

721
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,680
Just do that.

722
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,480
I'll make sure to take care of you after it's done.

723
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,300
- What?
- Hey.

724
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:36,950
Do you honestly think it makes sense for a girl to inherit the family's wealth?

725
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:40,300
What have you done except being born as your father's child?

726
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,810
I'm warning you...

727
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:46,430
don't mess with me.

728
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:49,540
You have no idea what I can do if you mess with me again.

729
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,320
Got it?

730
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,980
Are you okay?

731
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:35,080
Yes, I'm okay.

732
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:40,430
He at least pretended to try when the director was alive.

733
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:44,200
I guess he's not afraid of anything now.

734
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,740
They say that some people express their sadness with anger.

735
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:51,820
He's probably acting that way because he's upset, too.

736
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,370
If he was that type of person, then...

737
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:58,590
Sure. If you say so.

738

I'll do it.

739
