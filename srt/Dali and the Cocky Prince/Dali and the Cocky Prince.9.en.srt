[Episode 9: Will everyone become an adult?]

2
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,950
That startled me.

3
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,340
What's that?

4
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,720
What's all this?

5
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,180
Miss Dali?

6
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,290
What are you doing here right now...?

7
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,520
Are you okay?

8
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,020
You scared me.

9
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,430
You can't walk into someone's house without making any sound.

10
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,460
I'm sorry. I just saw the door open—

11
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,980
But what's going on? Why are you here, and why is the inside like this?

12
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,560
I thought the thief came back.

13
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,320
It's okay.

14
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,250
Everything is okay now.

[Police]

16
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,130
Why would someone search like that and not take anything?

17
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,950
Maybe someone was just joking around?

18
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,160
Joking? The owner came in and the thief ran away.

19
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,020
We'll leave now.

20
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,090
Oh, okay. Thank you.

21
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,240
No.

22
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,290
It was because the cat suddenly popped out of nowhere. Really.

23
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,060
All right.

24
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,220
I'll make sure to lock the door before I sleep.

25
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,540
Okay.

26
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,410
Are you okay now?

27
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,050
Yes.

28
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,030
They say they will investigate,

29
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,280
but I don't know if they're going to do it properly since there is no damage.

30
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,320
Does anyone perhaps know that you live here?

31
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,290
Among the art museum staff?

32
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,720
Among the art museum staff?

33
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,450
No. They don't.

34
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,710
Is that so?

35
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,160
Why?

36
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
No, it's nothing.

37
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,800
Look carefully again to see if there is anything missing.

38
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,010
I don't think there is—

39
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,070
I mean...

40
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,910
why did they put so much effort into finding something?

41
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,890
What about the tenant? Did he say he's not coming?

42
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,770
I purposely didn't tell Won Tak because it was an emergency.

43
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,410
I didn't want him to worry.

44
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,840
Let's clean this up and go to my house.

45
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,810
You have to eat dinner, too.

46
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,790
Just pack what you need and come out.

47
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,820
No. I'm fine now, so you should go home, Mr. Jin—

48
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,330
What kind of insane man would leave a woman he likes alone in a house with a broken lock?

49
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,270
You're so selfish.

50
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,810
Don't be stubborn and come with me.

51
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,260
How did it go?

52
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,800
- It's not there.
- What?

53
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,450
I can't do it anymore. I almost got caught by Kim Dali!

54
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,330
- You said she was going to the countryside for a writer's meeting!
- It must have been canceled.

55
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,410
What the hell are you doing this for, to the point you would have to go this far?

56
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,520
There's no way that something that looks like a stamp is a lump of gold!

57
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,920
Don't tell me...

No, Uncle.

I don't care what happens to me,

but what about the art museum? What about my family?

This is driving me crazy!

You're crazy.

67
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,180
Hold on. Why are you looking for things like that at the director's house?

68
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,350
- What did you do to the director?
- I didn't do anything!

69
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,380
My uncle brought this on himself! He shouldn't have been that stubborn.

Don't you dare call me again.

What did you just say? You'll go to the police?!

- This fucking bitch!
- What?

Do you think I'm just saying it? Should I go right now?

We have a nice and big painting hanging in our living room, too.

101

And I admire it every day. Morning and night.

Sit down. Nothing's going to happen if you sit.

105
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,360
It's just a pot of soybean paste.

106
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,340
It's not Goryeo celadon or Joseon white porcelain.

107
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,680
I don't have anything like that in my house.

108
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,980
Still, the wallpaper and curtains are of the highest quality interior.

109
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,190
There's nothing special about art.

110
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,130
Then, why is Cheongsong Art Museum sending you this kind of chamber-pot crap?

111
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,470
When I asked them about it, they said they sent it to thank you for loaning them money.

112
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,360
Chamber-pot!

113

- What?
- What?

114
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,650
It's just a pot of soybean paste. I'm worried it'll smell too much.

115
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,510
All right.

116
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,580
Didn't you say you were going to prepare something simple?

117
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,390
It is simple... there's no Gujeolpan,
(T/N: "gujeolpan" a traditional Korean Platter of Nine Delicacies)

118
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,280
braised short ribs, or even grilled octopus sticks.

119
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,510
Hurry up and eat before it gets cold.

120
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,530
It's because of the promise you made to your mother, right?

121
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,740
Pardon?

122
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,720
You told me that she was always heartbroken about the fact that her son grew up without his mom,

123
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,890
and she worried you would skip your meals.

124
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,110
That's why you never skip your meals.

125
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,110
Why would you remember something so unimportant?

126
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,300
It must have been tough for you to act like an adult from ten years old.

127
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,790
My father always told me...

128
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:20,380
you have to sleep and eat well on your own to become a real adult.

129
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,650
My dad ended up passing away before I became an adult.

130
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,440
That fact eats me up the most.

131
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,090
How many kids can say they're adults in front of their parents?

132
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,070
We're all children.

133
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:54,250
But you're facing all kinds of hardships right now and becoming an adult.

134
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,690
I'm sure he's cheering you on.

135
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,080
You said, that he'll always be watching.

136
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,660
Come on, the food's going to get cold. Hurry up and eat.

137
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,380
Excuse me... Mr. Jin?

138
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,180
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner...

139
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,050
about living together with Won Tak.

140
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,640
I'm well aware of what you're worried about.

141
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,650
- You don't have to worry—
- What am I worried about?

142
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,830
- Pardon?
- I said, what am I worried about?

143
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,340
Well... it's the electricity bills, water bills...

144
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,930
You know very well... then try to conserve as much.

145
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,660
Don't go around turning all the lights on.

146
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,950
Of course... don't worry.

147
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,060
Have you...

148
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,870
ever been told that you're oblivious, perhaps?

149
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,370
Never.

150
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:12,220
Man... I told you that cooking starts with prepping the ingredients and ends with doing the dishes, too.

151
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,280
This is the least I can do to thank you.

152
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,010
Oh, you can sleep—

153
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,390
I'll sleep in the bedroom.

154
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,880
Since you're the owner of this home, you should sleep in the living room.

155
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,760
Okay... let's do that then.

156
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,740
I'm not oblivious to the point that I'll hog the TV when I'm already spending the night.

157
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,240
The room with the TV is the better room.

158
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,610
I'm so grateful... that you're being so thoughtful...

159
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,390
Oh, also, I changed out the sheets and pillowcase today, so...

160
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,970
Have you... ever even washed dishes before?

161
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,230
Of course! What's so hard about washing dishes? You just use detergent to scrub things off,

162
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,760
and then rinse everything.

163
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,320
Oh, what do I do?

164
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,690
I'm sorry... I...

165
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:47,810
I think... you'll need a towel...

166
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,220
How can I not worry about you, when you're like this?

167
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,490
♫ Don't take that he says he will be better ♫

168
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,770
You're still completely oblivious.

169
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,640
Pick up your phone. It's been ringing since earlier.

170
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:17,810
♫ Well, a good time doesn't last long ♫

171
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,090
♫ Don't take it so hard ♫

172
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,900
♫ Like a strawberry sundae, dig all the way ♫

173
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,620
I ate.

174
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,240
Really, nothing happened to me, so don't worry about me and get back to work.

175
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,660
All right.

176
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,990
♫ Time will be on your side ♫

177
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,420

00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,850
♫ One day, it'll be ♫

179
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,050

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,750
50% discount event!

♫ One day, it'll be ♫

186
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,930
What was that?

187
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,940
Is it not her?

188
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,820
Why would the art museum's employee do that for?

189
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,320
Is something going on today?

190
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,990
Mom...

191
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,120
Ms. Dali.

192
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,470
- Ms. Dali.
- Mom!

193
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,550
Ms. Dali!

194
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,670
What is it? Did you have a bad dream?

195
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,770
I'm sorry. I knocked but...

196
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,300
I kept hearing crying sounds.

197
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,950
I'm sorry... You must've woken up because of me.

198
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,340
Are you okay?

199
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,880
No...

200
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,870
I'm not okay.

201
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,200
I'm not okay...

202
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:56,090
♫ Everything is crumbling down. A little strange ♫

203
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:01,840
♫ So bitter, just a little much ♫

204
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,660
I apologize again for the mistake I made last time.

205
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,840
I'm grateful for the way you feel... but I can't accept it.

206
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,080
I'm sorry...

207
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,750
♫ You can be the rest of me ♫

208
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,900
♫ Maybe in time ♫

209
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,840
♫ You can be mine, yeah ♫

210
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,510
Do you not like me because I'm ignorant?

211
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,420
You're a wise person, Mr. Jin.

212
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,390
Or do you not like me because I'm a materialistic person who's crazed about money?

213
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:41,340
You're someone I'm grateful for because you're helping our art museum. You're not a materialistic person.

214
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,360
Then, what is it?

215
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,770
Is it perhaps... because of Jang Tae Jin?

216
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,740
I can't say that it's not.

217
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,970
I don't know how much you know,

218
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,140
but I'm afraid to love someone

219
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:10,030
or give my heart and dream about something together.

220
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,990
They say that to love,

221
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,500
is to accept the risk of not receiving that love back.

222
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,470
I don't have the confidence to take that risk.

223
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,460
I don't know sayings that are hard and complex like that.

224
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,740
So, it means that you don't have another man in mind.

225
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,100
It also doesn't mean that you're going to try to make it work with Jang Tae Jin again either.

226
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,390
You don't hate me,

227
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,470
- or get creeped out, or disgusted by me. Right?
- Mr. Jin...

228
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,680
Then it's fine. I don't know what risk a person has to take

229
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,490
when they like another person,

230
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,420
but I understand for now.

231
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,890
You're saying that your heart hasn't healed yet.

232
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,400
I won't pressure someone who's hurt.

233
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:14,060
Let's just say that we'll stay in the "amicable creditor-debtor relationship" you said last time,

234
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,950
for the time being then.

235
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,520
Mr. Jin...

236
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,010
There are still many hours left until the sun comes up. Get some more sleep.

237
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,680
Don't have a nightmare this time.

238
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,710
♫ Can you not love me ♫

239
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:41,850
Oh... I would like you to know this one thing.

240
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:47,660
You're much braver than you think you are.

241
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:54,010
I'm saying that you're not someone to quit because you're afraid of something. At least as far as I know.

242
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,860
But if your reason is because of someone who hurt you...

243
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,510
then that's even more unlike Kim Dali.

244
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,800
Good night.

245
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:15,280
♫ I think I love you ♫

246
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:28,000
You're not... in danger of love... l-lo-love

247
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,170
lo-love... with love...

248
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,810
[₩50,000]

249
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,660
- Take this sandwich and eat it later.
- No, it's okay.

250
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,760
Come on, take it.

251
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,340
I won't feel comfortable if you skip breakfast when I know you couldn't sleep all night.

252
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,830
Won Tak.

253
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,860
What are you two doing?

254
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,820
It's nothing.

255
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,540
- So, nothing much happened?
- Yes.

256
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,000
- Are you hurt anywhere?
- No.

257
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,840
She was lucky that I showed up just in time.

258
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,420
If not then–

259
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,580
You call this a door? Any idiot will be able to come in.

260
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,040
Are you going to take responsibility if a burglar or someone breaks in?

261
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,710
Why would a burglar break into a roof-top house? What's there to steal? They won't even break even for the labor cost.

262
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,520
- What did you just say?
- Put your mind at ease.

263
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,670
Your face is a security system!

264
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,760
Well... I didn't know that Kim Dali lived here.

265
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,360
Also, why do you lack tenacity?

266
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,990
If it doesn't work out once, you have to ask twice, if not twice, then ask th-three times...

267
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,300
you have to knock down the door until you get what you want...

268
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,930
I'm saying, why did you say it only once... just once...

269
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,900
You better thank the heavens.

270
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,680
If there had been a single scratch on Dali's body...

271
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,670
you would have been smelling the scent of incense behind your funeral table.

272
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,540
Why are you hassling Mr. Jin? He was helping me all night yesterday.

273
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,570
Let's go in.

274
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,330
- This isn't a petty burglary.
- What?

275
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,280
With years of experience as a detective, you probably sense something is off too.

276
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,400
Dondon F&B's owner's house is directly below.

277
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,900
But they target the roof-top house instead?

278
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:34,120
Also, they rummaged through the entire room as if looking for something specific.

279
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,800
And there wasn't a single thing that went missing.

280
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,730
In this pathetic, shabby, vintage-looking house...

281
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,070
Hold on! I'm talking right now.

282
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,390
The only thing worth any money was the laptop or luxury bag.

283
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,720
But they left those completely untouched, too. Does this seem natural to you?

284
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,550
So if it's not a petty burglary, then what is it?

285
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,300
I think... it's a grudge.

286
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,470
A grudge?

287
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,290
- A lot of people hold grudges against you because you're a police officer, right?
- Me?

288
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:28,100
Find out if there's a woman who was released from prison recently, who may hold a grudge against you.

289
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,040
Since it seemed like a woman when I briefly bumped into her.

290
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,870
It could be because of blind love.

291
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,810
What is he saying? Is he insane?

292
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:55,850
I need to move out of this guy's place or something.

293
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:03,700
Can't you rest just today? You were probably really startled since you said you couldn't get any sleep.

294
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,490
I have an important meeting.

295
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,680
Oh, right, my phone.

296
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,550
What is this?

297
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,830
Oh, my! What's wrong with your ear, Gong Joo?

298
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,180
I got a small infection because of my earring.

299
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,250
You should be more careful. You have to take good care of that.

300
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,600
Are you okay, Gong Joo?

301
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,620
Yes... Thank you.

302
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:07,990
- White Bouquet... am I right?
- Pardon?

303
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,660
You seem to always use this perfume.

304
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,610
It's a common perfume.

305
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,700
It's not common. It's a niche perfume.

306
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,440
I tried to buy one, but I gave up because it was so expensive.

307
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,610
I'll buy you one... something that'll suit you well...

308
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,420
That's not what I meant... No, thank you.

309
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,080
I need to print out the meeting materials.

310
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,260
What is it?

311
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,790
What kind of person is Na Gong Joo?

312
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:12,430
I have personnel records of everyone else except for Gong Joo's.

313
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,130
About that...

314
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,860
My father did?

315
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,340
You're saying that my father hired Na Gong Joo himself?

316
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,400
We've always hired employees through open recruitments, didn't we?

317
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,200
It was quite unusual.

318
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,120
Also, when I told him that her education and experiences were all forged,

319
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,750
he told me that he would take care of it himself,

320
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,650
and to keep it between just me and Mr. Kim for the time being.

321
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,210
He said, "She seems to have good senses, so try teaching her well."

322
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,540
He made that special request...

323
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,900
When the kids arrive, they'll view the exhibition with the docent,

324
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,340
then they'll participate in the activity that Curator Han prepared.

325
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,270
The activities we prepared are traditional craftwork and origami...

326
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,130
Is this yours?

327
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:29,260
It's scheduled to go on for approximately two hours in the park outside.

328
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,850
All schedules will come to an end with the "Frog Restaurant" program.

329
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,580
The camp was always a one-night-two-day event, but after we reduced it to a one-day camp,

330
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,370
the schedule is a little tight. I think the children will be tired, too.

331
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:54,640
Then... how about we put up some tents in the art museum's garden and let the children sleep outside?

332
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,690
I think it will be nice to have a camping vibe.

333
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,560
Spending the night at the art museum is easier said than done.

334
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,840
He's right. It's dangerous because they're children.

335
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,420
We also don't know where they'll run off to.

336
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,180
Are you okay, Gong Joo?

337
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,570
Pardon?

338
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,690
About... what?

339
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,570
About letting the children spend the night at the art museum.

340
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,150
As the person in charge of the "Frog Restaurant" program, I thought you would have an opinion.

341
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,550
I think...

342
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,760
There are some concerns regarding safety and expenses...

343
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,410
It's a shame, but maybe not this year—

344
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:43,020
Then what about a hocance?
(T/N: Enjoying a vacation in a hotel)

345
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,640
Oh, please, sit down.

346
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,870
Century Group would like to join in at the last minute.

347
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,310
Am I being too shameless?

348
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:59,310
If you're saying a hocance, then a hotel...?

349
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,570
I thought it'd be nice for the children to tour the city while they're in Seoul.

350
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:06,640
Of course, all the extra expenses will be covered by Century.

351
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,000
Would that not be possible...

352
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,240
Director Kim Dali?

353
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,620
You should have gone through the formal procedure before making a suggestion like that.

354
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,090
You shouldn't have suddenly shown up during the meeting.

355
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,950
It isn't some mom-and-pop store, it's Century group.
(T/N: mom-and-pop - small, family-owned, or independent business)

356
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,660
I thought you wouldn't refuse if I did it this way.

357
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,110
Why would I refuse?

358
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,730
What?

359
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,290
- That's–
- What happened last time was a personal matter between you and me.

360
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,530
Was your opinion of me that poor, to think that I can't keep my personal matters and public matters separate?

361
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:52,310
You didn't make this offer because you expected something from me either.

362
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,970
That was thoughtless of me. I'll apologize if I offended you.

363
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,710
Oh? That's what I think it is, right?

364
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,660
The art container.

365
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,580
The one you carried around since you were young.

366
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,870
Do you still carry around candies in here?

367
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,270
Drink your tea. I don't have the yuzu tea that you like.

368
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,560
You're okay with Sejak green tea, too. Right?

369
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:32,950
Of course. I like any tea you make for me.

370
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,370
It's nice.

371
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:49,650
My decision won't change. It's over between us.

372
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:56,920
All right. I'll watch my pace.

373
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,650
I asked to go back to when we understood each other well... but I was hasty.

374
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:04,500
- Oppa...
- But I still would like for you to not stay at Won Tak's anymore.

375
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,770
Or should I move in?

376
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,140
You're not laughing... It was a joke.

377
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,070
What? Kim Si Hyung disappeared?

378
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,570
What about the stuff?

379
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,730
It seemed like he even borrowed money from President Ha... Are you sure it's not his doing?

380
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,460
Then, where in the world did he disappear to?

381
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,490
It'll be a relief if he shows up dead instead.

382
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,540
But if by any chance... he comes back alive and blabbers his mouth to the world,

383
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,920
we'll be done for. Everything would have been in vain!

384
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:20,410
Find him before everything goes down the drain.

385
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,290
No matter what!

386
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,530
Excuse me for the discourtesy during the meal.

387
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,440
Did you receive some sort of... bad news or something?

388
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,240
Right... Compared to just before, you look like complete shit–

389
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,840
♪ Tombe la neige ♪
(T/N: French, it means the snow falls)

390
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,340
You're as pale as snow!

391
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,620
Oh, taking care of a district is no joke.

392
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,880
They even send in a complaint to the assemblyman,

393
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,980
just because one stray dog disappeared.

394
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,210
Oh, my... a stray dog?

395
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:13,710
The assemblyman works a lot.

396
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,460
Mom...

397
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,210
- Anyways... why don't you carry on with what you were talking about just now.
- Ah.

398
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:28,220
I think the government's announcement will be sooner than we hard first expected.

399
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:33,090
The public's sentiment regarding measures for real estate is beyond passionate.

400
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,390
Once the announcement is made, the price will be completely up to the seller.

401
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,870
Do you think Kim Dali will hand over the art museum for cheap?

402
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:44,880
That's why I, Ahn Sang Tae, personally came to the CEO's home.

403
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,650
Let's file a lawsuit.

404
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,760
- A lawsuit?
- A lawsuit?

405
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,350
There's a loan refund claim lawsuit.

406
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,090
We'll send the certification of contents, pressure them,

407
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:02,130
and use whatever you can against her.

408
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:07,070
She'll have to pay her inheritance tax soon. So we'll attack her from all sides,

409
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:12,230
and right then... we'll throw the bait by saying we'll buy the art museum.

410
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,490
I hope... you got your bullets ready?

411
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,900
Oh, yes, sure... as long as you are certain about it.

412
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,530
Of course! It's a royal command from none other than you!

413
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:28,390
We completed loading the bullets! Bang, bang, bang!

414
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,700
Here.

415
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:40,890
It's a construction company run by a distant relative.

416
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:45,470
Once the announcement is made, we'll be in business right away.

417
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,450
When will you have time to start a company, build its resume,

418
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,730
and then participate in the bidding?

419
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,910
First... you should take over that company. The share will be 60/40.

420
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,060
You should do that.

421
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,700
Don't we need at least do this much between us,

422
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,330
for us to build trust among one another?

423
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:08,770
There are so many people who stab each other in the back these days.

424
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,630
Yes, of course!

425
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,670
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

426
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,410
That thieving bastard.

427
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,990
He's saying he wants us to pay for everything and he's going to take 40%!

428
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,160
But father, we were able to join this project thanks to assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae...

429
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,000
We should be glad it's not 50/50. At least he's a very conscientious man.

430
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,810
Conscientious, my foot!

431
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,490
He's gone. Let's go in.

432

433
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,340
Do you

434
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,410
really not have any money?

435
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,930
I'm sorry?

436
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,530
I'm just having a hard time understanding.

437
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:29,540
You're right. Not everything is what it seems.

438
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:36,690
Also, they rummaged through the entire room as if looking for something specific.

439
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,870
Something specific?

440
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,020
What could it be?

441
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,590

- Welcome.

High-five!

446
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,100
- The children arrived, so let's hurry.
- Yes, sir!

447
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,430
- Fill that up.
- Clean up well!

448
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,630
- Safety first.
- Whose is this?

449
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,520
Ask me if there's anything you don't know, Ms. Gong Joo.

Thank you for joining in a good cause.

451

Even if you have a good heart, it's hard to put it into action. Thank you in advance for your hard work.

472
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,290
created by Leonardo da Vinci himself!

473
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:51,710
You're all curious about what food will be underneath, right?

474
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,880
Yes!

475
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,690
- Are you curious?
- Yes!

476
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,360
- If you're curious... give me ₩500!
- What the...

477
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,990
Okay, we'll take a look at it now.

478
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,810
When I say, "One, two, three,"

479
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,820
- you can open it and say, "Ta-da!" Okay?
- Yes!

480
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:13,090
- One, two, three! Ta-da!
- What the...?

481
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,560
♫ The mean prince came, oh darling ♫

482
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,240
♫ He fell in love with her ♫

483
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,540
It's weird.

484
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,130
It's an Italian salted myolchi called "anchovy'."
(T/N: myolchi é anchovy in Korean)

485
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,370
It may be a little smelly but it still tastes good.

486
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,850
Whoever's curious can give it a taste.

487
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,100
- How does it taste?
- It's yummy.

488
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:43,870
It's yummy?

489
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,320
- Is it yummy?
- Yes!

490
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,380
- Really?
- For real?

491
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,890
He said it's yummy!

492
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,080
- He said it tastes like Korean anchovies!
- Oh, boy.

493
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,970
How rude though... to serve just one teeny piece of anchovy to our hungry guests.

494
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:02,180
If he had been born in this age, da Vinci or not... he would've been terrorized with one-star ratings!

495
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,250
His restaurant would've closed down! For good!

496
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,500
One piece of anchovy is hardly enough to fill someone's stomach,

497
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,780
so let's make a dish,

498
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,210
that's delicious and filling for ourselves.

499
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,170
- Sounds good, right?
- Yes!

500
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,990
I've gathered Leonardo da Vinci's recipes here.

501
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,930
Please reinterpret the dish and make it more modern so that the children will enjoy it.

502
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:34,080
They would've liked it more if a famous chef made it for them...

503
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,760
Instead of that... Let's have the children cook it themselves.

504
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,880
- What?
- What?

505
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,260
A fantastic dish made by a famous chef is good too,

506
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,820
but wouldn't it be better for them to learn to feed themselves?

507
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:53,940
Like it or not... there comes a time when everyone has to cook and eat for themselves.

508
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,340
All right! I need an assistant if I'm going to cook...

509
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:03,620
Who looks like the worst cook here?

510
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,250
Director Kim Dali! You've been chosen.

511
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,640
- Director!
- Let's give her a round of applause!

512
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,090
Yay!

513
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,800
- Kim Dali!
- Kim Dali!

514
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,210
Oh, my, my!

515
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,890
- What are you doing? Our cooks at "Frog Restaurant" are waiting for you!
- Kim Dali!

516
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,830
- Dali!
- Kim Dali! Hey!

517
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:30,400
Kim Dali! Kim Dali!

518
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,400
♫ I wonder how great it would be? ♫

519
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,800
♫ Go, Go, Go ♫

520
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,490
♫ It feels like love has come ♫

521
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,950
Pour some oil in the frying pan, please.

522
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,810
♫ Two steps closer ♫

523
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,950
- We'll stir fry the potatoes first!
- Okay!

524
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,980
Stir fry the potatoes, please.

525
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,460
We'll put in the onions and bacon together now.

526
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,510
While the teachers stir fry this, you children...

527
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:58,820
- Hand out the eggs, please
- Here.

528
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,370
Nice and healthy eggs.

529
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:04,030
Healthy eggs are here!

530
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,290
Shake it, shake it!

531
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,240
- Next step...
- Yes?

532
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,240
- Take it out of the pan.
- Okay!

533
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,550
There we go.

534
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,460
Mix it well, please.

535
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,290
Then, go like this...

536
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,570
I did it!

537
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,210
Good job!

538
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,280
Ta-da!

539
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,090
Great job!

540
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,900
- Here.
- Wow!

541
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,120
Wow!!

542
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,510
♫ That's ordinary love ♫

543
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,570
Everyone!

544
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:47,870
We're all going to become adults one day.

545
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:53,250
Some people sooner... some people later.

546
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,380
There will be a moment where you'll have to go up against the world

547
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,680
and overcome it by yourself without anyone's help.

548
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,010
In those moments, what do you need?

549
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:09,330
Food. Even if you eat by yourself,

550
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:12,200
you can't skip your meals, no matter what.

551
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:18,110
You have to learn to feed yourself to become a real adult.

552
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:20,450
♫ My heart is filled with you ♫

553
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:25,350
All right then... Thank you for doing your best cooking today, our little cooks!

554
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,570
- Great job!
- Great job!

555
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:33,300
Okay then! All of you leave now.

556
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,640
We're not eating? Do we have to leave?

557
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,980
Kidding! Let's all enjoy the food!

558
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,920
- Oh, come on!
- Wow!

559
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:46,860
Let's eat! Let's eat!

560
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,700
- It looks delicious!
- Yes, it does!

561
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,880
- Thank you!
- Goodbye!

562
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,880
Goodbye!

563
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,880
Thank you!

564
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,810
We should get going too.

565
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:18,330
What?

566
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:24,110
- Someone from the art museum has to go to the hotel with the children, too. You'll have to help transition them to us properly.
- Oh...

567
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,930
Then I'll go after I say goodbye.

568
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,440
The employees are waiting.

569
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,090
It's rush hour, so we have to leave now. Let's go.

570
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:40,180
You go ahead first. I'll be right behind you.

571
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,610
Great job today, everyone!

572
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,090
- Great job!
- Great job!

573
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,250
Mr. Jin, how can I help?

574
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,720
You can wipe some of these, please.

575
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,740
This one.

576
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:14,110
What? Gong Joo?

577
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,530
The number you have called is unavailable. Please leave a message.

578
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:23,520
She's not the type to do this without letting us know.

579
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,130
Was she tired from preparing "Frog Restaurant"?

580
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:30,180
I'm sure she'll come. It's because she grew up sheltered in a rich family.

581
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,050
She has none. She has no gusto!

582
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,180
I think someone from Dondon left this behind.

583
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:40,490
There are kitchen knives and sauce bottles inside.

584
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,140
Give it here. They'll come to find it if they need it.

585
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,010
They'll need it if they're going to work.

586
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,900
It's heavy.

587
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,240
Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae?

588
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,530
Why did assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae come to our house?

589
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,420
I don't know about that but he seems to have a lot of work with your brother.

590
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:05,850
The legal team is keeping things on the down-low too.

591
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,390
The legal team?

592
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,870
[Watch your back! Because someone's about to hit it!]

593
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,690
Be careful!

594
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:49,020
Excuse me... your dress code and color today is totally my style.

595
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,080
I have a girl I like so don't drool over me.

596
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,610
Kim Dali?

597
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,320
Yes.

598
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:03,050
What? What are you saying? I don't like anyone. That's not true!

599
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:07,900
What to do then? It seemed like Kim Dali likes you though.

600
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,660
Really?

601
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,010
Yes, really.

602
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:18,270
It's a lie... Darling...

603
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,670
I can't believe there are people like her.

604
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,150
Why are you avoiding me?

605
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,960
What do you mean avoiding you?

606
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,160
Then, why aren't you answering your phone? You even disappeared without saying a word at the opening.

607
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,120
Do you know how many times I called you after that?

608
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,040
Do you know how worried I was?

609
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,780
It's because I've been busy lately.

610
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:53,100
You're here to eat, right? Get up, I'll buy you something good to eat.

611
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,140
Do you want to sleep together?

612
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:01,530
I'm so-sorry.

613
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:06,670
I was shocked because you suddenly said something weird.

614
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:08,150
Are you okay?

615
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,690
Is it weird to ask that if we're dating?

616
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,830
We're... dating?

617
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:16,960
Since when?

618
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,040
I confessed to you that I liked you.

619
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,650
And I introduced you to my dad.

620
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,380
Hey, if I was dating like that, then I'd...

621
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,650
what was it... I'd already been King Chair.

622
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,360
It's King Uija!
(T/N: Uijia also means chair. Refers to men who are surrounded by many women)

623
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,860
Exactly.

624
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,520
I'm sure you noticed, but my body is in great shape.

625
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,320
I didn't want to know.

626
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,290
If I was a ten out of ten, then I would probably say that's not enough.

627
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:42,340
So don't waste your time with me.

628
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:47,140
Why did you see me all this time?

629
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:52,780
Have you ever wanted to touch me, kiss me, or sleep with me?

630
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,350
I haven't not even once.

631
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:57,370
Hey, we're not like that...

632
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:00,680
You said there's a line between us that cannot be crossed.

633
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,130
Seriously, what's wrong with you all of a sudden?

634
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,300
Then perhaps...

635
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:10,480
do you like someone else?

636
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,460
No! Forget it!

637
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,050
Forget it, so don't say anything.

638
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,850
Leave five minutes after I leave! If you follow me, I'll kill you!

639
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,660
Hey!

640
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:35,750
I don't know how I made you misunderstand,

641
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,350
but if I did, I'll apologize. I'm sorry.

642
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:43,630
And just in case you misunderstand again, I'll make it clear to you now. There's someone I like.

643
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:45,650
So I'll never let this happen again...

644

You jerk.

645

Did you have to tell me?

646
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:54,710
I told you not to tell me! I told you to leave five minutes after me!

647
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:58,160
Don't you know that's why I left because I didn't want to hear it?

648
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,250
If you're ignorant, you have to at least have common sense.

What? You also eat this kind of food.

671
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,930
This kind of food?

672
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:33,940
I felt like going somewhere different than our usual places.

673
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,010
They said it's a good restaurant.

674

What about the others?

675

They said something came up all of a sudden.

I rescheduled for a better time.

677
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,620
They only needed to deliver this anyway, so I'm the only one who came as the representative.

It's the sponsorship applications.

There are eight people for now, but I think two or three more people will participate.

Did you know that "gamja" in gamjatang,
(T/N: "Gamja" means potato in Korean)

690
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,900
doesn't stand for "potato" like we thought, but it means the bones?

691
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,460
Is that so? I didn't know.

692
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:25,670
They say this dish started when meat was scarce, so they took leftover bones from US army bases that were going to be discarded and boiled them to sell.

693
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:27,610
I see.

694
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:32,570
The dish suits very well with a man like Jin Moo Hak.

He seems like an amazing person... there's a lot to learn from him.

To succeed this much when starting from the bottom,

699
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:07,960
he probably experienced many things and made choices that we could never imagine.

700
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,950
Whether he liked it or not... he probably made a lot of people cry.
