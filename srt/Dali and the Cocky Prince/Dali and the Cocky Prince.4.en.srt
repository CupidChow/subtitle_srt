[Episode 4: Can you figure out who's rich or not by yogurt?]

2
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,300
That hurts, hurts, hurts! Let me go.

3
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,690
You have to let go of her first for me to let you go.

4
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,370
It hurts, it hurts.

5
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,710
Let's resolve this by talking.

6
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,960
By talking. This is an art museum, isn't it?

7
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,840
Let me go, you bastard!

8
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,050
Do you know how much this costs?

9
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,620
Who are you? What kind of person are you?

10
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,560
Me?

11
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,440
I am the new director of this art museum.

12
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,810
What?

13
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,270
Just how much amount are you guys making this fuss over?

14
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,900
Director, here it is.

15
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,990
Three hundred, four hundred fifty, two hundred eighty,

16
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,970
six hundred ninety...

17
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,840
I can just pay for all this. So, what's the problem?

18
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,670
That's not the invoice.

[Cheongsong: 7.5 million won]

13 million won.

45 million won.

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,010
120 million won─!

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,920
This is good.

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,730
Pu'er tea is the best.

26
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,190
It's Earl Grey tea.

27
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,780
Since you didn't seem to like the pu'er tea last time.

28
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,820
Earl Gr...

29
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,800
You were joking earlier, right? About being the new director.

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,070
It wasn't a joke.

31
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,400
I told you before that I'm a serious and reserved type of person.

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,020
Especially when it comes to money, I don't ever joke around.

33
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,970
What do you think makes you qualified to be the director of this art museum?

34
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,430
You said you would do as I want.

35
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,020
You said you would accept any terms of repayment.

36
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:41,180
Don't overthink it. It means I'll make my own money and go.

37
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,790
Haven't you heard about this? A temporary management system.

38
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,940
There is something creditors do when the company is in trouble. They bring in a professional business manager.

39
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,620
I'm also incredibly good at making money!

40
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,120
The art museum is not about making money.

41
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,490
If you don't like it, then give me 2 billion won.

42
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,130
Because you didn't have a few million won, you just had that mess with your clients,

43
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,410
so do you have any other plans?

44
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,980
You don't have to make a separate grand office for me.

45

Let me just...

46

Let me just use this one thing.

47
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,820
I won't even touch anything else.

48
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,610
Okay?

49

[Cheongsong Art Museum]

51
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,630
There are so many ways to make money. Why are they refusing to make it?

52
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,830
They're still not desperate.

53
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,680
Why are you doing this? Do you think the chairman will be okay with this?

54
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,840
Do you have a different way to do it?

55
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,540
You said we should just take back the principal after shaming and pressing them.

56
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,870
No, that's so unsophisticated.

57
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,340
That's not how I do things.

58
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,290
It's exactly how you would do things.

59
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,610
I'm going to take back the principal and the interest!

60
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,800
That's my method.

61
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,800
Then, where should we go to work from now on?

62
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,950
Starting tomorrow, you can go to work at the restaurant as normal.

63
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,600
To the restaurant?

64
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,780
They said everything was fine until a couple of days ago.

65
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,110
I don't know why they're suddenly making an issue out of it.

66
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,490
There are pictures all over social media.

67
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,540
Everyone probably figured out what was going on.

68
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,420
By the way, are we going to receive our paycheck this month? I need to get it.

69
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,260
Can't we just ask the Century Group for help in times like this?

70
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,700
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,120
Gong Joo.

72
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,830
Why? They were almost about to get married.

73
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,680
It's not the time to think about your pride.

74
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,380
It's better than letting this place be handed over to gangsters.

75
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,080
Our director worked hard to make this art museum.

76
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,820
If I were his daughter, I would've not just gone to my ex-fiance, but my ex-husband and begged to save this place.

77
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,480
Asking them to help me just this once.

78
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,670
Don't you know how much the director hates the Century Group?

79
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,510
No matter how hard things were, our director

80
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,610
will never let us even bring up the idea of getting any sponsorship from Century!

81
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,120
Even when Director Jang Tae Jin came and kneeled,

82
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,890
our director never even opened the door for him!

83
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,640
You saw all that, so how can you say such a thing?

84
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,450
What I'm saying is that it's not the same as then.

85
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,270
If she doesn't have the ability, then she shouldn't have inherited it.

86
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,300
Director, why aren't you coming in and just standing there?

87
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,690
Come in!

88
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,440
Why are you all standing like that?

89
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,030
What is it, Director?

90
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,440
About the Basquiat show that you talked about before.

91
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,850
Ah, yes.

92
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,260
How much will the penalty be if we cancel it?

93
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,450
Are you going to cancel it?

94
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,570
I think that's the only way to tackle the more urgent issue first.

95
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,400
You can't do that.

96
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,430
Pop-Art is the only thing that can be a hit in the Korean market.

97
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,110
And also, it's Basquiat!

98
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,760
That will attract attention without even spending a lot of money on promoting it.

99
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,290
And we can also receive corporate sponsorships easily.

100
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,790
We'll sell tons of merchandise and brochures as well,

101
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,400
but you're saying we should give this up?

102
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,260
This is being desperate, and you will be regretting it.

103
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,780
Please don't do that,

104
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,510
and why don't you start searching for sponsors with me?

105
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,100
They all know our situation

106
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,360
and have had relationships with Cheongsong for a long time,

107
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,980
so they wouldn't ignore us.

108
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,840
Then, please hand over the documents about the Basquiat show to me.

109
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,900
I'll make a decision after reviewing how much has been done.

110
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,350
All right.

111
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,410
Oh, did Si Hyung come to work?

112
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,400
Do you want to have a drink with me?

113
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,980
- I was looking at you over there, and there was a bright light shining!
- Hey, hey!

114
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,960
Don't invite Kim Si Hyung from now on.

115
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,130
He's always getting free drinks like a bum!

116
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,340
Hey, cut some slack! He really did lose everything.

117
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,960
You're right!

118
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,530
You're right. His uncle died!

119
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,270
His own father gave up on him, but his uncle gave him money

120
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,850
and bought him a car. He has a café, right? His uncle paid for that, too!

121
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,660
He was a total walking ATM machine for him. I was so jealous of him.

122
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,950
I heard that bastard has been borrowing money from President Ha from Palace.

123
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,980
He's totally at rock bottom!

124
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,270
Wait! If you mean President Ha from Palace, the gangster!

125
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,890
He's a gangster!

126
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,700
I feel bad for our Si Hyung!

127
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,570
You pushover old-geezer!

128
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,120
If you were going to die, you should've said something first!

129
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,800
So that Si Hyung wouldn't have become like this.

130
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,070
- What did you say, you bastard!
- Are you crazy, you bastard!

131
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,360
He got into a fight with his friends after drinking during the day.

132
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,860
I sent his friends back home after talking with them, so they aren't going to press charges.

133
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,370
I said I would take care of him by myself, you shouldn't have come.

134
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,740
Mr. Kim Si Hyung.

135
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,940
Mr. Kim Si Hyung!

136
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,950
Why are you making noise!

137
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,250
What?

138
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,330
Si Hyung!

139
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,630
Si Hyung, wait!

140
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,870
How dare you touch me?

141
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,850
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,770
Did you get my voicemails?

143
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,860
I called and texted you as well.

144
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,930
So, what do you want to talk about?

145
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,370
It's nothing. I wanted to discuss the art museum with you.

146
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,120
But since you're not feeling well, let's talk about it next time.

147
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,430
Are you making fun of me?

148
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,120
What about the art museum?

149
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,330
You didn't care if your father was eating rice or porridge,

150
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,420
and spent a great time in the Netherlands or Japan like a princess!

151
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,590
And now that you are the director, and what?

152
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,500
Discuss?

153
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,330
Listen carefully. I only have one thing to say.

154
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,430
Get lost. Go back to where you were before!

155
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,620
Check the art museum's clients' situation and pay them first.

156
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,900
All of this?

157
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,940
Then are you saying I should lose my 2 billion won because of those petty checks?

158
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,870
And.

159
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,530
Bring all the materials related to domestic and international art museums.

160
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,030
Focus on the ones that make the most money!

161
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,710
- You jerk!
- What's going on?

162
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,930
What the hell are you doing?

163
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,250
What's wrong now?

164
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,600
What now? Are you Mother Teresa?

165
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,800
Are you Beop Jeong the Buddhist monk?

166
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,100
You didn't get the money that I asked for, but instead, you got ripped off?

167
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,800
What are you saying?

168
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,380
Chairman! Please let him go!

169
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,010
I heard you went to Cheongsong to take the money, but you paid for their debt instead.

170
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,690
Why don't you just throw out some money from the rooftop? Let me get that money that you're throwing out!

171
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,580
Yes! Let me taste some money, so throw some at me!

172
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,700
Get out of the way! I said, get out of the way!

173
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,160
Do you know how expensive this is?

174
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,720
This is very precious, so handle it carefully! Carefully.

175
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,330
Come, come, come.

176
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,300
Move! Move! Move! I said move!

177
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,020
Mister, come, come. The angle. The angle. Make it stand.

178
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,030
Carefully.

179
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,170
What is this? Why would you hang it in someone else's office as you wish?

180
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,040
You didn't buy this, did you, Mom?

181
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,920
What are you saying? A living human cultural treasure painted this.

182
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,650
Living human cultural treasure?

183
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,790
Do you have money just sitting around!

184
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,740
You're going to make me go deaf.

185
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,970
Did I do this because we have a lot of money?

186
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,100
I did this to prevent losing money!

187
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,100
I heard that there's a flow for money as well.

188
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,150
And our company's flow of the money gets blocked right here!

189
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,790
Right here! At Moo Hak's spot!

190
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,830
Moo Hak's energy is so strong that he's tightly holding the company's money's flow!

191
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,850
It's unshakeable! It's not moving at all!

192
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,680
If we don't open this flow, not just new business or not,

193
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,290
it's only a matter of time before he's going to forget about the money we already earned.

194
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,250
And most importantly, it's going to even harm your health, too.

195
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,950
What? Where did you hear that annoying nonsense?

196
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,660
Has Doctor Kim ever been wrong?

197
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,570
He got it right that we got scammed out of 2 billion won!

198
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,290
Who got scammed?

199
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,710
But he also said somebody died recently.

200
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,270
Did anybody die around you?

201
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,740
Are you okay? What's going on?

202
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,660
It's nothing.

203
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,860
So will it get better if we hang that painting there?

204
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,790
Y-Yes, of course.

205
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,550
He said it's good to hang a painting with water in it.

206
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:04,390
It's going to let the money flow in and get rid of bad luck. He said it's just good.

207
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,220
That's an expensive painting, so don't get rid of it! Understood?

208
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,660
I'm fine. Hang that in Brother's office.

209
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,730
Sure! It seems like Moo Hak doesn't like it, so why don't we put it in my office─

210
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,940
I guess I wore high heels that were too high for me.

211
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,300
What? What is it?

212
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,480
Why do you want to hang it in your room! Do you know what that is?

213
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,910
Why? You said it's an expensive and nice painting!

214
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,500
I'm So Geum Ja!

215
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,200
Do you think I'll put a good-luck painting at someone else's son's office, but not at my own son's office?

216
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,760
Why would I give him luck?

217
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,610
Then, what is that painting for?

218
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,800
It's because Moo Hak's energy is too strong!

219
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,160
So I hung that painting to lock his energy in the pond. So he can be discouraged!

220
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,630
Oh, my goodness!

221
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,680
By the way, did you ask what I told you to ask him?

222
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,230
What did Doctor Kim say? Can I expand my business to construction?

223
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,850
Oh, that's right! He said you found a source of gold.

224
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,720
He said it's going to be a great success!

225
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,610
Really?

226
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:19,570
Why? Do you have something going on? What is it?

227
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,220
It's nothing. I don't know yet.

228
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,780
I'll tell you when I'm sure.

229
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:47,230
Aren't you sick of gamjatang? There's samgyetang, galbitang,
(pork and potato stew, ginseng chicken soup, beef rib stew)

230
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,030
lobster, Mian bao xia, and grilled octopus.
(shrimp toast)

231
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,160
There are so many delicious and healthy foods in the world, but you always want to have gamjatang.

232
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,490
Aren't you too old to still be complaining about the food?

233
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,220
Where are you going to use all that money? You don't have that much time left to spend it anyway, Father.

234
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,270
Stop wishing for me to die, you punk.

235
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,220
That's seriously disgusting...

236
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,060
So, what's your plan?

237
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,910
What plan?

238
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,490
How about you just take over that art museum?

239
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,460
What?

240
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,680
Isn't that why you gave them some money?

241
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,590
You're good at smelling money, so there's no way you did that without thinking about it.

242
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,950
About that...

243
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,300
I think it's a good idea.

244
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,590
It's not like the ground is going to rot,

245
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,910
so it'll be worth a lot of money when the development restrictions are lifted! 2 billion won is a bargain.

246
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,390
Their daughter is only book smart,

247
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,300
but she doesn't know anything about how the world goes around.

248
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,680
So a lot of people were targeting her.

249
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,520
So why don't you persuade her well, okay?

250
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,170
It's so good! I never get sick of it.

251
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,090
Their daughter is only book smart,

252
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,860
but she doesn't know anything about how the world goes around.

253
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,030
So a lot of people were targeting her.

254
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,110
So why don't you persuade her well, okay?

255
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,530
I think we should restart the project "The Space," which had been delayed due to the funeral.

256
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,350
The artists said they couldn't wait any longer because they have their next schedules planned.

257
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,160
Of course, they already waited long enough.

258
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,600
Do what you were doing.

259
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,150
Continue.

260
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,560
Please continue.

261
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,990
All right.

262
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:22,490
Since the arrangement of the artwork has already been determined, we should finish transporting and installing the collection

263
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,090
by at least the end of this month

264
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,530
to meet

265
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,690
the opening date deadline.

266
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,790
Oh, also, the merchandise and brochures are already...

267
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,530
I guess everyone here is rich.

268
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,040
There are more things to discuss...

269
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,540
Where did I stop? Ah, yes.

270
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,930
The merchandise and brochures have already been ordered.

271
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,890
"The Space?"

272
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,230
Isn't the schedule a bit tight if we wanted to publicize it as well?

273
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,680
Yes. That's why

274
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,500
we were thinking about a fresh and innovative idea

275
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,690
that will grab your attention quickly.

276
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,970
Are these all done by famous people?

277
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,970
Mr. Jin!

278
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,190
Can't I even ask a question?

279
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,250
Since you're a stranger to this field, you might not know,

280
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,580
but they are all renowned artists who are active both domestically and internationally.

281
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,260
They all have splendid, award-winning careers!

282
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,820
Ah, sure, sure.

283
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,900
Along with the "The Space" project, we plan to start an art camp for children at Hope Orphanage.

284
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,670
At this camp, the theme will be "Three Frogs' Flag Restaurant"─

285
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,630
Oh? I know this!

286
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,860
"Three Frogs' Restaurant." It's the one that you told me about before, right?

287
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,420
Who was the owner of the restaurant?

288
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,350
All right.

289
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,400
We're going to invite a famous chef

290
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,850
to recreate the food exactly as Da Vinci's recipe─

291
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,670
Da Vinci! That's right! Da Vinci!

292
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,320
Yes, I heard that this person originally wanted to be a restaurant owner.

293
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,210
Yes... Oh, good!

294
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:47,830
But what money do orphanage kids have to invite a famous chef to their camp?

295
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,420
No matter how cheap it is, it's still going to be difficult to match the chef's pay rate.

296
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,930
The chefs who come out on TV, their pay rates are no joke. It's different from before.

297
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,970
"Cheongsong Art Camp" is a free educational program that our art museum runs

298
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,160
for children who are underprivileged from art.

299
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,090
We're not doing this for money– Please get out of here.

300
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,440
It's a free educational program.

301
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,620
What?

302
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,040
Free?

303
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,780
Free?

304
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,740
That's just bullshit!

305
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,340
What do you think you're doing right now, Mr. Jin?

306
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,950
I should be asking you that.

307
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,630
What do you mean "free?"

308
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:51,360
And it's not a one-time thing either, but you to have three teams every quarter?

309
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,590
Do you think you're Mother Teresa?

310
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,450
Are you Beop Jeong the Buddhist monk?

311
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,410
The Cheongsong Art Camp is

312
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:05,810
our art museum's most important educational program, that has been passed down from generation to generation, from my grandfather to my father.

313
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:10,480
It's one of the few opportunities that culturally marginalized children get to access art.

314
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,870
Do you know how much the participating children love it?

315
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:17,060
We should be increasing the number of programs. But you're telling me to cancel it?

316
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,850
That's great.

317
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,930
That's great. It's all great. Of course, I know this is a great thing you're doing.

318
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:27,110
It's wonderful that you're helping children who live without art or culture.

319
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,940
You have my respect! But with what money?

320
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,950
Do you have money?

321
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,120
Have you secretly been keeping my money instead of paying me back?

322
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,980
I'll just have to start finding a sponsor now.

323
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,500
What?

324
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,890
You were going to show off using someone else's money?

325
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,110
They told me your family was one of Korea's noblest families. Turns out you're just a thief.

326
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,270
- Mr. Jin.
- Why?

327
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:05,150
Polishing and dressing yourself up with other people's money. Isn't that what a thief does?

328
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,530
You don't know the value of money because it's not yours.

329
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,160
Being generous by saying he's a famous chef or that it's free...

330
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,650
Do you think other people grow money on trees?

331
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,880
This is why you're about to go bankrupt!

332
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,020
Because of the crappy situation that your father left behind,

333
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,950
everyone from the dealers, banks, and so on is losing sleep from anxiety. And what?

334
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,860
How privileged of you to talk about a free art camp.

335
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,980
Watch what you say, Mr. Jin.

336
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,660
Look here, Kim Dali.

337
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,130
Do you still not understand the situation?

338
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,740
Do you not know where you belong?

339
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,270
You're no longer the only daughter of the noble family of Cheongsong.

340
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:46,180
You're penniless now with a bunch of debt. You can't even afford a pair of shoes now.

341
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,540
You're in no position to help anyone now!

342
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,620
If you want to help others, earn your own money and help them.

343
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,530
Don't show off with the money you begged for.

344
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,930
I'll pay you back.

345
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,550
What?

346
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,090
I just have to pay you back, right?

347
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,340
I will make sure to pay you within a week.

348
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,590
And if you can't.

349
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,500
Then I'll do whatever you want.

350
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,990
Curator Song, can you pick out a few pieces here that can be sold for money right now?

351
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,830
- What?
- How is the art market these days?

352
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:50,220
I remember Madam Kim from Hannam was interested in my grandfather's paintings. Do you think she's still interested?

353
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,220
As you know, we can't sell artwork registered with the art museum.

354
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,520
The art market is not doing well either.

355
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,650
We have some that aren't registered. There should be quite a few that were put under my name.

356
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,470
That's true...

357
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,970
How much do we have left of the art museum's operating funds?

358
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,770
What operating funds? We don't even have enough to pay the employees this month.

359
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,940
What?

360
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,050
I understand that the economy is bad, but one-third?

361
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:26,730
That's also only the case if we're lucky enough to make a deal.

362
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,750
The last six months were like a drought.

363
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,050
One-third?

364
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,830
They're basically glorified thieves.

365
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:45,130
I'm sure Chairman Choi will help out. He went to middle school and high school together with the director.

366
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:50,600
The director even went out of his way to support him when he ran for congress.

367
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,900
He's not a person if he doesn't help.

368
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:00,330
Please take a look. Take it with you...

369
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,070
♫ So bitter. Just a little much ♫

370
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:11,030
- We did our best preparing this.
- Oh, really? I'm sorry.

371
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,130
Team Leader! You can take this with you.

372
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,810
♫ You can be mine ♫

373
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:23,050
Take your time looking over it, please.

374
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,130
I'll get going.

375
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,200
Excuse me. Hold on.

376
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,290
Please take a look at this. Please.

377
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,810
All right.

378
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,200
Look at the state of the kitchen.

379
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:09,490
You've all gotten comfortable. Too comfortable.

380
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,420
When was the last time you cleaned the kitchen?

381
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,080
We clean it every day.

382
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,920
You clean every day,

383
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,110
but there's this much grease.

384
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,420
W-Well, we were making omelets

385
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,040
for the kids.

386
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,670
Omelets?

387
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:47,230
The thing is... when families come, they always say there's nothing for kids to eat.

388
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,470
Pil Gu created an omelet called "cloud omelet."

389
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,550
It's so soft.

390
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,340
There are a lot of customers coming to eat it these days.

391
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,480
Did you report this to the development team at headquarters?

392
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,490
Well... I was going to report it once I finished the recipe.

393
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:12,830
Then, you've been selling food that's not even finished!

394
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,910
Hey. What's the point of running a franchise, then?

395
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,520
You should just go start your own business.

396
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:26,720
How many times did I tell you that no matter how good the dish is, it has to be in the system in order to not have any issues?

397
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:32,900
We have a contest every month for new menu ideas, and the development team is open to new ideas!

398
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,620
How can we tell the other branches to follow the rules when the store run by the headquarters doesn't?

399
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,080
I'm going to take this into consideration during your performance ratings, so prepare yourselves.

400
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,850
N-No. Nevermind.

401
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,870
You could've just given them a warning. Don't you think you were too harsh, bringing up their personal evaluations?

402
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,190
- What?
- I'm sorry.

403
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:16,170
It only takes a few mistakes here and there for the system to collapse.

404
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,840
We have to set it straight from the beginning.

405
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,180
- What is it?
- Remittance from the Netherlands.

406
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,600
The Netherlands?

407
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,200
The private detective. You know, the watch thief?

408
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,540
Oh, right. There was that problem.

409
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,940
Have you forgotten about it? You?

410
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,400
The watch, that's worth hundreds of millions of won?

411
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,220
Aren't you going to approve it?

412
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,260
Forget it. It's not even Korea. I'll just be wasting money trying to find it.

413
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,780
Call the detective from the Netherlands and tell him to stop.

414
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,420
How can I tell him to quit after giving him so much money?

415
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,880
Let's just forget about it. What's next?

416
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,600
Then... should I call Interpol?

417
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
Interpol?

418
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,960
She could be an international criminal. One who targets and steals from Koreans.

419
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,420
You have to catch criminals like that, throw them into prison, and feed them prison food for life.

420
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,250
I said, just drop it!

421
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,150
I'm realizing you're heartless!

422
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,020
How dare he call me heartless? He's one to talk.

423
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,730
Wait. He is not the type to ever give up.

424
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,440
You have to get used to being rejected to do this job.

425

What are you doing at my company?

428
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,710
I'm so glad I ran into you.

429
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,540
I came here to get a sponsor for an exhibition, but there seemed to be an error, so I was feeling hopeless. Can you look into–

430
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,340
- What a bunch of beggars.
- What?

431
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,410
I heard Si Hyung has also been running around asking to borrow money.

432
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,210
Now you, too?

433
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,000
Don't bother these hard-working people,

434
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,870
and earn your own money through hard work.

435
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,770
Or just be honest and ask me to lend you some money.

436
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,320
Exhibition, my foot.

437
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,820
Is your company really doing well?

00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,800
What?

439
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm worried that a person who doesn't even know the concept of cultural marketing is going to be the successor.

440
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,800
Oh, that's right.

441
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,330
You said you borrowed money from your sibling, right?

442
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,040
I didn't. No, I didn't!

443
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,370
Now that her family is bankrupt, she talks with no manners! What nonsense.

444
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:05,840
Go! Quickly! We have work to do right now!

We're adjusting it now.

Get it quickly worked out. You have six hours.

Yes, Ma'am.

You did something to your face, right?

What?

453
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,660
I'm just saying that everyone looks like a zombie from working all night,

Did you get the dewy skin injection?

I haven't done anything. I've spent the nights here like everyone else.

Right.

634
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,540
Lyso, what?

635
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,310
They say that tears are merely a product of human emotions.

636
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,450
But actually,

637
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,030
they have a greater function of protecting the eyeball.

638
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,840
So if you don't have tears,

639
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:01,280
you will easily get eye diseases and your eyes become stiff.

640
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,020
And your eyesight will get blurred.

641
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,880
Anyway, everything will get worse.

642
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:15,480
So, you are saying that you were forcing tears that weren't coming out to protect your eyes?

643
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,120
Something similar to that.

644
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,520
Well, let's just say that was the case.

645
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,750
How did you know I was here?

646
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,180
I said that I'm the executive of a restaurant association.

647
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:44,200
Occasionally, I come out for inspection like this... while performing sanitary inspections.

648
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,100
Like a secret royal investigator.

649
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:50,690
- Oh... a secret royal investigator.
- Yes.

650
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,520
What is this?

651
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,840
You aren't perhaps planning to run away at night, right?

652
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,350
My house got sold.

653
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:07,130
Even then, I still can't pay off the debt to you.

654
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:09,640
Then, where are you going to live now?

655
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:15,290
Well, it's none of my business.

656
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:21,330
You sold your house before you figured out a place to go?

657
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,620
I probably will have to stay in a hotel

658
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,590
for the time being.

659
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:33,060
You're still going to a hotel even now.

660
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,910
She's not crying.

661
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:48,530
She's protecting her eyes.

662
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,620
With how smart you are

663
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:09,380
and your academic background, it looked like you had established yourself well in the Netherlands.

664
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:14,320
You never thought to just wrap everything up here and leave?

665
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,770
I heard selling the art museum would give you quite a lot.

666
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,110
You scared me.

667
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:26,810
You ghost money.
(Money is the power of everything.)

668
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:29,530
What did you say? "Ghost money"?

669
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:34,340
Can you sell your father?

670
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,690
What are you talking about?

671
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:42,840
No matter how good money is, would you sell your father?

672
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,110
Why are you bringing up your father here–

673
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:47,090
The art museum is my father.

674
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:49,470
It's my dad.

675
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:58,810
Without the art museum, where would a person like you enjoy art?

676
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,230
A person like me?

677
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,970
You need an art museum

678
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:07,390
so that even a person like you, who doesn't know who Da Vinci is,

679
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,530
can see what art is.

680
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,340
A poor person,

681
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,750
an uneducated person,

682
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,740
a person who has money but not that much,

683
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:27,110
without an art museum, they can only see art through books.

684
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:32,100
Why? Because even if there are a lot of

685
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:36,580
rich people, not halfway

686

in their museum's storage

690
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,360
and enjoy it just for themselves.
