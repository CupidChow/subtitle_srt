[Episode 15]

3
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,810
What do we do? What do we do, honey?

4
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,810
What do we do now?

5
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,150
What if we really end up going bankrupt?

6
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,090
Mom, just be quiet.

7
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,240
Do you think I can be quiet right now?

8
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,750
What did I get myself into?

9
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,760
Why would I get into the construction industry that's not easy to do when I'm this old?

10
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,390
Brother.

11
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,300
Everything that came out on the news, what's true and what's false?

12
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,000
I need to know that in order to know how to respond or prepare.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,910
Did you really make a slush fund behind my back and back Ahn Sang Tae with it?

14
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,160
Well...

15
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,660
That is...

16
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:51,180
- Hey! Do you think that someone who loves money like Ahn Sang Tae only took money from us?
- What?

17
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,310
I don't know for sure, but he would have taken money from all sorts of people.

18
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,070
If they pointed us out specifically, they're just trying to ruin us!

19
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,000
Political donations? That's just an excuse!

20
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,940
Who's trying to ruin us?

21
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,390
Why would they?

22
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,100
I know!

23
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,100
Jang Tae Jin!

24
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,550
What?

25
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,400
What are you talking about?

26
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,210
Jang Tae Jin said he would make us pay

27
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,910
because I grabbed Kim Dali's hair.

28
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,750
It's Jang Tae Jin!

29
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,620
What? Are you kidding me?

30
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,800
Why are you just telling me now?

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,420
How could the answer be so simple?

32
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,700
- Damn it! This woman!
- What's wrong?

33
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,200
Please calm down.
[Restricted Number]

34
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,060
Hello?

35
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,990
Please calm down.

36
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:53,790
What's going on? You didn't get a summons notice yet, right?

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,940
This is a show Jang Tae Jin is putting on to make himself look innocent and throw me under the bus.

38
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,770
Anyway, you have to deny everything no matter what.

39
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,370
And feign ignorance. I'll see you when this is all over.

40
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,140
Wait! Wait! Assemblyman.

41
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,900
What?

42
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,890
By chance, do you know Jang Tae Jin's phone number?

43
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,990
If you're going to keep saying things that I don't understand, then just leave. I am busy.

44
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,940
This is Jang Tae Jin.

45
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,050
I sent you a video, so you should check it.

46
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,630
But still, I can't bury the truth.

47
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,650
There's something I have to deal with. You should go now.

48
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,800
What was that just now?

49
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,100
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- That sounded like my dad's voice.

50
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,190
Don't be ridiculous.

51
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,900
It's not?

52
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,430
It's not.

53
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,230
A recording of the executive's meeting must have been leaked.

54
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,200
It's going to be a problem. I think I'll have to convene a meeting to countermeasure it right away.

55
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,250
When are you going to the police station?

56
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,340
- What?
- You didn't get the notice?

57
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,960
- What notice?
- Si Hyung is looking for you.

58
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,140
It's strange that he is only looking for you while refusing to see his father and his lawyer.

59
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,240
Do you know something?

60
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,020
What would I know?

61
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,930
He's a jerk who sold out the late director to save himself. Do I have to do what he says?

62
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,840
Do you believe that guy because he's your family?

63
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,910
Why would they send me an official notice when I have nothing to do with that junkie?

64
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,360
It must be quite serious.

65
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,540
That a recording was leaked. You don't usually raise your voice.

66
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,220
Did you not think that a leaked transcript of a meeting where company secrets were exchanged was serious?

67
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,810
Dali, I'm sorry but I don't have time to banter with you.

68
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,260
You should go now. I'll call you.

69
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,810
But still, I can't bury the truth.

70
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,890
If there is a rotten part, you have to cut it out. If you did something wrong, you should correct it.

71
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,700
That way you can start over.

72
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,150
Cheongsong cannot be an exception.

73
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,290
Can you afford to do that?

74
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,680
How are you feeling?

75
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,110
Who are you?

76
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,850
We should meet.

77
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,160
Who are you?

78
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,310
I'm sad. I introduced myself to you before.

79
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,900
Me?

80
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,750
I'm Jin Ki Chul from Dondon F&B.

81
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,530
What?

82
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,720
Dondon?

83
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,600
Wow, what a scumbag.

84
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,980
Don't let him bother you. It's because he's not educated.

85
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,040
Do we know each other?

86
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,050
Ahn Sang Tae introduced us earlier.

87
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,530
Is that so? I don't remember.

88
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,900
Well... I'm from Dondon F&B.

89
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,030
We are focusing on franchises right now

90
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,610
but you'll be doing business with us soon. I'm Jin Ki Chul.

91
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,160
You don't say.

92
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,540
All right. What's the reason for this prank?

93
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,760
Prank? Oh... you think this is a prank.

94
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,270
Do you think I'm joking right now?

95
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,990
There was a search and seizure done at our company. What should I do? Should I hand this over to them, too?

96
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,340
Or should I spread it online? Huh?

97
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,910
Should we see what happens to Century?

98
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,200
I guess you still don't understand the situation.

99
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,800
Should I let the world know what you did to Director Kim Nak Chun?

100
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,140
Your life is in my hands.

101
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:44,200
The life of the distinguished Jang Tae Jin is in my hands.

102
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,920
Don't even try to mess with me.

103
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,200
Just wait for me to call you back.

104
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,360
What a flippant bastard.

105
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,230
Brother

106
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,940
Oh, Moo Hak.

107
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,770
What's wrong?

108
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,380
What do you mean?

109
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,650
What happened that made you get so angry?

110
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,650
Was it a call from Jang Tae Jin?

111
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,110
You just said something about Jang Tae Jin, right?

112
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,900
What do you mean by Jang Tae Jin?

113
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,270
Jang Hae Jin. Hae Jin.

114
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,270
How would I know Jang Tae Jin's phone number?

115
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,330
It was just a classmate.

116
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,090
This jerk... I was kind to him and now he's trying to creep his way up.

117
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,770
- Are you going somewhere?
- Where else would I be going?

118
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,920
I am going to the meeting.

119
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,500
Meeting? What meeting?

120
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,330
We also need to release an explanation article through the media.

121
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,480
We also need to explain this to the store owners.

122
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,540
The investigation might start immediately, so we have to prepare too.

123
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,430
The legal, accounting, and public relations team will all be gathered.

124
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,000
- Aren't you going in with me?
- Why would I tag along?

125
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,690
You just take care of it.

126
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,260
What?

127
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,560
It's not that serious.

128
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,270
Don't worry too much.

129
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,810
Work hard. And you, too.

130
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,700
He definitely

131
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,300
was just talking about Jang Tae Jin's life or something.

132
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,510
I'll go to the meeting alone,

133
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,770
so you...

134
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,430
Director!

135
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,010
Please!

136
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,700
Go and find out about Dondon F&B's Jin Ki Chul.

137
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,120
Not about Jin Moo Hak but about Jin Ki Chul.

138
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,910
Tastes, personality, friend, girlfriends!

139
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,070
Everything. Find out everything that you can.

140
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,640
Yes, Sir.

141
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,550
Also...

142
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,290
Go ahead.

143
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,920
We must call CEO Ha's people again.

144
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,220
Will he show up today?

145
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,260
What do you want to eat for dinner today?

146
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,900
Hamburger?

147
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,040
He passed away because of me.

148
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,730
My uncle...

149
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,060
I...

150
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,920
You don't want hamburgers?

151
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,490
- Hyung, you also definitely heard him. Right?
- What?

152
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,060
Kim Si Hyung said that the director died because of him.

153
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,590
- What could he mean?
- He must have just said it.

154
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,240
I heard he caused the director a lot of trouble when he was alive.

155
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,360
If parents die, all their children are sinners.

156
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,510
I heard Kim Si Hyung's uncle was his father figure.

157
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,940
This is Jang Tae Jin.

158
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,230
But still, I can't bury the truth.

159
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,300
It was definitely my dad's voice.

160
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,780
You were here.

161
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We got a call from Palda Auction

162
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,200
saying that they'll come next week to pick up the artwork.

163
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,730
I see.

164
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,680
Seeing that they are really being sold off...

165
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,930
is sad, right?

166
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,520
Ah, right! Artists Choi Ki Chang and Goo Hye Young said they will also be participating in the exhibition.

167
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,310
It seems that the other artists are also thinking positively about it.

168
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,150
That's great, right?

169
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,950
That's a relief.

170
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,340
I think we'll have a great lineup for this exhibition, too.

171
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,850
Excuse me, Curator Song.

172
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,380
Yes?

173
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,890
By any chance...

174
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,100
Shall I put it in a plastic bag?

175
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,300
Can you do so?

176
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,150
I have talked to Lawyer Cha already.

177
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,210
He'll help you.

178
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,190
You're still pretending to be great.

179
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,420
The art museum is very busy.

180
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,740
We have to prepare for the new exhibition

181
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,510
and for the rental business.

182
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,950
Seems like you were quite competent.

183
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,010
You left big shoes to fill.

184
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,860
Will you come back to work?

185
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,100
I know you need the courage to do so.

186
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,600
It would be uncomfortable to face your art museum family.

187
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,670
But I still hope that you will muster up your courage.

188
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,720
We need you.

189
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,480
Seriously, why are you doing this to me?

190
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,040
- They say we all started from one dot.
- What?

191
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,230
That small dot caused a big bang and the universe was created.

192
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,820
Stars came to existence, so did the sun...

193
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,990
and the earth.

194
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,920
So,

195
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,960
we may be all just a speck of dust,

196
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,200
but we are also stars.

197
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,290
Gong Joo...

198
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,730
We are definitely not cheap dolls.

199
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:54,600
♫ Try to forget. You will be better ♫

200
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,080
♫ Don't take that. He says it will be better ♫

201
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:16,490
♫ You always have a lot of ways even if he's wrong  ♫

202
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:22,980
♫ Well, a good time doesn't last long ♫

203
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,480
♫ Don't take it so hard ♫

204
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,160
♫ Like a strawberry scent ♫

205
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,170
You're here? Come inside.

206
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:42,410
♫ Don't need to try to turn back his mind ♫

207
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,580
♫ Time will be on your side ♫

208
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,370
You had a really hard time today, right?

209
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,030
Not seeing you is hard.

210
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,640
Nothing else is hard.

211
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,160
Is there anything I can do to help?

212
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,000
- You are helping me right now.
- What?

213
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,740
This is helping.

214
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:18,200
But doesn't Won Tak do night duty, too?

215
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,780
Why is he coming home all the time these days? Can't he take a hint?

216
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,510
Is he doing that on purpose because his stomach hurts?

217
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,930
It would be nice if he could go work undercover.

218
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,670
Ah, I...

219
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,750
Wait a moment. Let me stay like this for a bit more.

220
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,240
Excuse me...

221
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,110
It's nice.

222
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,850
Hey!

223
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,240
Why is your voice like that, honey?

224
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,920
Are you impersonating Won Tak?

225
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,710
Hey!

226
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,140
Won Tak...

227
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,650
Oh! Won Tak. Why... Why...

228
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,480
Why are you coming just now? I missed you.

229
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,190
My eyes almost fell out.

230
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,050
You're not even a child. This is so childish.

231
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,900
How can you not know when to get involved and when not to?

232
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,030
You can't take a hint?

233
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,590
Hey, this is my house. You're the one who doesn't know about it.

234
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,410
My goodness. Showing off that this is your house.

235
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,210
If you're so unhappy about it, then go home.

236
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,510
Go. Go back to your home.

237
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,400
Go. Just hurry up and go.

238
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,510
Who said I'm unhappy?

239
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,810
It's just cheap and dirty.

240
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,670
Go since it's dirty.

241
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,510
Go, damn it.

242
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,780
What's wrong with you guys?

243
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,630
What did we do?

244
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,210
Hey! Dali, you even know how to make something like this?

245
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,780
Moo Hak taught me.

246
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,050
Eat up. I did it according to the recipe but I don't know if it will be good.

247
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,420
What? Is it bad?

248
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,360
No. Wow!

249
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,820
It's just hot! It's good...

250
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,930
As expected, anything made with oil is tasty.

251
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,030
Really? It may not be enough, I'll just make some more.

252
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,410
What's wrong with this food?

253
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,930
What the hell did you teach her?

254
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,990
I know, right? These ingredients can't taste bad but...

255
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,380
What should I do? I think I'll throw up if I eat one more bite.

256
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,140
What did you say?

257
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,550
The taste is unique.

258
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:33,930
I added my own secret recipe along with the recipe that Moo Hak taught me.

259
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,000
These days, you and Moo Hak are having a very tough time.

260
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,710
So I put vitamin B, magnesium, propolis, and red ginseng.

261
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,680
I mixed them all together because they are good for your health.

262
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,720
I want you to eat it and stay strong.

263
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,250
I see.

264
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,630
That is why it is like this.

265
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,910
Dali, why aren't you eating?

266
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,020
Why are only me and Jin Moo Hak eating? You also come and eat.

267
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,200
I'll do the rest so you come and eat.

268
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,640
Maybe it's because I smelled it a lot while I cooked it but it doesn't suit my taste.

269
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,570
That's possible.

270
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,420
Wait a bit, I'll make more.

271
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,810
I don't think I can make it.

272
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,410
Why do I want to use the restroom?

273
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,480
I need to use the restroom.

274
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,020
I have to go first.

275
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:44,780
♫  What should I say about going on a path that didn't exist?  ♫

Why are you giving the big one to me?

00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,880
You said you eat a lot. A lot more than regular people!

289
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,230
You said you eat a lot more because you work in the food business.

290
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,330
Give me the small one. Give that to me.

291
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,980
I really feel like I'm going to throw up.

Please!

I guess I have a talent for cooking.

297
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,990
I'll make it again.

298
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,340
Don't do it, you jerk!

299
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,430
- What?

♫  That's ordinary love  ♫

304
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,000
What's going on with that jerk Kim Si Hyung? Did he tell you anything?

305
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,820
Do you know how big of a deal it is to leak confidential information while investigating?

306
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,780
How dare you want to know confidential information when you're just a civilian?

307
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,610
That stupid "Confidential under investigation." It comes out often in the news as well.

308
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,170
Don't be like that and why don't you just give us some information?

309
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,040
Who knows? Maybe you will get something from us.

310
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,570
Is he still asking for Tae Jin?

311
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,930
Yes. We are still trying to convince him to come.

312
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,190
Actually, I went to see Tae Jin today.

313
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,790
Why did you go there?

314
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,560
I heard something weird.

315
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,840
Something weird?

316
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,220
While Tae Jin was talking with me, he picked up a call.

317
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:14,440
He opened a file right after he hung up the phone, and I heard my dad's voice.

318
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,420
A recording of the executive's meeting must have been leaked.

319
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,730
It's going to be a problem.

320
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:26,990
He said that a recording of the executive's meeting was leaked, but it was definitely my dad's voice.

321
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,890
And unlike usual, I felt like Tae Jin was really flustered.

What was it about?

326
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:53,200
I'm not sure, but it was "but you can't ask about the truth?"

327
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,000
or maybe it was "but you can't bury the truth?"

328
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,810
It was something like that.

329
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:02,730
When was that? Do you remember the time?

330
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,950
I think it was around 2:40 p.m? It was before 3:00.

331
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,780
If it was around that time, then it was when my brother was talking on the phone with Jang Tae Jin.

332
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,390
I guess you still don't understand the situation.

333
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:27,750
Should I let the world know what you did to Director Kim Nak Chun?

Your life is in my hands.

335
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,750
In fact, on the day when Director passed away,

336
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,950
I think my brother met with him.

337
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,910
I was supposed to go but I had a business trip to the Netherlands.

338
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,440
So my brother was going to go there instead of me.

339
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,380
Why would I meet with him?

340
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,220
Wasn't that the day I left on the business trip to the Netherlands?

341
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,940
You were going to meet him on my behalf.

Oh, that.

343
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:16,280
Father found out about the loan so I wasn't able to go because he was going crazy about it.

344
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,400
How could I have gone when he was like that? I didn't want to take the blame.

345
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,790
But my brother kept saying he didn't go there on that day.

346
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,520
I thought that was suspicious.

347
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:35,530
I think he definitely saw something over there on that day.

348
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,280
And he's threatening Jang Tae Jin with it.

349
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,180
Threatening?

350
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,350
What did he see?

The file that Jang Tae Jin received today might have come from my brother.

Actually, Kim Si Hyung also said something strange.

354

Before he got arrested, he said this to his father while crying.

355
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:11,670
That the director passed away because of him.

His name was Oh Ki Chul, but he changed his last name to Jin immediately when the family law changed.

363
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,670
With his mother's full support, he tried various businesses like information and communication companies, entertainment companies,

364
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,780
and advertising agencies, but they all failed one after another.

365

Currently, he's the director of the Dondon F&B headquarters but it's just a title.

366
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,160
He's quick-witted but timid, and he's not good at work but is greedy.

367

He's not a person for you to be worried about.

368

I think you can just deal with this while raising his pride a bit.

369

The problem is not the person but what Jin Ki Chul has in his hand.

370

There's a bomb on a person who doesn't know right from wrong.

00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:21,260
Thinking of all the criticism that would have come to Cheongsong,

483
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,800
I thought my uncle would accept their request.

484
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,550
Uncle!

485
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,850
But he said I should pay for what I did.

486
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:37,160
He said if I didn't turn myself in, he would report me.

487
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,520
If you commit a crime,

488
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,380
you should be punished.

489
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:49,820
The problem started here. I was only planning on threatening him,

490
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:56,860
but if he reports it to the police, not just Ahn Sang Tae, the one who organized this,

491
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,940
but also Jang Tae Jin would be revealed.

492
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,330
But still, I can't bury the truth.

493
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:08,930
If there is a rotten part, you have to cut it out. If you did something wrong, you should correct it.

494
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,280
That way you can start over.

495
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,600
Cheongsong cannot be an exception.

496
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,050
Can you afford to do that?

497
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,130
Just as I thought, Jang Tae Jin was behind it.

498
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:42,270
People often misunderstand this, but rich people are more greedy for money.

499
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:45,730
When it comes to money, there's no parent and children.

500
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,320
And even if it's your own sibling, you can just stab them in their back.

501
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,950
If the redevelopment starts,

502
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:58,790
it's a multi-trillion project. Doesn't that make you drool?

503
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,720
In this world,

504
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,610
my uncle was an odd person.

505
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:24,360
Do you think this incident will simply end as a drug scandal of Cheongsong's eldest grandson?

506
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,960
The Cheongsong Art Museum, which claims to be a foundation for poor Korean culture and arts

507
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,460
has poured out private funds and passion since its predecessors.

508
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:39,680
So if people find out it has been used as a port for drug smuggling, the public will be more disappointed and infuriated.

509
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:47,170
What do you mean by "it has been?" Are you saying this isn't the first time?

510
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,750
I heard you found the drugs.

511
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,940
Did you think that amount was for his personal enjoyment?

512
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:03,380
You mean you were smuggling and selling?

513
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,850
Si Hyung's house, car, and lifestyle

514
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:11,360
were all excessive compared to what you gave him for living expenses.

515
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:16,910
I'm guessing that a lot of the artwork in the museum's storage have been switched to fake ones.

516
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,820
And the originals sold to other countries.

517
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:24,510
- You... You bastard!
- Uncle!

518
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,380
All you have to do is allow the redevelopment!

519
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,520
If you help to lift the greenbelt zone, Assemblyman Ahn Sang Tae promised to cover up everything!

520
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,690
Let's take this as an opportunity and make the museum bigger!

521
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:38,110
And I'll change into a new man.

522
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,400
I'll never do any drugs anymore! Uncle...

523
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,770
Please, save me!

524
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:47,900
This was all your plan all along.

525
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,730
You were planning to redevelop with Ahn Sang Tae–

526
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:58,650
Is that why you lured Si Hyung?

527
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,500
It won't go as you guys planned.

528
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,800
It won't. It will never happen!

529
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:17,420

- Uncle, what's wrong?

530
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,270
What's wrong? Uncle!

531
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:28,120
Uncle, wake up! Are you okay? Uncle!

532

- My medicine...
- Medicine? Where is it?

533
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,260
He said he would never allow it to happen.

534
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,920
Then, shouldn't we make it possible?

- What?

How can they charge you with bribery for a redevelopment case where nothing has been decided yet?

562
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:06,610
Well, if you get unlucky, you will be fined a few hundred. Just think of it as a lesson fee.
