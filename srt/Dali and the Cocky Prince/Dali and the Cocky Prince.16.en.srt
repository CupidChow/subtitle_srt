[Episode 16: There are no right answers in our lives. But for me, you are the only answer!]

2
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,080
Ki Chul! What is it? What happened?

3
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,600
Ohhh, look at the blood! Oh my god!

4
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,450
Mom... what's going to happen to Moo Hak?

5
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,670
What's going to happen to Moo Hak, Mom?

6
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,710
What did the doctors say?

7
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,680
Blood... Blood...

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,240
Why can't you speak properly?

9
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,110
They said he bled too much.

10
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,110
I think they said some blood vessel in his spleen was cut.

11
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,820
He is unconscious.

12
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,310
Father, what should we do? What should we do about our Moo Hak, Father?

13
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:44,920
If only I hadn't contacted Jang Tae Jin. If only I hadn't met Jang Tae Jin!

14
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,300
I'm sorry, Father. Because of me, Moo Hak...

15
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,600
Moo Hak became like this, trying to save me. I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry, Father...

16
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
It's because of me.

17
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,870
Can't you be quiet!

18
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,430
Did he die? Like someone with bad fortune, why are you crying and causing a ruckus?

19
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,520
What about my Moo Hak? He's a good man. He's my son.

20
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,610
Nothing is going to happen to him, so stop crying.

21
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,530
Getting stabbed in his stomach? That's no big deal.

22
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,980
You're so loud, it's driving me crazy.

23
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,210
Ah, what to do... our Moo Hak...

24
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,360
Why did you come here?

25
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,150
What are you going to do to my son now?

26
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,010
Leave. Just leave.

27
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,120
I'm not in the mood to see your face, so leave.

28
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,910
I will leave after seeing Moo Hak's surgery is complete.

29
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,090
If I ask you to leave, just leave!

30
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,270
Why would you...

31
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,360
get to see when my son finishes his surgery? With what right?

32
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,180
When this happened because of you!

33
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,410
If it wasn't for you,

34
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,730
my son would have never been involved with Jang Tae Jin.

35
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,250
And he wouldn't be...

36
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,330
in the... operating room.

37
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,200
Do you know what kind of son my Moo Hak is? Not all children are the same!

38
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,200
My Moo Hak, like a thorn...

39
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,410
Right here. He's like a thorn stuck right here.

40
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,760
When you raise a child, I thought that they grew up on their own.

41
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,010
I never properly took care of him.

42
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,360
While everyone else was going to school, I made him hold a delivery bag.

43
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,570
I made him serve drunk customers,

44
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,110
I made him suffer until today, but now that we are well-off...

45
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,910
Honey...

46
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,350
Ah, geez, Moo Hak will be okay...

47
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,750
Don't cry, Honey. Don't cry.

48
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,590
I... can't let you be with him.

49
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,540
You don't even deserve to see him. If he...

50
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,740
continues to be with you, who knows what will happen to him.

51
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,580
So, get away from my son, please.

52
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,870
I will beg like this...

53
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,980
- Please get away from him!
- Go! Go!

54
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,360
I said go! Go! Honey...

55
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,900
Get up!

56
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,500
I said leave!

It's my darling.

62
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,300
He's saying something! He's saying something!

It's your father. Can you recognize your father?

65
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,590
Why did my darling get so many wrinkles?

66
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,900
What are you saying?

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,420
- Director...
- Director! Director!

69
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:40,770
Are you regaining consciousness, Director?

70
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,500
It seems like my darling cried a lot.

71

- Come on, come on.

I will stay here. The two of you can leave.

I will stay here. Please go home and get some rest, Chairman.

You should go home and get some rest.

No, I will go see him and then leave.

90

We don't know when he will wake up... and the chairman has been in a lot of shock.

91
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,160
We don't know if he'll blow up at you again.

92

No. Are you going to be late?

To take moral responsibility, I think it would be better to announce that

you will donate to the culture and arts in accordance with the will of the late Director Kim Nak Chun.

Do you know why this happened?

327
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,960
That video that appeared in the news all day,

328
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,250
my eldest son took that video.

329
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,410
Moo Hak's brother.

330
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,070
That guy tried to make a deal

331
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,100
with Jang Tae Jin with that.

332
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,780
With the video of your father dying.

333
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:56,620
Can you face that man?

334
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,990
I can't face you.

335
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:08,430
Even if I didn't give birth to him, he is still my son.

336
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,960
So, how can I face you?

337
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,320
Even though he passed away, he was your father.

338
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,790
I can't face you because I am ashamed.

339
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,110
I won't be able to face you even after I die.

340
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,240
But you can't cut off a relationship between a parent and child

341
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,430
or between brothers.

342
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,220
So, you should end things with him.

343
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,470
There's one thing I learned from this.

344
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:55,540
People should live with similar people.

345
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:01,970
You should go back to your world.

346
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,500
They say, don't bite off more than you can chew.

347
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,000
We won't even...

348
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:16,660
look your way ever again.

349
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:50,960
[One year later]

350
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,040
Darling. Darling!

351
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,240
Darling!

352
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,840
- Darling, I just made Pollack Hangover Soup.
- Huh?

353
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,560
Hey. I just made a refreshing pollack hangover soup. So, quickly wash up and come out.

354
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,850
This guy... how much alcohol are you drinking?

355
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:43,170
Geez!

356
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,230
How is it? Refreshing, right?

357
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,550
But why did you leave your fine house and come here?

358
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,940
You don't even like this neighborhood.

359
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:11,180
I don't hate the neighborhood. I just don't like the memories of me having a hard time here.

360
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:19,010
Eating here with just you makes me feel nostalgic.

361
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,560
Eating the leftover gamjatang with cold rice.

362
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,400
We went out of business as soon as we had a meal.

363
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:35,290
Now that I think about it, I think I was the happiest back then.

364
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:40,730
Even though all I had was you and me to depend on in the world,

365
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,130
I never thought I was lonely.

366
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,120
- Stop lying through your teeth.
- What?

367
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,910
You weren't lonely because of me, it was because of someone else.

368
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,250
I'm fine now, so stop tormenting me,

369
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:07,330
and call Brother and his mother back home. One year is enough.

370
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,110
Don't even bring up those punks!

371
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:15,010
If I think about what you went through because of those punks, I still have anger rising up inside me!

372
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,800
They say you shouldn't twist the truth.

373
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,430
Why was that because of Brother and his mother?

374
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,590
The situation somehow just played out that way.

375
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,940
Also, you hold some responsibility for why Brother became that way.

376
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,440
You know that yourself, which is why you're punishing yourself right now. Am I wrong?

377
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,140
Stop being stubborn.

378
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,370
What are you going to do if Mother finds another man?

379
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,620
What? That woman is meeting another man?

380
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:51,260
Wait... What? M-Mother?

381
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,900
Gosh, I'm saying you should go see her before it's too late.

382
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:00,210
There's not much to happiness. Happiness is when you live with the person you like and annoy them.

383
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,550
And dress up.

384
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:09,750
Take a shower, too! Put on some cologne, also!

385
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,350
And try going to places like this.

386
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,920
What's this? Black Tea and Madeleine?

387
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,910
What? Is this a place you go taste testing?

388
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:32,920
That punk. Always makes me mad after he does something nice for me.

389
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,660
What smell is he talking about?

390
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,590
I'm the new owner of the rooftop house, and I wondered when you were going to come and pick this up?

391
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:56,080
This crappy bed.

392
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,380
You know that nowadays you have to pay even if you want to throw it away, right?

393
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,160
Well, you being busy is your problem. If you don't take this away within three days–

394
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,120
What the? He hung up?

395
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,370
How can he have such crap manners?

396
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,340
Oppa! Oppa!

397
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,570
Oppa! Oppa!

398
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,080
Why aren't you answering when someone is calling for you?

399
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,270
- What is it now?
- Change out the bathroom's tiles.

400
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,190
Even though it's a rooftop room, it's really bad.

401
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:43,320
Are you going to pay the deposit fee? If you pay that, I'll change out the tiles for you.

402
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,790
I don't have that much money. At least change the wallpaper then!

403
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,220
I changed it to the best quality silk wallpaper already,

404
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,340
why would I change that?

405
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,310
It doesn't go with the color of my closet.

406
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,560
Then change your wardrobe.

407
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,510
- Then at least change the floors! I really can't back down on this one.
- What's wrong with the floors now?

408
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,680
My feet stick onto it because it's not marble.

409
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,060
Change it to marble. I have something in mind. It's made in Italy─

410
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,590
- You should just leave.
- What?

411
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:17,720
I rented out the room for cheap because I was proud of you for wanting to truly live by yourself. But what?

412
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,350
Silk wallpapers and marble floors?

413
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,400
There are a ton of people who want to live there besides you.

414
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,820
I'll call the realtor right now and you just─

415
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,600
Yes, Curator Song? Oh, is that so? I didn't know.

416
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,950
Hey, I'm not done talking.

417
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:41,360
The director? No, I didn't receive an email.

418
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,360
Well, it's still in the middle of the night over there, so she may not have checked it yet.

419
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,230
Yes, Sir!

420
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,770
Hello! Hello!

421
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,290
Gosh...

422
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,730
Mom! Mom! I'll do it.

423
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:24,300
Gosh, I'm So Geum Ja.

424
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,060
The Queen of Serving. Majang area's Pinwheel. My goodness.

425
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,990
This is nothing for me.

426
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,790
Mom, don't be like that and try giving Father a call.

427
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:43,550
I may have done wrong, but you... you didn't do anything wrong besides having a bad son.

428
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:49,570
Oh, forget it! I feel like I can breathe, not having to see that old geezer anymore!

429
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,720
Welco─

430
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,510
Honey! Are you okay?

431
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:15,220
- I'm just so weak...
- Oh, gosh!

432
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,690
What were you thinking, holding something this heavy with your weak body?

433
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:23,060
What if you get hurt because of that!

434
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:29,240
What can I do then? My body has to be tried for me to think of you less.

435
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,640
Geum Ja...

436
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,160
Baek Won...

437
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:44,410
Oh, you've gotten so skinny. There are only bones.

438
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,100
You bastard...

439
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,870
- Honey, I was wrong. Let's hurry up and go home, okay?
- Okay!

440
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,490
Wow!

441
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,500
Goodbye, everyone!

442
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,550
Goodbye!

443
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Everyone! That's my father! Dondon F&B's CEO!

444
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,000
That's my father, everyone!

445
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:25,430
I heard that the current exhibition at Cheongsong is doing really well. You're not going to go?

446
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,670
I think you should visit at least once.

447
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,750
I said not to bring up Cheongsong in front of me, didn't I?

448
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:38,600
I thought you could swing by since you have business in that area.

449
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,170
What is it?

450
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,800
It's nothing, I just imagined I saw something right now.

451
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:35,300
I guess the Cheongsong art camp this time will be held without the director.

452
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,340
Won't it be difficult to get back to Korea before that?

453
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:42,030
Since it's an exchange exhibition between Korea and the Netherlands, I think she will have to stay until the last day.

454
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:45,780
I think she's busy because she doesn't even check her emails.

455
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,850
I wonder if she is eating well.

456
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,530
She should take care of her health as well.

457
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,370
Then, why don't Gong Joo and Chak Hee

458
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:56,200
come up with a plan for the Cheongsong art camp this time?

459
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,950
We have many sponsors this year, so don't worry about the budget.

460
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,190
- All right.
- They will be at ease.

461
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,450
This ends the meeting.

462
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,380
Good job, everyone.

463
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,360
Good job, everyone.

464
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,510
Oh my god!

465
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:13,060
It's been a long time, everyone.

466
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,310
Director!

467
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,970
Director! You said you'd come back next month.

468
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,700
I am just here for a short time.

469
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,880
I have something important to take care of.

470
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,840
Something important?

471
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,290
What important thing could it be that she came back from the Netherlands?

472
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:30,440
Give me your suitcase.

473
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,710
Why didn't you contact us beforehand?

474
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:36,420
I would have gone all the way to the airport to pick you up.

475
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,820
This is great news.

476
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,050
I have a lot of things to ask of you on making a plan for the Cheongsong art camp this time.

477
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:46,440
You are a bank of ideas, aren't you?

478
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,260
Oh, right! What about having a company dinner tonight, now that the director is here?

479
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,780
We have had only greasy stuff till now. Let's go for something fresh and spicy this time.

480
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,930
What do you say?

481
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,490
Shall we then?

482
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,490
- Sure.
- Yes, that would be good.

483
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:01,800
Then, I will make the reservations.

484
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,870
♫ That's ordinary love ♫

485
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,660
You have to conduct your social life like that.

486
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,560
Why couldn't I have done that?

487
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,250
Let us learn, too.

♫ That's ordinary love ♫

489
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,160
Does your throat hurt? What was that "ahem" for?

490
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,810
She's the same as ever.

491
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,850
Right.

492
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:23,800
That's a lot of food!

493
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,340
It's been a while since you all have come here. I was about to forget what you look like.

494
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,930
These guys look so relaxed when our director is going through so much—

495
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,060
Let us know if you need anything and enjoy your meal.

496
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,060
Thank you, we will enjoy it.

497
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,370
- It's a lot of food.
- It is.

498
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,950
Director...

499
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,120
My goodness, Mr. Ji—

♫ Will be traces of the past ♫

504
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,650
You guys are checking the expiry dates properly, right?

505
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,480
Of course, we are.

506
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,890
You guys are responsible for training

507
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,290
the new employee next week.

508
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:53,160
Think of the new person as a student and teach them responsibly instead of thinking of them as your junior.

509
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,590
You don't have to tell us twice.

510
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:59,160
Upgrade the season menu.

511

♫ Is hidden behind it ♫

512
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,890
I will take care of things here.

513
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:09,110
Why don't you go out?

514

♫ Will you think of me again at night? ♫

515
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,520
How is the response to the new menu?

516
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,980
It is good.

517
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,010
But it seems a bit lacking with just the omelet,

518
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:20,830
so I am developing tonkatsu, too.

519
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,150

♫ The heart that no one knows  ♫

528
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,110
You came to Korea

529
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,800
but you did not even contact me.

530
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:25,260

♫ At night? ♫

532
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,440
If it is bothering you that much, why don't you contact him first?

533
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,760
No, that's not it.

534
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,420
Yeah, right. You have been fiddling with your phone for quite some time now.

535
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,420
You also saw the expression on his face.

536
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,380
That's exactly why I am saying you should contact him first.

537
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:58,950
Did you... go over everything I told you to study?

538
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,040
You had roughly copied and pasted some materials from the internet when I checked earlier.

539
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,740
Did you think I wouldn't know? I know everything.

540
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:10,400
You make it a point to drive the conversation towards studying when you want to avoid a certain topic.

541
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,880
I didn't eat any of the gamjatang earlier. I am really hungry.

542
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,480
Do you have something to eat at home?

543
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,410
I didn't get to eat either because of you.

544
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,930
Then, do you want to eat ramyeon?

545
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,420
Yes.

546
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:35,560
Home sweet home.

547
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,560
Trash?

548
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,810
Why? You must be feeling really guilty about something.

549
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,920
I was talking about this trash.

550
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,760
Why is this trash? I could easily get 200,000 won ($200) if I put this out as a second-hand item.

551
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,350
Who will buy this crappy bed for two hundred thousand won?

552
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,460
It's none of your concern as to who buys it.

553
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:09,170
I have settled with the owner to leave it here till it is sold. So, we are settled. Right?

554
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,020
Don't call me again.

555
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,000
What is settled? I am the owner here now.

556
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,630
You aren't aware of the Rooftop Protection Act?

557
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,240
Rooftop Protection... what? Are you talking about the Housing Lease Protection Act?

558
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,580
I am talking about a house, not a car!
(T/N: 'Imdaechabeob' the law for the protection of tenants ends with the letter for car (cha))

559
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,330
- So, you are talking about protection of—
- Be it a car or a house, you just need protection. No?

560
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,170
I am going to go crazy.

561
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,740
- Do you perhaps have a bed?
- What?

562
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,770
If not, I will give this to you for cheap.

563
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:37,890
- Who will buy something trashy like this?
- Agai—
- How much is it?

564
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,710
- A hundred thousand won.
- A hundred thousand won?

565
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:42,340
100,000 won ($100) is a bargain, I bought this for over 1,000,000 won ($1,000).

566
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:47,380
You have to spend ten thousand to dispose of this. But you want me to pay a hundred thousand?

567
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:52,070
Is the police robbing a civilian in daylight?

568
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,490
You are caught red-handed.

569
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:58,030
I am going to let a corrupt cop like you taste a free prison meal so that you can come to your senses.

570
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,090
Wait... What was 112 again?

571
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,090
Shall I call and ask 114?

572
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,980
Is she a female version of Jin Moo Hak or something?

573
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,830
- What?
- People don't get free meals at prisons nowadays.

574
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:12,070
People who have not even been near a prison talk as if they know everything about it.

575
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:15,300
I just came back from prison.

576
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,590
I was visiting my dad.

577
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:22,310
Are you happy that you got a special promotion after throwing my dad into prison? Are you on cloud nine?

578
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,080
Seeing me getting kicked out of a house that was like a palace

579
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,590
and moving into a rooftop place, you must feel so relieve—

580
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:30,070
Okay, I got it! I got it! Just take this.

581
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,390
Happy?

582
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:34,600
Don't try to pawn off your crappy bed to me.

583
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,520
Then, what do you want?

584
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,230
Buy me food.

585
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,180
Why should I?

586
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,560
You are good with jajangmyeon, right? The Chinese place, right here, looked good.

587
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,180
Why in the world do I need to buy you food?

588
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,230
Shall I order kanpungi?

589
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,460
Chili shrimp sounds good, too.

590
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,180
Hey, I don't like kanpungi.

591
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:56,550
The chili shrimp is... No! Why would I buy you a meal?

592
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:59,560
Because I am hungry.

593
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,750
Why are you telling me if you feel hungry?

594
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,040
Tangsuyuk?

595
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,210
They're good at making tangsuyuk there... No! Why would I go there?

596
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:09,610
I told you I am hungry!

597
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,820
He's coming out!

598
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,400
I think that's him!

599
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,400
Excuse me!

600
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,950
How do you feel about not being prosecuted today?

601
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,290
Are you really going to step down from all your roles?

602
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:26,940
Is there anything you want to say to the late Director Kim Nak Chun?

603
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:31,390
Do you think resigning is the right thing to do?

604
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,830
Do you agree with the non-prosecution disposition?

605
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,850
What are you feeling right now, Chairman?

606
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:36,470
Please say a word.

607
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,510
- Please say a word.
- How do you feel?

608
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,550
Please just give one comment.

609
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,130
Do you feel no guilt?

610
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:44,020
Please say something.

611
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,290
You're just leaving?

612
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,880
Chairman!

613
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,210
Be quiet!

[Cheongsong Art Museum]

615
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,420
Are you really going to do that?

616
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,070
Then, is there any other option?

617
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:16,720
The wedding hall rental isn't as great as expected.

618
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,220
About that... It's available only on Mondays instead of the weekends,

619
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:23,130
so it seems to be inaccessible.

620
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,710
But we cannot give up on exhibitions on the weekend because of that.

621
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:30,000
So, people need to choose and focus on one.

622
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,560
If there is someone who truly cares about my happiness, they won't care if it's a weekday or a weekend.

623
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,280
A small wedding with character, done in the art museum, with people like that around.

624
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,630
They can attend the wedding and visit the exhibitions.

625
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:43,740
We will share Cheongsong's dignity like that.

626
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,320
It seems you know a thing or two.

627
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,900
What is this?

628
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,110
One team in a month?

629
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,780
This is a complete mess!

630
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,550
You guys have become a mess in my absence!

631
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:16,680
What are you doing right now, Mr. Jin?

632
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,080
You don't know?

633
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,350
I'm giving you advice.

634
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:25,810
A management consultant who knows well how to earn money, to an art museum that does not know how to earn money.

635
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:28,290
With what right?

636
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:29,610
Do you know me?

637
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:32,280
Do we have anything to do with each other?

638
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,960
- Good job, everyone.
- The meeting isn't over yet!

639
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,550
Of course.

640
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:47,360
Please see yourself out, Mr. Jin.

641
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,730
Why wouldn't we have anything to do with each other?

642
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,550
You don't know? We are creditor and debtor.

643
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:01,580
It's been so long since we paid off that debt, so how long are you going to keep bringing that up?

644
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:06,640
I have paid you in full along with the interest, without missing even ten won.

645
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:15,940
My watch.

646
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,170
The watch that you took with you a year ago in the Netherlands.

647
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,620
Do you not remember?

648
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,340
Do you know how expensive that is?

649
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,540
You should have a conscience.

650
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,790
I am saying this just in case. Don't try to pay me off,

651
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,540
or say that you will buy me the same model.

652
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,050
Don't even try to say such things.

653
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:36,220
That watch is really precious to me.

654
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:39,710
If one of the minute hands is different, then I'll just–

655
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,790
Whoa!

656
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,800
This...?

657
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,300
- How is this...?
- I know.

658
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:18,110
I found it while cleaning out the house in the Netherlands. We are good, right?

659
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:30,760
- Whenever they see each other–
- Oh?

660
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:38,180
How can you not call me even once after leaving like that?

661
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,920
Did you plan to not ever call?

662
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,170
Do you know how I have been doing since then?

663
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:52,140
Why are they so serious?

664
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:58,030
You know why the two of them fought, right?

665
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:00,170
That...

666
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,590
What do you mean by a business trip?

667
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:13,870
I packed all my stuff. We just need to start now. What do you mean by a business trip?

668
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,740
They said there is some issue with Artist Hong Ja Young's work.

669
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,610
- I will come back quickly.
- Where are you going to?

670
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,520
- Netherlands.
- Netherland—

671
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,860
Then, what about Gyeongju and Seokguram Grotto?

672
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:29,010
We can go once I come back.

673
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:33,200
It has already been a year since I have been discharged from the hospital. Do you know how many times we have canceled this plan?

674
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,130
You are busy in your way, and I am in mine.

675
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,960
Do you know how difficult it is to find time together?

676
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,630
Then, what do I do when there's a possibility that the Korea-Netherlands exhibition may get canceled?

677
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:45,990
Are you saying that it's okay if our Gyeongju and Seokguram Grotto trip gets canceled?

678
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:48,790
It's not canceling, but postponing it.

679
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,110
I am sorry. I will be back quickly.

680
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,190
No, this won't resolve even if you kiss me. I won't overlook this today.

681
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:05,270
If you want to go, step over me and do so.

682
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:07,530
Step over me and go!

683
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:17,000
I will be back real soon!

684
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,210
Hey! Hey!

685
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:21,510
Hey, Kim Dali!

686
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:25,660
They are like that because they have been apart for a week.

687
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,060
What are you talking about? They are like that because they were apart for just a week?

688
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,300
Why, why, why?

689
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,940
My goodness, it's like they never dated before.

690
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:36,630
- Look at my goosebumps!
- Even I am embarrassed.

691
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:40,240
Both of them were normal. Why have they become like that?

692
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,730
These are the good times.

693
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:46,130
Shall we just go in?

694
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:49,100
Let's just end it.

695
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,180
- What are they talking about ending?
- Ending, ending, ending?

696
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:57,400
It cannot continue like this anymore.

697
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,460
3,000 does not stand a chance!

698
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:03,520
Let's add 4,000 eons and go till 7,000 eons.

699
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,840
7,000?

700
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:12,120
What are 3,000, 4,000

701
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,060
- and 7,000?
- Right?

702
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,610
Is it money again? Will they be a debtor and creditor again?

703
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,870
- No, no, no.
- Is it about money again?

704
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:20,730
I think they are talking about the Brahmajala Sutra.

705
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:23,080
I think they are talking about a cosmic connection.

706
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,630
Cosmic connection?

707
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,730
- A cosmic connection?
- Just a minute.

708
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:29,280
7,000 eons mean...

709
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,990
7...

710

711
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,430
Kim Dali,

712
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,450
will you go till 7,000 eons with me?

713
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:47,180
Oh my god!
