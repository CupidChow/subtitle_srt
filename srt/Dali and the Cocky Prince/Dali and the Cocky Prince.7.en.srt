[Episode 07: Does death mean the end?]

2
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,020
Be quiet, punk! Where do you think you are! Don't play innocent!

3
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,290
- Hey!
- What's going on?
- Hey! Hey!

4
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,810
Hey! You bastard! Hey!

5
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,430
Let me go!

6
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,380
If you were better, you could have hit me.

7
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,000
What? What?

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,150
Why don't you hit me and let me get some compensation money so I can live a comfortable life?

9
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,950
Whoever that woman is,

10
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,340
the one who reported me, I'm going to kill her if I get her–!

11
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,160
What the–

12
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,520
Say it again. What did you say?

13
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,900
- What did you say?
- Mr. Jin, no!

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,800
Don't do it!

15
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,130
I should've...

16
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,310
killed her then.

17
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,860
Please, don't do anything. Please.

18
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,940
Look at this fool.

19
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,880
You all saw that, right? I will never settle!

20
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,910
Since the camera is filming this, you guys figure it out. Call the police–

21
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,810
Jang Jin Gu! Shut up!

22
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,090
I'm telling you clearly, but every time you say something,

23
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,240
your sentence will increase by that much.

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,000
- But that damn–
- Armed robbery is three and a half years to seven years!

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,480
And you were released from prison last year, right?

26
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,630
A person who was punished for armed robbery and committed a second offense within three years gets ten years or life imprisonment.

27
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,870
The crime scene was clearly captured by your favorite camera. Footprints, fingerprints, and DNA.

28
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,930
The scene is full of evidence to put you in prison.

29
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,120
Nevertheless, you know that my testimony as a victim is imperative, right?

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,900
I don't know if it's unfortunate or fortunate, but I know many doctors,

31
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,240
and depending on your attitude from now on,

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,060
the content of the medical report is going to look very different.

33
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,640
I'm saying it again in case you don't understand,

34
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,500
but depending on what I say,

35
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,230
you may not be able to see sunlight for the rest of your life. Did you get it?

36
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,710
- Yes, Miss.
- Sit.

37
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,310
Where's my money? There must be money left, right?

38
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,130
T-That-

39
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,510
No way. Did you use all of that?

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,730
If the detective came in even a minute later...

41
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,020
The next card was a "palgwang" card! You saw the "samgwang" card I had, right?
(Playing cards called Hwatu, to play games such as GoStop.)

42
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,840
Put those two together and it's a perfect "sampalgwang"!

43
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,550
That's art, right there!

44
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,570
Do you know how much money that was?

45
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,240
You gambled with our employees' salaries?

46
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,180
You little...! Let me go!

47
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,950
[Episode 7]

48
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,730
No matter how angry, you shouldn't do that at a place like this.

49
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,690
If you're unlucky, he'll charge you with assault

50
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,530
and file a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. That will be troublesome for you later.

51
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,830
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,240
This goes for you and your boyfriend earlier,

53
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,590
go calm down your temper.

54
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,880
Boyfriend?

55
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,060
The flying kick guy.

56
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,900
No, that's not my boyfriend.

57
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,450
Then your brother?

58
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,210
No.

59
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,600
If he's not your boyfriend or brother, why did he do a flying kick in the middle of the police station?

60
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,330
You guys making all kinds of trouble.

61
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,390
Calm down your temper and go. Okay?

63
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,420
All right.

64
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,280
Take care.

65
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,330
You were a police officer?

66
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,230
It's nice to see you here.

67
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,880
What kind of relationship do you have?

68
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,770
Is it a habit to ask questions cutting to the chase, or is it an occupational disease?

69
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,850
What do you mean by relationship?

70
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,660
What's your relationship with Dali?

71
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,490
Dali?

72
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,330
Of course, if they're famous, they're all our friends.

73
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,610
That's true. Hyung Byung Hun, Hyung Woo Sung, and Hyung Bin, they are all my friends.
(T/N: All famous actors)

74
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,320
I don't know when Son will be back. We need to eat together sometime.
(T/N: Referring to soccer player Son Heung Min.)

75
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,920
Aren't you going to tell me?

76
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,510
Are you serious?

77
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,210
Ms. Kim Dali. She's not the type of person you can talk about carelessly!

78
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,990
Won Tak.

79
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,210
You came? Are you done?

80
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,710
Yes.

81
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,340
Mr. Jin, how do you know our Won Tak?

82
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,030
Our?

83
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,940
Our Won Tak?

84
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,860
Did you two know each other?

85
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,480
I don't know him.

86
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,230
- The house I live in—
- He's a tenant.

87
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,410
He lives in my rooftop room, and I'm the landlord.

88
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,060
- But weren't you living alone? Do you live with someone?
- Whether I live alone or with someone, what's it to you?

89
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,040
That's because...

90
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,930
my upstairs neighbor was being so loud.

91
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:28,320
They say that noise between apartments is a serious issue these days. I heard that there are several people who have no consideration for community life.

92
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,430
- I told you. The landlord downstairs is crazy–
- Why do you have this on your face? It's messy.

93
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,440
I see. Won Tak is the tenant of your house.

94
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,950
Please take good care of him. He's so energetic. Is there any noise between floors?

95
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,780
I told you there is. So I can't even sleep.

96
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,520
What a load of crap. That's because the house was a mess—

97
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,150
He says he's sorry, and next time he'll be more careful.

98
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,720
- When did I say that?
- We are done introducing ourselves, right?

99
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,880
We should go now.

100
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,870
Mr. Jin, you did a great job too. Get home safely.

101
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,980
What's wrong with you? Who is that jerk?

102
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,980
Be quiet. I'll tell you everything when we get home. For the time being it's a secret that I live with you.

103
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,280
- You living with me–
- I said be quiet.

104
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,310
Where are you going?

105
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,620
- Excuse me?
- Aren't you going to the art museum?

106
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,140
Are you not going to have the exhibition? There must be a lot of things to deal with!

107
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,680
Oh, right.

108
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,450
It was nice to see you, Won Tak. I should get going.

109
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:37,350
I don't know where you live, but until the day we meet again, watch your mouth–

110
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,730
be careful of the noise between the floors.

111
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,290
What?

112
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,930
Hey, Dal–

113
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,900
What is your relationship with "our" Won Tak?

114
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,070
- What?
- I don't think you guys have an ordinary relationship.

115
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,840
It is not an ordinary relationship, but it's a bit long to explain.

116
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,510
I guess it's a relationship involving more than three thousand eons? Is it about five thousand?

117
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,700
- Six thousand? Seven thousand?
- Well...

118
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,630
"Our" Won Tak is a really good and nice person.

119
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,460
He's really righteous, law-abiding, professional, a man of rank,

120
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,070
and above all, he's a detective in the violent crimes unit, so thieves can't even come close.

121
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,400
It's like having a security company without paying.

122
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,430
He is also good at fighting. How reliable it is to be with him.

123
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,360
Did you hire a bodyguard?

124
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,110
I mean, there's no one like him as a tenant.

125
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,830
He is often on duty and has a lot of work, so he's so easy-going that he doesn't even wash up.

126
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,810
So, how great is that? Electricity and water bills aren't that expensive.

127
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,650
Whoever heard that will think that you guys live together.

128
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,100
What?

129
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,180
Mr. Jin, how can you be that good at making jokes.

130
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,320
I'll also talk to Won Tak about the noise between the floors–

131
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,200
All right. I will take care of the tenant,

132
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,310
so can we stop talking about "our" Won Tak? My ears are about to bleed.

133
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,310
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,010
Is your hand okay?

135
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,520
It's nothing.

136
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,480
I was going to give that jerk a good punch,

137
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,010
- but you hugged me from behind.
- What?

138
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,580
I was surprised, and in front of a lot of people too.

139
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,570
I didn't hug you, but I was trying to stop you. I was afraid things would get worse.

140
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,310
You stopped me so passionately.

141
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,030
You should have gone as you were going. Why did you come back and cause a misunderstanding?

142
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,250
That's because—

143
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,610
That's because—

144
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,470
G-Gukbap. I was going to ask about the gukbap restaurant.
(T/N: Rice and soup meal)

145
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,620
- What?
- Usually, near police stations...

146
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,870
gukbap restaurants are famous.

147
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,270
I went to do research on famous restaurants. You didn't think I went because I was worried about you, did you?

148
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,830
And even if you're inside a police station,

149
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,230
you can't do what you did earlier.

150
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,860
Do you know how tough those kinds of guys are?

151
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,540
- I know well.
- What?

152
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,170
I know it's hard to imagine because he's so cool now,

153
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,880
but when Won Tak caused a lot of trouble,

154
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,380
my dad and I went to the police station a lot.

155
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,790

But I did not laugh.

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,710
I was thinking the current exhibition was the last one.

313
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:14,100
- Ms. Hong.
- I'll make sure you get a private exhibition within one year.

314
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,350
If you'll give us your permission, we'll have one next year, and the next...

315
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:23,730
I want to personally work on holding an exhibition with you at our art museum.

316
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,750
I saw somewhere

317
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,420
that people will get down on their knees in situations like these, too.

318
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:37,630
I guess you're too much of a snobby elite to do that.

319
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,930
- Ms. Hong!
- Will you give your permission... if I kneel?

320
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,310
Giving a condition is a negotiation, not a favor.

321
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,700
You normally hate stuff like this.

322
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,020
Why are you being like this, Ms. Hong?

323
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,400
If kneeling will make you forgive us, I'll happily do so.

324
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,560
I truly apologize for what happened today.

325
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,050
Please, don't do this Director.

326
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,940
- Please, Ms. Hong.
- Oh, forget it.

327
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,680
Why can't you take a joke?

328
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,530
Oh, it must have arrived by now.

329
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:20,050
What kind of magic did you use that made Ms. Hong change her mind?

330
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,650
It's amazing!

331
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,650
Be careful, please.

332
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:29,050
Up there.

333
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,710
Oh!

334
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,270
I'll carry it myself, sir.

335
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:48,870
No, it's nothing. It's fine.

336
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,980
What's he doing?

337
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:04,180
He said, "The Living and The Dead 3" has arrived.

338
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:10,680
- You're not going to go?
- Thank you so much, Ms. Hong.

339
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,790
I didn't do it to be thanked.

340
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,880
I did it because it'll be a loss to us artists if Cheongsong closes down.

341
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,240
This is why you have to keep your promise about what you said just now.

342
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,470
Your promise that Cheongsong will continue to hold private exhibitions of my work,

343
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,470
next year, the year after that, and onwards.

344
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,180
It'll be our honor.

345
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,060
Ms. Hong! You're the best.

346
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,750
Oh, my, my! Let's hurry up.

347
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,220
Twenty-four hours isn't enough to set everything up before the opening.

348
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:51,930
Oh, right! What does the piece of trash from this morning do?

349
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,060
He made a mistake due to his ignorance in this field, but he's not a bad person.

350
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,150
On the contrary, he's someone that Cheongsong has to thank a lot for.

351
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:08,050
How funny. I asked what his occupation is,

352
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,480
not if he's a good person.

353
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,510
The harmony of the disharmonious... How intriguing.

354
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,120
Oh, my!

355
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,200
Hello, I'm Dondon F&B Director Jin Moo Hak's executive secretary.

356
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,510
You said... who?

357
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,590
Jang Tae Jin?

358
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,750
He said he'll meet with you whenever you have time.

359
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,020
Meet with me?

360
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,700
He said he wants to talk about Cheongsong's debt. My prediction was correct, don't you think?

361
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,200
What did you predict?

362
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,400
I told you last time.

363
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,650
How I think Century Group will pay you back.

364
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,420
Why would he?

365
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,820
He's head over heels!

366
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,140
He's going to flex with his money. Two billion is nothing for Century Group.

367
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,610
With his biggest roadblock, Director Kim Nak Chun gone,

368
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,890
it'll be a piece of cake and we won't have to worry about anything either.

369
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,890
Isn't it great news? When would you like to meet him?

370
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,580
The sooner the better, right? Like, tonight?

371
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,320
- I'm busy!
- Then, what about tomorrow night?

372
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,320
I'm busy tomorrow, too!

373
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,880
- Then, what about the day after tomorrow?
- I said I'm busy!

374
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,400
I have no time to meet that punk!

375
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,390
Also, if he wants to meet, tell him to come to me! How dare he order me around to come and go?

376
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,500
I have money too!

377
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,020
Still... This is a rare opportunity...

378
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,560
Understood, sir.

379
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,290
What's this?

380
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:14,300
It's from Ms. Hong's "The Living and The Dead" collection that you purchased, artwork Number 1.

381
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,120
Peek-a-boo

382
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,410
This is it? A keychain?

383
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,620
She said that the explanation of the piece, the process, and everything is in there.

384
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,960
She also said that, without your permission,

385
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,420
no one can show it in an exhibition, print it, or shoot it anywhere.

386
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,010
It means, now you're a collector, too.

387
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,460
Are you going to throw it away?

388
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,470
It's so expensive though.

389
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:33,790
I... I bought a piece of trash for one hundred million won!!

390
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,250
What's wrong with him?

391
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,470
You got a call. Aren't you going to pick it up?

392
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:50,430
- Who is it?
- 3,000 worth.

393
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,960
Oh, that's not right. 3,000 eons. Eons!

394
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,550
Jin Moo Hak speaking.

395
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,480
Leave it here!

396
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,330
I wanted to let you know that fortunately, the issue has been resolved. You must have been really worried.

397
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,290
Oh, yes. Well, yes...

398
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,630
You probably have a lot of other things to worry about. You didn't have to worry about me.

399
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,770
That makes me worried...

400
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,140
This shouldn't be here.

401
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,060
Good job. It's a little late but I'm sorry.

402
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,250
Will you be at the opening ceremony tomorrow?

403
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:45,130
I'll be there! I'll go even if it's the apocalypse, so wait for me.

404
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:57,030
I don't know what happened. I thought she would never change her mind back.

405
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:01,790
Oh, right. Do you think Ms. Hong will do the opening performance herself?

406
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,510
She probably will. There's not much time to find someone to do it.

407
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:09,480
Hey, mister! Why... Why is this inside here? Get out.

408
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,100
Ms. Hong, is everything okay?

409
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,570
It's all flat now!

410
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,530
♫ The prince came ♫

411
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,040
Leave it the way it is. Exactly the way it is!

412
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,680
- That's not it...
- I have a problem with the direction of the monitor.

413
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,280
- I did it exactly as the design plan said so.
- You saw it wrong.

414
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,760
That's not right.

415
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,860
Please align it straight to the line. Please.

416
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,560
- No, it's too close. Leave a little space.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

417
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,710
- Who's in charge of this one?
- Here.
- Hurry, please!

418
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,910
Please set only three glasses per table.

419
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,730
That way.

420
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:59,370
This has to change.

421
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:04,900
This one has to be slanted. Put everything back down again.

422
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:13,050
♫ The prince came just for Darling. Will Darling
fall in love with him? ♫

423
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:22,270
♫ Will Darling fall in love with... him? ♫

424
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,190
Director.

425
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,320
Are you all ready?

426
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,020
Yes.

427
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,910
Are the VIP's not here yet?

428
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,890
They've all said they received the invitation, so if they can't make it, they'll at least send someone else instead.

429
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,530
Don't worry too much.

430
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,250
It's going to go well. Even the fact that we're opening.

431
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,340
I honestly thought this wasn't even going to happen.

432
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,470
Yes... everyone's worked so hard since the director passed away.

433
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,630
It has to go well.

434
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,720
Nobody's here.

435
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,030
Did they even promote this?

436
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,140
- Why is nobody here?
- My gosh.

437
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,660
How can they become completely irrelevant so fast like this?

438
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,150
Doesn't something seem strange?

439
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,370
Let's just go home now. It's over anyway.

440
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,100
How could not a single person come?

441
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,880
At least that ignorant man could've come to fill up the space. He's never here when we need him.

442
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,340
Why is he nowhere to be found?

443
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,160
We can't just sit around.

444
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,570
Everyone, start making some calls.

445
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,350
Oh... Over there!

446
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,180
Everyone, go to your places!

447
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,510
Go on down.

448
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,410
Over here!

449
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,970
Hello.

450
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,520
Look over here, please!

451
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,190

Over here.

Look over here, please.

00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,970
Thank you.

457
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,920

469
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,510
♫ Heartbeat growing faster ♫

470
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,840
Lead them over there, please.

471
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,940
♫ Trust your instincts and run straight ahead ♫

472
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,350
Look over here, please!

473
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,600
Pose for us, please.

474
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,230
♫ Go forward, forward, straight ahead ♫

475
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,340
♫ Go forward, forward, straight ahead ♫

476
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,650
♫ I have no intention of stopping, moving ♫

477
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,870
♫ Yeah, gotta go for all of it ♫

478
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,070
♫ Go forward, forward, straight ahead ♫

479
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,220
♫ Go forward, forward, straight ahead ♫

480
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,400
♫ I have no intention of stopping, moving ♫

481
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,240
♫ Yeah, I need to go faster ♫

482
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,280
♫ Money and love are like water and fire ♫

483
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,650
Where are they all popping out from?

484
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,800
♫ I’m going to flip over ♫

485
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,830
♫ Those rules, kung fu ♫

486
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,400
Hey. Get me a straw.

487
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,600
Get me a straw!

488
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,950
Oh, over here.

489
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,100
This is artist Chae Jeong Hwa's piece.

490
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,370
If you take a look. You can see she used household items to make this...

491
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,750
♫ Go forward, forward, straight ahead ♫

492
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,830
This person's philosophy of art can be felt...

493
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,280
♫ I have no intention of stopping, moving ♫

494
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,810
♫ Yeah, gotta go for all of it ♫

495
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,100
It's Elris. Elris.

496
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,610
They're idols!

497
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,360
Ham Yeon Ji is here, too.

498
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,510
She probably has over a million followers.

499
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:18,440
But did we send an invite to Elris and Ms. Ham Yeon Ji?

500
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,380
- They probably got it from a friend.
- That's true.

501
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,130
There. Over there! I saw that person on TV. What's his name again?

502
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,860
- He's an actor!
- Oh, is he?

503
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,660
- He's not a singer?
- No.

504
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,040
We've never had an opening this fancy since I started working for the museum.

505
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,450
I guess the director's marketing really made an impact!

506
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,470
That's right!

507
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:40,630
I think it has more to do with director Jang Tae Jin's influence.

508
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,450
Not only is he young, handsome, and he's also most likely going to inherit Century Group...

509
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,090
and now he's divorced, too.

510
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:51,400
He's not just a coveted target for big companies but also for those with daughters.

511
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,450
All right.

512
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,390
There she goes again.

513
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,620
- Should we go say hi to her?
- Let's go.

514
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,170
- Hello!
- Hello.

515
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,650
We're curators at Cheongsong Art Museum.

516
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,930
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

517
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,820
- It's really fun–
- You're so pretty.

518
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,330
- Thank you!
- You're filming!

519
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,110
Hello, everyone!

520
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,780
Yes, hello!

521
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,410
I thought you were going abroad for a business trip, how did you make time?

522
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,700
It got pushed to next week.

523
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,830
It got pushed because of them.

524
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,660
Don't tell me you're thinking it was because of you.

525
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,570
I wasn't.

526
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:38,410
No matter how crazy I am about you, I know how to distinguish between public and private matters.

527
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,040
Let's go over there. They're the people we'll be dealing with in the future.

528
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,620
You have to leave an impression.

529
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,160
- Chairman Choi.
- Oh, hi!

530
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,530
"We"?

531
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,260
This is Kim Dali, the new director.

532
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,630
This is C&C Venture's Chairman Choi Yeong Man and his wife.

533
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,810
Thank you for coming.

534
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:10,270
They're well-versed in the arts and culture, so they'll support you generously.

535
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:16,050
Oh, my. You threatened to never see me again if I didn't attend this. Now you want my money, too?

536
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,480
This guy... he's just a shameless thief!

537
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,740
He's not a shameless thief, he's a romantic.

538
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,180
I heard you even postponed your business trip back to make it here.

539
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,780
Pardon?

540
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,540
Oh, that's not it. It wasn't me who postponed it, they did.

541
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,930
- It was due to a situation over there.
- Oh, my...

542
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:37,400
It seems like I made a mistake.

543
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,700
Chairman Kim!

544
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,310
Luxe Hotel's Chairman Kim is here. We're going to go greet them.

545
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,350
Let's go, Dali.

546
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,990
Chairman!

547
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,760
What are you doing?

548
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,750
This is Director Kim.

549
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,360
This is Luxe Hotel's Chairman Kim. Have you been enjoying your time?

550
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,210
Yes.

551
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,810
He's here.

552
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,460
Why? No, seriously. Why?

553
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:33,000
Since when did our family visit exhibitions at art museums? Why are you all here?

554
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,840
How can we not check on them when we loaned them so much money!

555
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,340
Also... We have to start getting used to going to parties.

556
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,610
I told you it's not a party, it's an opening event.

557
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:47,280
It's an opening ceremony? Not a party?

558
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,840
Who cares if it's an event or party, as long as we make connections here?

559
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,590
I saw on their social media that a lot of big names are here today, Father.

560
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,970
Even Century Group's successor is here, too.

561
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,720
It's good we're here.

562
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,690
We're already late, so why don't we get going.

563
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,660
Like I said! Pretend like you don't know me once we go inside, okay?

564
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,160
We're not a team, all right?

565
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,760
Let's go.

566
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,360
I just arrived.

567
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,940
I already told you. I clean up after my own shit.

568
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,160
I said I got it.

569
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,800
Which piece is it?

570
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,410
The opening event...

571
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,370
Yes, I see.

572
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,630
How's work going for you?

573
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,260
- You saw it at the exhibition, right?
- Yes.

574
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,890
What did you think?

575
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,770
♫ Like I'm dreaming ♫

576
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,890
What the...?

577
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,740
Why are you so late? I was waiting for you.

578
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,970
Chak Hee? Why are you here?

579
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,340
Why else would gallerist come to an exhibition? Why wouldn't I be here?

580
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,730
Oh, right. You said you work at a gallery.

581
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,710
Look at me.

582
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,470
What are you doing?

583
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,120
Stay still, I have to introduce you to someone.

584
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,640
Introduce? Who?

585
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,720
This is great.

586
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,510
♫ Just smile for me ♫

587
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:29,600
♫ Never going to let you go I swear to you that some day ♫

588
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,390
♫ I promise you, only you ♫

589
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,920
I'll see you all later.

590
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,680
Yes, all right.

591
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,660
This is Kim...

592
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,320
Hold on.

593
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,970
♫ Never going to let you go ♫

594
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,000
That...

595
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,090
You know you look the best when you're not speaking, right?

596
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,350
Stop it. What are you doing?

597
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,190
Just say "hello" and nothing else. I'll take care of everything.

598
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,210
Let's go.

599
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,990
Where–? Where are we going?

600
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,790
Come on!

601
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,200
Where did he go?

602
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,030
Oh, thanks.

603
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,820
How do you hit the driver so well?

604
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,970
Dad!

605
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:42,140
Yes, Chak Hee!

606
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,790
I'm Ahn Sang Tae, who works hard 365 days in good condition.

607
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,450
But who is this?

608
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,770
- I'm Jin Moo Hak–
- You know the company,

609
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:57,220
Dondon F&B. They give you a lot of financial support for your political campaigns.

610
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,560
Hello, Congressman.

611
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,060
This is my father.

612
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,600
Oh, hello. It's an honor to meet you.

613
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,660
You little!!

614
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,320
Excuse me.

615
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,840
Thank you.

616
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,970
Mr. Jin Moo Hak.

617
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,120
What is it?

618
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,930
I'm Jang Tae Jin from Century Group.

619
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,460
I contacted you to meet up but you refused.

620
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,830
Your reporting system is a mess, I see.

621
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:15,050
I didn't refuse to meet you,

622
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,420
but it's a rule for the person who has business to discuss to go meet the other,

623
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,060
not arrogantly request for the other to go meet them.

624
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,340
That's what I said.

625
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,010
I was trying to be considerate of your time.

626
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:31,490
I'll apologize if you were offended.

627
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:33,180
"Considerate"?

628
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,150
If you say so. Anyways, do you have something to discuss with me?

629
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,570
I heard that my Dali owes you a debt.

630
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,200
I should've taken care of it sooner.

631
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,040
But the two of us had some personal issues,

632
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,530
so it's been delayed until now.

633
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,120
The two of them?

634
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,160
Personal?

635
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,060
So, what?

636
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,450
"So, what"?

637
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:08,250
So... I'll pay back the debt that Cheongsong owes you.

638
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:16,400
What gives you the right? Huh?

639
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,510
What gives you the right to butt into what's between me and Kim Dali.

640
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:24,330
I can no longer stand back and watch her being surrounded and harassed by people like you.

641
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,550
Men with tattoos lying down on the art museum's floor,

642
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:32,800
ruining artworks, and chasing her around while watching her every move.

643
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,590
She's grown up her entire life surrounded by only books and artworks.

644
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:39,320
She's different from you.

645
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,370
She may not show it because she has a strong sense of duty and responsibility.

646
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,930
But can't you see...

647
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,540
how much she's struggling? You should stop here.

648
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,590
Did Kim Dali say that?

649
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,120
That she's struggling because of me?

650
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,430
That's not what she said to me.

651
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,770
Also, Kim Dali...

652
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:05,340
She's not as weak as you think.

653
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,760
Can't you see? That she's doing well?

654
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,070
Why are you making a smart woman like her out to be an idiot?

655
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,850
All you have is your money to show.

656
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,680
Also, when someone's being this nosy,

657
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,170
it's not out of goodwill, it's because there's a purpose.

658
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:36,570
What? Is it not going as planned, Jang Tae Jin?

659
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,580
Yes, hello?

660
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,550
All right, I got it. I'm going now.

661
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,320
I'm a little busy.

662
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,430
I thought you liked money.

663
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,440
All you need is your money, isn't that right?

664
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,450
You're right, I'm obsessed with money.

665
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:14,300
But I don't take free money. It makes me sick.

666
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,400
This is Hong Ja Yeong's third piece from her "The Living and The Dead" series.

667
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,410
As you can see, the piece is made of waste that only the living can generate,

668
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,150
that is, trash.

669
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:40,190
The dead can no longer create trash.

670
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,780
Is it a good thing to be alive?

671
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:48,880
Is it a terrible thing to die?

672
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:55,060
What is the difference between living and dying?

673
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:00,850
The artist learned about her mother's death one month after she passed.

674
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:06,690
Her mother requested that her daughter, who was preparing for an important exhibition, should not be bothered.

675
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:11,280
During that one month, to the artist, was her mother, "the living"

676
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,590
or "the dead"?

677
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:24,140
This piece was made so that people can experience it personally and think about questions like this.

678
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:30,080
What the hell is going on? This crazy punk!

679
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,460
Why the hell are you doing in the coffin?

680
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,460
What game are you trying to play?

681
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,200
Why are you trying to kill me, you punk!

682
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,370
- What's wrong with you? It's supposed to be like this. The artist told me to do this.
- You liar!

683
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:48,140
He's telling the truth. This is part of the piece directed as the artist intended.

684
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,400
She personally chose a special model for today.

685
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:56,100
But starting tomorrow, those who apply in advance will be given a chance to experience it themselves.

686
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,050
Oh...

687
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,920
Shall we move on to the next piece?

688
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,540
Let's go.

689
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,240
Let's go.

690
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:32,740
What? What? I'm doing art.

691
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,440
I thought nobody was going to come, but they all came happily!

692
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,550
Curator Song was so excited when she saw KNK!

693
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:53,350
What about you? I saw everything!

694
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:58,230
I thought we weren't going to have a model because she changed the piece last minute.

695
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:02,400
Me too. I was shocked when I saw that guy was the model.

696
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,880
He didn't seem like someone who'd do that.

697
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,990
He's just cleaning up his mess. That's the least he could do.

698
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:10,910
Man... Curator Song...

699
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,270
Oh, what about the director?

700
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:16,480
She told us to go first.

701
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,490
This is the first exhibition she had since her father passed away.

702
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:27,520
Even though it was chaotic like today, I was still reminded of the director from time to time.

703
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,590
It must've been worse for the daughter.

704
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:25,320
♫ The moment I saw you walk in my life ♫

705
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:31,700
♫ I was happy to have you here ♫

706
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,910
♫ The scent of you near beside me ♫

707
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:45,190
♫ And every smile you shared, I was happy just to be with. U hoo hoo ♫

708
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:48,860
Daddy! Daddy!

709
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:56,100
♫ Anything just to be with you ♫

710
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,710
I told you that the art museum is a scared chatterbox, right?

711
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:03,290
It has a lot to say but it's too scared.

712
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:07,010
So you have to walk quietly,

713
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:11,610
and listen carefully to what it wants to say.

714
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:17,280
♫ The warmth from your eyes. Each second we spent ♫

715
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,300
♫ Each time that I called your name ♫

716
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:30,820
♫ I can still feel you near beside me and every bit of you ♫

717
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:35,690
♫ My life was brighter just by knowing ♫

718
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:41,300
♫ U hoo hoo U hoo hoo ♫

719
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:47,960
♫ Yeah U hoo hoo, I would do anything for you ♫

720
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,170
♫ U hoo hoo ♫

721
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,370
Mr. Jin.

722
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,020
Look here. It's cut here, right?

723
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,790
What a crybaby.

724
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:47,680
No, I'm not. Didn't you hear that loud sound earlier?

725
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,890
The moment everything became white... it's more dangerous not to bleed at times like this.

726
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,490
Let me see.

727
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:58,640
Do you feel nauseous or dizzy?

728
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,310
Or do you feel sick?

729
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:03,510
Do I?

730
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:10,360
♫ A... B, C, D... E, F, G... H, I, J ♫

731
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,880
♫ K, L, M, N, O, P ♫

732
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:21,420
♫ Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z ♫

733
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,860
♫ A, B, C ♫

734
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:27,570
Anyway, did you go too far?

735
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:31,680
You put me in a coffin and forgot about me.

736
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,410
Who knew you would fall asleep in a coffin?

737
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,550
Seriously?

738
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,490
I'm sorry.

739
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,140
You must have used good wine.

740
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:47,050
I always do this when I drink expensive alcohol.

741
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,050
You worked hard. It was hard, right?

742
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,290
I mean, well...

743
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,010
It was better than I thought.

744
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:06,880
The truth is, the thought of going in the coffin was uncomfortable.

745
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,180
It's cold, dark,

746
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,550
damp, and scary.

747
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:20,900
But when I actually laid down,

748
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:26,370
it was warm, soft,

749
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,510
and cozy.

750
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:33,190
I don't know if you sprayed perfume, but it smelled good.

751
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:40,300
Should I say that it put my mind at ease?

752
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:47,010
It comforted me.

753
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:56,350
My mom died on a particularly cold day.

754
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,670
I'm being thoughtless.

755
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:15,850
Doing this in front of someone who was mourning not long ago... I'm sorry.

756
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:22,830
Can I ask how old you were when she passed away?

757
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:28,080
It's not some kind of big secret. She died when I was ten years old.

758
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,800
You must have been heartbroken.

759
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:38,150
If she could see that you grew up so wonderful like this, she would be happy.

760
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,590
No.

761
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:45,300
I hope that doesn't happen.

762
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:54,030
People say that, because they have a soul, they will watch over you,

763
00:56:54,030 --> 00:57:00,860
become stars and protect you, and say that we will meet again someday,

764
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,090
but I wish death was the end.

765
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:12,510
Just as it means, the end. Just the end.

766
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,620
That's what I hope.

767
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,710
My mom...

768
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:27,500
was really sick.

769
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:34,680
She suffered throughout her life

770
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:44,080
and I remember her being sick every day.

771
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,500
Her body ached

772
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:57,910
and her heart ached because I would be growing up without a mother.

773
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:05,000
The strawberries are washed.

774
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:14,290
Eat this.

775
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,450
Come on, eat it.

776
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,220
Did you eat?

777
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,370
Yes.

778
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:27,090
Don't go skipping meals. Okay?

779
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:34,030
You have to make sure to eat even if I'm not here.

780
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:36,140
Okay?

781
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,040
Eat.

782
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,510
Of all days,

783
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,580
why did she have to die on the coldest day?

784
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:22,030
The ground was frozen

785
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,150
while burying her coffin,

786
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,320
so the workers cursed so much...

787
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,860
How can a person's life be without even a ray of sunshine?

788
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:51,280
It should have been enough that she suffered that much.

789
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,330
Why should she have to worry about me after she passes?

790
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,460
Let's go now.

791
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,440
I'm sure she was watching over you,

792
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,690
all this time, growing up.

793
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:20,920
Without missing a single moment, cheering and worrying.

794
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:27,680
She would be happy that you grew up to be this wonderful

795
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:30,310
and without going down the wrong path.

796
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:34,130
♫ Come close to me ♫

797
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:41,590
♫ Stay by my side with love ♫

798
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:48,750
♫ Everything in the world is ♫

799
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:53,760
♫ Beautifully colored in pink ♫

800
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,840
♫ This feeling is getting deeper ♫

801
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:05,280
♫ It's strange how we met ♫

802
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:12,580
♫ How did I fall in love at first sight? ♫

803
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:16,770
♫ It must be a fate ♫

804
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:20,250
♫ That is not easy to explain ♫

805
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:29,510
♫ I'm the only one for you. I'll give you this love ♫

806
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:43,960
♫ Like calm music, it keeps lingering ♫

807
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:51,380
♫ I kept wanting to listen to your shy voice ♫

808
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:57,260
♫ Do you know how anxious I feel? ♫

809
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:00,110
♫ As if today is the last day... ♫

810
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:04,380

~ Preview ~

811
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:08,540
We can't do that. Kiss café at the art museum?

812
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:09,920
Why did I do that?

813
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,800
We can't ignore how important the opening is.

814
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,600
You are truly our art museum's lucky charm.

815
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,200
What? How did you know this was my house?

816
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:22,230
If your dog pooped, then you should clean it!

817
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:25,600
- What?
- Sir, please start driving. Go.

818
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:29,580
I never forgot about you. Let's get back together.

819
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:33,490
A mistake? I never make a mistake when it comes to my mouth.

820
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:38,100
♫ I'll give you this love ♫
