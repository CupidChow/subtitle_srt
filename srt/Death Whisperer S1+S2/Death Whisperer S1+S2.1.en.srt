1
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,333
This movie was made for entertainment,

2
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,833
inspired by real events
from the "Krittanont" story.

3
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:27,333
All names, characters, behaviors,
and incidents are all fictional.

4
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:30,833
The depiction of any cultures
or individuals in this story

5
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:34,375
is not intended
to be derogatory or offensive.

6
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,542
KANCHANABURI, 1972

7
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,125
Shallots sell well this year.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,208
Almost ten baht per kilogram.

9
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,583
Any rate is good
as long as we can make some money.

10
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:47,833
So we can pay for the cure.

11
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,292
I wish things could go back
to how they were.

12
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,125
She's getting better.

13
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:56,792
You see,

14
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,833
she's even up and about sometimes.

15
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,583
But mostly bedridden.

16
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,833
We have to check if she's still breathing.

17
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:13,208
Her symptoms are just as they described.

18
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,625
You shouldn't overthink...

19
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:24,708
Dad! Mom!

20
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,792
Dad! Mom!

21
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:32,417
Nart!

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,250
Nart!

23
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:40,833
Nart!

24
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,458
- Nart.
- Dad!

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,750
- Nart! I'm here.
- Mom!

26
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:46,792
Hang in there.

27
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,458
- We're coming.
- Dad!

28
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,292
Nart.

29
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,000
Dad! Mom!

30
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,500
- Nart.
- What happened?

31
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,208
- Are you hurt?
- Mom.

32
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,083
Nart, how do you feel?

33
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:01,792
Where does it hurt?

34
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:03,958
My stomach…

35
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,333
My stomach!

36
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:10,708
What should we do?

37
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:19,875
Nart!

38
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,083
- Nart!
- What's happening to her?

39
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:30,500
Nart!

40
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,542
Nart!

41
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,375
Nart!

42
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,167
Nart!

43
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,875
What's happening to her?

44
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,167
- Nart! Nart!
- Nart.

45
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,042
- Nart!
- Nart!

46
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:03,667
DEATH WHISPERER

47
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,250
Shoot!

48
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,542
Mom, have you seen my watering can?

49
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,667
You woke up pretty late.

50
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,000
Luckily Dad isn't home,
or he would've made such a fuss.

51
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:29,292
Sis.

52
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,833
I already did it for you.

53
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:34,792
Thanks a bunch.

54
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:40,292
Let me help.

55
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,083
Come straight home after school.

56
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,625
Your father's going to take us to a fair.

57
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,125
- A fair!
- Yeah!

58
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,750
They sell cotton candy too.

59
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:58,667
That's a big no for your sister.
Her teeth will rot.

60
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,875
Mom, when will Yak come home?

61
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,708
Probably in a day or two,
he said so in his letter.

62
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,542
Isn't it strange, though?

63
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,792
He begged to be a soldier.

64
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,917
Why did he suddenly agree to come back?

65
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,083
Go take a shower.
You don't want to be late.

66
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,083
I said, "Go take a shower."

67
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,833
Run!

68
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,792
These girls!

69
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,875
Hurry up.

70
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,958
Oh, shoot!

71
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:44,458
I forgot to tell Mom
that I have cleaning duty after school.

72
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:45,458
It's the last day.

73
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:48,458
Classes will probably end early.
Don't worry, sis.

74
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:49,625
You think so?

75
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,667
Mom won't let me have cotton candy.

76
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,667
Will you buy it for me?

77
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,875
Aww, don't be so sad.

78
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:16,208
Come on. Let's race to the bus.

79
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,125
Last one there has to buy snacks.

80
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,625
- Go!
- Look at her go.

81
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:22,875
Hey!

82
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,708
Wait for me!

83
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:28,917
Wait up.

84
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:30,667
I want rice crispies.

85
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,292
You owe me for this morning.

86
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,167
No problem.
You can have as much as you want.

87
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:37,292
You're the best sister.

88
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,125
You sure are happy today.

89
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,292
Yee, what are you looking at?

90
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Let's go.

91
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,792
CLASS 3-A

92
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,958
I'll take the trash out.

93
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,625
Yam?

94
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,917
Get off the chair.

95
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:51,208
Whose desk is this?
Why would they draw such scary things?

96
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,625
Look, sis.

97
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,792
There's more.

98
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,625
"Nart."

99
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,750
The one with the mysterious death?

100
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,333
Let's go, Yee must be waiting.

101
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,917
KANCHANABURI - DAN MAKHAM TIA

102
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:05,708
Yam.

103
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,542
Come on, Yod! That's so not funny!

104
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,583
You'll give Yam a heart attack.
You know she's easily spooked.

105
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:21,083
Even malaria couldn't kill her.

106
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,417
You're the one who screamed the loudest.

107
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,333
Shut it!

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,708
I came all the way in this cold
to pick you up.

109
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:31,083
Is this how you repay me? Right, Yee?

110
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:34,250
Why are you picking us up?
Just came back from the farm?

111
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,333
Come on. Dad is waiting.

112
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:40,708
Let's go.

113
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,167
Come on, Yee.

114
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,208
Yad.

115
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:53,542
- Yeah?
- Hurry up.

116
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,625
I need more manpower, Mun.

117
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,542
There is one plot left to harvest.

118
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,875
Should be done in a couple of days.

119
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,875
It's five kilometers from here.

120
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,500
You can build a shack there.

121
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,167
I do daily pick-ups and drop-offs.

122
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,958
Why are you back this late?

123
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,542
Where have you guys been?

124
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,375
- They told me...
- I didn't ask you.

125
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,750
I had cleaning duty,
so we caught the last bus.

126
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,667
It took a while to drop us off.

127
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,125
If you leave home early,
you should be back by evening.

128
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,042
Not this late.

129
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,542
If this happens again,

130
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,375
I'll have you drop out of school
and help me at the farm.

131
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,167
Yod and Yad can go pump water
into the farm, Dad.

132
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,042
We don't want to be late for the fair.

133
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,500
So, where was I?

134
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,167
You haven't given me a date.
How soon do you want it?

135
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,250
Thanks, Mun.

136
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:22,708
<i>Please protect our family from illness
and all things sinister and foul.</i>

137
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:23,917
<i>Amen.</i>

138
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,458
What's wrong?

139
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,083
Your prayer was unusually short.

140
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:39,542
I was just wondering why.

141
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:43,417
And no one in our family is ill.

142
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,333
Come on,
let's go if we're all done praying.

143
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,000
Let's quickly go over there!

144
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,625
- Look!
- Be careful.

145
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,542
- You want some?
- Yes!

146
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,583
Cotton candy?

147
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,958
My cotton candy! Let's go.

148
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,792
Hey, wait up!

149
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:26,583
Here she comes.

150
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,000
Hello, cutie.

151
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,083
Here.

152
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,167
Don't ever run off like that again, okay?

153
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,333
What's wrong?

154
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:48,958
You're warm.

155
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:51,708
You probably caught a cold.
I'll go tell Mom.

156
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,542
No, sis. Don't tell Mom.

157
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,667
I don't want to miss the Ferris wheel.

158
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,542
It's windy up there. You'll feel worse.

159
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,750
Please.

160
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,583
Just this once.

161
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,375
If I miss it,
there might not be a next time.

162
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,583
Fine.

163
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,875
I'll tell Mom when we come down, okay?

164
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,875
Hey, Yad.

165
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,583
Let's go on the Ferris wheel
before they catch up to us.

166
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:23,583
Who are "they"?

167
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:24,917
Zip it.

168
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,583
Nothing. Come on.

169
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:28,583
What?

170
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,458
HAUNTED HOUSE

171
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,667
Look at that!

172
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,125
Look! The people down there are so tiny.

173
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,958
Yeah. So tiny.

174
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,125
Let's look around.

175
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,083
Isn't it beautiful?

176
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,208
Yes, it is!

177
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,667
I'm so happy being up here with you two.

178
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,625
I wish Yak was here.

179
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,833
It's great spending time as a family.

180
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,875
Even though we always quarrel
when we're together.

181
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,875
Look at those stalls.

182
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,500
- Be careful.
- Sis!

183
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,125
What's wrong?

184
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,167
There's an old woman pointing at me.

185
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,083
Thank you.

186
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,208
What's wrong?

187
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:16,417
Not having fun?

188
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh, Yee.

189
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,542
Are you okay, Yam?

190
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,042
I saw her too.

191
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,750
She was very creepy.

192
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,917
I don't see any old woman.

193
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,000
Are you all right, Yam?

194
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,333
She caught a cold,
probably from the breeze.

195
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:55,792
There she goes again.

196
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,542
She always gets sick when we go out.

197
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,083
Let's all go home and get some rest.

198
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,625
Let Yos take her
to the health center tomorrow.

199
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,417
Come on, dear. Let's go.

200
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,958
How could they say you're fine?

201
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:16,875
You're so pale.

202
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:33,958
Hey! How did you get here?

203
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,458
Yak!

204
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,208
Go sit in the back.

205
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:41,708
Are you sick, Yam?

206
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,458
I'm fine.

207
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,250
The doctor said it's only fatigue.

208
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,000
They gave me these supplements.

209
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,667
Since we're here,
shall we stop by the market?

210
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,000
- Then I can buy...
- You are a grown-up now.

211
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,458
And all you do is fool around.

212
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,625
I'll take that as an "I miss you too."

213
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,458
Sorry, I haven't driven in a while
so I'm a bit rusty.

214
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,542
Right?

215
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:45,625
Pull over.

216
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,333
Now. It's cramped in here.
I'll sit in the back.

217
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:51,625
Come on. It's dusty outside.
Just sit with me.

218
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,542
You care about me now?
Are you feeling okay?

219
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,917
Here. For you and Yod.

220
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,250
I don't want it. Give it to Yod yourself.

221
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,292
Playing hard to get, huh?

222
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,000
Fine, use it when you stop hating me.

223
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,792
Hey, Yak's home!

224
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,417
Hey, Yod.

225
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,833
A little souvenir.

226
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,667
Wow!

227
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:54,875
Cool.

228
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,667
Yak! Hey, Yak!

229
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,292
Hello there.

230
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,500
Wow! You've gotten so big!

231
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,000
I got you souvenir.
It's in the medicine bag.

232
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:09,917
Really?

233
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,042
Don't let Dad see it. We'll get an earful.

234
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,208
You go get some rest, Yam.

235
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,875
Let's go.

236
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:16,958
- Come.
- Let's go.

237
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Follow me.

238
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,417
- Yak.
- Mom. Dad.

239
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
How are you?

240
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,417
How come you're here
with your brother and sister?

241
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,958
Met them at the health center?

242
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:40,292
Singh picked me up from the terminal.

243
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:43,542
Then I met Yod and Yam,
so I drove with them.

244
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:46,125
Took you long enough.

245
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,125
Harvest season is almost over.

246
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,333
Tomorrow, we will leave at dawn.

247
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:53,125
You have a lot to catch up on.

248
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,750
Who says I'm here to help?

249
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,958
I'm just staying for a night.

250
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,208
I'm kidding, Dad.

251
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:04,917
You little bastard!

252
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,917
- Let's go, Mom.
- Come on. Let's talk inside, dear.

253
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,208
Dad bought fried sun-dried beef for you.

254
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:11,708
I bought it for myself.

255
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,500
What? You're kidding!

256
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,583
Made it just in time.

257
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,417
Looks delicious, Mom,
especially the beef...

258
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,375
You've been out all day
and come home reeking of alcohol.

259
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,792
What's up with you?

260
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:40,958
Well, if I smell of alcohol,
that means I went for a drink, Dad.

261
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:42,042
What an odd question.

262
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:48,542
- You meet friends on your first day back?
- Should I invite them over then?

263
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,333
- Yak!
- Sorry, sir!

264
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,500
Come on. Let him eat first.

265
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,667
You always take his side.

266
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,208
Now he's a spoiled brat.

267
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:04,875
Don't be upset. Here, it's your favorite.
Bean sprouts with tofu.

268
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:08,542
You left us to become a soldier,
and we work our asses off here.

269
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,958
I thought
they would've taught you discipline.

270
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:12,750
Stop it, Yos.

271
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,750
- He's your big bro.
- Big bro my ass!

272
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:21,375
Yak, the souvenir you got me is awesome.

273
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:26,792
What you got me is also cool.

274
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,708
I love how my tongue changes color
when I eat it.

275
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,250
A color-changing snack?

276
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,000
Stop buying her those weird things.

277
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,083
Come on, Dad. It's nothing to worry about.

278
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:43,125
Don't be so strict with them.
Let them go wild sometimes.

279
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,708
You don't want them to become shut-ins

280
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,500
and frown all day
like a constipated person.

281
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,042
- What did you say?
- You prick!

282
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,917
He's not directing it at anyone.
Don't get mad.

283
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,542
Eat up, Dad.

284
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,458
Have some eggplant.

285
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,208
Sis, I've got a headache.
Can you please take me to bed?

286
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,458
You're so frail.

287
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,333
What are we gonna do with you?

288
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:44,750
Dad forgot to light the candles?

289
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,375
Yam?

290
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:13,250
What are you doing?

291
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,083
I'm hungry.

292
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,458
Yam, what did you just eat?

293
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:14,583
I didn't see you heat anything up.

294
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:50,375
You can't just quit like this, Mun.

295
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:55,792
Tell me straight up
if you need more money.

296
00:28:57,125 --> 00:29:01,958
I swear on my mother's life,
this has nothing to do with money.

297
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,167
That's all I can say.

298
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,833
If it's not money, then what is it about?

299
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,083
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me anyway.

300
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:16,625
Gosh! What do you want me to say?!

301
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:17,542
I'm done!

302
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,917
It's such nonsense. Who would believe it?

303
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Hey, Dad.

304
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,208
Let me talk to him.

305
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Here.

306
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,875
Let me.

307
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,083
So, are you feeling better?

308
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:47,833
I'm sorry.

309
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:52,458
I don't care who stays,
but I can't do this anymore.

310
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,625
I won't try to change your mind,

311
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,167
but tell me what happened.

312
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,542
I don't want to talk about it.

313
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:07,667
Why not?

314
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:12,208
Can someone take me to the farm?

315
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:16,917
I'll hurry and finish all the work today.

316
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:23,875
And as for you…

317
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:28,667
keep an eye out for your family.

318
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:41,875
Go pump water into the farm,
then come help me in the kitchen.

319
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,458
We can't rely on the workers.

320
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,583
It's just you, Yod and I now.

321
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,792
Let's finish the work today.

322
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,708
Dad will calm down if we can pull it off.

323
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,542
He's just worried
no one will pack and dry the shallots.

324
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,208
Let's go.

325
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,000
You're up. How are you feeling?

326
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:43,250
The weather's nice today.
Shall we go for a walk?

327
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:45,792
No.

328
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:56,083
Come give me a massage, bitch.

329
00:31:57,167 --> 00:32:00,667
How can you say that?
You can't talk to her like that.

330
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,875
Get out of my face. Piss off!

331
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,792
That's enough!

332
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,250
What's all the ruckus?

333
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,583
I can even hear you from outside.

334
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:13,875
- Mom...
- Mom.

335
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:16,042
Sis is forcing me to go outside.

336
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:19,167
I told her I'm not feeling well.
I don't want to go out.

337
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,917
But she won't listen.

338
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
She wants me to sneak out
before Dad comes home.

339
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,042
I didn't say that.

340
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,583
You asked me to go out, didn't you?

341
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:34,417
Then she yelled
and got furious when I refused to go.

342
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,583
That's not true, Mom.

343
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,708
- She said something mean to me.
- Enough.

344
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,250
Why can't you be nice to each other?

345
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,625
You want your sister to sneak out
while she's sick?

346
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:47,417
That's not okay.

347
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,042
Why are you here?

348
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,000
Yam is asleep…

349
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,708
so I sneaked out.

350
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:39,083
Would it be okay

351
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,292
if I slept with you tonight?

352
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,083
Is something wrong?

353
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,750
When I woke up last night,

354
00:33:56,833 --> 00:34:00,000
Yam had turned around
and she was staring right at me.

355
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:07,042
And her expression was scary.

356
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:10,833
It was like this…

357
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:24,167
That's enough!

358
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,750
I get it.

359
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,125
You can sleep with me tonight.

360
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,500
Now, wash your hands
and go help Mom in the kitchen.

361
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,292
Are you still mad at me?

362
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:04,250
I know Yam is acting strange.

363
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,833
Don't mind her. You know she's sick.

364
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:09,792
One minute she's fine,
and the next, she's sick again.

365
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:10,958
She's also aggressive.

366
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,750
It's like she's not herself.

367
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,875
How can she be anyone else?
Stop talking nonsense.

368
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:20,167
But, Mom…

369
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:25,625
Come on.

370
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:35,875
Do you really have to go?

371
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,333
Can't you stay here?

372
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:41,375
It's just one night. Don't be so dramatic.

373
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,833
Look after the house and your sisters.

374
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:57,125
- Make sure Yam is eating well, okay?
- Okay.

375
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,167
We finished all the work, Dad.
I already dropped off the workers.

376
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,250
Good.

377
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,083
Let's go, honey.

378
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,292
Tell me, when I was away,

379
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,417
did anything weird happen?

380
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:38,333
What kind of question is that?

381
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:40,292
You're scaring me.

382
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:41,375
Really?

383
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:42,792
You idiot!

384
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,750
Didn't you see Mun's face?

385
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,750
This is not a joke, Yod.

386
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,750
You got anything to say, Yos?

387
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:06,625
The doctor said Yam was fine.

388
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:13,792
But she's obviously getting worse,
not better.

389
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:19,917
Have you noticed anything else?

390
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,292
- Yes.
- Whoa!

391
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,542
- How long have you been here?
- Since the beginning.

392
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,750
I heard strange noises.

393
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:37,292
What noises?

394
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,750
I couldn't make it out.

395
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,083
It was a woman's voice.

396
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:46,792
An eerie, high-pitched whispering
in the middle of the night.

397
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,208
I haven't heard anything.

398
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,708
Maybe it's the wind?
You know how windy it gets at night.

399
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,792
It wasn't.

400
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,333
Didn't you hear anything, Yak?

401
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:18,583
It's me.

402
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:23,458
- Yak?
- Yes.

403
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:27,042
What are you doing out here
alone in the dark?

404
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,333
Nothing.

405
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:31,750
Just thinking about something.

406
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:35,208
Well, I'm going for a shower.

407
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:38,833
That noise you said you heard…

408
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:52,667
I didn't hear it.

409
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:57,875
Let's forget about it, Yak.
Maybe I was just dreaming.

410
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,833
But Mun said he heard it.

411
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:02,333
Really?

412
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,625
Did he know what it was?

413
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:12,125
He wouldn't tell.
He only said, "It's back."

414
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,375
Yak,

415
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,708
do you think
it has anything to do with Yam?

416
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,375
- You should go shower.
- What?

417
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,875
I'll wait here, just in case.

418
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,125
Okay.

419
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:40,875
Yam?

420
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,583
Yak?

421
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:53,625
Yak!

422
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:57,875
Yod! Yos!

423
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:04,167
Yee!

424
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,375
- Yee!
- Sis!

425
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:09,458
Sis!

426
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,458
It's all right. I'm here now.

427
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,625
Son of a bitch!
What did you do to my sister?

428
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:29,000
I need to go look for Yam.
You wait here, okay?

429
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,375
No, please!

430
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:38,667
Don't go, I'm scared.

431
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
All right.

432
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:45,125
Come on.

433
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:48,292
Be careful, okay?

434
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:01,875
I don't know what's happening outside.

435
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:03,167
It could be a thief.

436
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,667
Hide in here, you'll be safe.

437
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,208
No, I don't want to.

438
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,458
Don't you want me to find Yam?

439
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:16,333
Are you more afraid
of hiding in the dark closet

440
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:17,750
or of losing Yam?

441
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:32,667
Sis…

442
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,958
Hurry back, okay?

443
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:49,292
Yak!

444
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,083
Why did you come out?

445
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:53,625
Is it a thief?

446
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:56,333
I can't find Yam. She's missing!

447
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:59,250
Get inside! Listen, Yad, get inside!

448
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:03,208
Yod, Yam is missing. I can't find her!

449
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,042
Anything?

450
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:08,583
No!

451
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,292
There! Is that Yam?

452
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,042
Yak!

453
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:25,542
Yak, you didn't shoot Yam, did you?

454
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:27,417
Tell me, you didn't shoot her!

455
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,667
- Yam!
- Get inside!

456
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,542
- Yak.
- Shut the door and light all the lamps.

457
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:35,208
Listen to me. You need to get inside. Go!

458
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:53,250
I told her to hide in the closet
before I went out.

459
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:54,333
It's okay.

460
00:43:58,458 --> 00:43:59,458
Come here.

461
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,833
Hey, how are you feeling?

462
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:18,042
My stomach hurts.

463
00:44:25,542 --> 00:44:26,583
What happened?

464
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,750
Nothing. You should get some rest.

465
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,333
Look after her.

466
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:58,458
Stay with her, okay?
I'll light up the lamp for you.

467
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,417
What on earth just happened?

468
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:24,458
Come on, be honest with me.

469
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,875
She's my sister too, you know.

470
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:35,875
<i>You two are such lightweights.</i>

471
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:42,958
I'm gone for a few years,
and you've forgotten how to drink?

472
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,750
Huh? Here.

473
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:49,667
You even bully us when we're drinking?

474
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,458
Fuck you.

475
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,292
I didn't have time to drink.

476
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:56,750
I had to do extra work because of you.

477
00:45:57,875 --> 00:46:00,125
For a big brother, you're such a dick.

478
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,250
You're drunk.

479
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:04,375
I'll let it slide.

480
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:07,958
When you're sober,
I'm gonna kick you in the face.

481
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:20,833
It's just us. Let's drink all night.

482
00:46:22,417 --> 00:46:26,083
We might hear the strange noises
that Yad was talking about.

483
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,375
Sure. Cheers!

484
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:41,167
Yam.

485
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:37,542
Hey! Yod. Yos.

486
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,500
Yod? Yos?

487
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:44,167
Why do we need these weapons, Yak?

488
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:46,375
- Yam?
- Yam!

489
00:48:57,292 --> 00:48:59,417
- Hey! That way.
- Shine the light.

490
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,083
I saw someone there, I really did.

491
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
- Yam!
- Yam!

492
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:10,958
Where are you, Yam?

493
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Yam!

494
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:16,875
- Yak.
- What?

495
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:20,417
What? Shit!

496
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,250
Where did she go?

497
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,000
- Shit.
- What was that?

498
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:28,708
- Follow me.
- Come on! Yam!

499
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:30,167
- Yam!
- Yam?

500
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:33,833
Hey.

501
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:35,000
- Yam?
- Is that you?

502
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,958
- It's you.
- Yam?

503
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:42,875
- Yam!
- Yam!

504
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:46,458
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey, wake up.

505
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,958
What did you do to my sister?

506
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:51,542
Yam?

507
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:59,333
Fucking show yourself, or I'll shoot!

508
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,500
Yod.

509
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:08,750
- What?
- The light.

510
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:11,042
- Where?
- There.

511
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,042
Yak, over there!

512
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Shit.

513
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:33,875
She's over there!

514
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:37,417
- Get down, Yos!
- There!

515
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,250
<i>We lost it.</i>

516
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,375
Didn't even know who that was.

517
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:49,292
Yam was not hurt.

518
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:52,333
Just curled up, saying her tummy ached.

519
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,500
Then Yos carried her home.

520
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:57,792
Do you know something?

521
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:00,750
You can tell me.

522
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:05,042
Does that woman

523
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:07,125
have long hair,

524
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,667
and was she wearing
a black funeral outfit?

525
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:17,875
You've seen her?

526
00:51:21,042 --> 00:51:23,250
At an abandoned shrine
under a weeping fig.

527
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,333
I...

528
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:26,583
But I shut it.

529
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:37,708
That person is messing with our heads.

530
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:45,458
Don't worry.

531
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:47,458
Go back to sleep.

532
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:51,667
You guys too. I'll be on the lookout.

533
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:54,458
Go on.

534
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:33,375
This is exactly what happened to Nart.

535
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,625
You know about Nart?

536
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:36,708
Yeah.

537
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,625
I asked around.

538
00:52:39,917 --> 00:52:41,042
Exactly the same.

539
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,458
Will Yam get better?

540
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:46,042
Well…

541
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:49,500
We'll look for a cure.

542
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:55,708
Hey.

543
00:52:56,417 --> 00:53:00,667
Shouldn't we tell Dad and Mom
about last night?

544
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,292
No one will believe us, Yad.

545
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,542
We'll get told off, like usual.

546
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:08,875
Here.

547
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:13,917
I give you ten baht each.

548
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,500
Share it with your sisters.

549
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,000
Treat yourself at Lek's shop.

550
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,917
Thank you, Yak.

551
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:27,708
I'll buy pink milk for Yam
and fried pork ball for Yee.

552
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:30,458
And for yourself?

553
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:38,083
It's good to think of others,
but don't forget about yourself, okay?

554
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:40,208
I'll find a cure for Yam.

555
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,708
Okay.

556
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:49,750
Bro, I'll go pick up Sergeant Paphan.
Can you look after the farm for me?

557
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,708
You can't order me around.

558
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:56,917
I always take care of the farm
since you left us.

559
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,500
I'm sorry for leaving you.

560
00:54:19,792 --> 00:54:21,125
You do your thing.

561
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,542
Go find a cure for Yam.

562
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:49,250
I know you won't let anything
happen to us.

563
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,083
You know, at the fair,

564
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,833
you hit on Singh's wife.

565
00:55:02,542 --> 00:55:03,958
I already talked to him,

566
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:07,625
so next time
you won't have to sneak around

567
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:10,208
and hide on the Ferris wheel.

568
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:31,500
No appetite?

569
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,458
My stomach aches.

570
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:39,333
I'll buy you pink milk to cheer you up.

571
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:46,417
Yak gave me this to share with you.

572
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:50,667
You should keep it, sis.
I won't get to use it.

573
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,208
Of course you will.

574
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:55,208
Treat me to something nice later.

575
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:56,292
Here.

576
00:55:57,917 --> 00:55:59,458
You want some toddy palm?

577
00:55:59,542 --> 00:56:01,250
You said you were craving it.

578
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:04,542
Sis…

579
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:08,042
Can I go with you?

580
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:09,792
We can eat there.

581
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,292
You can barely get up.

582
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:13,875
How will you go that far?

583
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,458
Wait here. It won't take long.

584
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,750
See you.

585
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,792
Go wash up.

586
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:32,292
I'll talk to Mom.

587
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:35,917
Let's go.

588
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:39,708
You okay?

589
00:56:41,042 --> 00:56:42,083
Be quick.

590
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:44,542
Wait for me, okay?

591
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:50,083
You told on me
last time I asked you to come out.

592
00:56:50,167 --> 00:56:51,542
You're eager to go now?

593
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,833
What are you talking about?

594
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:09,875
You can't take her out that far.

595
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:13,667
She can barely walk,
let alone ride a bike with you.

596
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:17,292
I feel bad for her
being all cooped up at home.

597
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:19,292
She needs some fresh air.

598
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:20,375
I said no.

599
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:34,583
Mom?

600
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:38,292
What's up with this thing today?
I just can't tune it.

601
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:09,375
Yam?

602
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:14,125
- Chauy!
- Yam!

603
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:15,208
- Get off of her!
- Yam!

604
00:59:15,292 --> 00:59:16,208
You bitch!

605
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:17,708
- Yam?
- Get out of my house!

606
00:59:17,792 --> 00:59:19,750
- Hang in there.
- Get out!

607
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:21,792
- Yam?
- Get the fuck out!

608
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:23,208
- Yam!
- You fucking bitch.

609
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:26,458
Get out! Now! Fucking cunt!

610
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:33,167
Yam!

611
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,250
Get the fuck out!

612
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:37,625
I told you to get out of my house!
Right now! Go!

613
00:59:40,667 --> 00:59:42,625
May you rot and burn in hell!

614
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:43,958
You hag!

615
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,708
Like I told you, Sarge,

616
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:13,083
she doesn't get up at night anymore.

617
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:16,250
And she eats what she couldn't before.

618
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,083
Honestly,

619
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:20,792
I'm worried sick.

620
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,042
It's noon and the door is shut?

621
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:36,458
Mom.

622
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:40,167
Mom, it's Yak.

623
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:44,792
Yad?

624
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,958
Mom, it's Yak and Sergeant Paphan.

625
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:50,792
Sarge, Chuay was here.

626
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:17,958
Yam?

627
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:24,042
Yam, what happened?

628
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:39,167
Yam!

629
01:01:40,292 --> 01:01:41,833
Why did you do that?

630
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:45,958
Yam.

631
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,667
Get lost, you evil!

632
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,458
Don't mess with me, or I'll eat you whole.

633
01:02:03,542 --> 01:02:05,417
Chuay, you foul soul!

634
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,792
I know it's you.

635
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:16,417
You fool.

636
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:19,917
You know nothing. My name is not Chuay.

637
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:23,250
My name is Yam.

638
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:25,792
Yam, huh?

639
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Even hell
won't take a vile spirit like you.

640
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:31,875
You're stuck in our realm.

641
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:47,500
What is this, Sarge?

642
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,208
Mom?

643
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,083
What's wrong with Yam?

644
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:52,167
Huh?

645
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:54,292
Who the fuck is Chuay?

646
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:56,583
<i>Chuay recently moved here.</i>

647
01:02:56,667 --> 01:02:58,750
<i>Rumor has it
that she evoked ancient spirits,</i>

648
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:01,250
<i>that she practiced black magic
and has gone insane.</i>

649
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:05,125
<i>No one wants to go near her
and risk getting bad luck.</i>

650
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:09,833
<i>When a bad incident befalls any family,
people think it is her doing it.</i>

651
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:21,333
Is she here?

652
01:03:22,542 --> 01:03:23,542
Up top.

653
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:31,833
How the hell can that hag
go up a steep hill like this?

654
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:39,042
Let's go.

655
01:04:44,958 --> 01:04:46,167
Damn it!

656
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:59,625
What the fuck are you doing, hag?

657
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:01,542
What the...

658
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:26,625
Chuay…

659
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:30,417
Sarge, tell me everything right now.

660
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,375
And please, no more shaman jargon.

661
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:35,958
What don't you understand? I told you.

662
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:40,500
These foul spirits
must possess a body, a host.

663
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:43,625
They go out looking for prey at night.

664
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:48,583
But during the day,
they come back here to the host.

665
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:52,792
But why did it let Chuay kill herself?

666
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:55,500
So it has no host now?

667
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:58,458
Everyone goes to a better place.

668
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:02,333
Human or spirit,
it makes no difference, Yak.

669
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:08,000
A tooth is what they need
in order to possess the host.

670
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:10,583
We were too late.

671
01:06:12,042 --> 01:06:13,042
Sarge.

672
01:06:14,417 --> 01:06:15,542
You mean, it chose Yam?

673
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,000
Did it?

674
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:21,667
Let's hope

675
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,000
that I'm wrong.

676
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:26,417
But if I am right,

677
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:28,958
it has a new host now.

678
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:40,958
Watch your sister closely tonight.

679
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:42,833
Stay vigilant.

680
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:46,667
For now…

681
01:06:48,958 --> 01:06:50,542
I'll do everything I can.

682
01:07:01,792 --> 01:07:02,792
How is she?

683
01:07:03,542 --> 01:07:07,458
She felt a sharp pain in her stomach.
She took a pill and now she's asleep.

684
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:11,542
Good.

685
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,750
You and Yee sleep in my room tonight.

686
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:17,875
- Okay.
- I'll stand guard.

687
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:21,083
Go now.

688
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:22,167
Come on.

689
01:07:57,292 --> 01:07:58,417
Four hours left.

690
01:08:00,917 --> 01:08:02,333
If nothing happens…

691
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:06,083
it means Yam is not the host.

692
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:41,375
Place your hand on the flame.

693
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:54,417
No, no. Yod. Yod!

694
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:56,542
Yod! Yos?

695
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:58,375
Yos, wake up!

696
01:09:09,417 --> 01:09:11,375
Yos! Yod!

697
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:15,917
Yos!

698
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:17,542
Yod! Yos!

699
01:09:19,042 --> 01:09:20,042
Yam.

700
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:33,000
Yak!

701
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,292
Yod! Yos!

702
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:42,000
Yak, wake up. Wake up!

703
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:46,500
Yod, wake up. Please!

704
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,833
Yos, can you hear me? Yos!

705
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,250
Yak!

706
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,000
Forgive me, Yak.

707
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,792
Wake up! Wake up now!

708
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,792
Yak, wake up!

709
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,500
Yak.

710
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,792
Did I pass out? Did I?

711
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:13,042
You all did.

712
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:14,708
Damn it.

713
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:17,417
Yam went to the backyard again.

714
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:21,542
Yod!

715
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:22,792
Yod, wake up!

716
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,875
Yos!

717
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:29,750
Forgive me.

718
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:33,833
Go in the room and lock the door.

719
01:11:33,917 --> 01:11:35,708
Don't open it no matter what. Go.

720
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:36,792
Go!

721
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:39,375
Follow me.

722
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:41,458
Yam?

723
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:49,708
Show yourself, you bastard!

724
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,000
I won't let you get away.

725
01:11:58,083 --> 01:12:00,458
- You cannot escape from me!
- Yak.

726
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,250
Yak.

727
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,375
Is it a thief?

728
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:07,125
Yam is possessed.

729
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:08,542
She went that way.

730
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:09,542
Possessed?

731
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,167
Don't be ridiculous!

732
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,833
- Hand me the gun.
- No!

733
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:16,667
Go back inside, Dad.
I'll tell you about it later.

734
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:22,125
What's that noise?

735
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:26,875
Don't mess with me!

736
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:29,542
Show yourself, you piece of shit!

737
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:31,167
Don't tempt it, Yak.

738
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,458
Please, don't.

739
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:35,125
I'm not just tempting it.
I want to lure it out.

740
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:37,542
If you're so brave, then show yourself!

741
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:38,917
You'll be dead twice!

742
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,958
Yak, don't tempt it. It might harm Yam.

743
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:44,208
Please, just listen to me.

744
01:12:44,292 --> 01:12:46,875
Yak, stop being crazy,
and hand me the gun.

745
01:12:47,542 --> 01:12:49,625
- Dad.
- I'll break your head.

746
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:51,250
Dad, stop!

747
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:54,208
You don't know shit!

748
01:12:54,292 --> 01:12:56,625
All you care about is fucking work!

749
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,167
You don't care about us.

750
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,500
You don't even try!

751
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
No!

752
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,958
I am your father.

753
01:13:04,042 --> 01:13:05,042
Don't be crazy.

754
01:13:05,917 --> 01:13:07,167
Ghosts aren't real!

755
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:09,792
- Dad.
- What…

756
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:11,708
Hey!

757
01:13:21,292 --> 01:13:22,500
What's on the roof?

758
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:26,375
That's a fucking ghost!

759
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:27,875
Do you believe me now?

760
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:31,083
Show yourself!

761
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,667
Where is it?

762
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:47,000
Dad, Mom, please listen to me.

763
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:50,083
Start a fire, and don't let it go out.

764
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:51,917
Stay here, in case Yam comes back.

765
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,208
Yos, look for Yam in the drying room.

766
01:13:54,292 --> 01:13:57,167
Yod, search the bamboo grove.
I'll take the farm.

767
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,333
What on earth is going on?

768
01:14:00,417 --> 01:14:01,417
Yak.

769
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:08,667
Yak.

770
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:11,875
Yam…

771
01:14:26,792 --> 01:14:27,792
Yak.

772
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:34,750
Yak.

773
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:42,458
Fucking Yak!

774
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,083
Bastard!

775
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:47,667
I know you're here.

776
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:50,458
Come out.

777
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:36,583
Mom!

778
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,667
Mom! Mom!

779
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:41,708
No…

780
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:46,167
Mom!

781
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:16,208
Yak…

782
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:18,750
Come here, Yak.

783
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:23,250
Yak!

784
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,083
You piece of shit!

785
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:35,333
Damn it!

786
01:17:13,667 --> 01:17:16,167
Catch me if you can, motherfucker!
Come on!

787
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:45,792
Yak?

788
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:50,625
Motherfucker!

789
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:51,625
No!

790
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:53,583
Yak! What are you doing?

791
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:55,208
- Get off!
- Hey!

792
01:17:55,292 --> 01:17:57,250
That's Mom! That's Mom!

793
01:17:58,792 --> 01:18:00,167
That's our mother, Yak.

794
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:06,458
What the fuck is wrong with you?

795
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:09,792
Mom?

796
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:11,375
Shit.

797
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:31,917
Yad, open the door.

798
01:18:44,292 --> 01:18:45,542
Open it, Yad.

799
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:08,542
- Yam.
- Yam?

800
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:09,833
- Mom.
- What?

801
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,083
Yee!

802
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:17,208
What are you doing?

803
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:18,750
Opening the door for Yam.

804
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:22,167
Yad, open the door for me.

805
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,208
"Yad"?

806
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:27,542
My sister never calls me Yad, bitch!

807
01:19:29,917 --> 01:19:32,583
If you won't open the door,
I'll do it myself.

808
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:52,917
I'm not afraid of you!

809
01:20:17,042 --> 01:20:18,750
Yad, are you all right?

810
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,083
Open the door!

811
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,833
Are you okay?

812
01:20:27,917 --> 01:20:29,958
Yad, answer me!

813
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:32,833
Are you all right? Open the door!

814
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:34,000
It's Mom.

815
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:35,750
Mom?

816
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:39,958
Open the door, please.

817
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:51,042
Yad?

818
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:04,792
Yad!

819
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:06,292
- It's me.
- Mom!

820
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:08,625
Come here, Yee.

821
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:10,792
- Mom!
- Are you all right?

822
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,708
What?

823
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:22,000
That was too much.

824
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:48,875
Mom.

825
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:52,917
Mr. Puth, right?

826
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:56,542
Thank you for coming.

827
01:21:57,667 --> 01:22:01,000
I could not sit still
after hearing from Paphan.

828
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:04,708
Let's talk inside, please.

829
01:22:04,792 --> 01:22:06,250
Let me look around first.

830
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:08,583
I'll fetch you something to drink.

831
01:22:09,167 --> 01:22:10,167
Thank you.

832
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:13,583
Hello.

833
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:19,292
That is one giant bamboo grove.

834
01:22:21,917 --> 01:22:23,583
That's where Yam collapsed.

835
01:22:24,417 --> 01:22:27,042
They would surely make fine utensils.

836
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:29,292
Many people want them.

837
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:32,208
My dad won't sell, though.
They're his treasure.

838
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:49,875
Listen,

839
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:52,458
we better go inside.

840
01:22:53,125 --> 01:22:55,583
My sister's gotten worse
since this morning.

841
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:57,917
Be patient.

842
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,083
I'm not done looking around.

843
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,500
These vegetables look nice.

844
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:04,792
Are you messing with us?

845
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:06,458
Yak!

846
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:13,458
You must learn to control yourself.

847
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:18,208
A challenge is coming your way soon
to test you.

848
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:21,875
And it's one you can't win
with sheer strength.

849
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,500
I'm sorry,

850
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:28,958
I know I'm hot-tempered.

851
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,958
It is time.

852
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,083
Lead the way.

853
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:31,000
Get out! You have caused enough suffering!

854
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,875
Mom, please come here.

855
01:24:46,667 --> 01:24:47,667
Mom, don't.

856
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:50,833
You leave me no choice.

857
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:31,375
Mom, help me.

858
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:36,375
Please.

859
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:41,500
Hold her, Dad.

860
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:43,708
Hold her! Don't let her come near!

861
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:45,875
Mom! Please!

862
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:47,958
Listen, Mom! Yam is possessed!

863
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:49,792
Mom, it hurts.

864
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:52,083
Listen to me, Mom! She's possessed!

865
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:55,625
Mom, listen.

866
01:25:56,667 --> 01:25:58,625
- Mom.
- My dear.

867
01:25:58,708 --> 01:26:00,833
It's okay. I'm here.

868
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:03,708
I'm here, dear.

869
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:06,625
If they dare hurt you,
they will pay for it.

870
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:10,500
Get out. Kick this old fart out.

871
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:14,958
Your sister is fine, Yak.

872
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:19,083
- Mom…
- Don't bring anyone else here.

873
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:20,917
She is fine, see?

874
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:28,542
Dad.

875
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:30,417
I thought you said she's fine.

876
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,583
- Look at her, shivering!
- Dad.

877
01:26:33,917 --> 01:26:35,375
- Get up!
- No.

878
01:26:36,042 --> 01:26:38,167
I told you I'm fine. I won't go anywhere.

879
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:39,625
Get up right now!

880
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:41,708
I am not going!

881
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:46,625
How dare you talk to me like this?

882
01:26:47,208 --> 01:26:48,208
Don't!

883
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:51,792
Please talk to her nicely.

884
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:53,375
- Dad!
- You want some?

885
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,917
- Get up!
- Please!

886
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,250
I said get up!

887
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,417
- Please.
- Dad!

888
01:27:03,417 --> 01:27:04,417
Please, stop.

889
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:07,292
Don't hurt our daughter. I beg you!

890
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:13,583
It's all right, dear.

891
01:27:14,458 --> 01:27:17,917
Everybody, leave this room.
Let Yen be with her daughter.

892
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:25,417
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

893
01:27:28,917 --> 01:27:29,917
Go rest, Dad.

894
01:27:33,042 --> 01:27:34,167
It's okay now.

895
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,167
<i>It is weak during the day.</i>

896
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:51,250
That must be all it can do.

897
01:27:54,167 --> 01:27:56,000
It will go dormant for a while.

898
01:27:58,042 --> 01:28:00,375
Time is of the essence.

899
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:04,958
Where do we go from here?

900
01:28:06,417 --> 01:28:08,375
Can we cut down these bamboos?

901
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:12,083
No way. Father will kill me for sure.

902
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:15,708
He will not kill you,

903
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:19,208
but that thing possessing your sister
will surely kill her.

904
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:21,875
Why must we cut them down?

905
01:28:23,542 --> 01:28:26,042
Cut them down, and you'll see.

906
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:03,292
Who said you could cut my bamboos?

907
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:09,250
I did.

908
01:29:10,708 --> 01:29:13,292
Whatever is hidden inside
will be revealed.

909
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:17,292
My daughter is acting strange, I admit it.

910
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:20,667
But I'd be a fool
to blindly trust everything you say.

911
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:23,625
I'm sorry, but please leave.

912
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:31,167
It is not just your daughter,
but you are also acting strange.

913
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:34,708
You were like a madman back there.

914
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:36,500
Is that normal?

915
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:37,583
Think about it.

916
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:42,792
This spirit is a master manipulator.

917
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:47,083
An untrained mind will be easily swayed.

918
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:50,625
Even a strong mind will turn violent.

919
01:29:51,792 --> 01:29:53,917
I can see right through you.

920
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:57,125
You're strict and disciplined,

921
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:59,625
but no matter what,

922
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:02,833
you would never hurt
your family like that.

923
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:05,042
Am I right?

924
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:11,375
Dad, please.

925
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:17,667
What we're doing here
might be the only way to save Yam.

926
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:23,208
If we find nothing inside,
I'll do whatever you ask of me.

927
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:40,417
Come on. Let's do it.

928
01:30:53,292 --> 01:30:54,292
God!

929
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:27,708
What is that?

930
01:31:28,958 --> 01:31:30,833
Whatever it took from its prey.

931
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:36,833
Things and organs
that link its soul to the host.

932
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:38,042
Foul things.

933
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:39,250
Do not touch them.

934
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:40,458
You must burn them.

935
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:42,958
Is my daughter really possessed?

936
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:45,792
Then do it.

937
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:47,375
Okay.

938
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:53,375
Come on, Yos.

939
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:54,708
No!

940
01:31:54,792 --> 01:31:55,875
Yod!

941
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:00,125
- Yam.
- Yam!

942
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:01,542
- Yam.
- Don't let her come close!

943
01:32:06,625 --> 01:32:07,625
Yam.

944
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,333
Stop, Yam!

945
01:32:11,417 --> 01:32:13,125
Stop it now, Yam.

946
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:14,292
Yam!

947
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,542
- Let me go!
- Yam.

948
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:17,875
- Let me go!
- Yam!

949
01:32:17,958 --> 01:32:18,958
- Stop it.
- Don't, dear.

950
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:20,208
- Mom.
- Yam.

951
01:32:20,292 --> 01:32:21,958
- Stop.
- Yam.

952
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:24,333
Mark my words. You will pay for this!

953
01:32:24,417 --> 01:32:25,958
- Yam.
- Yam.

954
01:32:40,792 --> 01:32:42,917
- Sarge. Dad.
- Yam?

955
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,125
Yos, Yod, help me.

956
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:45,333
Sarge, help.

957
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Yak.

958
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:50,250
- Yam.
- Yam.

959
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:38,875
Young man,
take your sister to the doctor now.

960
01:33:40,208 --> 01:33:42,125
Why don't you use holy water?

961
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:46,583
In your sister's current condition,
saline will do a better job.

962
01:33:47,542 --> 01:33:51,958
In order to survive this journey,
a strong mind is essential.

963
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:53,125
Young man,

964
01:33:54,417 --> 01:33:55,625
it must be you.

965
01:34:00,292 --> 01:34:01,375
Well, then…

966
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:05,333
Dad and Yos, please stay with Yee.

967
01:34:05,417 --> 01:34:06,833
You two can protect her.

968
01:34:06,917 --> 01:34:09,458
Yod and Yad, come with me and Mom.

969
01:34:09,542 --> 01:34:11,042
You can take care of Yam.

970
01:34:11,625 --> 01:34:12,625
Sarge,

971
01:34:13,708 --> 01:34:14,708
you come too.

972
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:17,167
Mr. Puth.

973
01:34:18,458 --> 01:34:19,458
Please help us.

974
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:23,208
You must save her.

975
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,500
Yak.

976
01:34:36,792 --> 01:34:38,458
Take care of her for me.

977
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:40,083
I will.

978
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:50,625
Come home soon, Yam!

979
01:35:04,458 --> 01:35:06,333
What exactly is this thing?

980
01:35:06,417 --> 01:35:07,417
A ghoul?

981
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:11,125
Way worse than a ghoul.
It has been here for centuries.

982
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:13,625
Fucking hell. Why did it target Yam?

983
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,417
Is it because she's weak-willed?

984
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:22,125
Normal spirits target scared children
because they're easy prey.

985
01:35:22,833 --> 01:35:24,583
This spirit is more cunning.

986
01:35:24,667 --> 01:35:29,958
It preys on healthy ones
with no illness nor injury.

987
01:35:30,042 --> 01:35:31,917
A superior prey.

988
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,125
Superior?

989
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:36,750
My sister is just a normal girl.

990
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:41,167
She has faced death, has she not?

991
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:46,167
When she was an infant, she got malaria.

992
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,958
I had already given up.

993
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,125
But then she miraculously recovered.

994
01:35:51,625 --> 01:35:53,542
She has rarely fallen ill since.

995
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:57,125
That's what makes her superior.

996
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:58,625
One among thousands.

997
01:35:58,708 --> 01:36:03,792
When it found Yam, it abandoned Chuay
and possessed her instead.

998
01:36:04,542 --> 01:36:06,958
What about Nart, the girl who died?

999
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:09,542
It saw her merely as prey.

1000
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:12,875
An appetizer before the main course.

1001
01:36:12,958 --> 01:36:17,250
What it will never want to let go of
is the body it possesses.

1002
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:19,750
Yam.

1003
01:36:20,583 --> 01:36:22,167
Hang in there, Yam.

1004
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:25,667
I wish I could trade places with you.

1005
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:30,542
This fog is heavy.

1006
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:31,958
Zip it, Yod.

1007
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:34,292
Whatever you see or hear,
do not speak of it.

1008
01:36:34,375 --> 01:36:35,458
That's crazy.

1009
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:38,208
You know it's hard not to, right?

1010
01:36:40,083 --> 01:36:41,625
I'll close my eyes then.

1011
01:36:46,583 --> 01:36:50,250
Young man,
where are the sacred bullets I gave you?

1012
01:36:50,333 --> 01:36:52,583
Here, ready for action.

1013
01:36:52,667 --> 01:36:53,958
Save them for later.

1014
01:36:54,542 --> 01:36:57,875
Your instinct will tell you
when to use them.

1015
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:00,708
Yam? Yam.

1016
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:05,000
Mr. Puth, will she be all right?

1017
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:06,250
She's burning up.

1018
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:08,208
Young man, it's showtime.

1019
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:11,917
It won't be an easy task
to reach the hospital.

1020
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:40,625
Nart?

1021
01:37:48,917 --> 01:37:50,875
Come on! Come on!

1022
01:38:28,208 --> 01:38:29,792
Sarge!

1023
01:38:29,875 --> 01:38:31,458
Can I say something now?

1024
01:38:32,875 --> 01:38:35,542
Close your eyes.
If we don't see them, they won't see us.

1025
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:55,708
It's coming!

1026
01:38:55,792 --> 01:38:57,958
Should we jump off the truck?

1027
01:38:58,042 --> 01:38:59,625
Yod, I told you to shut up!

1028
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,792
Damn it!

1029
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:37,250
Yad!

1030
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:42,542
- Well done, young man.
- Yam.

1031
01:39:44,875 --> 01:39:45,875
It's gone.

1032
01:39:49,333 --> 01:39:51,833
I shouldn't have trusted you.

1033
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:53,625
It haunted us anyway!

1034
01:39:53,708 --> 01:39:56,125
Got any more advice?
Should we let it kill us?

1035
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:58,583
Did you shoot it?

1036
01:39:58,667 --> 01:40:00,583
Must have been Yak.

1037
01:40:44,958 --> 01:40:45,958
No!

1038
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Stop!

1039
01:41:13,292 --> 01:41:14,417
Yak!

1040
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,500
Wow! You've gotten so big!

1041
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:18,042
- Sorry, sir!
- Cool.

1042
01:41:19,833 --> 01:41:24,042
<i>In order to survive this journey,
a strong mind is essential.</i>

1043
01:41:24,125 --> 01:41:25,708
<i>Come home soon, Yam!</i>

1044
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,875
<i>Yak. Take care of her for me.</i>

1045
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:19,333
What the hell do you want from us?

1046
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:21,042
What the fuck do you want?

1047
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,917
Oh, you're awake?

1048
01:42:28,625 --> 01:42:30,125
I was gonna drag you out.

1049
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:49,792
What are you looking for, brother?

1050
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:51,792
Are you looking for this gun?

1051
01:42:58,875 --> 01:42:59,875
Please, don't.

1052
01:43:07,292 --> 01:43:08,292
No!

1053
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:13,583
Come get it.

1054
01:43:20,792 --> 01:43:24,000
But don't shoot me.
We don't want Yam to die, do we?

1055
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:36,250
I only wanted your sister,

1056
01:43:36,333 --> 01:43:39,208
but your freaking family
won't mind its business.

1057
01:43:39,792 --> 01:43:41,667
Now I will devour them all.

1058
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:43,667
Fucking ghost!

1059
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:53,958
Don't!

1060
01:43:58,458 --> 01:44:01,125
I haven't been with a family
as fun as yours.

1061
01:44:02,458 --> 01:44:04,625
I don't regret choosing it.

1062
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:07,000
So fucking fun!

1063
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:11,875
What do you want from me?

1064
01:44:11,958 --> 01:44:13,042
Tell me.

1065
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,792
How can I rely on a brother like you?

1066
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:18,208
You're unreliable.

1067
01:44:19,208 --> 01:44:21,375
A failure to the family.

1068
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:31,708
Three more bullets.

1069
01:44:31,792 --> 01:44:33,208
Who should I kill next?

1070
01:44:36,167 --> 01:44:37,375
Your mother?

1071
01:44:42,333 --> 01:44:43,583
Your brother?

1072
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,875
You can hold their funerals.

1073
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:59,958
Don't forget to invite me.

1074
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:07,250
Hey! Hey, stop!

1075
01:45:09,292 --> 01:45:10,792
She goes first.

1076
01:45:10,875 --> 01:45:11,875
Shoot me instead.

1077
01:45:14,292 --> 01:45:15,750
I dare you, shoot me.

1078
01:45:27,917 --> 01:45:30,000
How can I refuse such a request?

1079
01:45:41,125 --> 01:45:43,125
I reckon you need a perfect host?

1080
01:45:56,458 --> 01:45:57,458
Yam?

1081
01:46:37,792 --> 01:46:39,250
The last bullet.

1082
01:46:39,958 --> 01:46:41,083
Bon appétit.

1083
01:46:51,333 --> 01:46:52,333
Yam?

1084
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:19,375
PHAHOLPOLPAYUHASENA HOSPITAL

1085
01:47:25,958 --> 01:47:27,375
Hey, sis. You're awake?

1086
01:47:30,292 --> 01:47:31,292
Yam?

1087
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,208
It's really you.

1088
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:37,083
What happened, sis?

1089
01:47:38,417 --> 01:47:40,042
I can't remember a thing.

1090
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:44,458
Slowly.

1091
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:48,792
I felt like I was in a deep slumber,
like I've been gone a long time.

1092
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,792
Where is everybody?

1093
01:47:53,875 --> 01:47:57,208
Yak and Yod took Mom to the doctor.
They'll be back soon.

1094
01:47:57,292 --> 01:47:58,333
What's wrong with Mom?

1095
01:48:00,875 --> 01:48:02,125
My arm…

1096
01:48:03,417 --> 01:48:05,958
What happened to my arm?

1097
01:48:09,667 --> 01:48:10,667
I…

1098
01:48:12,292 --> 01:48:13,875
I'll tell you later, okay?

1099
01:48:21,208 --> 01:48:22,750
Why are you crying?

1100
01:48:22,833 --> 01:48:24,250
What's making you sad?

1101
01:48:27,208 --> 01:48:28,208
Nothing.

1102
01:48:29,833 --> 01:48:31,292
They're tears of joy.

1103
01:48:33,292 --> 01:48:35,333
I'm so happy we're back together.

1104
01:49:06,542 --> 01:49:09,208
Thank you, brother, for saving our family.

1105
01:49:10,542 --> 01:49:12,917
We owe it to Paphan and Mr. Puth.

1106
01:49:14,542 --> 01:49:16,875
We wouldn't have survived without them.

1107
01:49:23,042 --> 01:49:24,083
- Yak.
- Huh?

1108
01:49:26,667 --> 01:49:29,042
Did you come home because you knew?

1109
01:49:33,292 --> 01:49:35,500
Sarge told Mom to write to me…

1110
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:40,042
about the strange rumors,

1111
01:49:41,625 --> 01:49:43,333
and that I should come home.

1112
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:52,958
No wonder Mom told me
to pick up our sisters that day.

1113
01:49:53,042 --> 01:49:54,792
I'm glad you came home.

1114
01:49:57,417 --> 01:49:58,583
Let's go.

1115
01:50:18,792 --> 01:50:23,042
When we return home,
I will never sleep in again.

1116
01:50:23,125 --> 01:50:27,250
I promise to do your chores for you,
so you can rest.

1117
01:50:29,667 --> 01:50:33,208
Can you do that for me forever, sis?

1118
01:50:37,125 --> 01:50:39,375
Yes, of course.

1119
01:50:53,125 --> 01:50:54,125
Yam?

1120
01:51:37,167 --> 01:51:38,375
Farewell, my sister.

1121
01:51:40,792 --> 01:51:41,958
Yam!

1122
01:52:03,583 --> 01:52:04,625
No!

1123
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:14,375
Help! Somebody help!

1124
01:52:14,458 --> 01:52:15,542
- Help!
- Yam!

1125
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:16,958
Doctor!

1126
01:52:17,042 --> 01:52:19,083
Yam! No, please.

1127
01:52:19,708 --> 01:52:20,750
Yam.

1128
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:26,917
Anybody! Help!

1129
01:52:40,458 --> 01:52:41,625
My dearest!

1130
01:53:09,625 --> 01:53:11,333
<i>Life is too short.</i>

1131
01:53:12,083 --> 01:53:15,875
<i>Let us make the most
of this borrowed time.</i>

1132
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:21,125
<i>Tomorrow is not for certain,
so hold your loved ones near.</i>

1133
01:53:21,208 --> 01:53:22,625
<i>Take care of each other.</i>

1134
01:53:24,042 --> 01:53:29,167
<i>Cherish every moment together,
as if it were your last.</i>

1135
01:55:01,875 --> 01:55:03,792
This is not the end.
