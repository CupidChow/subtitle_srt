00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,083
This film was made for entertainment,

2
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:29,041
inspired by the plot of Krittanon's work,
Tee Yod… Heard a Mad Groan.

3
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,083
Characters, behaviors, and incidents
are fictional.

4
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,291
No disrespect or encouragement
for negative attitudes

5
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,666
toward any individual is intended.

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,166
LUAY BORDER

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,166
5TH DAY OF THE WANING MOON
4TH LUNAR MONTH, 1854

8
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,916
Hang in there, guys.

9
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:53,083
We'll be safe
once we pass through the valley ahead.

10
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,208
Looks like I'm gonna die here.

11
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,666
If you die,
your wife will find someone new.

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,125
Damn you, Fak.

13
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,541
If I die,

14
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,666
I'll become a ghost and haunt you all.

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,916
If you all want to die that much,
go do it back home.

16
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,416
If I don't make it,

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,416
can you tell my wife something?

18
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:32,083
I love you as much as I first did

19
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:36,375
My heart is loyal, my love unwavering

20
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:40,458
Even if my lifeless body
Is buried in the ground

21
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:46,208
I shall return to possess you, my darling

22
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,125
Asshole.

23
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,833
Even if you were a ghost,
you would choose to be inside your wife?

24
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,333
Come on--

25
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,958
Hey!

26
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,166
Go!

27
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,000
Shit.

28
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,375
Run!

29
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,916
Oh, fuck.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Run!

31
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,583
Hey, get up!

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,500
If you don't want to die, I'll help you.

33
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,833
But you must take me in.

34
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:49,875
PHROM PHIRAM, PHITSANULOK, 1975

35
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,125
That's not her, Sarge.

36
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,708
Must be a forest ghost
or a salt lick ghost, Yak.

37
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,583
Spare it and the locals will suffer.

38
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,875
Let's take care of it.

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,208
Holy water, Sarge.

40
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:23,833
My piss is holier than your holy water.

41
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,000
Wanna try me?

42
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,291
Don't go overboard, Yak.

43
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,125
You'll die before you find the ghost
who ate your sister.

44
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,916
It would be easier
to find the one who keeps her.

45
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,208
Your entire family is doomed.

46
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,625
Fucking Yak!

47
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,875
I see I'm famous.

48
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,333
Even your ghost club knows about me.

49
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,791
You've got a smart mouth.

50
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,666
How about I remove all your teeth?

51
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,541
Will the ghost leave my husband's body?

52
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,833
We'll see.

53
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,625
What are you doing?

54
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,208
I'm reversing the stairs to fool it
so it won't be able to escape.

55
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,041
What's so confusing for you?
Come and help me.

56
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,541
Right. Hey, let's help him. Hurry.

57
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,458
Dear…

58
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:43,500
Now, tell me where that damn ghost is.

59
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,833
Bow at my feet! Then I'll tell you.

60
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,458
Bow?

61
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,000
Fine.

62
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,666
Lower it here.

63
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,083
Will my husband survive?

64
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,916
Yes.

65
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,416
Believe me, he'll survive.

66
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,750
Can I have one of your catfish?

67
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,166
Will you tell me or not?

68
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,875
No!

69
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,000
So you won't tell me?

70
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,458
You won't survive.

71
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,208
She won't let you fuckers live.

72
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,750
All set, Yak.

73
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,875
What the fuck is this?!

74
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,208
You won't tell me?!

75
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,041
You won't tell me?!

76
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,083
You still won't tell me?!

77
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,416
Yak.

78
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,750
If you don't tell me,

79
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,833
prepare to eat Pitsamon bullets.

80
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,041
Fine. I'll tell you.

81
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,208
I don't want to die over and over.

82
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,958
If you tell me where that damn ghost is,

83
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll help you cross over.

84
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,416
I don't know.

85
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,541
Asshole!
You're asking for it, aren't you?!

86
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,000
I really don't know.

87
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,583
All I know is that the man who keeps her

88
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,708
lives in Dong Khomote.

89
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,166
Dong Khomote?

90
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,166
I've told you now.

91
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,041
Will you help me cross over now?

92
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,291
You can leave his body.

93
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,791
Hurry and take your husband
to a hospital now.

94
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,083
Did the ghost eat all his innards?

95
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,500
No, he's just internally bruised.

96
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,833
Didn't you say you'd help
the ghost cross over?

97
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:45,000
These filthy ghosts will only do evil
if we keep them around.

98
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,875
I feel sorry for it though.

99
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,125
The ghost?

100
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,208
The fish.

101
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,375
By the way, Sarge.

102
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,333
Any ideas about her keeper
in Dong Khomote?

103
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,000
SHOCK! BABY DIES
DEFLATED STOMACH, MISSING ORGANS

104
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:15,916
Puang was
the first recorded ghoul in Siam.

105
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,416
The book Vajirayanwiset

106
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:22,041
states that he built a hut
at Wat Pak Fang in Uttaradit.

107
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,208
The ghoul under his control ate
and killed three villagers.

108
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,375
A GHOUL SINCE PUANG'S DAY

109
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,291
The villagers were terrified
and summoned the monks to get rid of him.

110
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,333
But it didn't work.

111
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,958
It is believed that Puang fled
to Dong Khomote.

112
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,125
No one has seen him since.

113
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,625
If we can find him, we might find out more
about the woman in black.

114
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,083
One ghoul controlling another?

115
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,833
That's too much.

116
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,083
And where is this fricking Dong Khomote?

117
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,083
MAP OF UTTARADIT

118
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,666
This is the Phi Pan Nam Range.

119
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,708
Here.

120
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,625
Dong Khomote is a jungle
filled with harmful supernatural beings.

121
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,166
When I was younger, I patrolled that area.

122
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,083
I barely survived.

123
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,375
Going there is like fighting a ghost army.

124
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,666
The past three years,
the ghoul has been weakened.

125
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,208
She's only been able to eat newborns.

126
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,541
SHOCK! BABY DIES
DEFLATED STOMACH, MISSING ORGANS

127
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,208
But that might change.

128
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,291
I'm sure she'll come back.

129
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,708
We have to find her keeper.

130
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,750
We don't know when she'll be
awakened again to bestow her power.

131
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:01,958
GHOUL 'RESURRECTED'
KILLS 9-MONTH-OLD

132
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,875
Are you really ready to go there?

133
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,250
I can't wait.

134
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,541
My family is in danger.

135
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,500
I've already lost Yam.
I won't let her take anyone else.

136
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,083
Don't worry, Sarge.

137
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,458
I won't die
until I get rid of that damn ghost.

138
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,958
You stay here.

139
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,458
Leave the rest to me.

140
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,208
Look after my family for me.

141
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,750
They're your family.

142
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,416
Take care of them yourself.
I'll go with you.

143
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,041
That forest is dangerous.
If you go alone, you won't survive.

144
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,458
Hey, Sarge.

145
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,250
You haven't learned your lesson yet?

146
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,041
Good thing she couldn't shoot for shit.
That's why I survived.

147
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,375
When are we going?

148
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,625
Stay cool as a gourd and solid as rock.

149
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,041
Live and grow old together.

150
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,958
- Pradit, please take care of Yad.
- I will.

151
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,291
Always forgive each other,
even when it's hard.

152
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,250
No matter what you face, good or bad,
don't let go of each other's hand.

153
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,666
I won't.

154
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,833
Behave yourself in his house.

155
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:59,041
Take care of his parents
as if they were your own.

156
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,958
And keep up with the household chores.

157
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,916
Don't let anyone criticize us.

158
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,333
Just a bit. Just a little.

159
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:13,791
You don't have to worry. I promise--

160
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,500
Don't make any promises.

161
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,250
Oh, bro!

162
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,250
Yak!

163
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,500
Look here, whey-face.

164
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,083
Look me in the eye.

165
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,583
I said look me in the eye!

166
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,708
If you want to take my sister with you…

167
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,000
don't send her back.

168
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,833
If you break Yad's heart,

169
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,416
I'll kick your ass.

170
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,208
The medical bills will cost you
more than the dowry.

171
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,625
Yak.

172
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,541
I promise

173
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,791
that I will love and respect Yad.

174
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,666
We'll be there for each other
in sickness and in health.

175
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:20,708
We'll take care of each other
till death do us part.

176
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,333
"Till death do us part"?

177
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,916
Brother-in-law…

178
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,833
You're so corny.

179
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,375
Come here!

180
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,666
Make sure you keep your promises.

181
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,416
Come on, cheer up.

182
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,125
His face is even more pale now.

183
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,750
Here.

184
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,041
Yak.

185
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,416
You've been a pain
since the moment you arrived.

186
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Apologies, sir!

187
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,708
Your fiancé.

188
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,375
You said he was funny.

189
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,000
He didn't laugh at all.

190
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,333
Just a little threat
got him shaking like crazy.

191
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,916
That's because you were bullying him.
Show him some respect.

192
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:29,125
Yeah. You're a grown-ass man, Yak.
Stop acting like a little kid.

193
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,458
I agree.

194
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:34,666
What if he cancels the wedding
and Yad becomes a rejected bride, bro?

195
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,125
Mr. Pradit is the son
of a rich sugarcane farmer.

196
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,500
- So?
- Yes!

197
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,541
Pradit is kind but you're being mean, Yak.
I'm not talking to you.

198
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,958
Oh, she's serious.

199
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,375
You're all ganging up on me
over a little criticism.

200
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,041
Yak.

201
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,125
When will you come back
to live with us again?

202
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,291
It's been three years.

203
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,875
That thing probably won't be back.

204
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,541
Can you stop acting like
a ghost hunter, Yak?

205
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,166
People around here
think you've gone crazy.

206
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,875
When are you gonna quit?

207
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:20,833
Dad.

208
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,500
Mr. Puth himself said that
she was a vengeful spirit.

209
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,416
She'll come back.

210
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,333
I'll hunt her down.

211
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,208
Don't even try to stop me this time!

212
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,041
Yod and I agree with you.

213
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,291
She'll be back.

214
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:53,250
If I can't get rid of her,
I won't be able to die in peace.

215
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,500
Since Yam died,

216
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,291
Dad hasn't talked about it.

217
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,125
He acts like nothing happened.

218
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,958
But as you can see,

219
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:24,291
when the sun sets,
he closes all the doors and windows

220
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,500
and keeps watch with a gun until dawn.

221
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,833
I think Dad agrees with us.

222
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,875
That every night…

223
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,416
it feels like
something is circling our house,

224
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,750
watching us.

225
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,000
What are you all talking about,
looking so serious?

226
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,875
Nothing at all.

227
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,291
Liar. You were discussing ghosts,
I know it.

228
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,750
Thank you for your sacrifice, Yak.

229
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,375
I'm just doing what I have to do.

230
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,125
Hang in there a bit longer.

231
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,500
Have faith in me.

232
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,958
Promise me first you'll come back.

233
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,125
I promise.

234
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:55,166
LAPLAE DISTRICT, UTTARADIT

235
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:04,500
THA IT MARKET

236
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:09,625
Water spinach! Fresh water spinach!

237
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,083
QUALITY CEMENT

238
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,125
We're screwed.
That old thing has a leaking radiator.

239
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:38,083
Good thing this didn't happen
while we were in the middle of nowhere.

240
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,791
You should look for a new ride.

241
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:45,291
When I mentioned Dong Khomote, not one
person was willing to rent us a car.

242
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,166
Boss, put this table on my tab.

243
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,416
Hello.

244
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,583
Hello.

245
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,916
Do we know each other?

246
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,333
My name is Luechai.

247
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,208
I own a logging camp I rent out here.

248
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,958
If you plan to go to Dong Khomote,
we can go together.

249
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,000
Do you want us
to hunt some animals with you?

250
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,583
No.

251
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,583
I'm not inviting you to hunt animals.

252
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,583
I'm hunting a ghoul.

253
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,541
Puang's ghoul.

254
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,833
Why? Did she eat your chickens?

255
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:51,166
The book Vajirayanwiset documents that
Puang's ghoul killed and ate three locals.

256
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,458
Those three victims

257
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,291
were my great-grandfather's daughters.

258
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,500
You're the descendant of Khloy?

259
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:09,625
If you two are hunting Puang's ghoul
in Dong Khamote,

260
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,083
we have the same target.

261
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,333
This is Sem.

262
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,833
He's both a hunter and a shaman.

263
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,791
The locals call him
the Sorcerer of the Laplae District.

264
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,958
Those two are my nephews.

265
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,041
The older one is Jirasak.

266
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,041
He's helping me take care of my tenants.

267
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:44,125
The younger one is Nawin.
He studied abroad.

268
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:46,833
That's Khom, our porter.

269
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:49,541
Despite looking clueless, he's reliable.

270
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,083
Bro.

271
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,958
I heard you've fought the ghost before.
Is that true?

272
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:12,625
So why is she still out there?
Did she magically escape?

273
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,333
Or did you forget
to put her in a pot and drown her?

274
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,791
Your joke isn't funny.

275
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,541
Gee. No need to get angry.

276
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,666
Your sister wasn't the only one
eaten by her.

277
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:38,291
Sak! Apologize to Mr. Yak.

278
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,291
Sorry.

279
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,583
We've arrived.

280
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,708
We'll have to go on foot from now on.

281
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,541
Are there really ghosts in there, Sem?

282
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,333
If you don't die first,
you'll see them for yourself.

283
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,166
Let's go.

284
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,416
Hey!

285
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Ask permission from the forest guardian
spirits before relieving yourself.

286
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,291
Asshole.

287
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,750
- Let's go.
- Let's go, Yak.

288
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,750
Our intentions are noble.
We're not here to kill animals.

289
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,708
We're just here to find someone.

290
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:47,416
Please open a path for us
so we can find the one we're looking for.

291
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,250
What is it, Sarge?

292
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,791
It won't budge.
I don't think permission is granted, Yak.

293
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,791
They're not granting permission
or you're too weak?

294
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,041
Let me.

295
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,041
They gave us permission.

296
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,208
Let's go.

297
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:47,291
When Christopher Columbus
explored the world,

298
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,958
do you think he did this?

299
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:53,875
No. He sailed. He didn't hike.

300
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,375
Wild animals have warning signals.

301
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:48,708
When their habitat is invaded,
they send each other warning cries.

302
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:50,333
Let's go.

303
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,250
Sarge?

304
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,416
They say werecats live in deep forests.

305
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,041
Is that true,
or just a story to scare children?

306
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:05,916
When a spirit of the dead possesses
a tiger, it's called a werecat.

307
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,791
If it's powerful enough,
it can transform into a human.

308
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:13,875
In the West,
humans transform into werewolves.

309
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:16,375
In Siam, tigers transform into humans.

310
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,583
Forests hold many mysterious things.

311
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,041
Always show respect.

312
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:25,458
If you see or hear anything strange,
keep your mouth shut.

313
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,458
What was that?!

314
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:33,166
Dumbass.
He just said to keep your mouth shut.

315
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,250
If I got spooked
and thought you were a ghost,

316
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,625
the gun in my hand might go off.

317
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:42,625
There's no law or police in the forest.
You can die before you know it.

318
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,958
If he was my brother,
I would've killed him.

319
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:50,791
I wouldn't have let him live this long.

320
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,250
Don't mind them.

321
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:57,875
When they were babies,
Puang's ghoul killed their mom and aunts.

322
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,333
So there was no one to teach them better.

323
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:02,625
I took them in.

324
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:05,916
If I hadn't, they would have
turned out even worse.

325
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:11,583
What made her so vengeful
that she did that to your family?

326
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,166
Puang is a ghoul!

327
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:18,750
Puang is a ghoul!

328
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,958
NEAR WAT PAK FANG
MUEANG UTTARADIT DISTRICT, 1893

329
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,333
Go to hell!

330
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:26,166
You ate my wife's guts and my child's!

331
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:33,291
- Burn it!
- Burn it!

332
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,750
There! There! She's there, Father!

333
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,208
Ghost! Ghost!

334
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:59,208
- Hey! The ghost! The ghost, Father!
- My baby!

335
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:02,458
Puang! Puang! Hey!

336
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:06,500
What on earth did you do?!
You've doomed us all!

337
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:10,833
Let go! Let me go!

338
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:14,875
My baby!

339
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,750
What about Puang? Why is he still alive?

340
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,458
His pet ghoul keeps him alive.

341
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:49,750
After that, Puang sent her to kill
all my great-grandfather's descendants.

342
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,541
Every generation.

343
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,500
Didn't even spare my parents.

344
00:32:56,083 --> 00:33:00,166
Fortunately, I have this Pitsamon amulet,

345
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:02,750
or I would be dead.

346
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:10,541
Just one amulet wouldn't give you
the courage to hunt her here.

347
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,208
I also have this Nam Phi iron knife.
All-powerful.

348
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,250
I've tested it by cutting the rainbow.

349
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,208
If I can find that damn ghost,
I'll kill her with this knife.

350
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,750
What do you have?

351
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:36,333
The holy 12-gauge shotgun
with the very blessed Pitsamon bullets.

352
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,583
It packs a punch.

353
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,291
One hit will stop her for good.

354
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,416
Sem.

355
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,666
Hey, can't you just chant a mantra
to summon that ghost?

356
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,083
We've been walking for hours.

357
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:27,291
If I do that,
every hungry spirit will come.

358
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,125
Everyone, be careful.

359
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:54,958
Oh. It's just a cobra.
I thought it was a ghost.

360
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:01,458
Nobody move. Just let it slither by.

361
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:42,666
It doesn't want us to go in.

362
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:47,083
The guardian spirits
have sent it here to warn us.

363
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,083
You dare block my way, you damn snake?

364
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,291
You damned snake!

365
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:10,833
Die, motherfucker!

366
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,583
No! Don't!

367
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:15,375
We aren't here to kill any animals!

368
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:18,500
You just broke the rules!
The forest guardians won't let you live.

369
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,416
We don't have a guide anymore.

370
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,666
The Sorcerer of the Laplae District
just fucking died.

371
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,291
Let's just go our separate ways.
Come on, Sarge.

372
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:44,958
Wait.

373
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,375
I won't go with you even if you hire me.

374
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,875
I'm more comfortable on my own.

375
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,333
I don't want to die
and become a ghost here.

376
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54,791
You and Sergeant Paphan can lead the way.

377
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,083
We'll just follow you.

378
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:02,833
I promise we won't cause any trouble.

379
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:10,250
Are you sure?
Especially that fucking asshole?

380
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,083
What?

381
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:15,083
What's your problem? Huh?

382
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,125
If you were really the real deal,

383
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,708
why did you let your sister get eaten
by that damn ghost?

384
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,875
So pathetic.

385
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:27,125
You fucking piece of shit.
I think I'll just shoot you.

386
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:39,208
I've heard enough from you.
Do you think my sister's death is a joke?

387
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:33,750
They're here, aren't they, Sarge?

388
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,833
They're just teasing us during the day.

389
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:42,625
They'll give us the real show tonight.

390
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,375
Everyone, be careful.

391
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,416
We'll camp here tonight.

392
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,166
Let's all go chop some wood
and make a platform.

393
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,208
We'll continue tomorrow.

394
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,875
Be a good girl when I'm not here.

395
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:01,375
Listen to Mom and Dad.
Help with the chores.

396
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,541
I will.

397
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,625
If you ace school
and get the highest score,

398
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:12,000
I'll take you to the beach.

399
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,208
You wanna go?

400
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:18,458
Yee?

401
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:21,625
Yee?

402
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:46,541
Yee…

403
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:52,083
Do you really think

404
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:54,708
you can escape me?

405
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:17,791
Yee.

406
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:27,958
Yee.

407
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,708
I'm here.

408
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,083
Yad!

409
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,875
- Yad! Yad! Yad!
- Yad!

410
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:03,875
She's being like this again!
She's like this again!

411
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:07,250
- Yad!
- Yad! Bite it!

412
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,625
- Yad.
- Yad!

413
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:16,083
- It's okay, Yad. I'm right here.
- Yad.

414
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:18,208
- Yad!
- Yad, baby.

415
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:21,250
Yad. I'm right here, Yad.

416
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,541
Yad!

417
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,458
- Yad.
- Yad.

418
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:33,458
Yak…

419
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,875
Whoa! Sleeping up a tall tree
is freaking scary.

420
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,791
I'd break my legs if I fell from here.

421
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,875
Then sleep on the ground

422
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,500
and let the tigers eat you.

423
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:50,541
The saying goes:

424
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:54,333
"Up high, lie on your stomach.
Down low, lie on your back."

425
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:58,375
Up high, if you're on your stomach,

426
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:01,625
you'll see everything that happens below.

427
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,166
But there's one rule.

428
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:13,666
No matter what happens,
do not leave the platform.

429
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,083
Why can't we leave it?

430
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:22,916
Dong Khomote is full of
supernatural beings and spirits.

431
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:28,333
If you hear or see anything, stay calm.

432
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,291
Remember,

433
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:34,708
they can't harm us if we don't go to them.

434
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Sarge.

435
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:44,708
If I die, don't bother carrying
my body out of here.

436
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:47,791
You're old now.

437
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:50,833
You'd just break your bones trying,
so don't bother.

438
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:53,250
Just leave my body here.

439
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,791
Who would be able to carry
a giant like you?

440
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,375
I have a friend in the army.

441
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:07,000
I'd just send up a flare and a helicopter
would come to pick us up in no time.

442
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:10,791
Then why didn't we take one here
in the first place?

443
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:14,666
It's a pain to relieve myself up here.

444
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:21,125
The wind is too strong around the forest.
Let's save it for when we need it.

445
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:23,708
- Once we're done with all this…
- You're full of it.

446
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:25,833
…I'll get you first, Yak.

447
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:30,458
I think you're the one
who's going to get hurt.

448
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,041
What? Hey, I'm your nephew!

449
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:35,333
Your real nephew. Remember that?

450
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:38,000
He threw his whole life away
just to hunt this ghost.

451
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,083
People like him have nothing to lose.

452
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:05,458
Help!

453
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:08,375
I'm still alive!

454
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:11,250
Someone help me!

455
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:13,958
No more!

456
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,416
Please, help me up there!

457
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,500
- Sem?
- Don't!

458
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:20,666
Don't go down there.

459
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:23,583
Stay calm. Ignore him.

460
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,416
What?

461
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,625
Hey!

462
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,250
Sem is gone!

463
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,833
Was that a man or a ghost?

464
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:40,833
- Fuck!
- Shit!

465
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:43,666
Fuck me.

466
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:47,125
Go! Climb down now! Hurry!

467
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:56,208
Sak! Why did you climb down there?
Get up here!

468
00:46:56,291 --> 00:46:58,708
Shit! Sarge told me to climb down.

469
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:00,625
Who told you to? I didn't.

470
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:04,583
Yeah, stop whining and climb back up.

471
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,708
Shit, what the fuck am I doing down here?

472
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:25,583
Shit!

473
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,333
- No!
- Shithead!

474
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,375
You goddamn ghost, stop playing games.
I'll shoot you, motherfucker!

475
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,291
Motherfucker!

476
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:46,250
Everyone, get down
from the platform! Hurry!

477
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,583
Shit! Damn you, Sem. You son of a bitch!

478
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,708
Fuck! Sak's slithering like a snake.

479
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:40,833
How is that possible?

480
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:45,041
Just regroup on the platform, sir.

481
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:49,083
It's too late. Our feet are on the ground.
That's like a mass ghost invitation.

482
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,625
What made you think that spirits
couldn't climb trees, Khom?

483
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:53,166
You're right.

484
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,125
I once saw a ghost drive a pickup truck.

485
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,333
We're dead. We're so dead.

486
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:02,083
They say no one survives Dong Khomote.
I shouldn't have come!

487
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,458
Compose yourself.

488
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:08,375
A real man doesn't fear death.

489
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,791
Only a salt lick can save us now.

490
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:18,083
Salt licks are sacred ground.

491
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,833
They can protect us
from evil spirits and bad luck.

492
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,375
If we can find one and get to it,
we'll survive this night.

493
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:25,458
Where would one be, Sarge?

494
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:28,375
No idea.
I just know they're in open areas.

495
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,416
If we're lucky,
we'll find a place to hide.

496
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,666
If not, we'll become ghosts ourselves.

497
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,541
Then let's move out.

498
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:42,833
Sarge. Yak. Weapons out.

499
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:45,416
There are ghosts everywhere.
How can we move out?!

500
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:50,083
Sarge, give us a good mantra.

501
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:54,875
Right. Everyone, repeat after me.

502
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:08,500
Do you have a shorter one, Sarge?
No one can keep up.

503
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,375
Try and concentrate.

504
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:13,291
Repeat after me again.

505
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:29,125
You'll all die here.

506
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:31,500
I'll eat every bone in your bodies!

507
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,958
Who wants to die first?

508
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:38,208
You, you, or you?

509
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:44,583
You talk too much for a fucking ghost.

510
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:48,666
Sak.

511
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:17,625
All of them will be flocking here.

512
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:22,291
Sarge, an expelling mantra. A short one.

513
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:24,458
Run!

514
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:30,708
This way!

515
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:35,958
Hey! Yak!

516
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,250
I'll clear the way.

517
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:42,625
Shit.

518
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:52,250
This way!

519
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:58,125
Hurry! Come on!

520
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,000
Where did you all go?

521
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,208
Shit.

522
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:12,666
Uncle Luechai! Yak! Sarge!

523
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:16,166
Nawin!

524
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,791
Wait for me, Uncle!

525
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:21,708
Hey! This way. Follow me!

526
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,041
Sarge!

527
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,000
Nawin!

528
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:32,166
What? Why are you over there?

529
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,541
I'm here!

530
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:36,458
This way!

531
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:40,791
Here!

532
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:44,333
Shit!

533
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:47,208
What the fuck is this?

534
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:49,416
Shit, I'm dead.

535
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:56,500
Uncle Luechai! Yak!

536
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,666
- Nawin!
- That was not Nawin.

537
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,583
Come on!

538
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:16,750
This way, Sarge!

539
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:37,416
You can't help anyone!

540
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,583
You'll die here for nothing!

541
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,416
Go back to your family

542
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,458
while you still have the chance
to say goodbye!

543
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:46,625
I'll say goodbye to you first.

544
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:55,125
Fuck.

545
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,291
Let's go.

546
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,791
- Hungry.
- Let me eat.

547
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:45,750
- Hungry.
- What the fuck?

548
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:49,625
- Let me.
- Let me eat.

549
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:52,916
- Let me eat.
- Let me.

550
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,541
- Let me eat.
- Fuck. Shit!

551
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,250
- So fucking starving.
- Let me eat.

552
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,541
Fuck!

553
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:03,041
- Let me eat first.
- I'm hungry.

554
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:06,958
Hungry.

555
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:09,291
- Let me join you.
- Blood.

556
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:10,625
- Blood.
- Fuck.

557
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,333
- Hungry.
- I'm sorry.

558
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:14,083
I'm sorry. I don't want to die.

559
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:15,958
- Please let me go.
- Blood…

560
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:17,750
I'll make merit for you.

561
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:19,625
Let me eat.

562
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:21,958
A monk. I'll become a monk for you.

563
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:25,791
- I'll get ordained for you.
- Hungry.

564
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:27,458
I'll eat you.

565
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:32,750
Shit!

566
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:45,333
The salt lick is there! Hurry!

567
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,541
- Are you sure?!
- Yes!

568
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:58,666
Tracks of animals eating this
are everywhere.

569
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,958
This must be it.

570
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,416
Here.

571
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,958
Salt licks are sacred ground.

572
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:05,208
Forest demons can't enter
unless we let them.

573
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,791
Uncle! Help me!

574
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:28,416
- I want to get in there.
- Come--

575
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,916
No, you're not allowed!

576
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:34,833
People fleeing death don't ask permission.

577
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:40,541
Uncle! Uncle, help me.
The ghost is right on my tail.

578
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:45,291
You abandoned me once.
You're gonna believe him again?

579
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:55,291
Fine. I'll help you.

580
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:57,833
Recite the Itipiso prayer backward
and you'll live.

581
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:59,583
I don't know that one.

582
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,083
Then repeat after me.

583
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:16,375
Not afraid of dying anymore?

584
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:22,625
Recite it!
Or the forest spirits will eat you.

585
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:05,500
Go! Leave us alone.

586
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:09,958
But if you want to try me, then go ahead.

587
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:14,500
But I swear it'll hurt like hell.

588
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:35,625
Yak, be honest with me.

589
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:38,833
Aren't you afraid of anything
in this forest?

590
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:42,291
Hey! I wouldn't run like crazy
if I wasn't afraid, Sarge.

591
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:44,583
I just tried to talk to them nicely.

592
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,708
That's what you call talking nicely?

593
00:58:57,666 --> 00:58:59,291
Yee, are you done? Hurry up.

594
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,708
Let's go.

595
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:09,791
Sis.

596
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:13,208
Is Yak really not attending your wedding?

597
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:18,291
It's Yad's most important day.

598
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:20,333
How could Big Bro miss it, Yee?

599
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,958
If Yak breaks his promise,
I'll go drag him to your wedding.

600
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:30,875
Well, shall we go?

601
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:34,666
Let's go. Come on.

602
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:18,416
Look at that.

603
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,833
If we can get out of this forest,
Puang shouldn't be far.

604
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:37,166
Can Pitsamon bullets
really kill that woman in black?

605
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,875
They've blown out many ghosts' brains.

606
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:45,041
That damned ghost shouldn't survive.

607
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:48,083
He's something else,
to be able to live here alone like this.

608
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:53,291
I'd bet a hundred to one on it
that this is his sanctuary.

609
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:55,166
Let's go.

610
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:10,666
Look.

611
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:13,541
She sent those damn spirits to kill us.

612
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:21,583
I'll look for Puang around here.

613
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:23,291
Be careful, Sarge.

614
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,375
Puang!

615
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:45,208
Sarge!

616
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:50,166
Put that down or I'll shoot you!

617
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:36,750
Where's the fucking ghoul you keep?
Bring her here.

618
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:38,375
I've never kept her.

619
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,083
She is the one who confines me.

620
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,000
Bullshit!

621
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,625
I've been trying to break free
for over a hundred years,

622
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:54,000
but she just won't let me go.

623
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:57,625
I can't die

624
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:00,458
because her tongue is in my stomach.

625
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:03,708
She forced me to find victims
for her to feed on.

626
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,625
She didn't even spare my own children.

627
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:11,708
The longer I live,

628
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:16,791
the more people she devours.

629
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,166
Then why didn't you kill her?

630
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:25,541
I could have succeeded.

631
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:31,375
But Khloy, your great-grandfather…

632
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,916
burned my cabin down
and destroyed my ritual!

633
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:42,166
I didn't want anyone else
to die because of me,

634
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:45,416
so I figured out a way
to get away from her.

635
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,875
I hid in the forest
so no one could find me.

636
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:54,500
But if she knows I'm here,
she'll come to get her tongue back!

637
01:05:54,583 --> 01:06:00,583
Then her power will increase twofold
and no one will be able to defeat her!

638
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:02,458
That damned ghost is powerful!

639
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:04,875
Why can't she find you?

640
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:16,291
I have the Wirunchambang amulet
to hide me from her eyes.

641
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:22,625
What the fuck are you doing?!
Why the fuck did you do that?!

642
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,375
Come out, bitch!

643
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:26,958
I found Puang!

644
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:30,458
Come out! Take back your tongue!

645
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:35,208
Come out!

646
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,083
You fool!

647
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:43,041
You'll get everyone killed.

648
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,208
Not me!

649
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,250
She promised me that
if she got her tongue back,

650
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:49,291
she'd stop coming after me
and stop eating my family!

651
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:51,500
Luechai, you fucking bastard!

652
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:59,333
I've been waiting to die,
but I'm immortal.

653
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:04,208
Now, my time has come.

654
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:07,125
From now on, it's your responsibility!

655
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:09,000
What the fuck does that mean?

656
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:19,291
No, no. No! No!

657
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:44,625
I had to do this…

658
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,416
to protect my family!

659
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:56,875
I'll make merit for your grave, Yak.

660
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:58,458
You fucking asshole!

661
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:13,208
You!

662
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,625
What a blast!

663
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:37,541
Who'll be next in your family?

664
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:47,541
I think I'll fucking eat them all.

665
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:36,958
YADTIP AND PRADIT
10 OCTOBER, 1975

666
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:44,416
Excuse me, mister.
Will there be any staff working tonight?

667
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,500
Yes, but they got stuck in the storm,
so you'll have to wait until it lets up.

668
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,291
Right.

669
01:11:57,083 --> 01:12:00,416
If it's raining this much,
how is Yak going to get here?

670
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:09,041
How could he miss his sister's wedding?
He'll be here once the rain lets up.

671
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,416
That's right.

672
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:20,750
Look at this glue.

673
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:26,833
If Yam were still here,
it would be nice, wouldn't it?

674
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:31,666
Don't say that.

675
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:36,000
At an auspicious event, they say
it's bad luck to talk about tragedies.

676
01:12:38,416 --> 01:12:41,125
We're almost out of ribbons.
I'll get some more, Mom.

677
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:44,708
I'll go with you, Yad.

678
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,208
I'll go too.

679
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:50,875
Yee. You're so attached
to that doll, aren't you?

680
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:55,666
Because Pradit gave it to me.

681
01:12:56,416 --> 01:12:57,666
Right.

682
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:03,083
She carries it everywhere, bro.

683
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:40,291
Don't be afraid.
It's just a power outage. Let's go.

684
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:06,791
Mom, I want to go downstairs.

685
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,958
Hurry. Come on.

686
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:31,000
- Go check on your mom and sisters.
- I'll do it.

687
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:44,333
- Pradit!
- Pradit!

688
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:45,833
Yos.

689
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:48,500
Dad, the doors are locked.

690
01:14:58,083 --> 01:14:59,416
Come on, hurry up.

691
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:30,000
Shit.

692
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:37,125
Yos! Move!

693
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:45,708
Shit.

694
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:49,000
What is all this?!

695
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:52,666
Dad! This one has Yak's bullets.

696
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,083
Go!

697
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:11,083
Yod.

698
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,083
Let's go!

699
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:03,666
Don't fall asleep, Yee!

700
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:26,125
Don't fall asleep!

701
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:38,875
Yee!

702
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:41,833
We need to go! Yee!

703
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:44,458
Get up!

704
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:04,958
Yee! Come back here.

705
01:18:14,916 --> 01:18:16,125
- Dad!
- Dad!

706
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:17,083
Dad.

707
01:18:17,166 --> 01:18:18,375
Pradit!

708
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,958
You're all gonna die!

709
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:30,666
Mom.

710
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:43,916
- Mom! Help me!
- Yee!

711
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:51,291
Yee!

712
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:54,958
Mom!

713
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:57,666
Yee!

714
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:03,166
Yee, where are you?!

715
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:08,875
Damn ghost!

716
01:19:10,166 --> 01:19:12,291
Give me back my girl!

717
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:14,958
- Mom! Help me!
- Yee!

718
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:11,875
The Buddha has helped us.

719
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:18,041
Yod! Go check on Dad!

720
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,750
Dad!

721
01:20:30,291 --> 01:20:31,583
Go help your mom and sisters!

722
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:08,541
Mom, why aren't we going downstairs?

723
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:35,000
Mom! Yee!

724
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:41,083
Mom! Yee!

725
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:20,583
I won't survive if the ghosts come
when you're away.

726
01:23:20,666 --> 01:23:24,500
You will. If the ghosts come,
eat this candy.

727
01:23:29,541 --> 01:23:30,541
Really?

728
01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:34,416
Yeah! The ghosts like to scare us.

729
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,541
If you ignore them, they'll go away!

730
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:35,166
Mom.

731
01:24:37,291 --> 01:24:39,875
Yee, I'm here to help you.

732
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:42,333
Don't be afraid.

733
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:46,333
Come to me.

734
01:24:49,666 --> 01:24:51,625
Little brat! I'm your mother!

735
01:25:03,625 --> 01:25:05,750
You wanna play hide and seek, Yee?

736
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:30,750
Yee, my dear?

737
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:40,416
Where are you?

738
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:47,000
Where are you?

739
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:49,041
Don't let me find you.

740
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:44,875
Where are you?

741
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:19,916
Mom.

742
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:22,625
Don't be afraid, dear.

743
01:27:22,708 --> 01:27:25,666
It'll only hurt a little.
Like an ant bite.

744
01:27:31,833 --> 01:27:35,083
- Mom. Mom!
- Where are you going?

745
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:39,500
I'm glad you came.
I'll send you two on to be with Yam.

746
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:44,333
Don't! Stop, Mom! Stop!

747
01:27:44,416 --> 01:27:45,500
Yos!

748
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:55,583
Yos!

749
01:27:56,083 --> 01:27:58,625
Mom. Mom!

750
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:07,625
- Yak.
- Yak!

751
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:10,416
Fucking Yak!

752
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:19,250
Yod.

753
01:28:21,916 --> 01:28:24,208
Yak, she's possessed Mom's body!

754
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:29,500
She hasn't, but she's controlling her.

755
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:33,166
She wants to mess with our heads.

756
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:35,666
How aren't you fucking dead?!

757
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,625
Yak!

758
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:51,333
Damn, it didn't pierce through.
Could it be…?

759
01:28:57,416 --> 01:28:59,083
The Mhaaud yantra?

760
01:29:01,416 --> 01:29:02,750
What is it, Sarge?

761
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,208
I'm totally lost.

762
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:10,000
Puang wrote the Mhaaud yantra
on that voodoo doll,

763
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:12,125
which makes the skin impenetrable.

764
01:29:12,208 --> 01:29:14,208
You survived because of Puang.

765
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:21,750
Get off of me!

766
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:23,583
Sarge!

767
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:28,833
Yos!

768
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,833
Don't think you can survive.

769
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:41,208
All of you will die, just like Yam.

770
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:46,541
Enough of your bullshit.

771
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:53,625
- Mom!
- Mom!

772
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:11,083
Mom! Honey!

773
01:30:13,125 --> 01:30:14,166
Yad!

774
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:38,875
Sis.

775
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:42,833
Yam?

776
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:48,916
I've really missed you, Yad.

777
01:30:52,041 --> 01:30:54,041
I've missed you too.

778
01:30:58,708 --> 01:31:00,416
Are you getting married?

779
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:03,833
I'm so happy for you.

780
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,583
Good for you.

781
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:09,791
After the wedding,
you'll move to another place.

782
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:12,375
You won't have to tolerate living here.

783
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:22,708
But you'll leave others behind
to get out safely alone.

784
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:24,458
That's not true, Yam.

785
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:26,750
I never planned to leave anyone.

786
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:29,916
I just wanted to forget
everything that happened.

787
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,666
It's okay, Yad.

788
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:38,416
I understand that
everyone is just trying to survive.

789
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:43,291
Soon, you'll probably use
your husband's last name.

790
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:47,083
You'll stop getting seizures.

791
01:31:49,041 --> 01:31:51,416
You'll finally have the life you want.

792
01:31:59,416 --> 01:32:03,791
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's my fault.

793
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:18,041
You'll have a good life.

794
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:21,791
But I won't.

795
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:24,791
I'm suffering so much.

796
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,250
She won't let me go.

797
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,458
I can't go anywhere.

798
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:35,500
Would you help me?

799
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:39,541
How can I help you?

800
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:54,041
Do you remember?

801
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:58,750
You promised to always
do anything I asked.

802
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,083
I remember.

803
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,750
Can you be my vessel?

804
01:33:15,916 --> 01:33:17,500
What do you mean?

805
01:33:26,791 --> 01:33:28,291
I want your body.

806
01:33:29,166 --> 01:33:30,708
Give me your body.

807
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:32,208
You're not Yam!

808
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:55,041
Of course I am.
Don't you remember your little sister?

809
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:57,375
No, sis. Don't do that.

810
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:11,875
I can't handle it anymore, Yak.

811
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:16,833
Give me your body!

812
01:35:28,166 --> 01:35:29,333
Don't be afraid.

813
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:32,000
I went through this before too.

814
01:36:40,708 --> 01:36:43,291
- Yad!
- Yak…

815
01:36:45,375 --> 01:36:48,583
Too bad for you, I'm not dead yet.

816
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:57,166
If you're gonna kill her,

817
01:36:58,416 --> 01:37:02,875
you'll need the Wirunchambang amulet.

818
01:37:09,625 --> 01:37:12,708
How do we use it? Huh? How?

819
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:27,833
Fucking Yak! How did you get here?!

820
01:37:28,666 --> 01:37:29,625
I flew here.

821
01:37:35,166 --> 01:37:36,958
You haven't learned at all.

822
01:37:58,583 --> 01:37:59,500
Yad!

823
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:07,458
If you don't want this bitch to die,
throw that amulet away!

824
01:38:10,416 --> 01:38:11,375
Don't!

825
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:16,291
Don't hurt my sister! Take me instead.

826
01:38:32,916 --> 01:38:34,041
Yad!

827
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,208
Yad!

828
01:38:44,958 --> 01:38:48,083
Without Puang's amulet to protect you,

829
01:38:48,166 --> 01:38:49,958
you're just a dog.

830
01:38:50,041 --> 01:38:51,416
Yak!

831
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:44,375
You think your crappy knife can hurt me?

832
01:39:46,458 --> 01:39:50,208
Since you got your tongue back,
you've never shut the fuck up.

833
01:39:56,958 --> 01:39:59,875
Being this close to you,
I think I really like it.

834
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:07,791
You want my tongue, fucking Yak?

835
01:41:05,791 --> 01:41:08,333
Where are you going?! Play with me!

836
01:41:12,083 --> 01:41:13,041
Sarge!

837
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:49,583
Where the hell are you going,
you damn ghost?

838
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:15,208
You fucked with the wrong family,
you goddamn ghost.

839
01:42:17,458 --> 01:42:21,833
Pound her forehead with the amulet.

840
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:32,958
- Yak.
- Yak.

841
01:43:36,958 --> 01:43:38,458
I finally killed her.

842
01:43:44,875 --> 01:43:46,833
I finally killed her for Yam.

843
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,458
I finally killed her for Yam.
