00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,958
"Love Senior The Series Special EP"

2
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:50,375
If love were like reading a book,

3
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,458
my book

4
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,291
would be full of stories of us.

5
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,375
Senior.

6
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,041
Are you the second-year head hazer?

7
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,875
Can I have your signature?

8
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,541
Gyo.

9
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,458
I don't wanna be your junior anymore.

10
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:16,583
Please.

11
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,458
No matter how the story unfolded before the final chapter,

12
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,125
today,

13
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,125
I still want the next chapter

14
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,291
to have you as my main character, just like always.

15
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:51,666
Naow.

16
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,416
You scared me!

17
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,083
Come here, let's cuddle.

18
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,791
Nice try!

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,791
You like it?

20
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,208
smell it.

21
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,791
I bought it for you.

22
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:16,583
It smells

23
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,625
really nice.

24
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:33,875
Ouch!

25
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,958
You bit me again.

26
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,833
Aren't you going to work? You’re going to be late.

27
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,666
Nope.

28
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:48,000
Because today, we’re going to Pattaya.

29
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,250
Huh?

30
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,916
You seemed bored,

31
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,583
so I invited P'Warang and the others to go to Pattaya.

32
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,375
But right now...

33
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,583
You make me want to do something else more than that.

34
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,750
That's it for your quota.

35
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,291
I'm going to pack my bag.

36
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,208
No more excuses either.

37
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,791
Because I already packed everything for you.

38
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,500
It’s so beautiful!

39
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,291
Let me show you inside, it’s going to be even more amazing!

40
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,625
- So nice.
- Wow.

41
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,333
Hello, everyone! We’ve just arrived at the pool villa. Look!

42
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:03,375
The atmosphere here is incredible. Wow!
Who should I sleep next to?

43
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,583
Let’s go check out the other spots!

44
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,375
Gyo.

45
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,625
Wow.

46
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,458
Woah.

47
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,000
Woah, Gyo.

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,416
That's a real nice, for real.

49
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,416
-Do you like it.
-Yeah.

50
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,333
That's nice.

51
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,583
Wait.

52
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,333
Oh, there’s a kitchen too!

53
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:21,833
Wow.

54
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,458
-Let’s cook something together, P'Suay.
-Sure.

55
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,791
But first, how about this?

56
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,916
Let’s go pick our rooms first.

57
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,666
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,791
Stop!

59
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,750
I’ve already checked it out for us.

60
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,125
-Why?
-There are three bedrooms.

61
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,625
But there are eight of us.

62
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,541
Including Joobjib and Thida, they’ll be joining us in the evening.

63
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,125
- I’ll sleep with Naow!
- And I will sleep with Gyo.

64
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,083
I’ll sleep with Prang.

65
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,833
I’ll have to sleep with Joobjib and Thida because
they left all their stuff with me.

66
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,958
I’m too lazy to move it. End of discussion.

67
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,333
And what about me?

68
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,416
Full.

69
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,958
- The pool looks so fun to swim in.
- Yeah, for real.

70
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,208
I remember this is supposed to be a girls-only trip.

71
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,916
So, the way you all just paired up and got all lovey-dovey like this

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,833
are not allowed.

73
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,000
But—

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,541
Stop!

75
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,333
We came on this trip together, so it has to be fair, right?

76
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,458
So,

77
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,375
let’s leave it to the spirits of the place to decide.

78
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,708
P'Lada, what are you doing?

79
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,333
Oh wow.

80
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,291
Come back already.

81
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,541
Careful, careful, watch out for ants.

82
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,541
Do you think she wants to eat mangoes?

83
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,708
Are you okay?

84
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,666
Oh no, oh no.

85
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,833
Goodness!

86
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,416
What happened to you?

87
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,208
What? It's nothing.

88
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,250
What’s with you?

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,958
Here are the rules,

90
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,208
Whoever picks the branch with the fewest leaves

91
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,041
will get—

92
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,583
Me, beautiful P'Lada here will sleep with you!

93
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,625
Alright, give a round of applause! Clap, clap!

94
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,333
So happy! So happy!

95
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,458
Excuse me.

96
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:02,250
Are you imagining yourself competing in some pageant or something?

97
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:03,750
Let me pick first.

98
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,791
You’re choosing without thinking? Okay.

99
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,041
Oh, you can’t count out loud; I’m excited too!

100
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,083
18

101
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:13,916
What?!

102
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:14,625
18

103
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,166
18, then I’ll count yours, Warang.

104
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:25,583
14

105
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,500
15

106
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,125
16

107
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,000
17

108
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:34,875
Ours is 18, right?

109
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,666
Yes! My dear spirits!

110
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,291
Um, P'Lada, you’ll be sleeping with you, Warang.

111
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,958
Alright, Naow, let’s go to our room.

112
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,583
-I'm so sick.
-Grabbing my stuff real quick.

113
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,541
-Okay.
-Sorry, guys.

114
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,083
Stop!

115
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,583
Gyo, step back!

116
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,291
Oh! What’s happening?

117
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,083
What?

118
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,416
18

119
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,291
19

120
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,291
Warang, you got 19. Pick your room.

121
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,958
Gyo, your room sleeps three people. Take P'Lada with you.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
No!

123
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,125
I guess I’ll go too, since It's full.

124
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,875
Let’s go, let’s go together!

125
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:15,666
Alright, let’s go!

126
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,541
You guys go ahead.

127
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,083
I’ll grab my stuff from the car and catch up.

128
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,458
Woo! We have a bedroom now! Woo!

129
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,583
Oh!

130
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:33,958
So annoying.

131
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,125
I can’t stay with you alone.

132
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,166
Why?

133
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,541
You want to remind about our beach moment last time, right?

134
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,250
Do you miss that night?

135
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,000
Naow.

136
00:09:58,958 --> 00:09:59,750
Yikes!

137
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,500
So intense.

138
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,208
Uh...

139
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,500
Sorry, haha.

140
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:09,875
Um...

141
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,041
Where did you and Naow, you know, do it?

142
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:14,833
Oops.

143
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,000
Where did you sleep?

144
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:17,875
I’ll take this spot.

145
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,083
I forgot to tell you...

146
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:31,541
I’m a deep sleeper, so feel free
to do whatever you want tonight.

147
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,375
Hello!

148
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,083
Today, the girls will show you how to make...

149
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:54,666
Spaghetti with bacon and sausages stir-fried with chili!

150
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,208
Yay!

151
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,583
Let’s introduce ourselves!

152
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,083
You're here with Prang and...

153
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,375
P'Suay.

154
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,333
We need to chop first.

155
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,375
Let’s start with this.

156
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,708
We need to chop garlic first.

157
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,083
Yes, we need to chop the garlic and dried chili.

158
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,541
Do you need another helper?

159
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,083
Hey!

160
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,541
P'Warang!

161
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,416
Cringe!

162
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,250
You said “ka.”

163
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,708
What? I’m just talking normally.

164
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,666
I mean, seriously, normally?

165
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,166
Hmm.

166
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,666
Do you want to hear your voice from earlier?

167
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,875
I just recorded it, actually.

168
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,000
Let’s stop teasing now.

169
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,541
P'Warang is about to turn.

170
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,000
Oops.

171
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,750
So, when are Jubjib and Thida coming?

172
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,833
I’ve already called them.

173
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:46,708
They said they’re on their way,
probably arriving around late evening.

174
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,000
Late evening, huh?

175
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,125
Yeah, probably late.

176
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,291
We’ll see.

177
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,875
When Thida arrives, she’s definitely going to complain.

178
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,083
Why?

179
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,708
She never eats after 6 PM.

180
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:58,875
What?

181
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,125
Oh, right,

182
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,000
What we gonna do? I totally forgot about that.

183
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,291
Let’s hurry and do it, so we can finish faster. Let’s start!

184
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:11,333
Wait, today I saw you make brownies, right?

185
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,041
Yes!

186
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:17,250
It’s perfect! When she’s irritated,
eating sweets will calm her down and make her happy.

187
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,041
Wow!

188
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,708
She’s living up to the legendary "First Year Couple" title.

189
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,375
You really know her well.

190
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,000
So dramatic!

191
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,708
Not dramatic!

192
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,458
I’ll help you out.

193
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay!

194
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,208
I’ll help you out.

195
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,541
Just put it in here!

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,791
Hurry up, okay?

197
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,125
Okay, okay, I got it.

198
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,375
Okay, we’re at this step now.

199
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:45,875
Oh, right, we didn’t even play yet.

200
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:49,000
Everyone, come eat! Prang made brownies for us!

201
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:51,916
Come on, come on!

202
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,666
Looks delicious!

203
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,041
It’s living up to the hype!

204
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,125
-One piece each.
-Come on, come on!

205
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:00,875
You’re so good at this.

206
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:01,875
Thank you!

207
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,750
No wonder you’re Prang!

208
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,291
Here.

209
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,500
Hmm.

210
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,041
That's a lot.

211
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,625
Well, you ate late, so I thought you might be annoyed.

212
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,458
And when you’re annoyed,
you need sweets. That’s why I brought this for you!

213
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,166
Hey, why did I only get one piece?

214
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:21,958
Exactly!

215
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,208
I ate late, just like Thida.

216
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,333
Why did I only get one?

217
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,250
Right?

218
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,625
Hey, if you’re not going to eat it...

219
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,333
...then let Naow have it!

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,833
Ooh!

221
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,083
Ooh, ooh, Prang! It’s delicious!

222
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,833
You could totally sell this!

223
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,750
Really?

224
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:38,666
Mmm!

225
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,833
Now I feel better.

226
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,916
Actually, I’m planning to open a small café with some friends.

227
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,625
Gracia and Belle!

228
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,708
Mmm.

229
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,625
It smells so good, and it tastes amazing too.

230
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,833
I’ll post a review on my socials for you later.

231
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,208
Thank you so much, P’Lada!

232
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,041
Hope your channel takes off!

233
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,875
Of course, happy to help!

234
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,916
Can I have more? Lots of it!

235
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:57,791
Sure!

236
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,083
(P’Waris)

237
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,375
Come on, girls!

238
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,791
Cheers!

239
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,083
Can I join?

240
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,875
Oh no!

241
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,916
You didn't touch any drinks.
You're so tough.

242
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:25,041
Oh, Every time she drinks, it’s always such a story!

243
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,833
Haha, that’s true!

244
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,666
That’s why I stopped drinking.

245
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,916
I’m trying to make up for the past.

246
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,250
I want to be someone worth being proud of.

247
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,541
So Gyo can feel proud to have me as her girlfriend.

248
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,875
Aww, so sweet!

249
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,916
Oh, for someone as pretty and lonely as me,

250
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,416
even I would want her!

251
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,958
-Oh, stop dreaming!
-Hey, don’t say that!

252
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:50,833
-Oh no!

253
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,166
I’m just kidding, Gyo!

254
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,125
Come on, I’ve prepared a surprise for today.

255
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:55,708
Aha!

256
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,083
So while we can’t go play in the water...

257
00:14:59,208 --> 00:14:59,666
Right.

258
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,833
...we won’t miss out today
because we’ve got a game to play!

259
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,125
And the game is...

260
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,958
This! The game is called "Who is the Queen?"

261
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,541
Ohhh!

262
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:16,208
The rules are everyone draws one card from this deck.

263
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:16,750
Mhm.

264
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,333
And whoever gets the highest card becomes the queen.

265
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:25,500
The queen will then have the right to order the person with the lowest card to confess...

266
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,375
...or do anything they want.

267
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,791
Whoa!

268
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,250
But, but, but...

269
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,541
If someone refuses, they’ll have to finish their drink.

270
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,458
-Finish the glass!
-Yep, bottoms up!

271
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,916
Shall we start, Jupjip?

272
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,333
-Let’s start!
-Alright, you shuffle first.

273
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:42,833
Okay.

274
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,333
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!

275
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,250
-Wait, wait, wait!
-Not like that!

276
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,958
Ohhh, okay, okay.

277
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,541
Alright, here we go.

278
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,208
I don’t usually play stuff like this, you know.

279
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,000
Pass to the left.

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,125
Here you go!

281
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,458
Looks like you’re not very smooth with this, huh?

282
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,458
-Not really, you know?
-So awkward!

283
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,791
Thank you.

284
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,375
Alright.

285
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,000
Thank you.

286
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,875
First round!

287
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,541
Let me take a look first.

288
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,291
Oh my God!

289
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,208
No way.

290
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,875
Alright, everyone, what cards did you get?

291
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,666
One, two, three... wow!

292
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,750
Who has the highest card? Oh!

293
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:16,916
I’m the queen!

294
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
And who got the lowest card?

295
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,375
It’s me.

296
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,083
Phew, I’m safe.

297
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:30,166
Alright, Lada, as the queen,

298
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,666
what do you want Thida to confess or do?

299
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:37,250
Thida, you’d better confess something right now.

300
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,333
No, wait! I’ve been wanting to know this for ages.

301
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,958
What do you want me to confess?

302
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,916
You’re the only one in the group, no one knows anything about your love life!

303
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,958
Right? That’s so true.

304
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:56,208
At least Suay and Jupjip have flirted with some hot guys now and then.

305
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,666
Yeah, just a little bit here and there.

306
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:58,916
With some oppas, right?

307
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,500
I want you to confess, truthfully,

308
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,583
Have you ever loved or liked someone?
Where, how, and when?

309
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,375
Or have you ever had a crush on someone in this group?

310
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,125
Oh, what’s it gonna be?

311
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,625
Oh my, you’re asking too much, Lada.

312
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,833
This one? No way she has ever been in love.

313
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,583
I’ve known Thida since middle school.

314
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,500
I’ve never seen her with a boyfriend.

315
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,333
Oh!

316
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,833
Stop!

317
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:22,791
I didn’t ask you.

318
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,958
Confess, Thida.

319
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:25,666
We’re curious.

320
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,541
It’s not certain.

321
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,541
Ugh.

322
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,750
No way!

323
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,166
Annoying!

324
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,500
Ugh!

325
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,958
We missed out on the juicy secrets of Thida’s love life.

326
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:41,541
True.

327
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:45,500
I’m not trading one drink for a lifetime of teasing from you guys.

328
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,666
-Oh, come on.
-Just a little?

329
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,666
Alright, next round. Not giving up!

330
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,958
Starting over, let’s go!

331
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,708
Oh my!

332
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,291
Why are you so heavy? You’re skinny, aren’t you?

333
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,916
Take it easy, Lada.

334
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:15,375
Alee doesn’t care at all. He never looks after me.

335
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,458
Hold on, Lada. Stop complaining.

336
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:18,791
Stop complaining already.

337
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,000
I haven’t even started yet!

338
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,333
Hang in there, Lada.

339
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:25,833
I’m not drunk!

340
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,791
Take it easy, will you?

341
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,333
Drunk.

342
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,000
No!

343
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,708
Sit down slowly.

344
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,333
Ow, ow, Your head, Your head!

345
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,208
Ugh, it's so hot.

346
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,166
Take it easy, take it easy!

347
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,583
Lada, up! Ouch!

348
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:47,791
Lie down.

349
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,416
No.

350
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,916
You drank like there’s no tomorrow!

351
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,583
Naow, go shower first.

352
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:06,291
I’ll take care of this drunk Lada over here.

353
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,708
I thought...

354
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,125
you would shower together.

355
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,291
No.

356
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,583
Go on.

357
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,416
No.

358
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,916
Why’d you hit me?

359
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,416
I couldn’t resist.

360
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,000
Coming or not?

361
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,333
Go already.

362
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,166
Go already.

363
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:36,916
Okay.

364
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,583
I'll hurry back to keep you company, okay?

365
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,708
You’ll end up missing me for a long time.

366
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,000
Alright.

367
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,500
I'll wait, okay?

368
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,208
Okay.

369
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,333
Naughty!

370
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,500
Don’t start missing me too soon, Gyo.

371
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,250
I bet you’re already missing me.

372
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,375
How did you know?

373
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:56,916
Okay.

374
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,833
Alee, don’t you ever pay attention to me?

375
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,208
Fine. Just you wait.

376
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,125
You’ll see.

377
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,666
Soaking in the water even when you’re sick?

378
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,750
You still have a fever.

379
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,500
What if you get even sicker?

380
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,875
Warang, please step out. I’m going to shower.

381
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,750
Here, put this on first.

382
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,958
You can step out, Warang. I can manage on my own.

383
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:10,750
No.

384
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:15,083
You’re still feverish. What if you faint?

385
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,833
Here.

386
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,041
I won’t peek.

387
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:22,583
Hmm.

388
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:29,958
Are you done yet?

389
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:34,708
Don’t turn around.

390
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:48,958
Does it hurt?

391
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,083
Uh...

392
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,500
Just a little.

393
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,291
Does it hurt?

394
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:00,916
I’m sorry.

395
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:02,708
You’re all wet now.

396
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,291
Why are you apologizing to me?

397
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,208
I’m fine, really.

398
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:13,583
It’s you I’m worried about.
What would you do if I wasn’t here?

399
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,375
But you are here.

400
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,000
And?

401
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,166
How would you like me to take care of you, Prang?

402
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:36,833
Gyo.

403
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:41,500
Gyo.

404
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:56,083
Gyo.

405
00:24:58,291 --> 00:24:59,708
Should you shower first?

406
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,541
Come on, let me help you up.

407
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,666
1 2 3

408
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:29,833
Where’s Lada, was she heading downstairs?

409
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,000
Gyo.

410
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:03,541
Are you drunk, Gyo?

411
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,583
Maybe you should shower first.

412
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,125
I’m not drunk.

413
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,541
I’m okay.

414
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,375
Can I?

415
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:37,791
Don’t you want to know, Gyo?

416
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:43,875
What you did to me last night?

417
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,375
Right now, let me.

418
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,500
What’s going on, Suay?

419
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:12,708
I don’t know. I came down to send Thida and Jubjib off and found Lada passed out on the couch, so I woke her up.

420
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,041
-Hey!
-Oh!

421
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:19,333
Why am I sleeping here? Why didn’t I wash my face before bed?

422
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:22,875
My face is going to wrinkle now!

423
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,500
You, Gyo!

424
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,041
You kicked me out, didn’t you?

425
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,541
Calm down, Lada.

426
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:33,625
Last night, I remember that Naow and I carried you to the room.

427
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,666
And you kept mumbling.

428
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,583
Complaining why Alee didn’t join the trip.

429
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,958
And after that, I fell asleep, didn’t I, Naow?

430
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:41,958
Exactly, exactly.

431
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,500
I finished showering and couldn’t find you anymore.

432
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,000
I thought you went out to call Alee.

433
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,083
Right, so why are you yelling at me?

434
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,250
Yes. No, you shouldn't.

435
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:51,166
No.

436
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,041
Not true.

437
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:55,166
Someone like me would never go to bed without washing my face.

438
00:30:55,875 --> 00:31:00,583
I would never ruin my youthful complexion and let it wrinkle like this!

439
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:05,500
Oops.

440
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,125
Oh my.

441
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:11,708
You look so..

442
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,958
True, I can confirm that.

443
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:17,625
I told her to go back to her room and shower, but she refused.

444
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,500
See?

445
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:20,250
No.

446
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,000
That’s enough. You'll see, Alee.

447
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,083
Give me that!

448
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:28,583
Hey, you!

449
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:30,375
Something’s off about her.

450
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:39,541
Hmm.

451
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:40,666
Warang, by the way,

452
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,708
why are you dressed like that?

453
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,208
This isn’t...

454
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:47,708
like you at all.

455
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:51,916
Exactly, Prang, why are you wearing this outfit?

456
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:54,875
That’s Warang’s favorite outfit!

457
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:57,166
Or is it...

458
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,833
That...

459
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:05,000
-It’s not like that!
-I haven’t showered yet! Let me shower first!

460
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,416
-Alright, see you! See you!
-Wait a minute!

461
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:08,500
Just like that?

462
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,791
Looks like someone got punished for being naughty last night.

463
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,458
Oh my!

464
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,666
Wait, hold on!

465
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,875
Manaow, did something happen to your neck?

466
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:20,541
Are you allergic to dust?

467
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:22,416
What part of the neck are you talking about?

468
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:23,291
Naow.

469
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,166
It’s clear.

470
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,000
Naow.

471
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,666
I'm not allergic to dust.

472
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:28,916
I'm not allergic to Gyo.

473
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:31,916
Naow.

474
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:33,583
Go on now.

475
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:38,166
Looks like our friend has turned into a tiger!

476
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,791
Wow.

477
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:47,208
Prang’s spaghetti is so gooddddd! Like, a million times "D"! DDDDD!

478
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,041
Really?

479
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,166
Thank you!

480
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,916
But honestly, Thida’s cooking is even better.

481
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:55,041
Too bad she had to leave early for urgent work.

482
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,500
So you missed out on Thida’s cooking.

483
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,416
Really, Gyo?

484
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:00,125
Yes!

485
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:03,750
Thida is amazing at cooking!

486
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:05,625
I still remember when we were at camp.

487
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,833
Chef Thida handled it all by herself.

488
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:08,625
Ahhh!

489
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:10,125
Back when she was in school.

490
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:12,083
She even competed and won first prize!

491
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:12,916
Whoa.

492
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:13,750
Are you serious?

493
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,583
I think...

494
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,750
I think I saw their picture on Facebook.

495
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,833
Hold on, let me show you.

496
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:18,708
-Hey!
-Just a second.

497
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,458
Wait, you have a picture to prove it?

498
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,833
-I don't remember it anymore.
-Proof!

499
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:22,500
Here!

500
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,458
Let me see too.

501
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:24,958
Wow!

502
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:28,000
See? She's really talented, right?

503
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:29,750
I still wonder...

504
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,750
If she's so good, why not just study to be a chef?

505
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,833
Wow.

506
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,666
Wait, P'Suay, let me see too!

507
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:36,750
Here.

508
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,250
Thida has grow a lot.

509
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,875
She's cute, really.

510
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:41,666
Yeah, she's cute.

511
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:42,375
Wait...

512
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:45,875
The one who's change a lot... is this one!

513
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,458
Who is that? Hey!

514
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,333
Who’s this?

515
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,250
Why are you showing this?

516
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,125
Oh!

517
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:51,208
She's cute.

518
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:51,958
No way.

519
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,416
Can I see it?

520
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,125
Um...

521
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,250
-Please?
-Let her see, she's cute.

522
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,166
Thank you.

523
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,166
My, my, Prang.

524
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,541
Looking at Warang’s picture and smiling so brightly like that...

525
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:13,958
I really want to know...

526
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,041
When did you start liking Warang?

527
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,041
Well, actually...

528
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,000
Since middle school.

529
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,208
I went to visit P'Thida at her school.

530
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:25,583
And I accidentally met P'Warang there, so...

531
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:27,458
Aw!

532
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:30,208
Love at first sight, huh?

533
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,000
Awww.

534
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:34,291
You two are so sweet.

535
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:36,750
I wish I had that too, you know.

536
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,458
I think you should try manifest.

537
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,916
Love at first sight.

538
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,125
Love when I first see.

539
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:41,791
Yeah.

540
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,875
Aren’t they a love-at-first-sight couple?

541
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,166
Um...

542
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:49,041
I’ve never seen this before, you know.

543
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,583
Oh.

544
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:57,875
This picture, Thida must have posted it a long time ago. That’s probably why you haven’t seen it.

545
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:02,416
Are you done eating? I’ll help clean up.

546
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:04,458
-Okay.
-I’ll clean up now.

547
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:05,833
Here.

548
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,291
Okay.

549
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,750
Everyone here has such cute couples.

550
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,708
Hmm.

551
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,958
Tomorrow is Monday again.

552
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,333
I hate Mondays.

553
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,791
Me too.

554
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:22,791
Sigh.

555
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,041
I don’t want to go.

556
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,208
Oh, by the way...

557
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,166
Gyo.

558
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,250
When are you going to get a proper job?

559
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:33,458
Or are you planning to mooch off of Naow?

560
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:34,750
What?

561
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,625
Lada.

562
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:39,500
There, there.

563
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,041
Just kidding, just kidding.

564
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,541
But I can support you, you know?

565
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,375
Yes, Daddy Naow.

566
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:48,250
Ugh.

567
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:50,625
No need to support anything.

568
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:52,666
Why not?

569
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,000
I think...

570
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,166
I just want to...

571
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:57,750
rest my body,

572
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,541
make sure

573
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,250
and then find a proper job.

574
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:03,041
That’s good. Rest well.

575
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,083
It’s understandable.

576
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,666
-Watch what you’re saying.
-Look at that side-eye.

577
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,208
Hurry and find one, Suay. Hurry.

578
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,958
An email confirming a job offer.

579
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:22,708
This is you doing, right?

580
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,291
Well...

581
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,833
my company was hiring,

582
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:32,541
And I saw that your qualifications matched perfectly.
Like, spot-on. So I just...

583
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:33,166
Well...

584
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,333
If we work at the same place,

585
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:41,000
then when we go to work, we can go together.

586
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:43,750
That way, you won’t have to be alone. You won’t feel lonely.

587
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,958
Exactly. You won’t have to deal with problems.

588
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:49,958
like a long-distance relationship, like me and Alee.

589
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,583
And another thing, Gyo.

590
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:56,416
If you work at the same company as me, I'll get to be your senior.

591
00:36:57,208 --> 00:37:00,583
Like, "Do you want me to teach you?"

592
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:02,333
Oh!

593
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:04,916
From now on, Gyo...

594
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,750
You’ll definitely get scolded by Senior Naow.

595
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,458
So it’ll be like,

596
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:15,750
"Can senior love junior?" Something like that, right?

597
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:18,208
Oh, stop it!

598
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,041
Just try scolding me, you’ll see what happens.

599
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,041
Oh! so scary.

600
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:23,583
But do you love me?

601
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:24,083
Aww.

602
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:25,833
What are we even doing here?

603
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,125
She catch every little thing.

604
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:41,958
(Waris : Don’t forget our agreement.)

605
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:48,500
This is Gyoza, who’s starting her trial period today.

606
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,666
Waris has one strict rule,

607
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:53,750
Employees who haven’t passed probation can’t have a boyfriend.

608
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:55,791
There’s such a rule?

609
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:56,791
Gyo.

610
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,250
Oh, Naow!

611
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,666
Wait, you two know each other?
