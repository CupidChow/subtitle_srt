00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,960
"Love Senior The Series Special EP."

2
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,200
If you knew that your trusted best friend

3
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,960
felt more than friendship for you,

4
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
What would you do?

5
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,880
Aof’s laptop is damaged from the impact.

6
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,039
The project files are all in this computer, right?

7
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,520
If we have to redo everything,

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,840
it’s impossible to finish in time.

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,239
Why wouldn’t it be?

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,680
Did you forget?

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,120
That you have friends in the same field as you

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,400
who can help?

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,680
Hi, Gorgeous! P'Lada is here to help!

14
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,639
(P'Warang)

15
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,199
(P'Warang)

16
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,960
(P'Warang)

17
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,680
Prang, are you okay?

18
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
I noticed Warang seems stressed.

19
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,520
I don’t want to be just friends with you, Warang.

20
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,240
The feelings I have for her,

21
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,280
it’s just friendship and goodwill.

22
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,800
That’s all.

23
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,800
P'Thida,

24
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,759
I have something I need your help with.

25
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,960
I knew you’d be here.

26
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,199
I forget something.

27
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,840
You don’t look okay.

28
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,479
Is it about Prang?

29
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,040
Warang.

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,480
These flowers...

31
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,439
The ones you gave me on our graduation day.

32
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,759
You’re still keeping them?

33
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,759
(I don’t want to be just friends, Warang.)

34
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,879
You’re probably wondering

35
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,600
why I never told you about this, right?

36
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,920
The truth is,

37
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,600
I thought of telling you during our first year.

38
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,759
But when I decided to,

39
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
you already liked Gyo.

40
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,839
So I figured

41
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,879
there was no point in saying it.

42
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,120
So all I could do was

43
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,839
accept the truth.

44
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,040
Just like I told you before.

45
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,519
That I had so many chances

46
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,920
but didn’t take them myself.

47
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,079
The way..Prang act differently,

48
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,360
because she found out about this.

49
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,199
If you knew that your trusted best friend

50
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,240
felt more than friendship,

51
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,759
What would you do?

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,800
I’m sorry.

53
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,279
I forgot about it in the recipe book I gave her.

54
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,800
And I’m sorry

55
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,120
that it’s my carelessness that caused this.

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,839
It made Prang feel bad.

57
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,360
You know what?

58
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,040
Prang kept apologizing to me over and over,

59
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,720
even though she did nothing wrong.

60
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,639
I’m the one

61
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,240
who’s at fault.

62
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,279
Thida.

63
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,160
Are you okay?

64
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,639
Of course.

65
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,839
Why wouldn’t I be?

66
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,120
Honestly, I don’t feel that way about you anymore.

67
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,720
After this, I just hope

68
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,319
you’ll be the reason she smile,

69
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,199
just like every day before.

70
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,439
I’ll be the reason,

71
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,319
just like she

72
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,079
is my smile and happiness.

73
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Don’t worry.

74
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,600
Oh.

75
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,879
Also,

76
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,920
she sent some treats for you.

77
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,800
Oh, really?

78
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,000
Then I’ll be off.

79
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,079
Thanks so much.

80
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,040
Good luck.

81
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,680
If you need anything, just let me know, okay?

82
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,600
I don’t need anything

83
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,399
but you.

84
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,559
Yay!

85
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,919
You’re amazing!

86
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,200
Cheers!

87
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,519
Naow, you’re still up?

88
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,639
Is there a problem with work?

89
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,600
No.

90
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,879
I just want to review before presenting again.

91
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,080
If you’re tired, take a break.

92
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,440
P’Waris said everyone can come to work late tomorrow.

93
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Careful, your face will get old.

94
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,919
If I gets old, will you not love me anymore?

95
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,799
Who’s going to let you get old?

96
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Here.

97
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,799
Come on, let me apply this for you.

98
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,879
Aren’t you going to apply it, Gyo?

99
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,639
I will apply after you finishe.

100
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,799
Let me do it for you, then.

101
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,919
Naow!

102
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,480
That’s enough!

103
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,440
Let’s sleep.

104
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,600
Oh.

105
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,840
Where did all the staff go, Belle?

106
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,279
They're all leave.

107
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,919
I don't know why they all took leave at the same time.

108
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,720
Did you bake something and forget about it?

109
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,519
No.

110
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,519
You know I can’t bake.

111
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,120
But it smells like something’s burning, Belle.

112
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,320
P’Warang!

113
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,600
What did you do?

114
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,919
My kitchen is ruined!

115
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,399
It's obvious, right?

116
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,480
Don’t be mad at me, okay?

117
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,559
I’ll clean everything up, spotless, I promise.

118
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,039
And for anything ruined,

119
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,399
I’ll replace it.

120
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,360
As for this cake…

121
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,799
I think you shouldn’t eat it.

122
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,279
I think it’s…

123
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,639
Thank you.

124
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:54,759
I thought…

125
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,080
you’d forgotten.

126
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,000
How could I forget the birthday of someone I love?

127
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,559
I’m sorry.

128
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,320
For letting you overthink for so long.

129
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,759
P’Warang,

130
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,759
you knew?

131
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,039
Yes.

132
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,960
I found out from Thida.

133
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,519
And I also know

134
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,720
How bad that made my little sweetheart feel.

135
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,679
How much it hurt her.

136
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,399
Prang,

137
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,919
P’Thida and I

138
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,600
are just sincere friends.

139
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,120
No matter what happened in the past,

140
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,000
Thida doesn’t have those feelings anymore.

141
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,159
And now, Thida is genuinely happy

142
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,039
to see us in love.

143
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,039
There, there.

144
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:12,399
Don’t cry.

145
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,759
Here.

146
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,480
Chocolate cake.

147
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,200
It’ll cheer you up.

148
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,559
And finally make you Miss Overthinking Love.

149
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,519
I was actually going to make a smiley-face cake for you,

150
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,799
because I want you to smile more.

151
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,679
Like this, like this!

152
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,039
Smiling yet?

153
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,600
No more crying, okay?

154
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,120
Alright?

155
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,519
It’s okay.

156
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,120
I already have my smile.

157
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,600
Thank you.

158
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,480
My smile.

159
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,519
Happy birthday,

160
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:10,840
my love.

161
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,639
I love you, P’Warang.

162
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,799
I love you too.

163
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:30,480
(The shop is closed today.)

164
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,440
The shop is closed today...

165
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,320
Thank you for helping me last night.

166
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,480
Did you buy treats for the café owner?

167
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,640
If you don’t want it, that’s fine.

168
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,440
I’ll take it.

169
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,599
I was just teasing.

170
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
Thank you.

171
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,680
Actually,

172
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,319
that night, I didn’t mean to.

173
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,160
I know.

174
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,200
Even if I tell anyone,

175
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,759
no one would believe me.

176
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,200
It’s my fault.

177
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,440
I’m the one to blame.

178
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,119
I hurt others.

179
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,160
But I’m not evil enough to ruin someone lives.

180
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,200
I believe you.

181
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,559
I believe that you regret everything that happened.

182
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,279
I believe you didn’t mean to.

183
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,960
And I believes,

184
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,240
that P’Tarn isn’t that bad.

185
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,839
Everything you did

186
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,960
was because you loved P’Naow.

187
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,359
I understand.

188
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,480
I have been there,

189
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,359
at the point where you’d do anything

190
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,720
just to be loved by them.

191
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,000
Until you forget

192
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,759
that you need to love yourself too.

193
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,759
P’Tarn, can you try loving yourself again?

194
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,720
Try smiling,

195
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,799
like you used to.

196
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,759
Laugh, like you used to laugh.

197
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,480
Everything

198
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,480
has become just the past now.

199
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:51,000
Let the old Tarn inside you

200
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,920
come back to life again.

201
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:12,839
It’s okay.

202
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,200
It’s okay now.

203
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,599
Thank you.

204
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,880
Gyo, are you hungry?
Should I take you to grab food before the office?

205
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,680
Naow, good luck today.

206
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,680
I know you can do it.

207
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,359
If I succeed,

208
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,480
can I ask for a reward?

209
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,319
Alright, stop it, or we’ll be late.

210
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,119
The last day.

211
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,519
What is it?

212
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,039
Not telling.

213
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,279
When you finish presenting,

214
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,960
I’ll announce it to everyone.

215
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,079
Let’s go, or we’ll be late.

216
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,799
It’s the last day for me too.

217
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,480
-The pitching?
-Yes.

218
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,440
-Will they make it?
-They’ve been in there a while.

219
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,400
They worked all night, they’ll make it.

220
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Of course.

221
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,559
Let’s hope it passes.

222
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,119
Hey, they’re coming.

223
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,839
They look so tense.

224
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,519
P’Waris, how was the project? Did it pass? You were in there so long.

225
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,440
I and P'Waris did ours best.

226
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:23,480
Like, Kirin and Kirin’s partner...

227
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,480
...approved it.

228
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,000
We did it! We did it!

229
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,680
And Kirin immediately approved the project.

230
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,359
Amazing!

231
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,160
Tonight, I’ll take you all to celebrate at Sweetness Café.

232
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:58,400
Wow!

233
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,279
Naow.

234
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,480
Before the party, let’s check the site first.

235
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,440
I want to wrap this up by the end of the week.

236
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,359
Okay.

237
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,920
Does the party have a theme, P’Waris?

238
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,119
How about a prom night theme?

239
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,920
It’ll fulfill P’Mujji’s childhood dream.

240
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,440
Oh!

241
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,880
Time to dress!

242
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,400
I need time for makeup and hair, so I’m leaving now.

243
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,440
Go, go. See you tonight.

244
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,160
-See you!
-Get ready.

245
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,759
Go, go.

246
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,880
See you at the café tonight.

247
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,880
Don’t forget my reward.

248
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,440
See you.

249
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,400
(You are my senior.)

250
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,279
(I can truly be myself when I’m with you.)

251
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,880
Gyo, look over there! There’s a rainbow!

252
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,240
Hey!

253
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,519
You’re right!

254
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,599
Did you know, Gyo?

255
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,519
If you make a wish on a rainbow, it’ll come true.

256
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,799
Really?

257
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,279
Wow, you took so long. What did you wish for?

258
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,960
I wished for my memories to come back.

259
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,960
I want to remember everything about us.

260
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:05,880
Good

261
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,799
or bad,

262
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,079
it’s still

263
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,400
The memories between us.

264
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,279
I don’t want them to disappear.

265
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:21,880
And you, Naow?

266
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,559
What did you wish for?

267
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:29,119
I’m not telling. If I tell, it won’t come true.

268
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,599
Hey!

269
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That’s not fair!

270
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,599
Not fair!

271
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,680
What are you filming?

272
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,160
Nothing.

273
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,680
Stop!

274
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,279
Stop right now.

275
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:36,839
Turn it off!

276
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,759
You’re just too cute.

277
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:39,839
Of course, I am.

278
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,839
Get the camera from me.

279
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Okay.

280
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:54,880
Gyo.

281
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,359
Gyo, do you still want to know?

282
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,279
What I wished for back then?

283
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,920
I wished to wake up to Gyo every morning.

284
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,680
I wished to fall asleep beside you every night.

285
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,400
I wished for us

286
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,240
to stay together like this forever.

287
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,680
These flowers,

288
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,400
I bought them for you on our anniversary.

289
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,720
I’ve never thrown them away.

290
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:20,720
I can’t change the past.

291
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,440
But I want these flowers

292
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,839
to symbolize a promise.

293
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,279
That I will love you forever.

294
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,200
Can I replace our bad memories

295
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,000
with good ones from today?

296
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,799
Will you marry me,

297
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,200
Gyo.

298
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,599
Yes.

299
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,519
Congratulations!

300
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,480
Congratulations!

301
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,000
So sweet.

302
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,440
Congrats, Gyo!

303
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,319
P’Waris.

304
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:41,640
So,

305
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,160
about the rule...

306
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,559
Did you really believe it?

307
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,519
So, Naow, you knew?

308
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,920
P’Mujji told me.

309
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,319
Come on.

310
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,800
Want a tissue or my shoulder to cry on?

311
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,320
What’s this?

312
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,199
I happen to be P’Waris’ little junior,

313
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:40,320
so she invited me.

314
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,559
So, what will it be? Tissue or my shoulder?

315
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,320
About that night,

316
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,400
Tarn, I’m sorry, P’Gyo.

317
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,480
It’s okay, Tarn.

318
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,760
It’s in the past.

319
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,440
Let’s move on together.

320
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,800
Thank you.

321
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,559
For everything.

322
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,519
For all the love you’ve given me.

323
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,079
Thank you, Naow.

324
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,280
Let’s stay together like this until the very end.
