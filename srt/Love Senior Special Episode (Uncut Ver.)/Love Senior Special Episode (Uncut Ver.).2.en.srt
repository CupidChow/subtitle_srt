00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,916
"Love Senior The Series Special EP."

2
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,250
Warang, by the way,

3
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,791
why are you dressed like that?

4
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,208
It's...

5
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,750
Or is it...

6
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,416
That...

7
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,250
Wait, hold on!

8
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,625
Manaow, did something happen to your neck?

9
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,333
Are you allergic to dust?

10
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not allergic to dust.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,250
I'm allergic to Gyo.

12
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,083
Naow.

13
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:10,916
Go on now.

14
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:15,500
Looks like our friend has turned into a tiger!

15
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:17,375
Gyo.

16
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:20,458
When are you going to get a proper job?

17
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:21,666
I just want to...

18
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,250
rest my body,

19
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,041
make sure

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,250
and then find a proper job.

21
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,500
An email confirming a job offer.

22
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,250
This is you doing, right?

23
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,291
See you at the office, newbie!

24
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,750
This morning, The senior like me have to stop by to meet a client first.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,875
P.S. Don’t be late, okay?

26
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,125
Otherwise, P’Waris will growling up in your face.

27
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,041
P’Naow, huh?

28
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,333
Just reading this, I can already imagine the face she’s making.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,333
I’ll pinch her until she’s blue!

30
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,125
P’Warit!

31
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,625
This is Gyoza, she’s starting her trial period today.

32
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,166
Hello.

33
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,041
Hello.

34
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,791
Looking forward to working with you!

35
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:05,791
Mujji,

36
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,625
Can you help guide and teach her the ropes?

37
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,500
Of course, boss!

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,458
And if,

39
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,666
you don’t understand something
or have any questions about work,

40
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,875
Don’t hesitate to ask me.

41
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,458
Thank you.

42
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,208
Hey, little monster?

43
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,625
So, Naow, how do you think you’ll resolve this client issue?

44
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,291
Tell me.

45
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,583
Good,

46
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,958
it's good you replied to the client like that.

47
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,250
How about,

48
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,458
you come back to the office,

49
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,958
and we'll talk about the detail later.

50
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,791
Oh, Naow Naow.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,708
The person named Gyo,

52
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,916
she’s here now.

53
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,625
She’s cute.

54
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,166
But I’m not sure if she’s as competent as you said.

55
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,125
Hurry back, okay? I’m waiting.

56
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:14,750
Okay.

57
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,750
This room is like a co-working space.

58
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,791
I come here often too.

59
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,250
If you ever feel like not sitting at your desk,

60
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,625
you can come hang out here with me.

61
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,625
P’Waris is so beautiful and kind,

62
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,791
and she’s so friendly too!

63
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,833
I could tell from when you were talking to someone named Naow.

64
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,041
Oh!

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,708
You're Naow, Waris's little monster, aren't you?

66
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,875
Those two...

67
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,375
They're the closest pair in the company.

68
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,166
They always work together.

69
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,583
And this duo...

70
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,458
Every time they go pitch a project,

71
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,875
They always land the client.

72
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,166
So Naow is definitely an exception.

73
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:10,875
Hold on a sec.

74
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,958
No, send it later. Wait for the final draft first.

75
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:28,833
(I've arrived at the office. Where are you, Gyo)

76
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,458
(I'm in the co-working space room)

77
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:41,750
(Alright, I'm coming. Don’t miss me too much while you wait)

78
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,375
Gyo.

79
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:48,958
Yes.

80
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,500
But P'Waris has one strict rule

81
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,958
Employees who haven’t passed probation

82
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:54,791
can’t have a lover.

83
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,916
There’s a rule like that?

84
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,791
Yep. There’s a history behind it.

85
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,333
A new employee and their supervisor

86
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,583
started dating

87
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,041
They had a fight, and the project they worked on

88
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,125
completely fell apart.

89
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,416
In that case, P'Waris fired both of them.

90
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:14,166
But the reason for waiting until new employees pass probation

91
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,416
is to ensure that the employee is responsible enough

92
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,833
to separate work matters from

93
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:21,958
personal.

94
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:33,291
Actually, this kind of rule is common in many companies.

95
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,333
Just waiting to pass probation is already lenient, I think.

96
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,333
Just don’t break the rule.

97
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,833
The company’s probation is not too hard to pass, you know.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,458
Alright, let’s look over here.

99
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,708
Actually, you can charge
your devices here too if you want to sit here.

100
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,791
Gyo.

101
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,625
Oh, Naow.

102
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,208
Perfect timing.

103
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,458
So.

104
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,958
You two know each other?

105
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:03,000
Turns out we’re senior
and junior from the same university

106
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,500
Really?

107
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,291
Wow, you never told me, Gyo.

108
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,458
Alright, I’ll let P'Waris know that Naow has arrived.

109
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,291
Looks like she might call a meeting.

110
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:18,833
Okay.

111
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,541
Okay.

112
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,125
Here you go.

113
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:40,625
Thanks.

114
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,916
One large iced Americano, low sugar.

115
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,416
Can I leave this post-it note on your store’s board?

116
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:58,958
Oh.

117
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,833
Sure, I’ll take care of it.

118
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:20,958
Alright.

119
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,875
I’ll stop by again soon.

120
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:20,916
Hello.

121
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,500
Little Gyo.

122
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,375
What little?

123
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,708
You told me yourself, didn’t you?

124
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,375
The one who comes first is the senior.

125
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,333
The one who comes later is the junior.

126
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,541
If we come along, we’re friends.

127
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,833
But in this company,

128
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,083
You joined after me.

129
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,291
So you must be..

130
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,166
Gyo, the junior of Senior Naow, right?

131
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,541
But if you’re in this room, then you’ll be..

132
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,250
Naow, stop teasing me already.

133
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,333
You know I’m not teasing you.

134
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,541
See you in the meeting room.

135
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,416
Little Naow.

136
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,541
One hot chocolate.

137
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,625
Chocolate is good for you. It helps stimulate endorphin production in the brain,

138
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,375
which is beneficial for your mind

139
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,666
and helps reduce stress too.

140
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,208
This is dark chocolate.

141
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,708
I once read that chocolate has many benefits.

142
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,458
It helps stimulate endorphin production in the brain.

143
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,833
and,

144
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,000
eating chocolate regularly

145
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,625
can strengthen your heart and blood vessels.

146
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,458
Why not take the medical exam instead of engineering?

147
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,000
I know this because I care.

148
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,625
I know because I intentionally bought it for you.

149
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,416
So?

150
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,875
do customers hit on you often?

151
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,291
Someone hit on me?

152
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,083
I had no idea. I wasn’t paying attention.

153
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,833
Maybe they didn’t know

154
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,583
that I already have a boyfriend.

155
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,291
Exactly.

156
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,333
What if I hadn’t been there to see it?

157
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,208
Hmm.

158
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,208
Then you’ll have to stay with me more often, P'Warang.

159
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,833
I want everyone to see how adorable my girlfriend is.

160
00:11:58,833 --> 00:11:59,625
Look.

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,625
Even when you’re so angry, you’re still cute.

162
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,166
Stop it.

163
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,583
Oh.

164
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,458
Does it hurt?

165
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,791
I told you to be careful.

166
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,708
It’s all red now.

167
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,416
Be more careful next time.

168
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,041
Thank you.

169
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:37,875
Silly.

170
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,000
Does it hurt?

171
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,541
My forehead hurts more.

172
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,125
Let me see.

173
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,708
You’re such a silly one.

174
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,541
How’s everyone doing?

175
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,208
Hello there.

176
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,875
Hello.

177
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,458
Wow, lots of work.

178
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,416
Just a bit, yeah.

179
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,125
Alright, today I’ve called this meeting

180
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,375
for two announcements.

181
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:28,958
First, I’d like to introduce our new staff member, Gyoza.

182
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,666
It’s a pleasure to be here.

183
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:48,916
Take a seat.

184
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,333
Yes.

185
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,666
While Gyo is interning at our company, she’ll be placed on Naow’s team.

186
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,750
Welcome to Team P'Naow, Gyo.

187
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,541
Nice to meet you.

188
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,041
P'Naow.

189
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,125
I’ll do my best to work hard.

190
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,833
And for the second announcement,

191
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,875
our company’s big project, for which we pitched the concept,

192
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,791
has been approved.

193
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,291
Yay!

194
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,333
For this project, I’ll have Naow take the lead.

195
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,833
You was the one who got the concept approved.

196
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,750
Got it.

197
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,583
I’ll do my very best.

198
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,083
And if this project succeeds,

199
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,125
Gyo,

200
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,333
since you’re part of Naow’s team,

201
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,291
I’ll approve your probation early, no need to wait three months.

202
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,958
Thank you.

203
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,416
As for everyone else,

204
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,166
your bonus is waiting for you.

205
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,958
Next, just keep working hard, alright?

206
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,708
-Sure!
-Absolutely!

207
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,375
Then, Naow will start teaching you the work.

208
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,875
Make sure to work hard

209
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,541
so I'll pass probation.

210
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,833
At the office, why are you acting so strange?

211
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,166
Is something wrong?

212
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,791
Don’t you know about P'Waris’ rule?

213
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,958
What rule? I don’t know.

214
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,125
I didn’t care either.

215
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,291
I’ve been so busy with my own work.

216
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,250
Otherwise, if I had free time

217
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,083
I would think about you.

218
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,625
I’ve been working hard,

219
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,958
before I became project leader

220
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,041
You must be really tired.

221
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,666
I’m sorry.

222
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,458
Why are you apologizing?

223
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,291
I’m not angry with you.

224
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,458
So can you tell me now,

225
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,875
Why do you act like you don’t want anyone to know we’re a couple?

226
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,541
And what’s P'Waris’ rule?

227
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,583
Actually, P'Waris, she...

228
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,500
It’s nothing.

229
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,666
I just

230
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,166
want to prove myself to others.

231
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,041
That I work here because of my own ability

232
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,833
Not because

233
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,666
My girlfriend is the manager.

234
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,916
I don’t want people to look down on you.

235
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,750
But I want everyone to know

236
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,791
That you are my girlfriend.

237
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,000
What if someone hits on you when I’m in the office?

238
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:22,833
Huh?

239
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,875
Shouldn’t I be the one who’s worried?

240
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,291
Because it seems like my girlfriend is the hot one.

241
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,625
The little monster in the office.

242
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,541
Hot?

243
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,083
What do you mean by hot?

244
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,875
Huh?

245
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,041
Didn’t you say you were hungry?

246
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,333
Let’s go eat.

247
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,208
Yeah, I’m hungry.

248
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,375
Can I have some Gyo, please?

249
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,250
Is this customer heartbroken?

250
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,541
She didn't touch any of her order.

251
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,333
Gossiping about customers is against the store rules.

252
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,500
Sorry, P'Belle.

253
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,333
It looks so sad.

254
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,583
(Chic shop, delicious cakes, confirmed by Jade La)

255
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,041
Jubjib : Beautiful shop, 5 stars cakes.

256
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,375
Hmm.

257
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,125
Don’t forget to eat this after your meal.

258
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,375
It’ll settle your stomach.

259
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,166
And make easy digestion.

260
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,125
You’ll feel refreshed tomorrow.

261
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,791
Thank you, P'Warang.

262
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,833
What are you looking at?

263
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,041
P'Lada reviewed the cakes for me.

264
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,041
Let me see.

265
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:29,708
Here.

266
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,875
So cute.

267
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,208
Other seniors are commenting too.

268
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,291
SuayNo1: I’d give it 10 stars!

269
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,208
What are you commenting, Suay?

270
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,333
Prangggg : Thank you.

271
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,125
Here, I’ll take it out for you.

272
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,458
Thanks.

273
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,833
It’s time to sleep.

274
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,458
You need to wake up early tomorrow.

275
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,000
Okay.

276
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,791
Or maybe you don’t want to sleep yet?

277
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,833
I’m going to sleep now.

278
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:16,583
Go ahead and sleep.

279
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,083
Cover me too.

280
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,916
Or do you really not want to sleep?

281
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:25,958
I’m going to sleep, really.

282
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,875
I think this part needs to be revised.

283
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,166
Okay, I'll check it.

284
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:57,291
I’ll coordinate with them to double-check this.

285
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,750
Okay.

286
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,125
In that case, can you take this to Naow for me?

287
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,125
Sure.

288
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:17,916
Here.

289
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,458
You look tired.

290
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,791
Can you tell just by looking at my face?

291
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,083
No.

292
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,750
But I think

293
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,000
I know you well.

294
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:44,166
I can tell what you’re thinking right now.

295
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:51,125
Do you know what I’m thinking now?

296
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,791
Hey, Gyo, Naow.

297
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,833
Here’s your pen that you dropped.

298
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,291
Wow, you found it?

299
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:52,291
Yes, here it is.

300
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,833
There’s only one, if I couldn’t find it, it would have been bad.

301
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,291
I’m leaving now.

302
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,291
Thank you.

303
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:03,875
Did you drop your pen again?

304
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,791
I’ve got the flour.

305
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,208
I’ve got the eggs.

306
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:44,750
Jam.

307
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,125
okay.

308
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:49,666
Oh.

309
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:51,583
We’re out of sugar.

310
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:08,958
Let me help.

311
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:16,041
Why didn’t you call me to help with the baking?

312
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,750
I saw you looking stressed,

313
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,208
so I didn’t want to bother you.

314
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,458
What are you making?

315
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:32,125
I’m making rice berry scones.

316
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:35,333
I want to make them lightly sweet
so they can be our signature item.

317
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,125
Oh.

318
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:39,958
But they’re not turning out well yet.

319
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,000
I’ve thrown out a lot of batches.

320
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:49,958
Well then,

321
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,291
Can I be your helper?

322
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,083
Can you even do it?

323
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:54,791
Hey!

324
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,583
You never know until you try.

325
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:59,333
No one is too old to learn.

326
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,458
Alright, I’ll just watch and learn for now.

327
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,375
All-purpose flour.

328
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,625
Salt.

329
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:19,625
Here.

330
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,083
I’ll help you.

331
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,166
What are you doing?

332
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,375
Someone’s going to see us.

333
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,541
No one will see.

334
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,291
I locked the door.

335
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:35,000
Are you here to help or to annoy me?

336
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,833
Well..

337
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:39,958
Do you want me to help

338
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:43,458
or to tease you?

339
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:46,916
Huh?

340
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:15,208
Can I look at that one first?

341
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Sure.

342
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,666
How’s it going?

343
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,041
Hello.

344
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:31,625
Hi.

345
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:33,750
Where are we now?

346
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,375
This is the last slide.

347
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:39,833
Okay, keep going everyone!
And remember to submit your work to me.

348
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:40,750
Yes!

349
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,416
Okay.

350
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:42,458
Thank you.

351
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,208
If you want this...

352
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:49,833
I’ll take care of it

353
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:52,083
How is it?

354
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,416
Let me open it for you.

355
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,083
Okay.

356
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,000
Um, I think

357
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:04,708
If you make that small change, it should be fine.

358
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,208
Also, double-check it carefully and have someone from your team review it too. Got it?

359
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:11,791
Thank you.

360
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:14,250
You’re really like a goddess to me.

361
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,416
Listen.

362
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,583
I’ll tell you something.

363
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,958
Being a good team leader

364
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:24,750
is not about doing everything yourself,

365
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:29,166
It’s about managing the team to achieve the highest efficiency.

366
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:33,291
Helping everyone shine, and the work will shine.

367
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:36,791
That’s the true measure of a good team leader’s success.

368
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:38,833
Understood.

369
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:42,000
This is a promise, okay?

370
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:46,875
I know Naow won’t just talk, but actually do it

371
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:50,833
I'll be a great team leader just like you, P'Waris.

372
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,916
Like you trusted me.

373
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,375
Sure.

374
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:56,958
Go fix the work now

375
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay.

376
00:30:58,875 --> 00:30:59,541
Let's see.

377
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:08,583
Lately, Naow looks so bright, doesn’t she? Not like before.

378
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:13,125
Do you think maybe she’s in love?

379
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:14,708
Oh!

380
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,375
I ship them!

381
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,916
The chemistry between these two is amazing, especially when they’re together—so sweet!

382
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,375
One’s the boss.

383
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,958
The other’s the subordinate.

384
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:26,333
Just like in a drama.

385
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28,625
Earlier, they even patted each other's head.

386
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,583
I think they’re real.

387
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,333
Here.

388
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,208
It looks so delicious, Prang.

389
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:48,708
Right?

390
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,208
Can I have some?

391
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,916
How is it, P'Warang? Is it tasty?

392
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:07,708
Good?

393
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,666
Why is it so salty?

394
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:27,083
Maybe I added salt again when mixing the dough.

395
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,958
I put some in before, and

396
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,958
I didn’t realize it, so I added more

397
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:34,791
Because I was distracted

398
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:38,375
P'Warang!

399
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,000
You said you would help.

400
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,208
Why hasn’t it worked after so many tries?

401
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,708
Oh, My.

402
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,166
I can help again.

403
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,041
But I remember

404
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,583
Thida made really good scones.

405
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:01,208
She made them for me all the time when we were in school.

406
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,041
I’ll call and ask her for the recipe.

407
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,541
Then, I’ll grab my phone.

408
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,166
You look so sad.

409
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,041
Belle.

410
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:22,208
Yes, P'Warang?

411
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,750
I’m about to order some food.

412
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,166
I wanted to check if you want anything so I can order for you too.

413
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:29,166
Oh, no need, I’ve already eaten.

414
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,291
Okay.

415
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:31,250
Thank you.

416
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:01,166
Sorry, can I grab some paper?

417
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't know what’s making you so worry.

418
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,916
But I want you to be sure.

419
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:20,416
That this place only belongs to you.
