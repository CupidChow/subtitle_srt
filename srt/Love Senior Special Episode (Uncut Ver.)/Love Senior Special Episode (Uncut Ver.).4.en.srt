00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,916
"Love Senior The Series"

2
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:52,833
Be careful.

3
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,208
P’Kirin?

4
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,250
Oh, Gyo.

5
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,666
Do you know her too?

6
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:02,041
Gyo and P’Kirin, are you two very close?

7
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,416
P’Thida,

8
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,416
Whoever dates her would…

9
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,000
Be very lucky.

10
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,791
I didn’t want to be your friend, Warang.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,583
Hello, P’Warang, P’Thida.

12
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:32,666
Hi.

13
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,541
Today, Thida and I would like to use the baking room just a bit.

14
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:37,541
Hope it’s not too much trouble.

15
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:38,583
No problem.

16
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,666
And..where’s Prang?

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,375
Oh, today she has baking class.

18
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, feel free then.

19
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,250
Thank you.

20
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,833
Hey, Warang.

21
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,666
This is my final time asking you.

22
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,291
Are you really going to bake the cake yourself?

23
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:00,791
Yeah.

24
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,166
I want to bake the cake for Prang myself.

25
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,833
Even if it doesn’t turn out great, it’s…

26
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,666
something I sincerely want to do for her myself.

27
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,791
Let me get started then.

28
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,458
Oh, Prang.

29
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,125
I thought you already went back with Warang.

30
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,125
Is something wrong?

31
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,541
Um…

32
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:55,250
The recipe book P’Thida gave me…

33
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,458
There are some things I still don’t quite get it.

34
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,541
I’d like you to help me.

35
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:00,791
Yeah.

36
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,625
Do you remember fortune cookies, P’Thida?

37
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:18,791
The ones P’Warang said you and she made before finishing high school?

38
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:20,916
Oh!

39
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,000
The cookies with messages inside, right?

40
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,458
I remember.

41
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,166
Can you take a look at the recipe again?

42
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,375
Is this what you were looking for, P’Thida?

43
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,291
Prang, it’s…

44
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:00,666
I…

45
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,416
I’m sorry, P’Thida.

46
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:13,833
I’m sorry I didn’t know you liked P’Warang.

47
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,333
I’m sorry for making you upset.

48
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,208
I truly apologize.

49
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,541
Prang.

50
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,416
You’ve done nothing wrong.

51
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,375
It’s just something from the past.

52
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,708
Besides…

53
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,500
The feelings I had for Warang…

54
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,833
Were just friends.

55
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,250
And filled with goodwill, nothing more.

56
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,166
But if I didn’t date P’Warang-

57
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,208
Everything would have ended the same.

58
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,500
Because…

59
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:04,166
I wouldn’t have had the courage to tell Warang how I felt.

60
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,208
But you know what, Prang?

61
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,416
I’m actually really happy.

62
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:16,833
That my beloved sister and best friend

63
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,750
have such a good love for each other.

64
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,416
See? It’s all good things.

65
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,666
There’s nothing sad about it.

66
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,291
I’m the one who should apologize.

67
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,250
For being the reason you’re uneasy.

68
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,291
And for making you overthink like this.

69
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:39,833
I’m sorry.

70
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,916
I’ll park the car first.

71
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,166
Wait for me a moment.

72
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,458
I’ll be quick.

73
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,291
Okay.

74
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,791
Are you going to the office today?

75
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,666
I have a meeting with P’Waris at 9 AM. Maybe I’ll see you.

76
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,208
My phone.

77
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:23,958
Oops.

78
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,083
P’Kirin!

79
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,625
I’m sorry.

80
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,416
I didn’t mean to.

81
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,208
Whoa.

82
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,166
It’s all wet.

83
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,041
It’s okay, it’s okay, Gyo.

84
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,500
It’s all messy.

85
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,583
Looks like I’m the one taking the hit this time.

86
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,166
What should we do, P’Kirin?

87
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,541
What happened here?

88
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,750
Why is Kirin’s outfit in this state?

89
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,416
I accidentally spilled it myself.

90
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,500
So, I poured the coffee on myself.

91
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:20,208
K.Waris, this is the Star Lab Pro Skin product that will feature at our big booth in the mall.

92
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,041
Today, I brought the products with me.

93
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,833
So you can better see the product’s mood and tone.

94
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:30,916
Thank you.

95
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:36,083
Let’s go upstairs to discuss the project.

96
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,541
You might want to clean your clothes first, K.Kirin.

97
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:42,875
Let’s go.

98
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,625
Iced chocolate, it helps relieve stress.

99
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,083
Thank you.

100
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,541
So, why didn’t you wait for me this morning?

101
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:44,625
Um, since I noticed you’ve been stressed lately,
so I wanted you to rest.

102
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:48,833
Here.

103
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,333
I’m relaxing right now.

104
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,458
How so?

105
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,041
I really feel recharged.

106
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:40,041
So, what exactly is bothering Prang?

107
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:44,416
Belle said you seemed off today.

108
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,791
If P’Warang knew

109
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,041
that her trusted best friend

110
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,375
felt more than friendship for her,

111
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,958
what would you do?

112
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,666
This is the product that will be sold at the booth.

113
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,833
I’d like K.Waris to help oversee the lighting design.

114
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,166
Make it stand out, modern, and suitable for our product

115
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,708
that target the modern market who love self-care.

116
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,958
So, I’d like you and your team to assist with this.

117
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,500
This client is one of the mall’s major customers.

118
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,625
Sure, we’ll do it.

119
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,708
So, Today, I’ll show you some initial references.

120
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:40,333
Then, we’ll work on further designs based on the product.

121
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,166
Thank you.

122
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,458
Then can Mujji keep one set?

123
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,500
Mujji!

124
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,791
It’s so tempting to use, P’Waris.

125
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,500
It’s not only tempting but effective too.

126
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,625
Gyo even let Naow try it once.

127
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,958
Oh, there was a buy-one-get-one-free promo at the time.

128
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,541
I noticed P’Naow looked a bit tired, so I got one for her.

129
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,666
Are you okay, K.Kirin?

130
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,541
I’m fine, really.

131
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,375
I’m just a bit cold.

132
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,375
Should I turn down the air conditioning for you?

133
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,791
But it’s a central system, so you’d need to notify the building management.

134
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,291
Umm…

135
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,875
How about this?

136
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,458
Here, take this suit.

137
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,333
That’s not necessary.

138
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,000
Are you sure you’re okay?

139
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,291
Take it for now. We’ve got hours of meetings ahead.

140
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,875
Thank you.

141
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,958
Then, let me present the reference designs.

142
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,250
Sure.

143
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,625
Naow, open the slides.

144
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,458
Okay.

145
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:16,583
You startled me! I thought Prang was asking me

146
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,250
because Belle likes you instead.

147
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,750
I see you guys together so often.

148
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,125
What did you say, P’Warang?

149
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,041
Just hearing that gives me chills.

150
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,916
No way!

151
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,125
That's too much.

152
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:37,541
A friend called me to consult, and I’ve never encountered something like this, so I wanted to ask.

153
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,250
I don’t know.

154
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:47,291
It probably depends on whether your friend feels the same as the person they have a crush on.

155
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,666
If you ask me,

156
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,041
I don’t think it’s strange.

157
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,416
For friends to become lovers.

158
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,375
It depends more on the feelings of the two people involved.

159
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,791
Want some, Belle?

160
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:21,583
No, it’s okay.

161
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,500
It’s delicious though.

162
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,166
Anyway, let me send you off here.

163
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,625
I’ll meet with the team and send it out to you as soon as possible.

164
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,083
Thank you.

165
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,541
Oh, thanks for the shirt too.

166
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,583
Once I wash it, I’ll bring it back quickly.

167
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,958
No rush.

168
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,583
Just return it on the final project meeting day.

169
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,708
I’ll take my leave now.

170
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,541
I’m off, Gyo.

171
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,041
Say hi to your mom for me.

172
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,833
Sure, P’Kirin.

173
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,041
Goodbye.

174
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,500
Naow, Gyo.

175
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,000
Go upstairs and work now, or it’ll get late tonight.

176
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:18,666
And Naow, once you’re done, send it to me. I’ll go meet a client first.

177
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:19,875
Yes, Sir.

178
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,250
I wants to greet your mom too.

179
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,875
Can I call your mom too?

180
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,208
Yes, Sir.

181
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,875
Hey, Gyo, wait for me too!

182
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,541
Here you go.

183
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,208
Thank you.

184
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:04,958
Do you want me to help?

185
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,291
Then, can you help me over there, Gyo?

186
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,083
Sure.

187
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,958
Maybe we need to add more details here.

188
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,958
Naow.

189
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,083
P’Naow.

190
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,166
We’re barely holding on. We haven’t taken a break since morning.

191
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,000
I’m about to collapse.

192
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,541
Alright, everyone can go home and rest for today.

193
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,541
I think we can finish everything before the Friday presentation.

194
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,416
Alright then, I’ll head out first.

195
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,250
Goodbye, P’Naow.

196
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:56,500
Oh, but for the remaining files, I’ll send them to Aof first to compile, then forward them to you, Naow.

197
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,208
Alright.

198
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,583
Bye.

199
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,166
Thank you so much.

200
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,958
Are you going to keep working, Naow?

201
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,791
Honestly, I’d like to finish so I have more time to review.

202
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,125
But maybe I’ll stop for today.

203
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,583
So I can spend some time with my partner.

204
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,833
Otherwise, she might feel neglected.

205
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,875
If it’s about work,

206
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,833
how could I feel neglected?

207
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,000
Then...

208
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,875
Can I have some encouragement?

209
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,791
I’m running really low on energy.

210
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,416
Can I have a hug?

211
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,791
Please.

212
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,666
Hug, hug.

213
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,208
Thank you for always supporting me.

214
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,750
Let go now.

215
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,250
This is the office. Someone might see us.

216
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,041
They’ve all left.

217
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:12,916
Let me stay like this for a little longer.

218
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,750
Almost fully charged.

219
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,541
That’s too much.

220
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,916
You're clinging too tightly,

221
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,958
what if I lose all my energy?

222
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,708
Then I’ll be your power bank, Gyo.

223
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,750
Take that!

224
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,708
Why are you taking advantage of me like this?

225
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:48,583
I think this method charges quickly, directly, and efficiently.

226
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,083
But this is the office.

227
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,375
Someone might see us.

228
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,541
I thought you wanted to change locations.

229
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,958
I saw you dazing off.

230
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,500
Take that!

231
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,791
Ouch, that hurts!

232
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,333
Why did you hit me?

233
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,875
Serves you right. Are we heading back to the room?

234
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,583
I’m sleepy.

235
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,750
What room? Do you want to continue at the room?

236
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,500
You want another hit, don’t you?

237
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,250
Are we heading back to the room or not?

238
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:27,833
Are we going or not?

239
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:32,208
Yes, we’re going, going, going… continuing at the room!

240
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,583
What’s with the duck sound?

241
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:36,875
Let’s go.

242
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,458
To continue at the room, right?

243
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,750
To sleep, okay?

244
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,291
What’s up, Thida?

245
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,500
Are you free?

246
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
I need to talk to you about something.

247
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,541
Sure, I’m taking Prang back to her room.

248
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,458
What’s going on?

249
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,500
Oh.

250
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:15,875
It’s nothing.

251
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,000
I just wanted to ask about baking a cake.

252
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,875
Have you make one yet?

253
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,458
I’m working on it right now.

254
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,666
I’m trying to follow what you said.

255
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:30,916
Yeah.

256
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:31,958
Yeah.

257
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,458
But let’s set another time to meet.

258
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,833
Sure, okay.

259
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,208
Alright.

260
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,208
Bye.

261
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,583
Bye, see you later.

262
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,333
See you, see you.

263
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,041
P’Warang?

264
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,000
Can you drop me off at home today?

265
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,750
My mom’s sick, so I’d like to keep her company.

266
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,375
Of course.

267
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,708
Then I’ll take you to buy something for your mom.

268
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,875
Okay.

269
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,791
P’Gyo.

270
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:23,750
P’Gyo.

271
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,500
Help me.

272
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,708
Just take it, please.

273
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,791
It’ll make you feel warm and safe.

274
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,291
I’ll be leaving now.

275
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,583
Sorry for bothering you so late.

276
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:23,333
P’Tarn, could you stay and finish this cup of tea with me?

277
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,041
I don’t want to drink tea alone.

278
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,833
Do you know that chamomile tea helps with relaxation

279
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,500
and reduces anxiety?

280
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:17,500
Thank you.

281
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,416
I told you before, didn’t I?

282
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:31,000
That whenever your sky isn’t bright,

283
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,458
I’ll be here for you.

284
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,291
Naow.

285
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,708
Don’t you want to recharge, Gyo?

286
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,250
Thank you.

287
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,583
The hospital called and said Aof is safe now.

288
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:41,458
That’s a relief.

289
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,333
I feel relieved.

290
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:48,000
P’Waris, is something wrong?

291
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,625
You look worried.

292
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,125
P’Waris?

293
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,958
The project files are all in this computer, right?

294
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,666
Oh, you’re right.

295
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:58,500
And Aof handled the last part.

296
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:00,958
Then…

297
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:04,458
Aof’s laptop is damaged from the impact.

298
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,708
We can’t recover the files.

299
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,208
What do we do now?

300
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,041
If we have to redo everything,

301
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,833
with the workload and our team size,

302
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,416
it’s impossible to finish in time.

303
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,625
Why wouldn’t it be?

304
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,958
Did you forget?

305
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:26,375
That you have friends in the same field as you

306
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,583
who can help?

307
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,916
Come here, hey!

308
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,041
Beautiful P'Lada is here to help!

309
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:38,791
Did you forget about us?

310
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,041
Well, when it comes to studies,

311
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,833
I might not be as good as you.

312
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:46,291
But if it’s about rushing to meet deadlines, count on me.

313
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,208
We’re second to none.

314
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:50,291
Hey, Naow.

315
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,166
I brought my lovely junior to help.

316
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,583
Hey, Aey!

317
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,083
Thanks a lot.

318
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,333
I missed you.

319
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:01,250
For friends like us, it’s a small matter. I missed you, too. Wait a second.

320
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,166
Thanks.

321
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:02,958
Hey!

322
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,041
Don’t just stand there looking surprised.

323
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:08,041
Let’s get to work, everyone, or we’ll run out of time.

324
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,750
By the way, how did you all get here?

325
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,250
Sis asked us to come help.

326
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:14,625
Sis?

327
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,833
Thank you.

328
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,291
Gyo.

329
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,208
Why didn’t you tell me, Naow?

330
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,333
that P’Waris is Warang’s sister?

331
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,333
Honestly, I was going to tell you from the first day you started working.

332
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,125
But you probably didn’t notice what I was saying.

333
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:51,625
So, are you going to tell me why you act like you don’t want anyone to know we’re dating?

334
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,000
And what’s this rule of P’Waris?

335
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,083
Actually, P’Waris is...

336
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,500
Forget it.

337
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,083
And what about the agreement and picking up P’Waris from home?

338
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:09,875
To be honest, I used up all my leave days when we went to Pattaya.

339
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:12,541
But I wanted to take you on a trip.

340
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:17,958
So P’Waris made a deal to let me trade the leave days for completing the project proposal for K.Kirin.

341
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:20,791
-Ouch!
-Naow!

342
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,166
About picking up P’Waris,

343
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:28,041
Her car broke down.

344
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:29,708
And P’Warang wasn’t available to pick her up.

345
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,875
So she asked me to pick her up since we had to check the site together.

346
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,208
That’s all.

347
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:35,541
Really.

348
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:38,583
Oh.

349
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:40,125
Warang!

350
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:40,958
Gyo!

351
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,000
Naow, don’t stop me!

352
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:48,625
Or is there something else you haven’t told me?

353
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,458
I’m just wondering.

354
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,166
Why is it that when you’re jealous,

355
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,083
you’re so cute?

356
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,500
I’m not jealous!

357
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:01,250
You’re the one at fault.

358
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,250
You didn’t tell me.

359
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,791
You’re not jealous?

360
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:07,791
You just secretly checked my phone.

361
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,041
Well...

362
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:20,333
And?

363
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:25,041
You’re the one at fault, Naow. You didn’t tell me.

364
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:28,500
Then I’m the one at fault.

365
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,375
I’ll let you punish me, okay?

366
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:01,666
You’re so cute.

367
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:12,041
Oh!

368
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:12,958
Are you slacking off?

369
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,541
Where have you been?

370
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,208
To the bathroom.

371
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:18,500
We’ve been working so long, and you won’t let me go to the bathroom?

372
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,166
Exactly.

373
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:20,458
Hey, Naow.

374
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:20,958
Yes?

375
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,916
Hey, are you wearing this lipstick color now?

376
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,041
I don’t recognize it.

377
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh, it’s… just lip balm.

378
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:29,666
Oh.

379
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:32,208
Nowadays, lip balm tends to change colors, huh?

380
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,666
I just haven’t been drinking enough water.

381
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:39,000
So my lips are a little dry.

382
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:40,666
Is it too red?

383
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:42,291
Yes, very much.

384
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:43,625
Oh, please.

385
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:47,291
I don’t think it’s because of dehydration.

386
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,666
Anyone want something to eat?

387
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,208
I’ll order for you.

388
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,750
Oh, great, I’m hungry.

389
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,250
Perfect timing, huh?

390
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,166
No need; P’Kirin already sent some.

391
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:00,708
Thank you.

392
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:03,625
You can put it down here.

393
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,541
Thank you.

394
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:06,541
Looks so delicious.

395
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,125
Hey, kids.

396
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,125
After eating, hurry up and get back to work. Also...

397
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:13,916
Anything finished, send it to my office.

398
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:14,916
Got it!

399
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,500
Mujji, come see me in my office.

400
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:21,333
Good luck!

401
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,125
Thank you.

402
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,458
Let’s eat.

403
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,625
Which one’s good?

404
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:30,958
Let me see.

405
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:35,083
That one’s tasty.

406
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,000
Gyo, that’s yours.

407
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:39,958
Oh.

408
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:45,458
This one looks really appetizing.

409
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,541
Of course it is; it’s from a famous shop.

410
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:09,250
Warang.

411
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,375
Are you still keeping this?

412
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,333
The shop’s closed today.

413
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,416
I believe you can do it, Naow.

414
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:24,958
If I succeed...

415
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,250
Can I ask for a reward?

416
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,916
Sorry I don’t talk much,
Sorry I keep backing away,

417
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:58,083
Sorry I don’t want to meet,
Don’t even want to look your way.

418
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:02,125
Who else could I blame but you?
It’s your fault for coming through,

419
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:06,083
For the way you talk so smooth,
And looking way too good to be true.

420
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:08,208
Stop right there, just stay away,

421
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,166
Drawing a line, keeping my heart at bay.

422
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,250
This is the zone for the weak and the worn,

423
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,333
Ready to melt from the love I’ve borne.

424
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:18,291
What a shock, such a shock, when you heal my heart,

425
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:22,583
Like I’m floating away, piece by piece falling apart.

426
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:26,750
What am I supposed to do? Gotta keep it inside.

427
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,875
But how am I supposed to hide it? Can’t let it slide.

428
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:35,000
Fine, just turn away, look somewhere else for me,

429
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,625
But then you turn around and flash that smile at me.

430
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:43,333
You’ve got me losing my cool, ‘cause you hit the spot,

431
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:47,583
Making me blush like crazy—why are you so hot?

432
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:51,583
I’m losing my form, and I’m giving in,

433
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:55,791
If you don’t stop being cute, I’ll need a heart refill again.

434
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:58,833
No, no, no, you’re too much to bear,

435
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,875
No, no, no, so unfairly rare.

436
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,916
No, no, no, stop it, I swear,

437
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,958
Don’t make me fall for you—I care!

438
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:07,166
No, no, no, you’re too much to bear,

439
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,208
No, no, no, so unfairly rare.

440
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,250
No, no, no, stop it, I swear,

441
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,291
Don’t make me fall for you—I care!

442
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,583
Stop right there, just stay away,

443
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,541
Stop it with those looks, okay?

444
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,625
I’m losing my mind here, Facing a heart attack near.

445
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,708
My heart’s beginning to melt away.

446
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:29,666
Shocked, totally shocked,
You’ve got my pulse on lock.

447
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:33,916
So cute, way too cute,
I’m breaking under your pursuit.

448
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:38,125
What am I supposed to do? Gotta keep it inside.

449
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:42,250
But how am I supposed to hide it? Can’t let it slide.

450
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,375
Fine, just turn away, look somewhere else for me,

451
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:49,958
But then you turn around and flash that smile at me.

452
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:54,708
You’ve got me losing my cool, ‘cause you hit the spot,

453
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:58,916
Making me blush like crazy—why are you so hot?

454
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:02,916
I’m losing my form, and I’m giving in,

455
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:07,166
If you don’t stop being cute, I’ll need a heart refill again.

456
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:28,875
You’ve got me losing my cool, ‘cause you hit the spot,

457
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:33,125
Making me blush like crazy—why are you so hot?

458
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:37,125
I’m losing my form, and I’m giving in,

459
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:41,250
If you don’t stop being cute, I’ll need a heart refill again.

460
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:45,500
You’ve got me losing my cool, ‘cause you hit the spot,

461
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,750
Making me blush like crazy—why are you so hot?

462
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,750
I’m losing my form, and I’m giving in,

463
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,958
If you don’t stop being cute, I’ll need a heart refill again.

464
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,958
No, no, no, you’re too much to bear,

465
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:03,000
No, no, no, so unfairly rare.

466
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,041
No, no, no, stop it, I swear,

467
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,083
Don’t make me fall for you—I care!

468
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,291
No, no, no, you’re too much to bear,

469
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,333
No, no, no, so unfairly rare.

470
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,166
No, no, no, stop it, I swear,

471
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:15,416
Don’t make me fall for you—I care!

472
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:45,041
Yeah!

473
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:46,875
Come on, baby

474
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:48,500
Ohh

475
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,041
Cygnus

476
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:51,375
Let’s go (Yeah)

477
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:55,833
Do you know how lonely my heart’s been all along?

478
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:59,708
Deep down, my heart’s still empty, oh boy.

479
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:04,500
Don’t leave me waiting. Come join my paradise. (Ohhh)

480
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,500
I’m waiting for my love.

481
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,375
Then I met you, and you made my heart flutter.

482
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:14,208
Once again, I fell for those sweet words of yours.

483
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:18,083
How can I stop myself from thinking about

484
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:21,958
Your looks, your moves, your style? (Yeah.)

485
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:28,833
My heart’s been like a dry desert for so long.

486
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:33,083
Your love, your love,

487
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:37,208
That is a waterfall in my heart.

488
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:41,083
On the days when I feel so alone,

489
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:44,916
You swoop in and leave just as fast.

490
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:49,375
Do you know, for messing with my heart like that…

491
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:54,291
I won’t let us both remain lonely anymore.

492
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:58,000

Come and kiss me.

497
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:14,458
You’ve got so lucky that I’m super hot.

498
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:17,333
That’s right, I’m on top. I’m the queen of our love game. Uh

499
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,166
Love me every day and night, alright?

500
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:21,208
Baby, follow me. It’s so easy, isn’t it?

501
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:24,666
My heart is calling. Are you ready?

502
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:28,541
If you meet me, you’ll surely fall for me.

503
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:32,250
Your heart will be conquered by my sweet words entirely.

504
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,125
Lost in my paradise that you keep craving—

505
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:40,000
Your looks, your moves, your style? (Yeah.)

506
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,875
My heart’s been like a dry desert for so long.

507
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,125
Your love, your love,

508
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:55,250
That is a waterfall in my heart.

509
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:59,125
On the days when I feel so alone,

510
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:02,958
You swoop in and leave just as fast.

You swoop in and leave just as fast.

519
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,958
Do you know, for messing with my heart like that…
