1
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,083
"Love Senior The Series Special EP."

2
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,916
Lately, Naow looks so bright, doesn’t she?

3
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,583
One’s the boss.

4
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,125
The other’s the subordinate.

5
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,916
Just like in a drama.

6
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,583
Is this customer heartbroken?

7
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,833
She didn't touch any of her order.

8
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,583
I'll be back with P'Warang first.

9
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,791
See you tomorrow.

10
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:18,416
Okay, see you.

11
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:19,083
Bye bye

12
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:19,583
See you later.

13
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,458
See you at our café.

14
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,583
What should we eat today?

15
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,916
I want to eat spaghetti

16
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:24,916
Okay, I'll take you.

17
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,416
I hope she will come today.

18
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,041
Excuse me,

19
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,250
may I take a piece of paper?

20
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,916
You’re not going to ask for my signature, are you?

21
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,083
Hello.

22
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:35,166
Then, could you please sign it for me?

23
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,583
My name is Luktarn.

24
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,458
N' Belle.

25
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,375
P'Tarn

26
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,416
Stay and have ice cream together first,

27
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,250
Can you?

28
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,541
So the ice cream won’t melt before you get to eat it.

29
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,708
Are you the owner of this café?

30
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,875
Yeah, when I graduated,

31
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,083
I and my friends still don’t want to work for a company.

32
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:59,041
Prang loves making pastries. At that time, Belle was…

33
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,875
into Art Therapy.

34
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,541
So, we decided to partner up and open an art café together.

35
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,875
The sky is so beautiful today.

36
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,041
It's like every day.

37
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:49,958
No.

38
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,166
I think..

39
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,958
the sky looks more beautiful today than ever.

40
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,291
But for me to see the sky as this beautiful…

41
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,708
It took quite a long time.

42
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,708
P'Tarn

43
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,625
Whatever has already passed,

44
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,625
Just let it go, okay?

45
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,750
That crazy plan to drug her,

46
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,833
Take photos to blackmail,

47
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,916
I never thought Tarn could do something so dirty.

48
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,541
I don’t want you to disappear from my lives.

49
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,458
I don’t want to lose you.

50
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,000
Even if no one in this world

51
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,000
forgives you,

52
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,083
at least you should forgive yourself.

53
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,416
So that one day,

54
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,375
we’ll have the courage

55
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:02,208
to apologize to others for the mistakes
we’ve made with them.

56
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,083
I forgive you, P’Tarn.

57
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,666
And if one day your sky isn’t bright,

58
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,375
you can always come to see me.

59
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,625
If you want to come and share your feelings,

60
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,583
or just sit together in silence, that’s fine too.

61
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,083
I’ll be here to keep you company, P’Tarn.

62
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,583
Is this okay?

63
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,166
Would you like some water?

64
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,666
What’s wrong, Gyo?

65
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,791
I haven’t seen you all day.

66
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,708
I’m fine.

67
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,166
I just had to work on documents for P’Waris all afternoon,

68
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,500
so I was a bit busy.

69
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,000
If something’s wrong, just say it.

70
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,083
No need to lie.

71
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,666
How do you know I’m lying?
Do you even care?

72
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,541
If I don’t care about you,
then who else should I care about?

73
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,750
How would I know? You usually seem to care
about everyone else anyway.

74
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,750
Are you jealous?

75
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,416
I’m not jealous at all.

76
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,416
Who’s jealous?

77
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,041
You’re so cute.

78
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,333
Hmm.

79
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,000
Don’t you dare smile.

80
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,583
Gyo.

81
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:21,000
I don’t know what’s making you so worried,

82
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,416
but I want you to be sure

83
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,250
that this place in my heart is only for you.

84
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,500
I Love You.

85
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,666
(P'Waris: Don’t forget to pick me up tomorrow.
Call me when you arrive.)

86
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,041
Where has she been since this morning?

87
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,333
I called, but she didn’t answer.

88
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,666
Gyo, can you please take the coffee to P’Waris?

89
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,666
I have to go down and greet the customers right now.
Please do it for me.

90
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,250
Okay!

91
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,750
Two cups?

92
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,500
Naow!

93
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,333
Gyo.

94
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,833
Are you scared?

95
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,833
Yeah.

96
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,166
It’s okay.

97
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,791
I’m right here.

98
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,625
Let’s sleep.

99
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,833
Okay?

100
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,583
Come here, I’ll put you back to sleep.

101
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,041
I’ll go check the site first.

102
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,250
See you at the office.

103
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,041
Hold on.

104
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,166
Why does your face look so tired?

105
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,458
Hmm?

106
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,416
You should take better care of yourself.

107
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,291
You’ve been working on the site and
your face looks all tired now.

108
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,166
I want you to apply the cream for me.

109
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,583
Aren’t you going to apply it too?

110
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,833
I applies it every day anyway.

111
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,166
That’s true.

112
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,583
Your cheeks are both clear and soft.

113
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,250
Thank you for always taking care of me.

114
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,708
Hello, P’Waris.

115
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,833
Okay, Naow will hurry up and go now.

116
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,541
Yes, yes, I’m on my way.

117
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,708
-Wow, P’Waris looks stunning.

118
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,250
-How can someone look so sexy even
in a Working Women look?

119
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,791
-Anyone nearby not feeling shy? Just say it.

120
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,666
-Where has P’Naow gone?

121
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:10,916
Be careful.

122
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,291
P’Kirin?

123
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,333
Oh, Gyo.

124
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,833
Thank you.

125
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,833
Kirin.

126
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,958
Hello.

127
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,500
Are you okay?, Gyo.

128
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,958
Oh, She had a little accident.

129
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:39,708
And

130
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,958
Do you know her too?

131
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,208
Yes.

132
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,500
I’ve known her since we were kids.

133
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,666
But since I went to study in England,
we haven’t met at all.

134
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,583
Is he an employee of your company?

135
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,666
Yes, she is on Manaow’s team.

136
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,333
They’re working on a project for you.

137
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,041
We should hurry up and go upstairs to discuss the work.
The team is waiting.

138
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,041
Please, after you.

139
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,083
Oh.

140
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,750
You’re here already?

141
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,958
Hello, P’Thida.

142
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,750
Why did you bring so much stuff?

143
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,500
Thank you.

144
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:56,916
Wow.

145
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,000
Since you became the “cool” Warang,

146
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,416
I’m not used to seeing you like this.

147
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,250
If it were back in middle school, that would be different.

148
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,125
i wore it just to match her.

149
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:12,916
Oh, right.

150
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,875
You might need to go through it a bit.

151
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,041
Because I’ve kept it since high school.

152
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,916
Now, I just watch YouTube or ask Google for help too.

153
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,333
Oh, we’re making scones, right?

154
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:26,666
Yes.

155
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,000
Here.

156
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,750
Thank you, P’Thida.

157
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,250
Wow, you really brought a lot.

158
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,583
Well, since you’re here, stay and have dinner with us.

159
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,791
Hmm, sure.

160
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,791
I’ve been waiting for you to invite me.

161
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:50,125
So, what do you want to eat?
I was thinking of ordering delivery for us.

162
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,083
I’ll order in return for the recipe you brought.

163
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,833
Hmm, you’re so generous.

164
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,458
I’m not treating you.

165
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,125
Oh no.

166
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,416
This one is better. I like this one.

167
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:07,666
So,

168
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,958
The concept will be something like this.

169
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:10,833
Okay.

170
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,666
Actually, I quite like what the team has presented.

171
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:18,375
But I’d like to add a gimmick that reflects
the uniqueness of our mall more.

172
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,000
This will help make our mall

173
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,541
become a new landmark in Bangkok.

174
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:27,958
I believe this will help boost the economy and
bring more tourists to visit Thailand.

175
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:32,583
Okay, then our team will make the adjustments
and present it to you again.

176
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:33,958
Thank you.

177
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:39,125
Handsome with good vision.
I wish I could have P’Kirin for myself.

178
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,125
Mujji.

179
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,291
Do you think Gyo looks a bit odd?

180
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:47,750
Yeah.

181
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,250
She looks like someone.

182
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,791
Thank you for helping me today.

183
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:10,916
It’s no problem.

184
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,541
By the way, where are you going for dinner?

185
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,708
Oh, I …

186
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,875
We have a meeting at the office today.

187
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,708
P’Waris has a tradition of treating the team to dinner after a presentation.

188
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,458
Okay.

189
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,958
Um, Kirin, do you like Chinese food?

190
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,333
Aren’t you going to eat this?

191
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,250
-Nah, I don’t want it.
-Can I have it?

192
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,250
Go ahead.

193
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,250
Aren’t you going to eat the pizza crust?

194
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,666
Okay, I’ll have it. I’ll eat it myself.

195
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,458
Are you full?

196
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:55,750
Yes, I’m full.

197
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,750
I’ll take the plates away.

198
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,250
It’s okay, P’Thida. I’ll clean up.

199
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:01,791
Thanks.

200
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,708
Well, I should head back now.

201
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,875
I’ve finished delivering.

202
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,458
I’m full from dinner.

203
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,000
The checklist is all done.

204
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,375
Hey, wait.

205
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,750
Don’t leave yet.

206
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,541
Can you help me double-check the work?

207
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,875
I’m so buried in it right now that my head is spinning.

208
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,416
Please take a look for me.

209
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,083
-Sure.
-Prang, I'll be back to work just a bit, okay?

210
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,458
Okay.

211
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:25,916
Bye-bye.

212
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,750
Thank you for everything you did to help me graduate.

213
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:39,208
I hope your university doesn’t give up on me.
I’m glad to have you as my best friend.

214
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,833
I didn’t want to be your friend, Warang.

215
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,750
I didn’t want to be your friend, Warang.

216
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,583
Your order is ready.

217
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,375
Thank you.

218
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,416
Excuse me.

219
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,833
Thank you very much.

220
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,541
Thank you.

221
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,750
How do you do this?

222
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,500
Like this.

223
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:06,916
Here.

224
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:09,375
Hmm.

225
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,708
Add a little bit of this.

226
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,791
And look, you typed it wrong.

227
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:17,791
Where?

228
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,125
Here.

229
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:23,875
All done.

230
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,041
Wow.

231
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,666
I’m so lucky.

232
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,458
To have such a talented friend like you.

233
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:35,125
It’s your luck.

234
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,875
But my misfortune.

235
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,791
Did I really make the right choice?

236
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,416
Entrusting my sister’s life to you.

237
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:43,833
What misfortune?

238
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:47,250
I consider you my best friend.

239
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:51,458
You’re the only one who sees me at my worst.

240
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,416
But for Prang,

241
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,166
I can promise you.

242
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,750
That I’ll take the best care of Prang in every way.

243
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:04,000
Except for baking.

244
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:05,750
Thida,

245
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:09,250
Can you help teach Prang to bake?

246
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:13,000
I’ve seen how much Prang puts her heart into it.

247
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,958
But it still doesn’t turn out well.

248
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,958
And she doesn’t dare bother you.

249
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,333
I’ve tried helping her many times.

250
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,791
But it always

251
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:27,583
Fails.

252
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,666
Thida,

253
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,791
Please help me.

254
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,291
Please.

255
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,875
Please.

256
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,083
Can you? Hmm?

257
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,125
Fine, fine.

258
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,416
But have you talked to her yet?

259
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:44,750
Doesn’t matter.

260
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,375
As long as you agree, that’s enough.

261
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,958
Let’s eat some snacks instead.

262
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,208
Looks so good.

263
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,125
Oh, Prang.

264
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,416
What are you doing standing here?

265
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh, just got some dust in my eye.

266
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,416
Are you okay?

267
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:04,125
Hmm.

268
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:05,333
Sure?

269
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:14,416
When P’Warang is with P’Thida, they look so cute together.

270
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,333
Doesn’t seem like the usual serious engineering seniors at all.

271
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,250
Thank you too.

272
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,750
The buns are here.

273
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:41,541
Eat as much as you like.

274
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,916
Thank you.

275
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,291
These are Gyo’s favorite.

276
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:52,250
Yes.

277
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:55,250
Really, Gyo?

278
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,875
I never saw you eat it at university.

279
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:02,083
Oh, it’s just that…

280
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,833
Naow and I often ate together back then.

281
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,375
Oh, I forgot about that.

282
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:14,250
Gyo and Kirin have known each other since childhood, right?

283
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:15,958
Yes.

284
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,958
Back then, Gyo wasn’t like this.

285
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,958
She ate so much her cheeks puffed up like buns.

286
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,708
Not that much.

287
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,208
Gyo.

288
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:31,750
What about the crab noodles I bought for Kirin?

289
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:33,625
Oh.

290
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,541
P’Fresh and P’Toon are warming it up.

291
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,291
Let me go get it.

292
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,583
It’s okay.

293
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,958
I’ll just eat the buns.

294
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,750
I’m allergic to crab.

295
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,583
Really? Oh, I’m sorry.

296
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,416
Would you like to have some gyo instead?

297
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:57,250
I saw P’Waris also bought some pork gyoza.

298
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,625
You should be able to eat them, right?

299
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:06,958
Thank you.

300
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:10,583
Yes, there are pork gyoza
You should be able to eat them.

301
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,458
Just a moment.

302
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:22,458
Go ahead, eat.

303
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:23,500
Sure.

304
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:34,416
-Exchange your card first.
-Okay.

305
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,583
Thank you for dinner.

306
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,291
You’re welcome.

307
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,541
Aren’t you leaving yet?

308
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:53,583
I’m about to, but my car’s in the shop, so I’ll call a ride.

309
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,750
You can head off first, Kirin.

310
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,541
It might rain and cause traffic.

311
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,083
Sure.

312
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:07,500
Are you okay?

313
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,458
Wait here.

314
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,125
I’ll bring the car around.

315
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,000
Let’s go.

316
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:09,958
What’s wrong?

317
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,250
Are you feeling unwell, Naow?

318
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,541
Gyo and P’Kirin,

319
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,583
are you two very close?

320
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,250
Yeah, pretty close. Why?

321
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:35,708
Back when I was a kid, I got bullied a lot.

322
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:40,083
P’Kirin was the only one who helped me.

323
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,541
Why do you ask, Naow?

324
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:48,625
Or…

325
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,250
Are you jealous, Naow?

326
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,166
Not jealous.

327
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,125
Just curious.

328
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:57,750
That’s all.

329
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:02,625
Besides P’Pure, I’ve never seen you close with
any other senior guys.

330
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,875
You said we wouldn’t lie to each other.

331
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,708
Didn’t you ask me to trust you, Naow?

332
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,000
Don’t you trust me?

333
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,208
It’s not that I don’t trust you.

334
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:21,625
It’s just…

335
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:27,583
Well…

336
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,625
I can’t help but worry.

337
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:33,541
Today, you’re dressed so sexy.

338
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,250
I’m concerned.

339
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,416
I thought

340
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,208
You liked sexy people.

341
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:05,333
Is this sexy enough?

342
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,250
Are you teasing me, Gyo?

343
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:19,875
I can be sexy...

344
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,833
Even more than that night when I was drunk.

345
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,708
Where, Thida?

346
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,916
Oh, I found it.

347
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,541
Thanks so much.

348
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,291
P’Thida is amazing.

349
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,083
She’s good at everything.

350
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,750
Whoever dates her would…

351
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,583
Be very lucky.

352
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,833
I agree.

353
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,958
But it’s strange, isn’t it? She’s still single.

354
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:52,625
Even though people are interested in her.

355
00:32:55,041 --> 00:33:00,000
Maybe P’Thida already has someone she likes.

356
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:02,666
I wouldn’t know.

357
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:06,041
I’ve never asked her.

358
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:08,916
Don't you know?

359
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:17,083
Even you, who's been close to her
since high school, don't know.

360
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,750
So how would I know?

361
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:23,458
Just because I’m her sister doesn’t mean I know everything.

362
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:35,833
Now this, this is what it calls close.

363
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,375
Aren’t you working anymore?

364
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:47,833
I’d rather go to bed with my girlfriend.

365
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,333
I love you, Prang.

366
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,041
Love you the most.

367
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:33,541
Thida: Warang, can I ask you something?

368
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,625
(Today, wear this outfit.)

369
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:22,041
The sexy outfits you ordered online?
I already sent them all to Lada.

370
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,583
See you at work.

371
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,125
Naow.

372
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,958
I think this idea is good, Naow.

373
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,458
It aligns with the brief Kirin gave us.

374
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,291
Let’s do this.

375
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:54,541
Naow, have your team gather some rough data
and draft it for me.

376
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:56,541
Then we can have a meeting again. Sound good?

377
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:57,958
Okay, P’Waris.

378
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:01,416
I thought today you wouldn’t approve of me.

379
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:06,541
I thought you were so focused on other things
you forgot to update me.

380
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,833
Oh, come on.

381
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,458
I would never mess up my work.

382
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:14,250
Oh.

383
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,416
Are you going out?

384
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:17,958
Where’s your car?

385
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,250
This question.

386
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,625
Why didn’t you ask me yesterday?

387
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,750
What kind of person picks up but doesn’t drop off?

388
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,458
Picking up?

389
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,250
Oops.

390
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:54,833
P’Kirin.

391
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,500
Is this what you were looking for, P’Thida?

392
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,916
Prang, I…
