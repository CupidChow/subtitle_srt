1
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,137
Why is it so difficult for you?

2
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:58,975
You see,

3
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,270
I really like you.

4
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,149
So I want to know…

5
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,445
what kind of life you've lived

6
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,490
and what's on your mind.

7
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,586
I've been dreaming of the day

8
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,631
you and I become family.

9
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,810
Say something. Anything.

10
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,861
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,953
Why are you turning into someone else?

12
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,207
Why are you drifting away?

13
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,587
Why are you becoming a stranger?

14
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,637
I don't know who you are anymore.

15
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,099
I don't understand you.

16
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:25,937
Me neither.

17
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,530
I don't know either.

18
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,011
Dr. Yoon!

19
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,224
I was actually on my way to your place.

20
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,683
What are you doing here?

21
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,981
Dr. Yoon, are you crying?

22
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,567
What's the matter? Is something up?

23
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,070
It's just that I forgot to pay my rent.

24
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,448
What? That's not a big deal.

25
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,244
I'm sorry. I'll make sure
to wire it to you today.

26
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,455
One might think I'm a mean landlady.

27
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:11,334
Dr. Yoon, it's all right. It really is.

28
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,224
I must be going nuts.
The tears just keep coming out.

29
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,937
Have you had breakfast?

30
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,611
EPISODE 14

31
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,822
-Dr. Yoon.
-Oh, right.

32
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,203
It's seaweed soup with sea urchin.

33
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,914
I made it for Yun-gyeong,
but you get to have some.

34
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,501
Isn't this what you had
on your first day in Gongjin?

35
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,130
I really enjoyed it that day.

36
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,217
I'll enjoy it today as well. Thank you.

37
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,677
Don't mention it.

38
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,388
Giving birth sure is exhausting,

39
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,558
but I'm sure it was no easy task
delivering the baby.

40
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,768
Go ahead and dig in.

41
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,853
Okay.

42
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,323
It's good.

43
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,579
Come to think of it, haven't you been here
for about four or five months now?

44
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,622
Yes.

45
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,168
Time sure flies,
and it's scary how people connect.

46
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,837
Who would've thought

47
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,382
you'd open a dental clinic here
and date Chief Hong of all people?

48
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,640
Did something happen
between you and Du-sik?

49
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,314
You don't have to tell me.

50
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,860
I just thought
maybe I could be of any help.

51
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,573
You know, unlike Nam-suk,
I'm one to be tight-lipped.

52
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,411
Ms. Yeo.

53
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,873
Do you know

54
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:18,836
why he quit his job
and came back to Gongjin?

55
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,257
Oh, that. That's something
I don't know much about.

56
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,469
The same goes for most people in town.

57
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,514
That's why there are
all sorts of rumors about it.

58
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,934
After he went to college
and served in the military,

59
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,770
he got busy and rarely had time to visit.

60
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,105
But

61
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,942
I do remember how he was
on the first day back.

62
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,785
He was a wreck.

63
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,546
He wasn't the man we used to know.

64
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,299
I guess you can say
that he held a blank expression.

65
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,594
Like someone who had let go of everything.

66
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,474
So no one could ask him.

67
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,645
We just all assumed
that he'd gone through something.

68
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:22,316
Has he not told you about that either?

69
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,069
No.

70
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,366
He still hasn't opened up to me.

71
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,411
No, you're wrong about that.

72
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,539
Chief Hong… No.

73
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,127
I've never seen Du-sik
happier than he is these days.

74
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,796
-Really?
-Of course.

75
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:49,302
Dr. Yoon, what may be easy for one person

76
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,722
can be something difficult for another.

77
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,477
Ever since he was a kid, he was so mature.

78
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,438
He only learned how to hold himself back,

79
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,024
so he doesn't know
how to open up to people.

80
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:09,238
For a long time, he hasn't had anyone
that he could share his pain with.

81
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:18,331
I believe that you can be his rock,
someone he opens up to.

82
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,046
Going through both marriage and divorce

83
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,215
has enlightened me.

84
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,550
I regret being so impatient.

85
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:34,472
I wish I'd told him
what I was really feeling for once.

86
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,866
MS. DENTIST

87
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,556
Hello?

88
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,518
Chief Hong, where are you?
You said you'd come and help out today.

89
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,103
Right. I did.

90
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,022
Sorry about that. I'll be right over.

91
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,482
Got it.

92
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,524
Seon-a.

93
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,901
-Ha-rang!
-Uncle Seong-hyeon!

94
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,949
-Gosh, how long has it been?
-Have you been well?

95
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,451
Ha-rang's gotten so big.

96
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,162
He couldn't wait to see you, you know.

97
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,290
-Ha-rang.
-Yes?

98
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,125
"Yes," was it?

99
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,961
You're loving it, aren't you?

100
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,505
Is Auntie well?

101
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,342
She is. You won't believe what she said.

102
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,469
When she found out
I was coming to see you,

103
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,431
she asked me to get DOS' autographs.
She doesn't even know who they are.

104
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,683
How was the traffic?

105
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,310
It's not the traffic

106
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,146
but traveling with a kid
that's the hassle.

107
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,691
He was adamant about
not sitting in his car seat.

108
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,985
I know he's my kid, but gosh.

109
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,489
Seon-a, just let him do whatever he wants.

110
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,158
Don't even think of winning
against this adorable being.

111
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,703
You think so? Then why don't you do
a babysitting variety show next?

112
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,039
One with about 15 kids.

113
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,958
Fine, I apologize.
Forgive me for what I said.

114
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,003
Yes, and there's another thing
you should ask for forgiveness for.

115
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,755
You didn't come to my wedding.

116
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,007
It's been years,
and you still bring it up?

117
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,094
I was an assistant director back then
and was in another country

118
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,638
pulling all-nighters to shoot a show.

119
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,766
You chose your career
over my wedding then, and thanks to that,

120
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,768
you've become a star director.

121
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,686
I take credit for your success.

122
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,607
Jeez. You sure have gotten
more brazen over the years.

123
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,317
What? Is there something you need?

124
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,112
Whatever it is, I won't decline.

125
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,160
By the way, I didn't expect
you'd actually come here.

126
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,498
I've been meaning to come by sometime.

127
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,417
I heard a lot about it.

128
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,377
Really? From whom?

129
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,380
Someone I know. This is his hometown.

130
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,342
Really? That's interesting.
So how do you like it?

131
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,763
Just like I've heard.

132
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,683
It's nice.

133
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,023
Is it good? Take your time.

134
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,959
How long was I asleep?

135
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,800
Ms. Yoon, I'm leaving
without waking you up. Enjoy your sleep.

136
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,514
MISSED CALL: CHIEF HONG

137
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,519
MISSED CALL: CHIEF HONG

138
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,770
CHIEF HONG

139
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,240
Hello? Hye-jin?

140
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,618
I see you called.

141
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,702
Yes.

142
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,122
I'm sorry I didn't stop you when you left.

143
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,876
We should meet. Where are you?
I'll be right there.

144
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,962
No, I'd rather not see you.

145
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,548
What?

146
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,928
What if I see you? I know all you'll say

147
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,889
is that you're sorry.

148
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,308
Like you did just now.

149
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,644
I think

150
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,980
we need to have some time apart.

151
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,194
Not in a way people do as a formality
before breaking up.

152
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,365
I don't want to break up with you.

153
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,825
Then why…

154
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,788
It just seems to me you need some time.

155
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:56,877
Time that will finally stop you
from being sorry.

156
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:02,758
Time you'll need
to finally be honest with me.

157
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,596
Because we can't go on like this.

158
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:14,395
Let's take our time
and carefully think this through.

159
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,773
About where we should go from here

160
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,526
and what we both want.

161
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,445
You get what I mean, right?

162
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,447
I do.

163
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,075
I'll hang up then.

164
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,552
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

165
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,225
What's this?

166
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,394
I thought you'd look

167
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,982
pretty, cute, and lovely in it,
so I bought it for you.

168
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,568
-Is it clothes?
-Yes.

169
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,946
You really didn't have to.
I have a lot to wear.

170
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,948
But I thought it'd look perfect on you.

171
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,949
I see.

172
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,703
Anyway, I have to get going.
I just stopped by.

173
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,248
Thank you for this.
I'll make sure to cherish it.

174
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,207
Sure.

175
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,338
I'll call you later.

176
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,846
Good for you, Mi-seon.

177
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
You're in the honeymoon phase.

178
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,267
What?

179
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,146
Why do you sound
like you're already in a rut?

180
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,440
Are things still off
between you and Chief Hong?

181
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,987
I get the feeling that it'll take
quite a while to patch things up.

182
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,324
No?

183
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,743
Hello.

184
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:53,953
Gosh, Ms. Yu.

185
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,497
-Hello.
-Hello.

186
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:02,211
As you can see, your wisdom tooth
is impacted close to your jaw.

187
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,504
Wisdom tooth?

188
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,550
I never had one,
so I thought I was born not to have any.

189
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:14,473
They mostly emerge
in one's teens and early 20s.

190
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,852
Technically, they're third molars

191
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,357
but also known as wisdom teeth since
they emerge when you get wiser about love.

192
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,567
I see.

193
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,905
It stayed hidden for long
without showing any symptoms.

194
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,415
Hwa-jeong, people don't color
their fingernails with balsam these days.

195
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,041
Most people use manicure.

196
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,628
But cooks shouldn't since
it might chip and fall into the food.

197
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,046
I see.

198
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,923
Besides, I prefer balsam anyway.

199
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,509
Why? Wait, I know.

200
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,845
Because of the saying
that love will come true

201
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,513
if the color lasts until first snowfall?

202
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,056
As if I'd believe such nonsense.

203
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,059
Do you want to try?

204
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,895
Probably not. It's dowdy, isn't it?

205
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,941
I want to try it too.

206
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,782
Cho-hui.

207
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,085
Are you out of your mind?

208
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,756
-Your brother will kill you.
-Why are you here?

209
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,216
To nag at me?

210
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,345
You only took the thick duvet,
so I brought you summer sheets.

211
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,474
I wanted to see how you were doing.

212
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,642
But here you go again!

213
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,062
What? I didn't do anything wrong.

214
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:43,979
Seriously?

215
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,191
I'm your mother.
I can tell by the look in your eyes.

216
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,985
Denying it won't work.

217
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,112
You can't fool me.

218
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,368
Cho-hui, please. Get a grip on yourself.
What's wrong with you?

219
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:03,832
If you keep this up, your brother will
lock you up in a mental institution.

220
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,334
Mom!

221
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,670
I'm not crazy. I'm perfectly fine.

222
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:13,050
How is liking someone an illness?

223
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,343
You're wrong.

224
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,471
This is all because I raised you wrong.

225
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,849
-It's all my fault!
-Mom.

226
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,063
It's not your fault. It isn't.

227
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,357
It's not my fault either.

228
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,569
No, Cho-hui.
This isn't how you should live your life.

229
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,239
Cho-hui, no.

230
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,993
Please, Cho-hui.

231
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,748
Ms. Yu?

232
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,543
Sorry about that.

233
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,254
I only came in
because my molar hurt though.

234
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,464
That's actually because

235
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,051
the impacted tooth is
pressing against the molar's roots.

236
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,263
There's a chance
that the roots will also be affected,

237
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,140
so the tooth should be extracted.

238
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,892
Is that the only way?

239
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,644
Many fear the procedure,

240
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,982
but I recommend
that you bravely dig it out

241
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,818
rather than keep your pain hidden.

242
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,027
I see.

243
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,641
YOON HYE-JIN

244
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,677
Mi-seon.

245
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,014
-How do I look?
-Absolutely gorgeous.

246
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,812
-Let's see.
-What are you doing? Don't.

247
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,773
Does Officer Choi know this brand?

248
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,109
How trendy of him.

249
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,612
I bet he looked it up online.
He's been doing it nonstop these days.

250
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,864
Is this brand expensive?

251
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,201
Yes, it is quite expensive.

252
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,411
Really?

253
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,081
Eun-cheol's salary probably isn't much.
I feel bad.

254
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,336
These flowers look like you, so…

255
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,672
Oh, my.

256
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:42,509
I can't tell you apart from the flowers.

257
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,016
I don't want you to run away,

258
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,768
so pay me 100 won.

259
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:03,363
I'd appreciate it
if you wore it every day.

260
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,586
What's this?

261
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,129
It's a purse.

262
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,299
I thought it'd suit you.

263
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,551
I won't accept this.

264
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,635
Sorry?

265
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,679
Why not?

266
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:31,349
Eun-cheol, this is wrong.

267
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,893
This is too much.

268
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,895
Mi-seon,

269
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,355
am I making you uncomfortable?

270
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,483
No, it's not like that.

271
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,153
You're giving me too many gifts.

272
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,364
You give me a gift every day,
even when it's not a special day.

273
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,866
But every day is special.

274
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,079
Every day with you…

275
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,414
is special to me.

276
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:59,586
Every day I spend with you
is special to me too.

277
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,504
However,

278
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,800
I mean it when I say
the thought is what counts.

279
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,933
I understand. I'll hold back from now on.

280
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,235
I'm sorry, but I need to make a call.

281
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,336
Gosh.

282
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,173
It sure is pretty.

283
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,675
No way!

284
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,596
This is a pricey one.
Isn't it from the new F/W collection?

285
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,682
No way. It's gorgeous.

286
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,185
How is it that you know
more about these things than I do?

287
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,189
Because I'm the future stylist
of the globally acclaimed DOS.

288
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,526
-I hope your dream will come true.
-Thanks.

289
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,614
Can't I look at it some more?

290
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,199
-No.
-Please.

291
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,160
-Just a little more.
-No way.

292
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,036
-Can't I look inside?
-No.

293
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,164
-Please let me look.
-No.

294
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,665
What's taking him so long?

295
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,376
I'm afraid I can't.

296
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,338
After all those favors I've done for you?

297
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,965
I at least want five large ones.

298
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,136
You know how dangerous it'll be
if we get caught.

299
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,265
Okay. I'll see you at 9 p.m.
at the back of the market.

300
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:36,892
Sure.

301
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,313
Oh, no.

302
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,191
Is he taking bribes to pay for my gifts?

303
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,277
No wonder. Where else
could he have gotten the money?

304
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,739
You've got to be kidding me. What do I do?

305
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,495
Mi-seon, why did you come down?

306
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,582
Oh. Well…

307
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,836
Eun-cheol, let's catch
a late-night movie today.

308
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,672
-How does 9 p.m. sound?
-Well, I…

309
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,927
I'm sorry, but not today.

310
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,181
You see, I'm on duty tonight.

311
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,974
Tomorrow. How about tomorrow?

312
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,185
Right. Okay.

313
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,269
Okay.

314
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,033
Cho-hui.

315
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,792
I asked you to help me with the cleaning…

316
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:51,424
to say that I'm sorry about
putting you in a tight spot last time.

317
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,134
I shouldn't have said it.

318
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,513
It's all in the past now,
so please don't let it bother you.

319
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,555
Sure.

320
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,224
Actually,

321
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,894
there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

322
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,397
What? What is it?

323
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,399
When I came back to Gongjin,

324
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,110
I was surprised to hear…

325
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,904
about your divorce.

326
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,409
I'm utterly ashamed.
It's actually all my fault.

327
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,245
I thought you two
would still be happily married.

328
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,163
In harmony,

329
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,459
trading fish eyes for roe.

330
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,754
Enjoy.

331
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,964
Thank you.

332
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:36,052
So Cho-hui gets the middle slice.

333
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,846
Thank you.

334
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,098
And Hwa-jeong gets… There you go.

335
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,518
Yeong-guk, she should get
a good slice as well.

336
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,353
-Hwa-jeong, take mine.
-It's fine.

337
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,148
Hwa-jeong!

338
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,317
She loves fish eyes.

339
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,278
God, I can't even bear to look at them.

340
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,322
Hey. I'll take your eyes too.

341
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,120
Eat your own eyes. You can't have mine.

342
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,080
Don't be so dramatic.

343
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,124
Trade them for the roe then.

344
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,751
You don't eat roe?

345
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,169
It's too dry for me.

346
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:13,131
Fish eyes are tasty and crunchy.
They're definitely better.

347
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,051
You and that grotesque taste of yours.

348
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,719
I appreciate the satisfying deal.

349
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,894
You probably don't know this,

350
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,315
but I envied the relationship you two had.

351
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,316
What?

352
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,570
This is what I thought
every time I saw you two.

353
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:41,201
"I'd never grow lonely if I had
someone like that."

354
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,164
I had no idea back then.

355
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,209
I took it for granted,

356
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,295
so I didn't realize

357
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,757
how precious and rare it was.

358
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,053
It's funny, isn't it?

359
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,432
You don't realize your own feelings
until they're seen from a distance.

360
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,270
Don't

361
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,648
lose Hwa-jeong twice.

362
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,693
I truly hope
that you two become happy together.

363
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:22,283
I hurt her too badly
and I'm too ashamed of myself.

364
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,410
Yeong-guk,

365
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,498
I'm sure what she wants to hear from you
isn't an apology.

366
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,590
I'm having my wisdom tooth
extracted next week.

367
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,510
I'm scared
since people say it hurts a lot,

368
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,763
but I'll muster up the courage for it.

369
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:49,561
So you should muster up
a little bit of courage too.

370
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,235
Thanks, Cho-hui.

371
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,721
Here, let me.

372
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,847
No, I'm good.

373
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,145
Mi-seon's going out on a date,
so I came by myself.

374
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,775
But don't forget
that we're still on a break.

375
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,366
Chief Hong, you still have
nothing to say to me.

376
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,031
It should be close to 9 p.m.

377
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,908
Why can't I see a thing?

378
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,244
Damn sunglasses.

379
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,713
-My gosh.
-Will you check the merchandise?

380
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,757
Come on. As if I'd be that cold.

381
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,884
-This isn't our first rodeo.
-What's in that?

382
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,261
Take the money first.

383
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,014
It's all there.

384
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,560
-I'll now open this.
-No.

385
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,689
Eun-cheol, no. Don't!

386
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,773
You can't!

387
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,693
-Eun-cheol, you just can't.
-What the hell?

388
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,862
-What are you doing?
-How are you here?

389
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,072
Eun-cheol, you can't.

390
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:10,243
Are you selling illegal firearms?
You're a police officer.

391
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,161
It's not like that. Mi-seon, this is--

392
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,455
-It's not that.
-Did you just shoot me?

393
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,832
-Of course not.
-You shot me!

394
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,460
Mi-seon, it's only a toy.
It can't shoot live rounds.

395
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,837
-It can't?
-No.

396
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,005
-It's a toy?
-Yes.

397
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,883
-Is that a toy?
-Yes, it is.

398
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,510
Why on earth did you bring
a toy gun out here?

399
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,263
I'm selling it to him. Used goods.

400
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,973
What?

401
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,726
I've been selling items in my collection.

402
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,311
I'm a military-junkie, you see.

403
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,521
I'm a frequent buyer.

404
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,317
He is.

405
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,112
My gosh.

406
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,408
It looks pretty real, doesn't it?

407
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,163
I apologize for alarming you.

408
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,208
Why did you lie to me?

409
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,378
You could've been honest from the start.

410
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,589
I was embarrassed.

411
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,968
I want to give you everything,

412
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,262
but I'm not that well-off.

413
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,891
I'm not saying that I'm totally poor.

414
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,770
I save about 70 percent of what I earn.

415
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,773
I have insurance
that covers hospital expenses.

416
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,818
And I even have
a housing subscription deposit account.

417
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:28,863
Same here.

418
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,491
Sorry?

419
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,618
I have all of those as well.

420
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,330
I'm older than you

421
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,916
and have had a longer career.

422
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,878
I have an installment saving
that has matured

423
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,713
and also a CMA account.

424
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,509
Right, I see.

425
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,762
Eun-cheol.

426
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,182
Do you know the song that goes,

427
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,519
"write love with a pencil"?

428
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,437
No, I don't.

429
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,108
Well… Come to think of it,

430
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,610
you were born in the 90s.

431
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,863
Anyway, there's a song like that.

432
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,574
Like that song,

433
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:18,121
rather than in fonts
that seem flimsy and silly,

434
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,164
we'll write our love in cursive.

435
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,958
What?

436
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:27,088
I'm saying we should date seriously
with thoughts of marriage.

437
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,464
Mi-seon.

438
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,011
That has always been my intention.

439
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,525
And I may be jumping the gun here,

440
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:52,113
but we should stick to two kids
and raise them well.

441
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,366
"Procreating without planning
will condemn you to poverty."

442
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,663
Don't you know that one either?

443
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:05,418
It was the birth control policy
carried out by the government in the 60s.

444
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:09,005
I don't know. There's only one thing
on my mind right now.

445
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,008
What's that?

446
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,469
Today,

447
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,681
-I'm skipping a few bases.
-What?

448
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,908
Why has it been
so damn hard to reach her today?

449
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,703
What the heck?

450
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,332
It's not like her to close up so early.

451
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,085
Gosh. What on earth?

452
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,545
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

453
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,505
What's going on?

454
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,635
What…

455
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,268
What are you doing

456
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,562
all alone?

457
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,731
What?

458
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,860
Jeez. What's with you?

459
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,864
Get yourself a glass
if you're going to sit.

460
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,033
Jeez.

461
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,578
Judging by your answer,
you're completely wasted.

462
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,873
I don't believe this.

463
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,796
Did you empty
the bottle on your own? Gosh.

464
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,675
Goodness.

465
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,139
I can't seem to hold my liquor
like I used to.

466
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,015
Gosh.

467
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,600
Jeez.

468
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,897
That's good.

469
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,359
If you needed a drinking buddy,

470
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,070
you should've called.
What's with the pity party?

471
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:56,988
Wait.

472
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,283
Filling your own glass brings bad luck.

473
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,997
What gives though?

474
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,834
The rain, the snow,
not even a divorce stopped you

475
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,502
from working until late.

476
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,964
Tell me about it. I should've
closed up early on the day of my divorce.

477
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:18,134
Why did I bother to work so hard?

478
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,387
Just think that this break
is long overdue then.

479
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,308
Your body recovers after resting,

480
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,894
but your heart doesn't, I guess.

481
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,147
The wound must've festered
or the heart must have rotted

482
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,774
because I feel all mushy inside.

483
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,152
You…

484
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,781
still have feelings
for Yeong-guk, don't you?

485
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,954
Why do you ask? So that
you can tell everyone if I tell you?

486
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,040
Gosh. What do you take me for?

487
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,375
I may not seem like it,
but I'm your friend.

488
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,088
Also, I haven't forgotten about the time

489
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,175
you helped me through my rough patch.

490
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,969
Nam-suk, that's something
you should forget.

491
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,721
Girl, please.

492
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,266
I just can't understand you.

493
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,978
Why is it that you feel so much regret?

494
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,314
I just don't get it.

495
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,653
Because Yeong-guk took care of me
when I was down.

496
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,700
Back when my mom collapsed.

497
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,539
Life itself felt like a burden,

498
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,627
and not a day went by
when I didn't want to run away.

499
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,882
Then one day,
when I went to see my mom at the hospital…

500
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,801
I bet that's refreshing.

501
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,719
-Right?
-Yeong-guk was there.

502
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,515
-It's not too hot, is it?
-My mom hadn't been able to shower,

503
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:51,102
and he was there
wiping her with a damp cloth

504
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,312
with a smile on his face.

505
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,777
That brought a smile to my mom's face too.

506
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:06,534
The pain she was suffering
had her frowning and crying all the time,

507
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,160
but thanks to Yeong-guk,

508
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:12,039
she was laughing like she used to
before she fell ill.

509
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,253
And back then, not even I could smile
in my mother's presence.

510
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:26,345
Goodness. A good wash
brought your beauty back out.

511
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,849
I bet that felt nice. Right?

512
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:34,145
From that day on,
he came to see my mom at the hospital

513
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,649
every day after getting off work.

514
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:44,030
Being the sweetheart he is,
he probably did it out of pity.

515
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,406
Jeez.

516
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,700
And just like that,
I put a ring on his finger.

517
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:52,580
I clung onto him
knowing that he didn't actually love me.

518
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,418
But I guess I grew to expect more
over the years.

519
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,505
I blame my own greed and low self-esteem.

520
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,715
You…

521
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,426
Stop putting him on a pedestal.

522
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,764
He's not Jesus, Buddha, or a saint.

523
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,515
He only did what he wanted to do.

524
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,227
Don't you know by now that
he never does what he doesn't want to?

525
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,938
He's timid but totally stubborn.

526
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,940
Hasn't marriage taught you that about him?

527
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,818
Forget it. It's all in the past now.

528
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:30,326
By the way, Ms. Joo
offered to set me up on a blind date.

529
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,619
Seriously?

530
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,122
You've got to be kidding me.

531
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,168
And Yeong-guk said
I should accept her offer.

532
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,295
That crazy bastard.

533
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,091
So I told him I would.

534
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,968
Why say something you don't mean?

535
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,846
For someone who claims to be smart…

536
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,476
Yeo Hwa-jeong.

537
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,313
Hwa-jeong?

538
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:05,236
Gosh.

539
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,115
Yeong-guk, Hwa-jeong's drinking
at her restaurant

540
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,283
with the guy
she went on a blind date with,

541
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,952
and she's completely wasted.

542
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,287
They're drinking alone?

543
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,956
Damn judicial scrivener.

544
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,417
For the first time,
I might commit a crime tonight.

545
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,088
Hwa-jeong! Damn that bastard.

546
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,590
Where… Hwa-jeong?

547
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,683
I lied.

548
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,852
Nam-suk, damn you!

549
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,173
What the hell?

550
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,843
What is this? Am I dreaming?

551
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,470
No, you're not.

552
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,182
Why are you here?

553
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,813
Jeez. My head's killing me.

554
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,817
Don't make it worse, and just leave.

555
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,278
I have something to tell you.

556
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,739
-Don't.
-I have to.

557
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,449
Whatever. Don't say it.

558
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,825
Don't go on that blind date.

559
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,712
Are you drunk?
Why are you talking gibberish?

560
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,881
I know I don't have the right to say this,

561
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,091
but don't do it.

562
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,676
You lunatic.

563
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,803
Yes, that's what I am.

564
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,725
Since we've established that,
I'll say one more thing.

565
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,102
Can…

566
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,440
Can you forgive me just this once?

567
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,111
I shot myself in the foot.

568
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,740
I dug my own grave.

569
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,786
What I did to you…

570
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,084
It all came back to me.

571
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,798
I'm sorry…

572
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,051
for hurting you

573
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,054
without realizing it.

574
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,142
I know…

575
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,440
I could apologize forever
and it still wouldn't be enough.

576
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,074
So I was going to let you go
to atone for what I did.

577
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:58,993
But…

578
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,706
Damn it.

579
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,459
But I don't think I can.

580
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,842
We were together since we were young,

581
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,179
so I took you…

582
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,932
for granted.

583
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,979
Only after I lost you

584
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,648
was I able to realize…

585
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,318
what you mean to me.

586
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,323
I'm truly sorry, Hwa-jeong.

587
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,285
Can…

588
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,958
Can we start over from the beginning?

589
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,090
I'm slower than average

590
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,219
and a darn fool.

591
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,185
So I was the last
to realize your feelings.

592
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,396
Hey!

593
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,069
You asshole.

594
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,782
Who takes 15 years
to come to that realization?

595
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,784
Just leave.

596
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:25,746
Leave. Just go!

597
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,256
I'm sorry, Hwa-jeong.
I'll make it up to you while by your side.

598
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,218
I'll treat you right from now on.

599
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,437
Hwa-jeong, I'll treat you right.

600
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:55,692
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

601
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,615
So busy.

602
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:02,699
Hello.

603
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,120
-Do-ha!
-Hey.

604
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,371
Where are you off to?

605
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,373
To the mart in the city.

606
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,376
Ms. Wang needs something,
so I'm getting the car.

607
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,045
I see. I'll go. What do you need?

608
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:18,298
No, it's fine.
I can't pass an errand on to my boss.

609
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,676
Tell me before I change my mind.

610
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,682
All right. Then…

611
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,685
The pot and flipper
JUNE burned the other day.

612
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,439
Pot and flipper.

613
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,774
We're out of bottled water too.

614
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:36,942
Bottled water.

615
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,569
And eggs.

616
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,736
Eggs.

617
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,990
By the way, I heard that Chief Hong
and Dr. Yoon had a falling out.

618
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,826
Chief Hong… What? Who said that?

619
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,329
Mr. Choi at Chung-ho Hardware,
Mr. Oh Yoon,

620
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,833
Ms. Cho at the Gongjin
Korean-Chinese Restaurant, and…

621
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,169
Where are you off to?

622
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,505
We're also out of
tissues and green onions! And ice cream!

623
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,094
Knock, knock. Excuse me.

624
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,346
What brings you by, Director Ji?

625
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,391
Just to say hi. Why are you
sweeping a yard that's already clean?

626
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,352
Because moving about
will help clear your head?

627
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,813
-Your words sting a little.
-I don't mean to be nosy,

628
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,399
but everyone knows about
your falling-out with Hye-jin.

629
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,653
Stay for some sikhye.

630
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,452
Thanks for this.

631
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,455
It's to shut you up, so drink and leave.

632
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,627
That I can't do. Make up with her already.

633
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,339
I should've thrown you out
instead of inviting you in for a beverage.

634
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:45,385
If you keep being like that,
my giving up on her won't be worthwhile.

635
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,264
You just have to make me speechless.

636
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:53,268
Right? There's nothing
you can possibly say to that. Right?

637
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:55,604
We didn't argue.

638
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,231
Then what?

639
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,483
It's just that…

640
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,736
I feel like I'm not worthy of her.

641
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:07,115
She's transparent, honest, and brave…

642
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,952
unlike me.

643
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:15,541
Hold on. Does that mean you're vague,
dishonest, and a coward?

644
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:19,795
Gosh, come on. I was only joking.

645
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,424
But if that's the case,
isn't the solution quite simple?

646
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,387
You can be just as transparent,
honest, and brave.

647
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,639
I'm not in the mood for wordplay.

648
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:31,807
But I'm being serious.

649
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:39,481
Look. I don't know what you're holding,
but just lay all your cards on the table.

650
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:43,068
Relationships aren't a poker game
where you bluff and make bets.

651
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,113
Just be honest.
Show her what kind of person you are.

652
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,948
Let her decide how she feels about it.

653
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,119
But what if she's disappointed in me?

654
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,539
No way. She'll accept you for who you are

655
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,165
because that's who she is.

656
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,296
Maybe you know her better than I do.

657
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,466
Hey.

658
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:12,055
There's no one in this world right now
who knows her better than you do.

659
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,026
I could've just gone with Do-ha.
Why did you offer to go?

660
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,573
Director Ji?

661
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,993
-Director Ji?
-What?

662
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,788
-Did you say something?
-What are you thinking so hard about?

663
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,750
I met with Chief Hong earlier

664
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,002
since he and Hye-jin hit a rough patch.

665
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,254
I'm just worried about them.

666
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:49,384
How is it that your mind
has room for such thoughts?

667
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,094
Why do you worry about that?

668
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,220
What?

669
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,348
Focus on healing your own heart

670
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,059
instead of worrying
about their lovers' quarrel.

671
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,437
-My heart?
-Yes, your heart. I know it still hurts.

672
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,606
You're still broken-hearted.

673
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,107
Well…

674
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,486
Actually, I'm fine.

675
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,780
With what?

676
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,327
I think I'm better now.

677
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,122
I'm even better than I realized.

678
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,749
Is that so?

679
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,753
Then… That's a relief.

680
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,434
Seriously? Keep your eyes on the road.
That scared me!

681
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,062
-Sorry about that.
-That was terrifying.

682
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,732
Gosh. Where's the emergency light?
Sorry about that.

683
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,434
What? Hey, Hye-jin.

684
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,186
Why did you send so much?

685
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,564
For you to share with your boyfriend.

686
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,817
The weather's hot,
so refrigerate the green onion kimchi.

687
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,985
Can I talk to her?

688
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,404
Hye-jin, your father wants to talk to you.

689
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,321
Sure.

690
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,324
Hey, Hye-jin.

691
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,703
Hey, Dad. Is there
something you wanted to say?

692
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,164
Well, it's nothing serious.

693
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:46,501
Can you tell that friend of yours
that the plant's been growing well?

694
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,505
That even a flower
might blossom next spring.

695
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:56,636
And come visit us with him
when you're not too busy.

696
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,473
I'll treat you to meat this time.

697
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,935
Hye-jin, are you still there?

698
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,979
Yes, I am.

699
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,273
Hang up already so that she can rest.

700
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,734
Right. Get some rest then.

701
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,110
Bye, Dad.

702
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,918
Ever when he was a kid, he was so mature.

703
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,879
He only learned how to hold himself back,

704
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,548
so he doesn't know
how to open up to people.

705
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:35,675
No, because of me,

706
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,553
my grandfather passed away.

707
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,890
If only I hadn't gone out…

708
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,560
to watch the World Cup matches.

709
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,146
For a long time,

710
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,108
he hasn't had anyone
that he could share his pain with.

711
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:58,156
I believe that you can be his rock,
someone he opens up to.

712
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,464
Jeong-u…

713
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,927
Why did you want me home early?

714
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:21,972
What…

715
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,391
What's all this?

716
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,978
I'm new to this,
so I don't know if I got it right.

717
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,606
It's your grandfather's death anniversary.

718
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,275
Jeong-u…

719
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,862
Come on.
There's no need to be that touched.

720
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,406
Seriously? Don't you know
even the simplest rule?

721
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,534
Red sits in the east
while white sits in the west.

722
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:46,413
Yes, of course.
Anyway, let's greet your grandfather.

723
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,372
Sure.

724
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,918
Hello, sir. I'm Park Jeong-u.

725
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,004
I'm Du-sik's upperclassman,

726
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,091
and your grandson is like a brother to me.

727
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,637
I'll see to it
that he serves well in the military

728
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,474
and that he gets married,
so don't you worry.

729
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,601
So please look over us from above.

730
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,694
Are you crying?

731
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,363
No, I'm not.

732
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,615
-But you are.
-I'm not.

733
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:07,077
-But you're in tears.
-Dust blew into my eyes just now.

734
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,288
-Your eyes are bloodshot.
-Stop saying I'm crying!

735
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,456
Damn it.

736
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,210
Where are you going?

737
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,924
I feel so awkward
because I've never worn a suit before.

738
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,301
Seon-a, how do I look? Do I look okay?

739
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,346
Gosh, you look really nice.

740
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,015
-Really?
-Yes.

741
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,183
Don't you agree, honey?

742
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,187
Du-sik.

743
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,064
Did you leave your suit here?

744
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:37,983
It has your name on it.

745
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,859
Don't be ridiculous.

746
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,653
How much is it?

747
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,739
It's too expensive!

748
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,950
-I can't.
-Don't be like that.

749
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,785
I have a lot of money.

750
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:52,539
And you made it as an intern at my firm.
Of course, I should get you this.

751
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,458
Still. This is too expensive.

752
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:59,129
When you get your first salary
as a regular employee,

753
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,798
pay me back with a decent fishing rod.
That'll do.

754
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,009
You've got to be kidding me.

755
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,344
Are you already looking for a way
to extort him?

756
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:10,265
Consider it done.
I'll be made a regular employee this time.

757
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:14,644
Nice! Du-sik promised to show me
a great fishing spot in Gongjin.

758
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,647
From what I hear, fish bite in seconds.

759
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,815
Black piggy, right?

760
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,316
No, it's black porgy.

761
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,902
Yes, black porgy. I'll catch that for you.

762
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,572
Getting the name right comes first.

763
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:50,722
Leave.

764
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,224
How dare you come here.

765
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,144
How dare you show your face!

766
00:55:57,353 --> 00:56:00,398
Seon-a, I'm sorry.

767
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,649
You're sorry?

768
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:05,195
If you're that sorry,
bring Jeong-u back to me.

769
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,991
Bring him back to life.
Bring him back to me!

770
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,409
I'm sorry.

771
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:15,413
Why did my innocent Jeong-u have to die?

772
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,040
Why?

773
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,752
It should've been you.

774
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,129
You should've been the one to die!

775
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,590
You should've died instead…

776
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,303
I'm so sorry.

777
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:36,017
-No…
-I'm so sorry.

778
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,313
I'm sorry.

779
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,355
Can I come in?

780
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,158
Once again, it's not coffee.

781
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,076
It's too deep into the night.

782
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:39,289
Only one more shoot to go. There's
no need to pull an all-nighter now.

783
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,797
Hold on.

784
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:59,100
What the hell? Who said you could
take off my shield without permission?

785
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,185
Ji-won,

786
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:05,231
I thought long and hard
about what you said the other day.

787
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,906
I offer two more large ones
than what they offered.

788
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,620
Okay, fine. I'm in a generous mood.
Five large ones.

789
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:22,790
So all you came up with is
"What's your price? I'll buy you off."

790
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,334
Who are you to steal my line?

791
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:29,964
You should be saying, "How much
can you offer? I need the money."

792
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,716
Has the heat fried your brain?

793
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:35,595
We can't do Autumn in My Heart
since we're in the middle of summer.

794
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,098
Do-ha told me
you haven't signed any contract yet.

795
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,517
So?

796
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:45,522
After our talk the other day,
I was going to let you go.

797
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,732
But Director Ji
without Writer Wang Ji-won?

798
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,443
I couldn't even picture it.

799
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,074
I still have so much
I want to do with you.

800
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:02,497
Come on. We agreed to do a summer
special mystery horror show a while ago.

801
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,332
-Do you remember that?
-I do.

802
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:09,003
The Red Mask, Hong Kong Granny,
and the plushy ghost.

803
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:12,465
The show would feature ghosts
that terrorized us as kids.

804
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,551
Exactly. You remember it all.

805
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,928
Yes, and I'll sell the idea
to just about anyone.

806
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,638
Sure, the idea's all yours.

807
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,100
That easily?
You know you could sue me for it.

808
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:25,603
I don't care.
You'll end up doing it with me anyway.

809
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,231
What do you mean?

810
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,608
This is the conclusion I came to.

811
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,778
It's not over until it's over.

812
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,282
So I'm starting over

813
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:42,245
and joining the long list of candidates
who are trying to court you.

814
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,416
Here.

815
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,630
I hope things turn out for the best,
Writer Wang Ji-won.

816
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,444
Damn, that's hot!

817
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,449
I came here

818
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:23,828
because my mom sent
side dishes for you too.

819
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,956
The green onion kimchi
should be refrigerated before it ripens.

820
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,751
I see. Please tell her I'm grateful.

821
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,965
Also, I'm done thinking about us.

822
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,009
What?

823
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:41,304
Chief Hong, you know patience
isn't my strong suit.

824
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,516
-I do.
-I moved to Gongjin

825
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,435
only after thinking about it for a day.

826
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,062
I'm aware of that.

827
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,231
I hate it when things are vague.

828
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,860
Things that are ambiguous
don't sit well with me.

829
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,154
So what I want to say is…

830
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,617
Despite our current situation,

831
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,495
if you can promise

832
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:09,415
that you'll someday open up to me,

833
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,335
I could wait.

834
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,385
I'm not asking you
to open up to me right now.

835
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,597
All I want is for you
to acknowledge the possibility.

836
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:30,269
Am I a part of the future you paint?

837
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:36,067
And do you think that
you could see a future with me?

838
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,861
That's all I wanted to know.

839
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:44,325
It's what I want too, but--

840
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,993
Leave it at that.

841
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,537
Nothing else matters

842
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,456
if that's what you
ultimately want as well.

843
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,418
Then we're good. I'm willing to wait.

844
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:55,878
Hye-jin.

845
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,880
I've made up my mind,

846
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,717
but I'll give you
some extra time to think.

847
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,095
But let's end the break.

848
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,140
You can think while we date.

849
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,268
Take your time while we're together.

850
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,108
But don't make me wait too long.

851
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,883
-It's good.
-It is.

852
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,135
That's great.

853
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,178
Is that Ms. Gam-ri's sikhye?

854
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,387
-Yes.
-Tell me about it.

855
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,478
Guys, that was the bomb!

856
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,313
Good job, everyone.

857
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:58,107
-Good job.
-Good job!

858
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,193
-Thank you.
-Good job, guys.

859
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,819
-Good job, Director Ji.
-Good job.

860
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,029
-Good job.
-Nice.

861
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,783
-Thank you!
-You guys did great. Chief Hong, thanks.

862
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,493
I didn't do much.

863
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:11,746
From handling the location
to the props and filming,

864
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,414
you helped in every aspect.

865
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,583
It ended well all thanks to your help.

866
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:18,294
This much expression of gratitude
is too much for me.

867
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,212
Jeez.

868
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,089
Chief Hong,
I'm grateful for everything too.

869
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:26,052
The medicinal herb you gave my father
helped him regain his energy.

870
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,095
I'm glad. I'll get you some more later.

871
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,932
That's not why I said it.
I won't forget your kindness.

872
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:34,143
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm just glad your father's better.

873
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,146
Nonchalantly sweet and generous.
You're so cool.

874
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,107
When did you two get so close?

875
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,610
Hey, Ms. Gam-ri.

876
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,029
What? A stock pot?

877
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,576
-Ms. Gam-ri!
-Hey.

878
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:53,830
I said I'd bring it over to you.

879
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:57,458
I took a walk to lessen the boredom
and ended up here.

880
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,961
Gosh. Anyway, what do you need this for?

881
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:03,172
-Well, I heard there'd be an after-party.
-Right.

882
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:07,176
So I was cooking yukgaejang for the staff,

883
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:12,390
but Mat-i dozed off
and burned the stock pot.

884
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:15,142
I'm burning with anger right now.

885
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,896
-So you're making a new batch?
-Yes. It won't take long.

886
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,440
I see. I guess I have no choice then.

887
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,026
Since it's so hot today,
I should give you a piggyback

888
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,945
to help conserve your energy.

889
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:31,659
Don't be ridiculous. Why would you
carry me when my ankle is fine?

890
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,078
Come on. Hop on while I tell you nicely.

891
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:39,333
Well, it does seem you have
a broad enough back for it.

892
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,752
-Why are you stating the obvious?
-Get up.

893
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:44,714
Let's go.

894
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,382
Let me at least carry it for you.

895
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,802
-Du-sik.
-Yes?

896
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,180
You and the doctor had an argument, right?

897
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,727
Unbelievable.
I see that everyone in Gongjin knows.

898
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,687
Even the neighborhood dog would know.

899
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:05,276
Just go tell her that you're sorry
and give her a hug.

900
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:10,489
What if she gets tired of waiting
and ends up giving up on you?

901
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:16,245
This kind of relationship
isn't easy to come by,

902
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,456
so you must do your best not to lose it.

903
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:22,835
Du-sik.

904
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:29,759
I love how you now have
Dr. Yoon by your side.

905
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,430
How you help others is admirable,

906
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,807
but you must live your own life too.

907
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:43,397
Eat a lot of good food and be happy.

908
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,317
Seeing you happy will make me happy

909
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,611
and also make Dr. Yoon happy.

910
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,866
I'm sure everyone in Gongjin
thinks the same way.

911
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:55,868
Grandma,

912
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,121
am I allowed to do that?

913
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:03,501
Yes, of course. You deserve it.

914
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:10,216
I know these past years
haven't been easy for you.

915
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,887
Don't worry about other things now,

916
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:16,973
and only think about yourself.

917
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,742
Hey, it's been a while.

918
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,411
It sure has.

919
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:39,745
Have you been well?

920
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,664
How's school?

921
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,541
Same old, same old.

922
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:46,419
Not you though. Rumor has it
that you moved to a small town.

923
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,338
Yes, it ended up that way.

924
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,549
Anyway, what's the occasion?

925
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:55,094
You never call just to check up on me.

926
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,723
I always liked how you cut to the chase.
Come back to Seoul.

927
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:02,143
What? That's out of the blue.

928
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:06,397
A clinical professor job opened up,
so I thought I'd recommend you.

929
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:11,986
I see.

930
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,470
Let's go.

931
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,180
Sure.

932
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:54,987
Goodness.

933
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:58,449
-Here you go.
-Take those for her.

934
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:02,078
It's yukgaejang I made. Try it.

935
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,080
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

936
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,665
Once you leave town,

937
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,543
I'll only see you again
when we meet in the afterlife.

938
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,338
Don't say that.
I'm going to come visit you for meals.

939
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,131
-What?
-Should I not come over?

940
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,509
Gosh. Of course you should come!

941
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,512
Of course. You're always welcome.

942
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,347
-Okay.
-Good.

943
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:26,352
Nam-suk, can you get them
bowls of yukgaejang?

944
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,728
-Sure.
-Enjoy.

945
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,313
-You too.
-It's coming.

946
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:32,817
Here comes the yukgaejang.

947
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:40,908
Here you go.

948
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,788
Your yukgaejang is served.

949
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,706
-Right.
-Thanks.

950
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,210
Don't make it so obvious.

951
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,045
-What?
-What?

952
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:56,590
I have no clue what you're talking about.

953
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:59,426
As if. Remember that night?

954
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,388
You two got back together thanks to me.

955
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:03,848
My little white lie.

956
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:08,102
Things worked out for the best
because I told that little lie.

957
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:09,311
Don't you like shrimp?

958
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,896
-Yes, I love them.
-Have this.

959
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,524
It's hot! Hey,
you should be nicer to me now.

960
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,526
What the hell are you saying?

961
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,987
You should've said that it was hot!

962
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:20,281
That's because they've been deep fried.

963
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,950
And your heart's been fried with love.

964
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:27,454
She'd make a great K-pop idol singer too.

965
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:28,914
Hye-jin.

966
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,166
Hey, Seong-hyeon.

967
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,626
-Hey. You should get eating.
-Sure.

968
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,254
-Thanks for coming.
-I'm the one who should thank you.

969
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:39,300
Thanks to your show,
the whole town of Gongjin perked up,

970
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:40,676
and everyone had a blast.

971
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:43,012
Right, of course.

972
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:44,930
I'm even more grateful to hear that.

973
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,725
-I should give you some privacy.
-Right.

974
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:49,894
I'm not that dense, you see.

975
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:51,937
-Gosh.
-Gosh, hello.

976
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,898
I'm glad I ran into you again.

977
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,065
Same here.

978
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:59,069
I feel like I was able to complete
an unfinished task in life.

979
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:02,948
All right, everyone.
It seems like the right time

980
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,702
to hear a few words from Director Ji.

981
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,621
Yes, go ahead!

982
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,085
Look how handsome he is!

983
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,839
Gosh, this sure is embarrassing.

984
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:23,344
Anyway, thanks to
your consideration and generosity,

985
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:25,596
filming was able to go smoothly.

986
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,057
Your smiles and encouragement,

987
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,434
I'll never forget them.

988
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:33,145
Please watch the show when it airs.
Thank you!

989
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:36,315
Director Ji!

990
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,817
Since you're there, sing a song for us.

991
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,402
-Sorry?
-It's an after-party.

992
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,489
Suk-ja, you just don't know
when to shut up.

993
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:47,409
She's right.
Sing a song since you're up there.

994
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,078
Gosh, no.

995
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,413
-Sing us a song.
-Go for it!

996
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,123
-Sing for us!
-Sing for us!

997
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:56,293
-Sing for us.
-Don't sing and you'll stay single

998
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,421
-You poor soul
-You poor soul

999
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,466
-One, two, one, two
-One, two, one, two

1000
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:04,260
-one, two, three
-one, two, three

1001
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,387
-One, two, three, four!
-All right.

1002
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:10,557
I'm not particularly good at it,
so I'll keep it short.

1003
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,823
It takes new love

1004
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:30,619
To forget about an old one

1005
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:35,207
We seem to be on the right track

1006
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,209
I don't have any regrets

1007
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:41,255
Trust our laughter

1008
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:46,135
Let's stop being sorry

1009
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:52,182
It's all in the past

1010
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:57,479
Whoever brought the pain

1011
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:01,775
You remain as the song

1012
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:07,865
That brings me helplessly to tears

1013
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:13,037
I believed it would be momentary

1014
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,875
When I tossed and turned, unable to sleep

1015
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:23,380
You reached out and held my hand

1016
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:29,178
Someone new entered my life

1017
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:32,681
Let it stay this way

1018
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:41,440
La la la la la la

1019
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,153
-No way.
-My gosh.

1020
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:52,284
-That wasn't any good.
-Jeez.

1021
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:55,120
Gosh.

1022
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,379
Can we talk?

1023
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:04,463
Sure.

1024
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:16,183
Chief Hong.

1025
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,230
Why come all this way
just to say something?

1026
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:28,404
Hye-jin, would you like to come over
after the after-party?

1027
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,155
Did you bring me here to ask that?

1028
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:33,867
Yes, there's something
I must tell you today.

1029
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:38,747
It will probably be a very long story.

1030
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:42,584
Do you still want to hear it?

1031
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,838
Sure. I'd love to.

1032
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:48,882
You can talk all night.

1033
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:52,719
Tomorrow's Sunday,
so I don't have to go to work.

1034
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:59,518
And I also have something to tell you.

1035
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:04,189
Okay. We'll talk later then.
We'll talk about everything.

1036
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,274
Sure.

1037
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,618
-Where did they go?
-Who?

1038
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:19,663
Did Chief Hong and Dr. Yoon
skip out already?

1039
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:22,207
Yes, they left together earlier.

1040
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,294
Bo-ra, you can't tell on them like that.

1041
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:26,670
Do you have a death wish?

1042
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,631
He's right, Bo-ra.

1043
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:33,719
You should learn to turn a blind eye
when it comes to business between adults.

1044
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:37,514
I guess they're back on good terms again.

1045
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:40,726
It looks that way, and I'm glad.

1046
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,603
I knew it, you know.

1047
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:44,813
Anyone can tell they're in love.

1048
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:50,152
Exactly. He used to address her
as "Ms. Dentist" with a frown on his face,

1049
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:53,530
but now he calls her Hye-jin.

1050
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:57,159
My ears can only take so much.

1051
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:02,414
But Hye-jin still calls him Chief Hong,
and not by his name.

1052
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,916
-Really?
-Yes.

1053
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:07,044
It must've become a habit for her
just like the rest of us.

1054
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:11,465
Or she might choose not to
since his name's on the dowdy side.

1055
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:15,260
It's why I suggested
that he change his name.

1056
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,930
Take me for instance.
Oh Yoon. How perfect is that?

1057
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:21,517
I was surprised when I heard his name too.
It didn't match his looks.

1058
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,559
It does surprise you.

1059
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:24,937
Why? What's his name?

1060
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:26,647
Chief Hong's name?

1061
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:30,192
-No way.
-Oh, here they come.

1062
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:32,611
-Right here.
-You seem much better.

1063
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,572
-What do you mean?
-Gosh, don't do that.

1064
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,658
Fine, let me clear it instead.

1065
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:42,412
Chief Hong, is your name Hong Du-sik?

1066
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:43,622
What? Yes, it is.

1067
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:46,375
Did you perhaps work
at YK Asset Management?

1068
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:53,840
Do you know Kim Gi-hun?

1069
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,099
Hi, Mr. Hong. Good morning.

1070
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:04,434
Yes, hello. Good morning to you too.

1071
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,812
It's hot outside, so here you go.

1072
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:09,648
You don't have to always get me one.

1073
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:12,109
There was a buy-one-get-one-free deal.

1074
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:14,319
Who am I to refuse a freebie, right?

1075
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,697
Convenience stores have
buy-two-get-one-free deals.

1076
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,448
Aren't you buying one more for me?

1077
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:21,660
No way. The place in my neighborhood
has a different policy.

1078
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:22,995
Anyway, enjoy.

1079
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:26,790
Thank you!

1080
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:27,958
Don't mention it.

1081
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:36,174
Well, my father is a bit ill.

1082
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,135
He's paraplegic.

1083
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:41,722
I heard those beans increase blood flow
and help with paralysis,

1084
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:42,889
so I got some.

1085
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,893
You know my dad, don't you?

1086
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:50,439
Hong Du-sik, you bastard!

1087
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:54,568
Chief Hong?

1088
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,445
-What?
-What the hell?

1089
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,925
DU-SIK AND HYE-JIN'S BUCKET LIST

1090
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:31,313
6. MAKE YOU HAPPY

1091
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:49,623
Be happy with you for a very long time.

1092
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:36,169
Don't follow me.

1093
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:38,004
I'm worried about you.

1094
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:41,842
I'm the one who did that
to Do-ha's father.

1095
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:46,471
I don't know what's going on anymore.
I really don't know.

1096
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:50,183
Sir, just trust me and wait.

1097
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:52,227
Mr. Hong.

1098
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,897
It must've been so hard for you.

1099
01:18:56,648 --> 01:18:59,401
You must've hidden the pain deep down.

1100
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:02,362
You've been holding onto such a burden.

1101
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:04,197
I'm really sorry.

1102
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,074
I'm sorry.

1103
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:14,291
