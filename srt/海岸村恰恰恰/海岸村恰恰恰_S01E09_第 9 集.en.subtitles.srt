1
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,443
Ms. Dentist?

2
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,904
Your clinic closed hours ago.

3
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,989
You shouldn't be out so late--

4
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,631
Excuse me.

5
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,883
You dropped your phone.

6
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,221
I'll leave it here.

7
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,184
Continue what you were doing.

8
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,825
It didn't break.

9
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,286
Really?

10
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,038
Our country sure makes sturdy phones.

11
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,417
Of course. After all,
we are an IT powerhouse.

12
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,835
-I should go.
-Okay.

13
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,807
Get home safe.

14
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,602
Okay. Thanks.

15
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,811
No problem.

16
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,742
You were just startled.

17
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,036
That's all.

18
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,705
Gosh, it's hot.

19
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,250
Why am I feeling so hot?

20
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,075
Is the feng shui bad here?

21
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,280
Taekwondo!

22
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,783
EPISODE 9

23
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:12,413
Please touch the anti-static pad
for your safety.

24
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,125
-Please select your method of payment.
-How will you pay? Credit? Cash?

25
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,710
-Credit, please.
-Just press this.

26
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,754
Please select the fuel of your choice.

27
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,798
-It's diesel, so press this.
-Right.

28
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,341
You selected diesel.

29
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,384
-Input the amount of fuel you want.
-How much?

30
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,888
-Fifty thousand won.
-Fifty thousand won. All right.

31
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,934
Please insert your credit card facing up.

32
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,103
-Insert your card.
-Right.

33
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,108
-Checking your fingerprint.
-Press "confirm."

34
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,567
It worked.

35
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,027
You can refuel now.

36
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,655
-Make sure you touch the anti-static pad.
-Right.

37
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,948
Thank you, sir.

38
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,784
Don't mention it. This is a problem.

39
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,537
They're replacing everything
with computers now.

40
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,873
The elderly have no time
to adjust to this change.

41
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,876
Yes?

42
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,212
Right now?

43
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,923
Is it the standard size?

44
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,383
Okay, I'll stop by.

45
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,300
All right.

46
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,928
Are you done?

47
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,555
Yes, almost.

48
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,723
We should've gone
to a regular gas station.

49
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,270
By the way, didn't that guy
speak down to me?

50
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,396
Did he?

51
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,982
I think he did.

52
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,552
Hello, Dr. Yoon.
Working out early in the morning?

53
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,929
Yes. My body felt a bit heavy,
so I went for a run.

54
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,516
I see. Are you sure
it wasn't your heart that was heavy?

55
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,434
Sorry?

56
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,603
I know.

57
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,815
-Know what?
-Mr. Ban told me.

58
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:08,112
He said you and Chief Hong
passionately embraced last night.

59
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,030
What?

60
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,199
Don't worry. I didn't tell anyone.

61
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,742
That's not what happened.

62
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,785
I understand.

63
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,581
You spent the night with Chief Hong,
but you're also interested in Director Ji.

64
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,626
You're torn between those two. I get it.

65
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,127
You got it all wrong.

66
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,962
Don't worry. I get it.

67
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,964
I totally understand how you feel.

68
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,634
Don't worry. I haven't told a single soul.

69
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,052
I'm rooting for you.

70
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,137
Good luck.

71
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,268
Seriously? She's awfully excited
for someone with a secret.

72
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,104
Don't you worry about a thing!
I won't tell anyone!

73
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,439
-That hurts.
-Trust me!

74
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,650
Gosh.

75
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,738
Dad.

76
00:08:56,285 --> 00:09:00,206
Had you told me you were coming,
I would've cleaned up a bit.

77
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,083
I didn't want to come.

78
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,751
Unbelievable.

79
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,211
He's lying.

80
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,548
We were nearby, and he wanted to stop by.

81
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,050
I told him
we should call you first, but he insisted.

82
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,343
I see.

83
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,387
Where's the bathroom?

84
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,305
It's over there.

85
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,725
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

86
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,019
Goodness!

87
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,313
Chief Hong.

88
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,191
-"Chief Hong"?
-What? Yes.

89
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,193
What are you doing here?

90
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,487
I came to fix your shower.

91
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,990
The showerhead burst,

92
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,784
so I got completely drenched.

93
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,244
The new head is stronger.

94
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,246
Why would you do that in an empty house?

95
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,622
Ms. Pyo just left.

96
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,833
She told me to fix it
since you'd be home soon.

97
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,167
I can't believe her.

98
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,461
Okay, then. You should go.

99
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,131
-Pay me.
-What?

100
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,507
I need to get paid.

101
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,884
Okay. I'll wire it.

102
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,136
-Leave.
-Come on.

103
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,929
Don't push me. My bag's still here.

104
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,639
Fine. I'm leaving.

105
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,016
-Gosh.
-Stop!

106
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,728
Will you pay me instead?

107
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,187
So you're Chief Hong?

108
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,355
That's right.

109
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,108
I'm her father.

110
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,068
I thought so.

111
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,114
Did you refuel your car all right?

112
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,700
Yes, we did. Thank you.

113
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,286
-It was my pleasure.
-You met him?

114
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,623
Yes. I helped him out at the gas station.

115
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,834
Do you frequent her house?

116
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,963
Well… I do come by
more often than every now and then.

117
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,507
Dad. Let me explain--

118
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,635
What's your relationship with her?

119
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,180
-What?
-From what I heard,

120
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,099
you two even spent
the night together. Am I wrong?

121
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,601
Well…

122
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,438
-Dad. Let me--
-I'm afraid I can't answer that

123
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,190
with a simple yes or no.

124
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,942
I also heard you two
embraced each other last night.

125
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,361
There's actually a good reason.

126
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,363
Gosh, will you continue holding…

127
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,785
Right. You have
no intention of letting go of it.

128
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,622
Dad, I can explain. So please let go--

129
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,582
There's no need. I already heard it all.

130
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:12,088
Besides, I even caught him at your house,
so don't try to make excuses.

131
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,715
-I said I'd explain--
-No, let me.

132
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,387
You're right. I'm Ms. Dentist-- I mean,

133
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,056
Hye-jin's boyfriend.

134
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,434
Goodness.

135
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,773
Oh, dear. Come on, honey.

136
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,589
Why did you say that?

137
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,841
I had to survive.

138
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,717
What?

139
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,764
That's your reason?

140
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,058
Then what? He was about to crush my hand.

141
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,978
And I figured
that this was the simplest way.

142
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,522
He wasn't going to be convinced otherwise.

143
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,441
Explaining myself wouldn't have worked,

144
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,569
so I decided to just pretend
to be your boyfriend for today.

145
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,736
And then?

146
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,031
And then you can say we've broken up.

147
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,658
What can he do about it?

148
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,662
So you're making me clean up the mess.

149
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,622
Consider this a part-time job for me.

150
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,624
I'm your boyfriend for the day.

151
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,376
And you want to get paid?

152
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,503
I'll only charge you for the showerhead.

153
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,338
Unbelievable.

154
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,549
"Unbelievable"? Why? Do you not like it?

155
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,217
Then I'll tell him the truth.

156
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,887
Continue what you were doing.

157
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,974
What is this? A rabbit?

158
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,227
Yes. Isn't it pretty?
I have a fruit plating certificate.

159
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,813
Hop, hop.

160
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,651
Oh, my. You sliced them so well.
It's so pretty.

161
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,029
It's nothing. Enjoy.

162
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,495
Hye-jin, go to your room.

163
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,537
No.

164
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,375
All right, then.
You. Let's talk over there.

165
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,376
No.

166
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,590
-She says no.
-He's quite obedient to her.

167
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,926
Women know what's best, right?

168
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,388
He already knows the truth.
He's better than you.

169
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,057
Be quiet, will you?

170
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,975
Was that an order?

171
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,646
No, it was a question.

172
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,192
What's your name?

173
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,401
I'm Hong Du-sik.

174
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,237
-Sir.
-Age?

175
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,154
Thirty-five.

176
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,198
Sir.

177
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,992
How long have you two been dating?

178
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,037
For about three months.

179
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,291
How could you have gotten
so close in such a short time?

180
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,170
Honey. Calm down and breathe. Okay?

181
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,173
Times have changed.

182
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,716
Don't be so old-fashioned.

183
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,969
Fine.

184
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,055
What do you do for a living?

185
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,307
I just have many part-time jobs.

186
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,267
Are you saying

187
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,687
you're unemployed?

188
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,232
I'm currently experiencing
all the jobs in the world.

189
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,943
But if you want to limit that
to having one specific job…

190
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,319
Then no.

191
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,908
Are you dating an unemployed man?

192
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,535
I guess you could say that.

193
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,036
Well…

194
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,333
Why does it matter
when I make enough money?

195
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,335
He's a good guy.

196
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,420
What did you say?

197
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:44,216
And he's not the incompetent man
you're making him out to be.

198
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,136
I mean, he's handsome, tall,

199
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,929
and graduated from SNU.

200
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,807
-SNU?
-Yes.

201
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,851
Besides, he got in
with the highest grades.

202
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,227
Was it chemistry?

203
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,937
-Engineering.
-Right.

204
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,775
-I see.
-Anyway, he's just taking a rest

205
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,360
in his hometown.

206
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,403
Right?

207
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:05,988
Is that true?

208
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:10,826
Of course, Dad.
I am a good judge of character.

209
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,830
She's right. I'm sure
she picked the right one.

210
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,334
Let's go check out her dental clinic

211
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,127
and look around the neighborhood.

212
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,629
Sure, then.

213
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,214
Then let's let him go first.

214
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,175
-I'll guide you after.
-You should do it.

215
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,302
Me? Sir?

216
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,428
What? No?

217
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,684
Let's go, honey. Come on.

218
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,858
Are you insane?
People will see us together!

219
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,402
Don't worry. I have a plan.

220
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,946
Let's go.

221
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,326
I can't believe this.

222
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,619
Here.

223
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,330
Eat slowly and enjoy.

224
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,873
Eat up.

225
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,209
-Thank you for the meal.
-My pleasure.

226
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,881
This is an announcement
to our dear Gongjin residents.

227
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,511
-Due to some unavoidable situation,
-No way!

228
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,180
-Chief Hong is pretending
-Look at this.

229
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,683
to be Dr. Yoon's boyfriend.

230
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:21,105
We ask for your cooperation
in this role-playing.

231
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,524
Whoever contributes the most
will be rewarded

232
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,777
a 30-percent discount
at our dental clinic.

233
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,529
-Thirty percent?
-Thirty percent?

234
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,532
Let's go!

235
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,078
Cut.

236
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,039
You're in a food coma, aren't you?

237
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,667
Yes. I'm extremely drowsy.

238
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,128
How about we take a two-hour break?

239
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,379
-Seriously?
-Yes.

240
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,716
I don't want the staff
to get heat stroke in this scorching heat.

241
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,510
We deserve to work in better conditions.

242
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,223
-Awesome.
-But promise me you'll stay inside

243
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,933
and rest up.

244
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,226
-Okay.
-Okay.

245
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,729
Let's take a break

246
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,355
and come back by 2 p.m. Go.

247
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,774
-Okay. Good work.
-Good work.

248
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,401
-See you later.
-Bye.

249
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,778
-Bye.
-Bye.

250
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,071
-Hello.
-Hello.

251
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,159
Goodness, you're going to spill it.

252
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,869
No, I'm fine.

253
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,328
That must be very heavy.

254
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,998
Let me take it.

255
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,126
-Goodness.
-It's nothing much.

256
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,087
We just made some potato rice cakes.

257
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,548
We've worked since early
in the morning to make them.

258
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,383
How could you say that?

259
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,761
My back is about to break in half.

260
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,013
-Goodness.
-Are you not filming now?

261
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,556
We're taking a break.

262
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,724
-I see.
-I see.

263
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,769
Thank you so much for this.
We'll have them later.

264
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,188
Try some now.

265
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,522
-Should I? Okay.
-Yes.

266
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,691
My gosh.

267
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,902
Check out this color.

268
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,445
Here I go.

269
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,241
It's scrumptious!

270
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,288
It's so chewy.

271
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,873
Are they beans inside?

272
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:03,916
To be exact,

273
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,794
-they're kidney beans.
-I see.

274
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,921
I'm afraid they'll go bad quickly

275
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,423
-in this scorching heat.
-I'll take them indoors.

276
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,218
-Put them in front of the fan.
-Gosh. You fool.

277
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,638
-They'll harden in the fridge.
-Wait.

278
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,266
It's sweet and salty.
And the texture is just perfect.

279
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,518
JUNE, try one.

280
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:27,898
By the way, are you still on a diet?

281
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,650
No, ma'am. Thank you for this.

282
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,026
Try it.

283
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,530
It's delicious.

284
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,199
-Is it?
-It's so good.

285
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,867
-Have more.
-It's so tasty.

286
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,994
Eat more.

287
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,746
Isn't the ocean beautiful?

288
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,165
-Yes, I love it.
-That's right.

289
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,671
Isn't the neighborhood cozy and nice?

290
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,506
It's nothing special.

291
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,343
Gosh. Hye-jin, why is your dad so boring?

292
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,302
Sorry?

293
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,721
It's impossible to have
a conversation with him

294
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,974
since he's so indifferent
about everything.

295
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,101
I have no idea what's on his mind.

296
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,521
I know how tough it is to deal with people
like him. Does he sulk often?

297
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,605
Of course, I don't.

298
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,108
-He does. He sulks all day long.
-What?

299
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,818
He sulks when his egg yolk breaks,

300
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,487
-when we run out of toilet paper--
-That's not true.

301
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,738
You have it rough.

302
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,660
Then you must've frowned a lot,
but how come you don't have any wrinkles?

303
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,915
Your boyfriend is humorous.

304
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,458
What a lucky girl you are.

305
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,627
-Don't worry.
-Don't go overboard.

306
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,045
Go ahead.

307
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,172
Hello.

308
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:38,468
Gosh! It's Dr. Yoon and Chief Hong.

309
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,265
No other couple can hold a candle
to them in the neighborhood.

310
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,975
They're the best couple ever.

311
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,270
I agree.

312
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:53,025
My good friend Du-sik
looks as handsome as always.

313
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,735
I thought you had a plan.

314
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,112
-He can't act to save his life.
-You're so awkward.

315
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,117
Hello, you must be Dr. Yoon's parents.

316
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,244
-I'm Oh Yoon,
-What's up with his voice?

317
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,289
the singer who sang
"Exercising in the Moonlight."

318
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,917
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

319
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,252
I guess you don't recognize me.

320
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,545
That's fine.

321
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,007
Chief Hong and I are pretty much brothers.

322
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,511
And Dr. Yoon and I
often share thoughts on music and culture.

323
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,473
-I see.
-I've prepared a present

324
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,851
for you two. It's my autographed CD.

325
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,020
-Don't!
-Here you go.

326
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,814
And this is my poster.

327
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,444
It may not seem like much right now,

328
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,615
but it could be a remarkable gift
for your future generations.

329
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,908
-Thank you.
-No problem.

330
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,619
Hey, Du-sik.
Wow, have you been working out?

331
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,579
-You're--
-Hello,

332
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,831
sir and ma'am. I'm the zone chief here.

333
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,375
Hello.

334
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,502
Thanks to Dr. Yoon, we finally have

335
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,046
a dental clinic
and can get our teeth treated.

336
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,297
That's right.

337
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,967
She's the owner of both my place

338
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,385
and the clinic building.

339
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,511
-Goodness.
-I see.

340
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,265
I finally get to meet you.
Thank you for your help.

341
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,642
Goodness. I should be
the one thanking you.

342
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,271
You should bring them to our restaurant.
I'll prepare a nice lunch.

343
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,107
No, bring them to my restaurant. I'll--

344
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,903
Okay? Bring them to my place.

345
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,988
Sure.

346
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,781
-That way.
-Come by for some coffee.

347
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,907
That way.

348
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,867
-Goodbye.
-That's okay.

349
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,953
See you, my friend.

350
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,579
-Bye.
-Don't do that.

351
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,540
This neighborhood is a bit odd.

352
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,918
And how do they all know about me?

353
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,878
Let's hurry.

354
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,797
-Goodbye.
-This way.

355
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,341
-Goodbye, Du-sik.
-Good luck!

356
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,801
Goodness.

357
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,761
-That was awkward.
-We did well.

358
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,804
What's with the CD?

359
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,806
-I was most natural.
-Why gave it to them?

360
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,099
Because I'm a singer.

361
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,143
-You were most awkward.
-That's not true.

362
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,728
-I did well. What?
-Unbelievable.

363
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,318
Are you crazy? Tell me you are.

364
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,320
That's our precious cue sheet.

365
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,905
I wanted to see
if it'd make a good paper plane.

366
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,659
Are you kidding me?
Just go take a walk and get it together.

367
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,411
-Fine.
-I ought to smack you.

368
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,747
Gosh, you're so strong.

369
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,792
What?

370
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,627
Looking for JUNE?

371
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,547
No. We Hackers respect our stars' privacy.

372
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,632
Are you seriously not here to see DOS?

373
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,510
Is JUNE in there?

374
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,055
No, he's taking a rest somewhere else.

375
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:32,017
Darn it. I should've come earlier.
Then I would've seen him leave.

376
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,894
Darn it.

377
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,563
-Hye-jin?
-There's a harbor.

378
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,231
Why is she with Chief Hong?

379
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,358
-There's a fish market too.
-You can't go.

380
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,569
-Why not?
-Dr. Yoon's parents are here,

381
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,821
so he's acting
as her boyfriend. Awesome, right?

382
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,949
What? That can't be. Why?

383
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,285
-I don't know.
-Hye-jin!

384
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,956
Seong-hyeon. Aren't you supposed
to be filming?

385
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,874
Do you know him?

386
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,462
Hello! I'm Ji Seong-hyeon,

387
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,631
Hye-jin's senior from college.

388
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,966
I see. Hello.

389
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,094
Your name sounds familiar.

390
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,598
Goodness. Aren't you that famous director?

391
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,391
Thank you for recognizing me.

392
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,185
Wait. Do you know him?

393
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,897
Of course. He directed
all my favorite shows.

394
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,942
Really? It's nice to meet you.

395
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,945
It's an honor to meet you, Father.

396
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,196
"Father"?

397
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,157
That's wonderful to hear.

398
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,408
How formal.

399
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,536
Aren't you busy? Shouldn't you be filming?

400
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,539
-Filming?
-Sir, we're taking a break right now.

401
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,250
Would you like to come in?
I'll give you a tour.

402
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,709
No, there's no need.

403
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,586
-That's okay.
-May we?

404
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,296
Wouldn't we be a nuisance?

405
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,465
Not at all. Come on in.

406
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,092
-This way.
-Let's go.

407
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,761
I'm actually their crew's guide.

408
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,679
Seong-hyeon.

409
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,849
-Yes?
-Let me explain.

410
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,267
It's okay. I heard.

411
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,811
Don't worry. I won't put you in a pickle.

412
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,689
-Let's go.
-Okay.

413
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,652
-This is the living room.
-I see.

414
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:10,323
There's another camera here.
Gosh, how many cameras are there?

415
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:15,078
I saw how these cameras followed
your movement.

416
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,873
-Are they filming us?
-No, we turned them off.

417
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,749
-Please sit down.
-Okay.

418
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,918
Would you like some iced coffee?

419
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,503
That'll be great.

420
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,880
Coffee on an empty stomach?

421
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,716
Then how about some tea?

422
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,759
No, coffee is fine. Thank you.

423
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,846
Why did you have to say that?

424
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,307
Hye-jin, isn't it hot out there?
Come inside.

425
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,184
No, it's okay. I'll stay here.

426
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,103
Let her be. She works indoors all day.

427
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,190
She needs some sunlight and vitamin D.

428
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,483
I'm already taking supplements.

429
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,652
Why, when you can get it naturally?

430
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,279
Give your liver a break.

431
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,488
Don't worry about me.

432
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,659
-All right. Hye-jin, sit down.
-Gosh.

433
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,662
Here you go.

434
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,123
All right.

435
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,125
Here.

436
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,126
-Hye-jin.
-Thank you.

437
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,419
Cover your legs with this.

438
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,130
Thanks.

439
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,967
I brought these from Seoul. Try some.

440
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,387
Since they're vegan-friendly,
they're not sweet and easy to digest.

441
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:18,308
Don't vegans refrain from eating meat?

442
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,977
Bread doesn't have meat in it, does it?

443
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,314
Well, you see, the bread--

444
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,483
That's not what he meant.

445
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,318
There are levels to vegetarianism.

446
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:32,489
Flexitarians occasionally consume meat.

447
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,574
Pescatarians consume fish but not meat.

448
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,952
Vegans are the strictest

449
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,163
and even refrain
from consuming milk or eggs.

450
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:44,709
So simply put,
this bread doesn't contain milk or eggs.

451
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,255
Please enjoy them.
They're light and tasty.

452
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,344
Dad, let's leave
after eating this. He needs to work.

453
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,055
Right. He must be busy.

454
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,015
That's okay.

455
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,060
She just doesn't want to inconvenience me.

456
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,979
She's been like this ever since college.

457
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,399
By the way,
we met through an elective course.

458
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,900
I see.

459
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:13,029
She prepared really thoroughly
for our group project

460
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,531
and even did the presentation.

461
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:18,618
She gave an outstanding presentation.

462
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,620
-She left everyone was speechless.
-Really?

463
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,999
-Did you know she's good at arguing?
-Yes, she's a feisty one.

464
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,006
I was never like that.

465
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,050
Please tell us
what kind of student she was in college.

466
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,136
Let's see.

467
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,931
She was studious
and worked hard for the scholarship.

468
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,642
And she was a terrific dancer.

469
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,352
She was?

470
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,062
How could you tell them that?

471
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,731
I only danced once.

472
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,484
-That's enough.
-You were good at this.

473
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,488
I won first place.

474
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:04,581
Mother, please visit our TV station
next time. I'll give you a tour.

475
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,374
-Do you mean it?
-Of course.

476
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,085
We shouldn't bother you anymore.

477
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,839
If you want, I can get you tickets
to Gag Big League.

478
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,592
Really? I love that show.

479
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,974
It's so strange
how nobody ever eats the last piece.

480
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,063
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, no.

481
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,981
-Are you okay?
-I'll bring some tissue.

482
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,816
It's okay. I have some wet wipes.

483
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,778
You should've been more careful.

484
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,864
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

485
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,871
Sir.

486
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,624
Sir, we should get back to the shooting.

487
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,959
Sure. I'll be there soon.

488
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,755
Okay.

489
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,511
I'm sorry we have
to make you leave like this.

490
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,222
That's fine. Thank you for the tour.

491
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,725
I'll tell my friends to watch your show.

492
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,395
Thank you, ma'am. Have a safe trip.

493
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,397
I'll officially introduce myself
next time.

494
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,314
-Okay.
-Sure.

495
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,525
-I'll call you later.
-Bye.

496
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,866
I know you're just part-timing,
but treat them well.

497
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,577
Of course. I'm going to be true to my role

498
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,790
as Ms. Dentist's boyfriend today.

499
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:34,796
That little… God, I never pegged him
as such an annoying type, but he's so…

500
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,842
You surprised me too.

501
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,219
I was wondering where our lucky charm was,

502
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,262
and she has it.

503
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,933
Director Ji, I bought a house
with a 30-year installment plan.

504
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,813
And I need to feed my cats.

505
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,107
Let's do well.

506
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,191
Okay.

507
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,403
-I'll do my best.
-No, do well.

508
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,489
I'll do well.

509
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,709
Ms. Pyo.

510
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,711
Hey!

511
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,087
What are you doing here?

512
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,549
Me? I was just killing time here.

513
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,677
Because I don't think
I should go home right now.

514
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,471
What do you mean?

515
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:28,183
It's nothing important.
Aren't you working? Where are you headed?

516
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,643
I was just patrolling.

517
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,480
Now, I'm delivering lunch
to the elderly living alone.

518
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,149
Me. I'll help you. Let me volunteer.

519
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,610
What? There's no need for that.

520
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:42,322
It's okay.
I have nothing better to do anyway.

521
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:46,034
This is wonderful.
I'm helping those in need.

522
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,327
Can I get in?

523
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,538
What are these?

524
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,748
They're lunch boxes.

525
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,291
I see.

526
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,463
This is my first time riding a police car.

527
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,008
The seat feels different.

528
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,260
It's coated with enamel
to make it waterproof.

529
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,596
Because drunk citizens often throw up

530
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,431
or relieve themselves in the car.

531
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,099
They do what?

532
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,062
Don't worry. There was an incident
last night, but I cleaned up after them.

533
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,816
I see.

534
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,655
-Give me a minute.
-What?

535
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,549
License plate 8736,
you made an illegal U-turn.

536
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,758
Please pull over.

537
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,098
-Wait here.
-Okay.

538
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,315
He looks even more handsome when working.

539
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,316
Thank you.

540
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,695
He's driving me crazy.

541
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,407
-Sorry about that.
-No, it's fine.

542
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,451
Did you just give him a ticket?

543
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:14,038
He went over the centerline. That's
30 penalty points and a 60,000-won fine.

544
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:14,956
I see.

545
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,001
You should be penalized too.

546
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,794
Sorry?

547
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,298
You see, you invaded my heart.

548
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,969
As for the penalty, let's call it even
with the chicken you bought.

549
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,392
Let's date.

550
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,733
I think you're being rash.

551
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:44,861
Sorry?

552
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,450
You still don't know much about me.

553
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,872
I understand that people these days
easily fall for each other

554
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,332
and date casually.

555
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:01,669
I'm aware of how easy it is
for people to start dating.

556
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,464
However, I'm afraid
I'm a bit old-fashioned.

557
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,219
I hope you understand.

558
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,638
Sure.

559
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,893
Wait. I just remembered

560
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:20,772
that I have somewhere to be right now.

561
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:25,068
I promise I'll help you
deliver the lunch boxes next time.

562
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,866
This is driving me insane.

563
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,287
Rear doors of police cars
don't open from the inside.

564
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,540
I see. Darn it.

565
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,586
Okay. Thank you.

566
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,114
Hye-jin, does Seong-hyeon
have a girlfriend?

567
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,450
Seong-hyeon? Probably not.

568
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:19,789
Really? He seemed like a decent guy.

569
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,624
-I see.
-Over here.

570
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,376
It's nice and cozy.

571
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,170
It's neither too big nor too small.

572
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,088
-Right?
-Really?

573
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,466
I chose this place
and took care of the renovation myself.

574
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,759
What a show-off.

575
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,220
What? Did you say something?

576
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,765
Hye-jin, take good care of the orchids.

577
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,933
I will.

578
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,146
You're one to talk.
You've let a few die yourself.

579
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,023
What kind of orchids did you have?

580
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,233
Oriental orchids. You wouldn't know.

581
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,318
Those are noble orchids.

582
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:53,614
To make them bloom, you need to maintain
the temperature well during winter.

583
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,324
How did you do it?

584
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,369
What do you take me for?
I kept them in our living room.

585
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,998
Oh, dear. The temperature
must've been too high.

586
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:06,335
During winter, they should stay
at temperatures between 5°C or 15°C

587
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:10,631
for 60 consecutive days to bloom.

588
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,468
Is that so? I thought they'd freeze.

589
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,802
I see.

590
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:19,098
By the way, how do you know
so much about growing orchids?

591
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,017
That was my job in the military.

592
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,852
Sir.

593
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,103
Is that actually a thing?

594
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,316
Yes. I grew trees and flowers
that were used for events.

595
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,525
I see.

596
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,445
Look.

597
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,910
I'm also growing Jeju Island boat orchids.

598
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,495
Boat orchids… Let me think.

599
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,335
Boat orchids live in shaded forests.

600
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:51,047
The environment needs to be warm.
And give them enough water and fertilizer.

601
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,759
-They shouldn't receive too much sunlight.
-I see.

602
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,719
-Hello.
-Hello.

603
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,221
Do you want to go upstairs?

604
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,223
Sure. It has the best view.

605
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,808
-Okay.
-This way.

606
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,356
Does he like to play go?

607
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,565
I don't know.

608
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:13,486
He loves it. He spends
his free time looking at game records.

609
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,781
-Hey.
-Hey, Chief Hong.

610
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,950
-Hey. Who won?
-Hey.

611
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,202
It was a close match, but I won.

612
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,745
Is that so?

613
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,164
I'm sorry.

614
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,127
Don't be sorry.

615
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,922
Why are you still here?
Buy him some jjajangmyeon.

616
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,340
Fine. Let's go eat it.

617
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,050
-Well done.
-Okay.

618
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,051
Come.

619
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,929
-Order some tangsuyuk too.
-Got it.

620
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,764
I won't go easy on you next time.

621
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,099
Goodbye.

622
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,061
Care for a game?

623
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,564
Can you even play?

624
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,816
Find out for yourself.

625
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,486
-All right.
-Bring it on, then.

626
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,324
You're going to do that right now?

627
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,703
-Aren't we here to eat?
-Oh, dear.

628
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,502
All right. Let's see.

629
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,365
Here.

630
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,494
We'll order after they're done playing.

631
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:50,041
Sure. I should've just opened
a board game center instead.

632
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,545
I can't believe
I-jun knows how to play go.

633
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,589
He even does traditional painting.

634
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,345
If he were born during the Joseon Dynasty,
he would've made a name for himself.

635
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,971
I bet he'll be successful.

636
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,224
You're the successful one.

637
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,644
You must be very proud of your daughter.

638
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,271
Right. I am.

639
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,107
By the way, you look very young.

640
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,741
-I'll let you guys be.
-Okay.

641
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,543
Are you feeling unwell?

642
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:39,298
No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

643
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,467
You keep drinking water.

644
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,469
Are you parched?

645
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,596
Actually,

646
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,140
I met with a doctor.

647
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,351
Apparently, I have burning mouth syndrome.

648
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,852
I see.

649
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:57,483
Then is your mouth feeling hot?
Does it burn?

650
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,444
A bit. I'm sure it'll go away.

651
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,868
Have this.

652
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,248
Thanks.

653
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:17,128
You need to keep your mouth
hydrated at all times.

654
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:20,172
Suck on candy or chew gum often.

655
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,216
You should also drink a lot.

656
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,094
Right. I'll get you some warm water.

657
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,305
No, that's okay.

658
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,699
I think you should know that
I've always had free jjajangmyeon.

659
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,786
I was able
to feed myself with my go skills.

660
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,210
Can you take that back?

661
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,130
Come on. What do you take me for?

662
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,257
Old age has been messing with my sight.

663
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,093
Shouldn't you respect your elders?

664
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,306
I believe it's unfair
to mention your age during a match.

665
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,016
Forget it.

666
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,477
Father, are you sulking?

667
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,062
No, I'm not.

668
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,397
And why do you address me that way?

669
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,317
Then what else should I call you?

670
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,155
Fine. I'll take it back.

671
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,866
-But just this once.
-Forget it.

672
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,495
Here. I took it back. It's your turn now.

673
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,830
It's your turn. I took it back.

674
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:44,548
Oh, dear. So that was your plan.

675
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,675
In that case…

676
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:58,938
Yeong-guk.

677
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,357
Cho-hui.

678
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,862
I just came by to see
how you were doing. I wanted…

679
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,280
Take this.

680
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,950
Vitamin C is good for your health.

681
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,701
You didn't have to do this.

682
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,623
I don't think I can invite you in,

683
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,418
so can we talk outside?

684
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,462
Just the two of us?

685
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,592
-I'd love that.
-Okay.

686
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,811
I'm bored out of my mind.

687
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:45,734
How could you say that
when I even grilled that fish for you?

688
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,278
You see,

689
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:52,032
snacks taste the best
when you're gossiping.

690
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,535
Anything interesting to talk about?

691
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,662
You need to fix that bad habit of yours.

692
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:01,625
Now, that's interesting.
It's Mr. Chang and Ms. Yu.

693
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,379
Look at that.
This is going to be interesting.

694
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,673
-Hey, you're here.
-Sit down.

695
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,180
Don't do that!

696
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,394
What would you like…

697
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,938
All right. Got it.

698
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,868
All right.

699
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,497
-Are you guys done?
-Yes.

700
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,373
So who won?

701
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,462
Do you want some food?

702
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:51,050
Sure. Please prepare a feast for us.
I'm counting on you.

703
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,719
Okay. I'll prepare a lavish meal for you.

704
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,763
Thanks. Is there anything you want…

705
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,893
Come on. It's not my fault you lost.
Will you keep sulking like that?

706
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,229
Wait up, Father. Gosh.

707
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,563
Wait for me.

708
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,440
NAM-SUK

709
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,569
-The person you have called…
-Why isn't she picking up?

710
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,113
I can't hear them
since they're too far away.

711
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,491
You see, Cho-hui.

712
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,078
There's something I want to tell you.

713
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,788
Listen carefully.

714
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:32,466
"To the love of my life.

715
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:39,056
I will never forget you
until my very last breath.

716
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,018
I know my chance will never come."

717
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,272
-Can you hear them?
-He's reciting a poem.

718
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,482
He's reciting a poem? That lunatic…

719
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:53,988
"Please stay beautiful as you are."

720
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,909
That's a poem by Yi Sang.

721
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:05,291
Gosh, Cho-hui. You and I click so well.

722
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,042
I think we're soulmates.

723
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,504
The reason

724
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,091
I recited his poem

725
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,304
is that I still like--

726
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,346
Yeong-guk.

727
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,181
Yes?

728
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,561
He's confessing his love,
but I can't hear that well.

729
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,979
Me neither!

730
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,689
You've been so good to me

731
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,984
ever since we first met.

732
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,819
I'm always grateful for that.

733
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,948
-Don't mention it.
-However…

734
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,328
I've never had any romantic feelings

735
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,496
for you.

736
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:59,219
I hope we can continue being good friends.

737
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,267
Is this because of Hwa-jeong?

738
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,062
What?

739
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,773
You're turning me down

740
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,026
and drawing the line

741
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,986
because of her, aren't you?

742
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,448
That's not true.
This has nothing to do with her.

743
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,664
I should get going.

744
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,472
Gosh, she has prepared

745
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,307
all kinds of seafood for us.

746
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,559
Father, try this.

747
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,854
These sea squirts are known
for their scrumptious aftertaste.

748
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,272
No, thanks.

749
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,608
Honey, are you upset you lost the game?

750
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,361
Gosh, you're too competitive.

751
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:01,281
What? Ms. Dentist is the same.
She's also impossibly stubborn.

752
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,616
You take after him.

753
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:03,784
I'm not like him.

754
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,954
Of course, she does.
Like father, like daughter.

755
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,833
Gosh. I've noticed this
from the beginning,

756
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,626
but you guys aren't close at all.

757
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,839
What does it matter when you're family?

758
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,341
It does matter. It's still a relationship.

759
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,344
Mother, this won't do.
There's this ice breaker game

760
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,471
called Two Truths and One Lie.

761
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,432
They should play that.

762
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,892
-Cut that nonsense.
-They should--

763
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,771
When it's awkward like this,
it's best to just eat.

764
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,607
Father, try some of this.

765
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,110
Here. Open up.

766
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,946
I don't eat anything slimy.

767
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,074
He doesn't eat seafood.

768
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,953
Goodness. You're all about the sauce
when having raw fish, aren't you?

769
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,414
Just trust me and have a bite.

770
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,125
I promise you that
you'll appreciate the taste of seafood.

771
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,252
Why should I trust you?

772
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:56,795
Because

773
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,215
we played go together.

774
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:07,097
My grandfather used to say,
"Playing go brings good friends.

775
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:12,978
Being able to play the game together
means you're already good friends."

776
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,191
What? Does that mean you two are friends?

777
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,358
Don't be ridiculous.

778
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,236
All right, open up. Come on.

779
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,113
Open up.

780
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,364
Good.

781
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,993
Chew well. It'll taste salty at first,

782
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:31,121
but then you'll get a hint of sourness.

783
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,665
It seems like you like it.

784
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,918
How is it? Doesn't it taste fresh?

785
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,878
Well, it's not bad.

786
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,549
Okay. You've mastered
sea squirts now. Next up are spoon worms.

787
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,343
That's too disgusting to eat.

788
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,011
I know, but the texture--

789
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,262
-No way.
-Come on.

790
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,056
-I don't want to.
-Try it. Come on.

791
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,058
-I don't want to.
-Try it.

792
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,434
-Never!
-Give it a go!

793
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,145
-Come on!
-Try it. It's tasty.

794
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,522
No, I don't want to.

795
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,606
-Please.
-It's strange.

796
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,400
-Try the spoon worm.
-This is their first time meeting.

797
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,529
-If she cans, so can you.
-So how does he seem

798
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,031
to blend in so well?

799
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,116
-How is it?
-How does he make us

800
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,244
-It's not bad.
-feel so comfortable?

801
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,411
Now, the spoon worms.

802
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,163
How does he warm our hearts like so?

803
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,249
-I really can't eat that.
-The texture is--

804
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,959
No. It disgusts me.

805
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,335
I don't like raw food.

806
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,382
Gosh, I can't believe
you finished two bowls.

807
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,926
This is surprising
for someone who eats like a bird.

808
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,513
It's because I'm eating
with my entire family.

809
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,015
The best meal is one
that you have with your family.

810
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,183
You're right.

811
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:39,439
By the way,
it seems that this is your hometown.

812
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,733
Does that mean you live with your parents?

813
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,612
No, sir. They both passed away
when I was little.

814
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,240
-Is that so?
-Yes.

815
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,158
Then do you have other family members?

816
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,828
Dad, that's a private matter.

817
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,413
It's okay.

818
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,706
My grandfather passed away

819
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,457
when I was in middle school.

820
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,417
Now, it's just me.

821
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:03,005
Goodness. You must've been lonely.

822
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,676
The people here have treated me
like family and taken great care of me.

823
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,178
Shall we go?

824
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,930
-How about some coffee?
-Sure.

825
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,432
That sounds good.

826
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,516
That's okay.

827
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:19,146
Why not?
Let's have some coffee before we go.

828
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,481
We should go now
if we want to avoid traffic.

829
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,525
You're right. It's the weekend.

830
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,236
Then I'll get some coffee to go.

831
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,864
-You can drink it on your way--
-No, thanks.

832
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,657
There's no need for that.

833
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,911
Dad.

834
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,583
Let me go to the bathroom.

835
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,876
Okay.

836
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:53,764
Dad, what is the matter?

837
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,307
Were you aware

838
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,686
that he was an orphan?

839
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,440
"Orphan"? How could you say that?

840
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,694
He had a family as well.
He just lost them when he was little.

841
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,073
-It's not a sin to have no parents.
-It is.

842
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,283
What?

843
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,577
I have nothing personal against him,

844
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,664
-but you shouldn't be seeing him.
-Dad.

845
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,291
No parent in this world
would be supportive

846
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,877
of their child dating an orphan!

847
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,878
Honey!

848
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:27,464
Break up before it gets any deeper.

849
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,758
You haven't been dating for long.

850
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,429
I don't want someone with a flaw like that
to be my family.

851
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:41,353
In that case, I have a flaw as well.

852
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,562
What?

853
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,773
I also lost my mom when I was little.

854
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,317
On top of that, I have a stepmom.

855
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,485
Yoon Hye-jin!

856
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,112
I have a flaw too.

857
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,447
So why do you think
he's the only one with a flaw?

858
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,070
Damn it.

859
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,239
You even smoke?

860
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,659
You do everything that's unhealthy.

861
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,579
Even Hye-jin never nags at me.

862
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,004
I'm sorry.

863
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,882
With or without you present,

864
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,594
I shouldn't have said what I said.

865
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,014
She sure does take after you.

866
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:04,352
She also admits to her mistakes quickly.

867
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,402
This may sound like an excuse,

868
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,031
but she was also lonely growing up.

869
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,993
After her mother died,

870
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,538
I relied on alcohol for a long time.

871
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,086
I was a neglectful father.

872
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,588
JIHYE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

873
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,174
Never once did I pack her backpack.

874
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,803
Thanks to my negligence,

875
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,389
she grew up too fast.

876
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,018
I'm going to school.

877
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,105
I'll carry that guilt with me forever.

878
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,945
It's not that I don't like you.

879
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:59,241
And I know it's selfish of me to expect
someone else to do what I couldn't.

880
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:04,162
But I hope she marries into a big family

881
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,915
so that she never gets lonely again.

882
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,710
Finally receiving the love she couldn't.

883
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,341
You got it all wrong.

884
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:17,801
Hye-jin…

885
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,263
received tons of love growing up.

886
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,810
If not, she wouldn't be able

887
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,146
to give others so much love.

888
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,989
The weather's so nice.

889
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,080
I apologize for what I said earlier.

890
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,833
It was wrong of me.

891
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:54,838
That's okay.
Your dad crossed the line first.

892
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:01,887
Hye-jin.

893
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,556
That's just how parents feel.

894
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:09,311
To be frank,
what he said was downright unfair.

895
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:14,065
But you see, it's hard
to be objective about your own child.

896
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,527
It's easy to spot other people's flaws,

897
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,362
but not your own child's.

898
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,824
You just want to turn a blind eye to it.

899
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,871
I promise to tell him off big time,

900
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,915
so don't resent him too much.

901
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:34,753
That'd be too harsh of a punishment
for someone who dotes on you.

902
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:37,923
He does?

903
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,635
We visited a dozen flower shops

904
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:45,013
before finally buying those orchids.

905
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,523
I'm looking for something
meaningful and rare.

906
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:59,069
Something that brings
success, good health,

907
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,112
and luck.

908
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,950
The wallpaper on his phone
is you as a little girl.

909
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:12,457
I heard it's pouring in Gangwon Province.

910
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,293
I'm worried about Hye-jin.

911
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,338
Give her a call if you're worried.

912
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,593
I heard there will be a typhoon too.

913
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,851
He doesn't care
about the weather back home,

914
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,522
but he always knows
how the weather is down here.

915
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,565
That's not all.

916
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,484
He's quiet at home.

917
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,487
But he becomes chatty
and boasts about you when he goes out.

918
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,032
Soon, he's going to have no friends left.

919
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:51,871
Hye-jin.

920
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:57,919
At times, you guys may bicker
because you don't always see eye to eye,

921
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:02,298
but he always has
nothing but love for you.

922
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,688
Do you like her a lot?

923
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:21,943
Yes.

924
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,364
But…

925
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,576
I like her as a friend.

926
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,872
What do you mean?

927
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,917
We're actually just friends.

928
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,297
I had no choice but to lie
since there was a misunderstanding.

929
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,009
Nothing you might worry about happened.

930
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,680
-I'm sorry.
-So you're telling me

931
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,476
that you're not my daughter's boyfriend?

932
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,393
Yes.

933
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,271
But I meant what I said.

934
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,441
She's a warmhearted person.

935
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,401
So I…

936
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,281
truly hope that she'll find
someone good that she deserves.

937
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,868
And that…

938
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,830
could be you.

939
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:30,887
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

940
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,102
Oh, you came out.

941
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,981
Let's go eat something.

942
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,360
We just did.

943
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,820
Right.

944
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,739
Then how about some coffee?

945
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,742
I prefer tea.

946
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,745
We seriously don't get along.

947
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,666
What an awkward relationship they have.

948
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,001
Really? I think it's nice.

949
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:04,879
Wait up.

950
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,845
Let me take you
to a place that serves good tea.

951
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,265
But to be frank, I make the best tea.

952
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,851
All right.

953
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,896
Gosh.

954
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,400
Okay.

955
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,484
All right.

956
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:28,820
Okay.

957
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,573
I can't be late again.

958
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,745
Aren't you tutoring today?

959
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:38,830
Yes.

960
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:42,459
They're brother and sister,
and they never listen to me.

961
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,669
Really? Call me if you need help.

962
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,212
I'm good with kids.

963
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,590
I once aspired
to become a preschool teacher.

964
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,091
Don't lie.

965
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,968
I'm serious.

966
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,928
-Really?
-Yes.

967
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:57,056
Okay. I'm going to the restroom.

968
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:57,974
Sure.

969
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,899
ROMAGNA

970
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,196
"I have a free ticket.

971
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,448
Would you like…

972
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,911
I heard this musical is fun.

973
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,288
Let's watch it together
if you have time, Hye-jin.

974
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,623
They sing like this."

975
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,089
Hye-jin.

976
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,467
-Gang-uk.
-What are you doing here?

977
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,053
I'm having coffee with my friend.

978
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,054
Hey, Seong-hyeon.

979
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,514
Hey, Gang-uk.

980
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,932
What a small world.

981
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,476
I was going to introduce her
to you next time we met.

982
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,603
Say hi. This is
my girlfriend, Yoon Hye-jin.

983
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,773
Wait. Do you two know each other?

984
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,816
Oh, I see.

985
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,277
He's my high school friend.
Didn't I tell you?

986
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,362
I see.

987
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,490
No way. This is crazy.

988
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:58,368
-This is amazing.
-You're right.

989
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,496
Gosh. You guys look good together.

990
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,373
I can't believe this.

991
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,339
Here.

992
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,216
-Done?
-Yes.

993
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:14,884
Gosh.

994
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,180
-Here you go.
-Goodness.

995
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,230
-It doesn't fit.
-Should we make it again?

996
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,482
-No, it's too late.
-It's not too late!

997
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,451
I'm just saying that it's not too late

998
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,121
even though you think it is…

999
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,081
What are you doing? Make it again.

1000
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:46,624
Don't look at me.

1001
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,544
-Don't.
-What's wrong with you?

1002
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,132
A dog is barking.

1003
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,804
We had a blast today thanks to you.

1004
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,724
It was my pleasure.
I also had fun thanks to you.

1005
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:07,020
About that coffee stain,
rub it with some baking soda,

1006
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,439
detergent mixed with vinegar,

1007
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,316
or carbonated water.

1008
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,818
You'd make a better housewife than me.

1009
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,029
What do you not know?

1010
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,448
Dad, drive safely.

1011
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,365
All right.

1012
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,119
Father, pull over if you get drowsy.

1013
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,370
It can be dangerous.

1014
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,956
You. Can you come over here?

1015
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,416
Me?

1016
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,794
Goodness. I wonder
what he wants to tell me.

1017
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,967
-Closer.
-What is it?

1018
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,804
Wait. I get ticklish
when someone whispers in my ear.

1019
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,306
Fine.

1020
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,021
Why do you talk casually to me?

1021
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:53,316
Oh, that? It's sort of
a philosophy of mine.

1022
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,612
Simply put, it sounds
more friendly that way.

1023
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,325
Not to me, you bastard.

1024
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,579
-We'll get going then.
-Okay. Drive safely.

1025
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,081
-Bye.
-Bye.

1026
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,340
-What did he say?
-Pardon?

1027
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,550
-"Pardon"?
-Pardon? I…

1028
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,011
What did…

1029
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,849
What did he say to you?

1030
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,149
You like him, don't you?

1031
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:36,567
What?

1032
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,490
How about we get some snacks
at a rest area if the traffic gets heavy?

1033
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,867
I know you have a sweet tooth.

1034
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,453
It's okay. I already have a snack.

1035
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,247
What?

1036
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,763
Why did you follow me
all the way here? You're being a nuisance.

1037
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:09,308
Well, you see,
I tend to be the curious type.

1038
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,102
You're not answering my question.

1039
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:16,566
I've always been curious.

1040
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,818
Is this your boat?

1041
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:19,819
Yes.

1042
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,572
Why did you bring it up here?

1043
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:27,493
I mean, how did you even bring it here?

1044
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,496
I looked for a helicopter
and even rented a truck.

1045
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,373
It was quite difficult.

1046
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,250
But in the end, I succeeded.

1047
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,961
So why did you do such a thing?

1048
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,588
Boats belong in the ocean.

1049
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,798
I wanted it to appreciate a different view

1050
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,217
since it had been sailing all its life.

1051
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,345
To tell you the truth,
this was my grandfather's.

1052
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,474
I see.

1053
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,061
You're definitely not normal.

1054
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,316
You wasted money and time
for such a sentimental reason?

1055
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,986
I was expecting to hear
some grand explanation.

1056
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,702
Why do you live here like this?

1057
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,121
Are you picking a fight with me?

1058
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,165
No, I'm asking out of pure curiosity.

1059
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:18,711
What did you do
after graduating from college?

1060
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,714
I mean, during those five years.

1061
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:29,722
Fine. The past is in the past.
What's important is the present.

1062
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,727
You're just taking a break now, right?

1063
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,021
I get it.

1064
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:40,566
You get tired.
You can't run a marathon forever.

1065
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,068
You came down here

1066
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,570
to refresh yourself
and plan for your future.

1067
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,697
This is temporary, right?

1068
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,700
You're wrong.
I'm going to live like this forever.

1069
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,121
I'm content with this life.

1070
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:56,415
You must be kidding me.

1071
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,710
That's a total waste of resources.

1072
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:03,339
It's like playing Minesweeper
on a high-tech computer.

1073
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:06,676
You're driving a sports car
across the rice paddies

1074
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,511
instead of the highway.

1075
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,765
Don't look down on the beauty
of simplicity Minesweeper has to offer.

1076
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,726
And rice paddies look magnificent
on a summer night.

1077
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,894
You have no idea.

1078
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:19,897
Right.

1079
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,984
I was crazy to think I could actually
have a conversation with you.

1080
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:26,195
Do you want a flower in your hair
to look like a pretty lunatic?

1081
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,030
No, thanks.

1082
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,036
It's going to be a long walk.

1083
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,455
Goodbye, then.

1084
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,013
Darn it.

1085
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:56,475
I'm mortified that I had
some kind of hope even for a moment.

1086
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:03,816
Mi-seon, why did you call Chief Hong over…

1087
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:09,614
Why are you crying?

1088
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,492
I asked Eun-cheol out,

1089
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,328
but he said no.

1090
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,380
Don't cry.

1091
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,113
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

1092
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,959
Take the call. I'll take it from here.

1093
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,210
I'm sorry.

1094
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,883
Mom, I'm working.

1095
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:16,138
What? Is it serious?

1096
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,475
Where did you hurt yourself?

1097
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:22,687
She put her hand down as she fell.

1098
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,480
Yes, it's a compound fracture.

1099
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,359
Would she be able to have surgery
as soon as possible?

1100
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,612
Okay. Thanks.

1101
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:32,822
Thank you.

1102
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,284
Fortunately, my friend had
some time today,

1103
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,911
so I scheduled the surgery.

1104
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:42,039
Don't worry. The surgery will go well.

1105
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:43,874
Thanks.

1106
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,502
Let's go to Seoul right now.

1107
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,170
You're coming?

1108
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:51,298
Of course. We should cancel
our afternoon appointments.

1109
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,718
But Ms. Lee Jeong-yeon
is coming by in the evening

1110
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,970
because her makeshift tooth fell out.

1111
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,638
She needs to get that treated.

1112
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:00,641
You should stay here. I'll go by myself.

1113
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,444
Just go straight to Seoul in this.

1114
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:14,405
My dad and Hyeon-seon already arrived.

1115
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:17,241
I can just take the bus
at the terminal. I should get going.

1116
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:18,909
Call me as soon as you get there.

1117
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,077
-Okay.
-All right.

1118
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,417
Oh, my goodness.

1119
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,627
What are you doing here?

1120
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,796
Is she going somewhere?

1121
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:32,548
Well…

1122
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:46,771
Ms. Pyo!

1123
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:48,689
Officer Choi.

1124
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,483
Get in. I'll drive you to Seoul.

1125
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:51,817
What?

1126
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,027
Come on.

1127
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,407
Thank you. How did you know?

1128
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,791
You're going back to Seoul today?

1129
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,877
Yes. I'm coming back next week.

1130
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,089
Try to focus more on the subtitles.

1131
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,133
Your show tends to lack in that area

1132
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,760
compared to the other shows.

1133
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:20,805
Thanks for the advice.

1134
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:21,931
My pleasure.

1135
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:27,978
Did Hye-jin's parents go home safely?

1136
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,480
I think so.

1137
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,776
Look, I'm just asking out of curiosity.

1138
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,195
You're done with that job, right?

1139
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,827
Yes. I worked 7 hours and made 61,040 won.

1140
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,245
It was a great success.

1141
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:48,582
Really? Then why does it seem
the job is still ongoing?

1142
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,544
Then maybe it is.

1143
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,755
Have a safe trip.

1144
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,009
Gosh.

1145
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,851
I came out for a quiet walk.
Why are you tagging along?

1146
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,519
What are you, a leech?

1147
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:11,105
Hey, I'm also just trying to exercise.

1148
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:14,608
It's not easy
to maintain this figure, you know?

1149
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,696
Oh, my. Isn't that Yeong-guk?

1150
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:19,613
Yeong-guk!

1151
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,408
You. Take a detour.

1152
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:23,909
Why?

1153
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:34,461
Why are you drinking here alone
when you can't even hold your liquor?

1154
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,255
I've only had one sip so far.

1155
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:38,215
Two sips, and you'll die.

1156
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,593
Just go home and sleep.

1157
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,261
It's all your fault.

1158
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:48,225
Cho-hui turned me down because of you.

1159
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,479
I'm sorry you failed to win
your first love's heart once again.

1160
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:56,901
But don't you think
it's so unfair to blame that on me?

1161
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:01,697
That's rich coming from you.

1162
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,658
Did you forget
what you did three years ago?

1163
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:12,166
You wanted a divorce just because
I took off my socks inside out.

1164
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,753
I promised that
I wouldn't do that ever again.

1165
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:21,592
I begged and asked you for forgiveness,
but you kicked me out that day.

1166
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:25,638
I was downright dumbfounded.

1167
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,099
But I accepted it. Do you know why?

1168
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:33,938
Because you said
you couldn't live with me anymore.

1169
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:40,819
I did everything you wanted.

1170
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:44,448
So why do you keep getting in my way?

1171
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:49,370
You'll never know why I wanted a divorce.

1172
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:52,831
Fine. Let's keep it that way forever.

1173
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,084
Just live your life.

1174
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,837
Hey, Hwa-jeong.

1175
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:02,049
What did you mean by that?

1176
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:04,885
Why are you insinuating
that there was another reason?

1177
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:10,266
You can't just leave like this.
Do you want me to suffer forever?

1178
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:11,433
-Hey!
-Gosh.

1179
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:15,437
What are you doing?
You can't grab her like that.

1180
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,647
You're a civil servant.

1181
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:19,441
She may be your ex-wife,
but you have no right to do that.

1182
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,528
I only grabbed her
because I wanted to talk.

1183
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,947
Besides, I've always had a weak grip,

1184
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,658
so she's beaten me
in arm-wrestling every single time.

1185
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:30,661
-Right?
-Yes. He's weak as a kitten.

1186
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,292
Don't forget that I have eyes everywhere.

1187
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:37,960
I know.

1188
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:41,964
And why did you have to mention
Cho-hui to her? You're pathetic.

1189
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:43,257
Hwa-jeong!

1190
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:46,218
Gosh.

1191
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,761
Wait up.

1192
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,266
I'll pretend I didn't see that.

1193
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:53,892
As if.

1194
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:55,644
Right?

1195
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,188
I can't promise you that.

1196
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,025
It's better to talk about it, you know?

1197
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:04,653
If you keep bottling up your emotions,

1198
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,196
you'll get sick.

1199
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,574
Talking is like pooping.

1200
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,869
You need to relieve yourself
regularly to stay healthy.

1201
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,457
You're unhealthy right now.

1202
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:57,956
Hey, Seong-hyeon.

1203
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,833
Hey, where are you?

1204
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,752
I got off work.

1205
01:13:01,835 --> 01:13:03,212
I'm on my way home.

1206
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:06,882
I see. I'm on my way to Seoul.

1207
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:10,719
I had to leave right away,
so I couldn't even say bye to you.

1208
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:14,348
That's fine. You were busy. I understand.

1209
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,266
You're coming back anyway.

1210
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,810
Right.

1211
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:21,980
Hye-jin.

1212
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,273
Yes?

1213
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:27,236
When I go back down to Gongjin,
can you meet up with me?

1214
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:28,612
Meet up?

1215
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:30,656
Of course, I can.

1216
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:33,659
I really hope you can.

1217
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:36,662
I have something to tell you.

1218
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:37,996
What?

1219
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,881
They fixed the streetlamp.

1220
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:53,178
It's finally working.

1221
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:58,684
Are you happy

1222
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:02,396
that you could fix it today?

1223
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,857
Yes. I feel great.

1224
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,234
You put off such a simple task.

1225
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:10,696
An IT powerhouse
should always keep the people safe.

1226
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:11,780
I'll get going.

1227
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:14,491
Where are you going?
I have a ton of complaints.

1228
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:17,161
Listen carefully. Number one.

1229
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,955
How could there be
no Wi-Fi at the community center?

1230
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,458
The elderly enjoy watching videos online.

1231
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,835
Number two. The garbage bags…

1232
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:29,047
Hye-jin, are you there?

1233
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,340
Yes, I am.

1234
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,428
Let me know when you're back.

1235
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:36,221
I'll treat you to a meal.

1236
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,140
Okay. I'll see you soon.

1237
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:41,351
Okay. Drive safely.

1238
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,269
I will.

1239
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:00,078
No. I can't be late again.

1240
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:42,579
She's a warmhearted person.

1241
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:44,456
So I…

1242
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:49,169
truly hope that she'll find
someone good that she deserves.

1243
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,882
And that could be you.

1244
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:29,376
MEDICAL CHART

1245
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:33,213
It seems you're sleeping better now.

1246
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:37,634
At this rate,
I think we can lower the dosage.

1247
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,387
Okay.

1248
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:41,638
Great.

1249
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,141
Today,

1250
01:16:44,224 --> 01:16:48,770
we're going to get
to the root of your fear.

1251
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,149
Do you still feel that…

1252
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,278
those around you…

1253
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:03,076
Goodness. What an unfortunate boy.

1254
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,371
As if losing his parents early wasn't
enough, he lost his grandpa too.

1255
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,165
Goodness.

1256
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:13,128
I guess it's true that some people
bring death to those around them.

1257
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,979
So everyone you loved

1258
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:35,984
has left you?

1259
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:38,820
Yes.

1260
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:41,406
And I'm to blame.

1261
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,167
It's because of me.

1262
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:37,796
Gosh, I was so scared.

1263
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,465
Chief Hong.

1264
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,677
-Would you like to say hello?
-Hello.

1265
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,555
I'm Yoon Hye-jin.

1266
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:47,806
Gosh.

1267
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:51,685
You keep talking about Gongjin
as if all roads lead there.

1268
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:55,313
Du-sik, life may seem long,

1269
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,357
but it really isn't.

1270
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,317
Chief Hong.

1271
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:02,904
I've been regretting
not telling you how I felt 14 years ago.

1272
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,782
The conclusion I came to is this.

1273
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:08,368
I like you.

1274
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:14,875
