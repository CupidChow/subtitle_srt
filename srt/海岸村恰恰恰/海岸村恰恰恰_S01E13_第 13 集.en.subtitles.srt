1
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,182
It's almost done.

2
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,350
EPISODE 13

3
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,188
Oh, my goodness.

4
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:08,777
This is all seaweed? It's way too much.

5
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,030
Hey, why does seaweed expand so much?

6
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,076
I had no idea
one small package would become this much.

7
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,994
If you crave seaweed soup,

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,163
you should just buy cooked one.

9
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,166
A terrible cook like you
shouldn't attempt anything.

10
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,542
I agree.

11
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,171
But it's Chief Hong's birthday today.

12
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,466
Since it's our first time
celebrating it together,

13
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,551
I should cook for him.

14
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,180
-Do you want to try some?
-No.

15
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,182
It must be really delicious.

16
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,683
No, thanks.

17
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,061
-I bet it's good.
-No.

18
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,813
-I followed the recipe.
-No, thanks.

19
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,147
Come on.

20
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,316
I'm sure you'll love it. Try some.

21
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,193
-No, thanks.
-It's tasty.

22
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,654
I don't want it. No!

23
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,617
Chief Hong.

24
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,704
Chief Hong.

25
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,705
Goodness.

26
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,207
Hey, you're here.

27
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,708
-Come in.
-Hello, Dr. Yoon.

28
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,085
-Hey.
-Hey.

29
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,962
-Dr. Yoon.
-Come in.

30
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:12,507
-That spot is the coolest.
-Sit down.

31
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,758
I'm working on it.

32
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,135
Sit there.

33
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,219
Okay.

34
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,894
What's going on? They're all here?

35
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,729
This is a yearly thing.

36
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,899
I tell them not to,
but they still do this every year.

37
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,900
Gosh.

38
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,028
Suk-ja, bring lots of japchae.

39
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,447
Okay. I should bring more.

40
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,407
This is good.

41
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,285
I'm going to serve the seaweed soup now.

42
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,579
-How many bowls?
-Hold on.

43
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,747
Two, four, sixâ€¦ Thirteen bowls.

44
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,958
Nam-suk, you forgot to count yourself.

45
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,502
Fourteen including me.

46
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,045
Where's Yeong-guk, by the way?

47
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,589
Who knows? He hung up on me.

48
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,299
Gosh, he's cold.

49
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,051
-Happy birthday
-You have horrible pronunciation.

50
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,637
-I pretty much sound like a native.
-That's absurd.

51
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,140
What? You guys are here already?

52
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,474
Seriously?

53
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,186
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

54
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,648
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

55
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,193
-Happy birthday, dear Chief Hong
-Happy birthday, dear Chief Hong

56
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,698
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

57
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,829
I told you this wasn't necessary.
You're embarrassing me.

58
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,707
This only happens once a year.
We must celebrate it.

59
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,584
-Right.
-Hey, blow them out.

60
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,336
-Okay.
-Blow out the candles.

61
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,798
Thank you, guys.

62
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,759
You should also cut the cake.

63
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,218
-Right. Here's the knife.
-Hey.

64
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,512
-Do it with her.
-Me?

65
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,140
-Come here.
-Hurry up, Dr. Yoon.

66
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,979
-All right.
-Gam-ri, they look great together.

67
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,316
-Right?
-I agree. Seeing them side by side

68
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,277
makes this seem like
an engagement ceremony.

69
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,404
Gosh, don't exaggerate like that.

70
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,366
We also did that for our wedding.

71
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,493
Do you remember our three-tier cake?

72
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,746
What? This is good.

73
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,248
He's so useless.

74
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,457
You idiot.

75
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,417
Go ahead and cut the cake.

76
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,837
-Go on.
-Congratulations.

77
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,089
Thanks.

78
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,799
Thanks, everyone.

79
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,344
Thank you.

80
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,684
What's that in your hand?

81
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,145
Oh, this? I made this seaweed soup myself.

82
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,231
But you already had some.

83
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,816
You made it yourself?

84
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,858
Yes.

85
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,902
Let me see it. Let's see.

86
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,239
-What for?
-I can have another bowl.

87
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,865
Seaweed is good for you.

88
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,035
-Let me have a taste.
-No, you don't have to.

89
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,245
No, I want to.

90
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,289
All right.

91
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,419
Gosh, it looks delicious.

92
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,801
How is it? Is it good?

93
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,760
I like it.

94
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,099
It's tasty.

95
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,686
It's so salty.

96
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,813
So salty.

97
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,607
It even smells salty.

98
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,736
No one deserves to eat that.

99
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,364
Are you serious?

100
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,449
Yes, it's tasty.

101
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,619
See? I can cook if I want to.

102
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,496
Let me try it too.

103
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,290
No, this is all mine.

104
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,960
-Share some with me--
-No, I'll have it all.

105
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,795
Is it really that good?

106
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,756
This is mine. You made it for me.

107
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,300
-Let me have a sip.
-No, it's mine.

108
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,677
I made it, so I should have a sip too.

109
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,387
-It's for me, though.
-I made it.

110
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,306
-You can't take it back.
-Give it to me.

111
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,807
-Why?
-I want a sip.

112
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,102
No, you can't.
It's my birthday gift, so it's all mine.

113
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,063
But I made it.

114
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,273
-So? It's too tasty to share.
-How greedy!

115
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,524
All right.

116
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,987
Gosh. How about
some watermelon for dessert?

117
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,280
Sounds great.

118
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,533
All right. How should I cut this?

119
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,452
-It looks so tasty.
-Wait a minute.

120
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,830
I forgot I had something urgent.

121
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,999
I'm afraid I should head back now.

122
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,667
-But the watermelon--
-I see.

123
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,086
What, Ju-ri?

124
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,879
-You left that thing?
-No.

125
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,506
-The--
-You know, that thing.

126
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,757
-What?
-The DOS goods.

127
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,300
-What? No--
-Why would you

128
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,469
-say that now?
-I'll buy you one.

129
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,346
I should head back home too.

130
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,599
-You too?
-I'm too sleepy to be here.

131
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,520
-Goodness gracious, my butt.
-Oh, dear.

132
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,022
My butt hurts too much.

133
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,649
-Gosh, my legs.
-Bye, Chief Hong.

134
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,942
Bye, Ms. Suk-ja.

135
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,151
I should head back too.

136
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,529
-You too?
-I should check I-jun's homework.

137
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,115
-Goodbye, then.
-We should go too.

138
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,367
-Goodbye.
-Bo-ra, wake up. Let's go.

139
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,536
-Get up, now.
-Why is everyone leaving?

140
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,329
We haven't even started drinking yet.

141
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,415
We should have a taste of that.
I bet it's expensive.

142
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,084
Take the hint, will you?

143
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,002
Right. I see.

144
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,630
Let's go, Bo-ra.

145
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,215
She's so sleepy.

146
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,342
-Bye.
-Bye.

147
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,136
-Goodbye.
-Hurry up.

148
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,179
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

149
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,931
-Goodbye!
-Bye!

150
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:12,849
Bye!

151
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,227
They're giving us privacy, aren't they?

152
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,647
They're terrible actors.

153
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,941
They all can't act to save their lives.

154
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,651
Tell me about it. Horrible.

155
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,694
Horrible?

156
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,491
-Geum-cheol.
-Yes?

157
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,577
Can you walk a bit slowly?

158
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,996
We should hurry home and rest.

159
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,958
This baby is weighing me down.

160
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,669
Can't you see that I'm carrying Bo-ra?
I'm exhausted too.

161
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,213
-Geum-cheol.
-Yes?

162
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,717
How about we ask Ms. Yeo
to take care of Bo-ra this weekend

163
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,968
and go on a date?

164
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,344
-A date?
-Yes.

165
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,556
Things will get
even more hectic once the baby is born.

166
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,309
We won't have much alone time.

167
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,479
How can we go anywhere
when you can barely walk?

168
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,523
Just rest at home
since our baby is due soon.

169
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,025
-Okay?
-Okay.

170
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:04,984
Good.

171
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,455
We finally have our alone time.

172
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,000
Chief Hong, happy birthday.

173
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,714
Thanks.

174
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,469
Should we drink this?

175
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,929
-I'll get the glasses.
-Okay.

176
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,849
I can't wait.

177
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,607
What is this? It looks new.

178
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,943
I made that for you.

179
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,486
For me?

180
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,157
But it is your birthday, not mine.

181
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,118
Don't get ahead of yourself.
You need to wait a year.

182
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,745
That long?

183
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,373
The alcohol will become sweeter with time.

184
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,084
Let's see.

185
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,588
-What are you doing?
-I want toâ€¦

186
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,593
make it clear that it's mine.

187
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,678
YOON HYE-JIN

188
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,888
You definitely have a strong ego.

189
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,557
I won't deny it.

190
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,726
Will we be able to drink that

191
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,437
-on your next birthday?
-Yes.

192
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,321
Summer, fall, winterâ€¦

193
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,699
Then it'll be spring and summer again.

194
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,160
What will have happened

195
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,663
a year from now?

196
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,332
Of courseâ€¦

197
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,588
It'll have become sweet.

198
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,048
I'll open this.

199
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,551
Yes, I'm sure it will.

200
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,179
Right.

201
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,230
-Hello.
-Hello.

202
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,233
Hello. But what brings you here?

203
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,654
Since it's so hot today,
I thought I'd visit and check on them.

204
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,947
What are you guys doing?

205
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,658
Can't you see? We're cleaning.

206
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,953
Unlike you who needs a reason
to come here, we visit often.

207
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,873
Don't make me out to be that guy.

208
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,209
Gosh, these recyclables
haven't been separated.

209
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,671
What?

210
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,174
The watermelon isn't ripe.

211
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,051
The stem is too green.

212
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,054
You should've bought
a round one with clearer stripes.

213
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,016
Mr. Ban, is that coffee?

214
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:46,395
Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Chang brought them for you ladies.

215
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,813
Is that it?

216
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,023
But I prefer

217
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,860
the condensed milk latte
that Director Ji bought us before.

218
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,155
-We don't have that.
-I prefer

219
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,659
the Belgian chocolate mocha.
That was tasty.

220
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,620
No, the "shake-it-rato" tasted better.

221
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,789
Is that what it's called?

222
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,584
No. It's shakerato.

223
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,836
Shaâ€¦ what's that?

224
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,506
You should've gotten those instead.

225
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,924
We should have.

226
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,344
Mr. Chang, don't just stand there.
Go recycle these.

227
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,179
-Me?
-Then who?

228
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,349
Are you here just to watch us?
Set a good example.

229
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,977
What? Don't be ridiculous.
Let me take care of this.

230
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,689
-I'll take care of this.
-Sure.

231
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,483
-Gosh. Come here.
-That looks good.

232
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,735
-Let's eat first.
-Gosh.

233
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,487
Hwa-jeong.

234
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,365
What now?

235
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,578
So you said you'd discard

236
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,581
your family name if you cheated.

237
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,294
I have no idea
what you're talking about. What is this?

238
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,089
"What is this?" Look at you.

239
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:59,135
Hey, you'll never be able to fool me.

240
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,720
Hey, youâ€¦

241
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,723
-I'll go first.
-Look at you.

242
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,892
I have to serve a group of 45 customers.

243
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,856
It's so obvious
that you're trying to change the subject.

244
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,275
Hold on. Where are they from?

245
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,527
Chung-ho Industry? Chung-ho Cement?

246
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,611
Just go.

247
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,656
But they said
they were coming to my restaurant. Hey!

248
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,701
-Enjoy your meal.
-You too.

249
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,999
What? Is he not eating?

250
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,333
No.

251
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,712
This is unlike him.

252
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,716
He treated himself to a grand meal
after being told off by the committee.

253
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,011
That's him. But nowadays,
he's refusing to eat anything

254
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,597
Not exactly.
I made him drink milk yesterday.

255
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,349
Whatever. This is all your fault,

256
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,393
-so fix it yourself.
-What did I do?

257
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,936
You know why he's doing this.

258
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,855
He doesn't want you to quit.

259
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,899
How much is TCB going to pay you?

260
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,152
Just negotiate with our company
and ask for a raise.

261
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,780
Do-ha, don't be so ridiculous.

262
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,117
I was just worried about you starving.

263
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,286
And I wanted her to stay.

264
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,329
What do you mean?

265
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,998
You're starving, and Ms. Wang is quitting?

266
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,876
Gosh, that was fast.

267
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,712
I'm going to have pork belly
by myself today.

268
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,797
By yourself?

269
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that to her.

270
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,887
It's okay. I'm sorry for what I said.

271
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,768
This won't do. Guys, come with me.

272
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,897
-Where are you taking us? Where?
-Over there.

273
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,901
Gosh, your house is superb.

274
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,987
The ceiling is awesome.

275
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,448
The lights are so cool.

276
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,034
And so is the furniture.

277
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,790
Do-ha tends to be
all over the place. I'm sorry about that.

278
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,960
You have a lot of medicinal herbs too.

279
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,171
Aren't these seomoktae?

280
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,216
Yes, it's a kind of small bean.
How did you know?

281
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,386
Well, my father is a bit ill.

282
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,137
He's paraplegic.

283
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:11,559
I heard those beans increase blood flow
and help with paralysis, so I got some.

284
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,812
Gosh, you're such a caring son.

285
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,189
He's kinder than he looks.

286
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,609
What are you talking about?
My face screams I'm a kind person.

287
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,986
You don'tâ€¦

288
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,281
Rather, you look like the sly type.

289
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,157
Hey, I second that.

290
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,785
You guys are unbelievable.

291
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,247
I'm almost done here,
so let's get ready to eat.

292
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,418
All right. Here it is. Gosh, it's heavy.

293
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,339
Eat up, Do-ha.

294
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,300
-Okay.
-Here you go.

295
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,011
You too, Director Ji.

296
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,179
Thanks.

297
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,433
By the way, what's the occasion?

298
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:57,146
Wellâ€¦ I just feel bad for some things.

299
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,693
What is it? Is it because Dr. Yoon
chose you over him?

300
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,404
Hey, how did you know?

301
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,364
You got your lucky llama back.

302
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,575
At least the show won't flop.

303
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,536
Thank you for the meal.

304
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,997
It's not because of that.

305
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,459
This is for stealing both drumsticks
the other day.

306
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,628
Thanks.

307
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,506
-How is it?
-This is insanely good.

308
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,508
-Insane, right?
-Totally.

309
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,762
Eat up, will you?

310
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,895
It's so tasty.

311
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,898
I make 1 of the top 3
samgyetang dishes here in Gongjin.

312
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,983
You'll crave it again.

313
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,579
Do-ha is doing the dishes.

314
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,167
What is it? Are you on a power trip
since you're his boss?

315
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,212
Maybe I am, subconsciously.

316
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,006
Whatever. He volunteered,
saying he ate the most.

317
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,842
You didn't eat much.

318
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,052
I'm sorry.

319
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,056
I should've shown my appreciation
and not nibbled on the food.

320
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,933
Is this because of Ms. Wang quitting?

321
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,648
Wellâ€¦ I guess.

322
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,943
That's when I started losing my appetite.

323
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,195
Did she tell you the reason?

324
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,156
She says she wants to change things up

325
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,701
and work in a new environment.

326
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,619
Do you think that's her only reason?

327
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,789
-Then?
-A while back,

328
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:42,710
she told me that she admired you.

329
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,879
Do you think
she only admired you as a colleague?

330
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,634
This slowness of yours
is why you lost Hye-jin.

331
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,846
Hey. You rub salt into my wound now?

332
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,974
I think you have
a bigger wound to worry about.

333
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,142
What do you mean?

334
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,937
You look more hurt now
than you did back then.

335
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,732
You even lost your appetite this time.

336
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,656
Look at this from a different angle.

337
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,869
Who knows? Perhaps, life has
something else in store for you.

338
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,417
I'm done with the dishes!

339
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,171
He's done already. How is he so quick?

340
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,505
Did he do it properly?

341
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,388
Gosh, it must be so tiring
to drive back to Seoul.

342
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,017
Thanks for the meal.

343
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,645
My body really needed that. Thank you.

344
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,440
Right. Take this.

345
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,609
What's this?

346
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,446
It's aralia cordata.
It's good for sore muscles and paralysis.

347
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,281
Soak it and make tea with it.

348
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,741
It's for your father.

349
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,787
Thank you.
I really didn't expect such a gift.

350
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,625
Thank you. As his boss,
I should've treated him to a good meal.

351
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,668
You're better than me.

352
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,379
Oh, please.
Don't get all emotional over nothing.

353
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,799
Go on. I need to go to work too. Bye.

354
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,550
-Bye.
-Bye.

355
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,469
-Thank you.
-Sure.

356
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,972
I always knew he was an incredible guy,

357
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,432
but this is really touching.

358
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,559
I hate to admit it, but he really is.

359
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,852
But you're incredible too.

360
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,939
You're kind toward your former love rival.

361
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,357
You're pretty much a saint.

362
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,319
Yes, and you just enraged a saint.

363
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,862
-Come here.
-Gosh.

364
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,489
-Come here, you.
-What did I do?

365
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,407
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

366
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,159
Hye-jin!

367
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,664
Gosh, what brings you guys here?
You didn't even call.

368
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,041
We're attending a seminar nearby.

369
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,044
We came early to play golf
and thought we'd say hi.

370
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,005
I saved your address
when I sent the congratulatory flowers.

371
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,050
-I see.
-I thought it'd be teeming with patients,

372
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,802
but it's pretty empty.

373
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,388
You seeâ€¦

374
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,932
They need to book an appointment first.

375
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,270
I see. This is exactly
how I pictured your clinic.

376
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,480
A seaside clinic in the countryside.

377
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,857
How cute.

378
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,483
Thanks.

379
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,987
Wait. It reminds me of a dollhouse.

380
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,699
The lobby is small, and so is the office.

381
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,534
Everything's so small.

382
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,163
How about we go out

383
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,540
and have some coffee? It's my treat.

384
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:31,420
Sure. We didn't even walk around,
but we're already done with the tour.

385
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,839
Wait outside.

386
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,174
Let me just get changed.

387
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,758
-Sure.
-Okay.

388
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,679
-Why are they here?
-Who are they?

389
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,307
-What's with them?
-Did I wear expensive clothes today?

390
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,349
I don't remember.

391
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,643
This is so annoying.

392
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,899
Exercising in the moonlight
Because I can't sleep

393
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:56,862
Two glasses of iced Americano
and one glass of iced vanilla latte.

394
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,823
-Thank you for the coffee.
-Are they your friends?

395
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,534
-Thank you.
-You're both pretty.

396
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,163
Are all the countryside cafes like this?

397
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,499
The decorations and vibe are so tacky.

398
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,920
You're right.
It's neither a cafe nor a bar.

399
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,130
-What kind of place is this?
-Wait--

400
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,632
Dr. Yoon is there.

401
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,802
Right. Did you hear?
Gang-uk is getting married.

402
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,680
His fiancÃ©e is four years our junior,
Park Min-ji.

403
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,557
Myeongin Hospital director's daughter.

404
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,476
I heard the families are close.

405
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,145
Maybe this is a sensitive topic.

406
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,064
Why not? They just briefly dated.

407
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,442
Hey, I'm totally fine.

408
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,819
Tell them I wish them
a happy married life.

409
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,740
Do you have any plans to get married?

410
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,285
Come on. That's a bit rude
to ask someone who's single.

411
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,704
-I do have a boyfriend.
-Ms. Dentist.

412
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,208
-Hey.
-Speak of the devil.

413
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,461
-"Ms. Dentist."
-Hey, I don't like them.

414
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,381
What? What are you saying?

415
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,510
-Whoâ€¦
-Hello.

416
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,012
We went to college with Hye-jin.

417
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,556
I see. Hello.

418
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,185
Goodness, he's the guy from that photo.

419
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,937
-So he lives here.
-Photo?

420
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,481
-The guy who was chasing you--
-That's not true.

421
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,942
-Chasing?
-What are you talking about?

422
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,777
We're dating now.

423
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,779
Sit down, oppa.

424
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,030
"Oppa."

425
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,448
-Sit down.
-Sit, oppa.

426
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,826
Sit down, oppa. He's my boyfriend.

427
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,621
He looks different today.

428
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:34,459
How do I put it?
He looks healthy and strong.

429
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,463
Right. We're going to go golfing tomorrow.
Would you like to join us?

430
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,883
A friend of ours was going to come,
but they bailed on us.

431
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,429
Hey, it's too hot to play golf.
You'll collapse from the heat.

432
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,347
But we already booked.

433
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,475
Does he not know how to play golf?

434
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,352
-Let's go.
-What?

435
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,229
They invited us, so why not?

436
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,356
I just need to hit the ball, right?

437
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,482
Wellâ€¦

438
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,777
-Oppa.
-Why do you keep calling me that?

439
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,612
I always call you that.

440
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,781
I always call him that.

441
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,700
I see.

442
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,333
Why did you say you'd go?

443
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,917
Do you know how to play golf?

444
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,295
What's wrong? Worried I'll embarrass you?

445
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,422
That's not why.

446
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,009
They have totally
different values from you.

447
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,219
I don't want you to get upset.

448
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,473
Gosh, don't worry.
Things like that don't faze me.

449
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,516
Through this opportunity,

450
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,354
I'll show your narrow-minded friends
there are different values in life.

451
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,108
You're impossible.

452
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,861
Right. Do you even have golf clubs?

453
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,030
Don't you worry. Come.

454
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,200
You can always borrow them.
They lend those these days.

455
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,995
Thanks for lending them
so early in the morning.

456
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,997
I promise I'll use them carefully.

457
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,500
Of course. These clubs weren't cheap.

458
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,794
And I only wore this outfit once.

459
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,171
They're just steel rods and worn clothes.

460
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,756
Anyway, thanks.

461
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,218
Gosh, this is heavy.

462
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,179
Gosh. This is heavy.

463
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,060
What kind of attitude is that
when he's the one borrowing?

464
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,979
Darn it.

465
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,330
Chief Hong.

466
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,832
Thanks.

467
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:38,959
Let's go.

468
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,045
Hold on. I have one favor to ask.

469
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,380
Sure. What is it?

470
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,551
Can you please
use honorifics to my friends today?

471
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,719
-That's--
-I know.

472
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,014
I know you even treat
the elderly like they're your friends

473
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:57,644
because you believe
everyone should be treated equally.

474
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:03,608
But could you not do that
just for today? Please?

475
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,985
But that's unlike me.

476
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,444
Just for today.

477
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,536
Hey, you're here early.

478
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,794
-Hello.
-Hey-- Hello.

479
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,796
-I'm Hong Du-sik.
-Gosh.

480
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,425
I barely recognized you.
You look completely different.

481
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,719
Oh, I was doing something
that day-- Ma'am.

482
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,555
Can you golf?

483
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,141
Yeah. I mean, yes.

484
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,476
What are we doing here? Let's go inside.

485
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,061
Sure. Let's go.

486
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,062
Let's go.

487
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,735
Good job. You're doing well.

488
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,987
Just keep it up like now.

489
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,179
He's pretty good.

490
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,185
You're so happy.

491
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,147
Nice.

492
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,736
I'm better than her.

493
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,824
I'll go first.

494
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,837
Thank you.

495
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,933
That's par.

496
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,982
No way.

497
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,442
Thank you.

498
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,033
He never misses.

499
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,410
You're really good.

500
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,789
-Did you see that?
-Thanks.

501
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,041
You were incredible.

502
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,502
-You could become a pro golfer.
-Thankâ€¦

503
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,753
Thank you.

504
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,506
He's good at lots of things.

505
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,133
He has so many talents.

506
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,303
He surfs and is even a certified barista.

507
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,930
He knows how to enjoy life.

508
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,974
That's admirable.

509
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:44,185
They say smart people are athletic, right?

510
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,229
He graduated from SNU

511
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,605
and is athletic.

512
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,983
Goodness. You're from SNU?

513
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,236
May I ask what you do for a living?

514
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:58,658
Well, I paint,
brew coffee, and sail a boat.

515
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,995
-I don't have a specific job right now.
-Sorry?

516
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,874
I chose to lead my own life
instead of being led by someone else.

517
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:10,795
Change your view on life just a bit,
and this lifestyle will bring you joy.

518
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,881
Is this what they call YOLO?

519
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,675
-Yes, something like that.
-I see.

520
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,929
You only live once,
and I already have everything that I need.

521
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,558
A comfortable bed
I'll be sleeping in tonight,

522
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,435
a sturdy surfboard,

523
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,438
and the love of my life.

524
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,691
Goodness, you're so romantic.

525
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,859
I agree.

526
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,903
I envy you.

527
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,200
You have a wonderful boyfriend.

528
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,036
Unlike the cocky guys I've met recently.

529
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,872
Really? Thanks.

530
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:49,542
By the way,
are you even thinking about marrying him?

531
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,545
-What?
-Unless you won't get married at all,

532
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,507
people our age
should think that far when dating.

533
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,593
You must be in a dilemma.

534
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,679
He seems like a great guy,
but you still need to be realistic.

535
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,972
That's true.

536
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,651
Electric cars sure are nice.

537
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,570
They should really improve
the charging infrastructure.

538
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,989
I'll go to the city hall soon and ask them

539
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,783
to install more chargers.

540
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,743
I'd be grateful.

541
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,036
Gosh.

542
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,247
Can I ask you a question?

543
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,873
I know you're still going to ask.

544
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:34,129
When did you first decide
to live this lifestyle?

545
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,299
-What?
-Something must've triggered you.

546
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,717
I'm sure you're aware

547
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:43,304
of all those rumors
about those five years.

548
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,348
I am.

549
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,851
Don't you think you can tell me now?

550
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,815
So I came up with a few hypotheses.

551
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,692
Number one.

552
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,697
You were the winner of
that lottery ticket from Bora Supermarket.

553
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,949
Look at you smiling.

554
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,827
That's your hope, not a hypothesis.

555
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,496
I didn't even live in Gongjin then.

556
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,082
I see. You weren't here.

557
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,250
You look disappointed.

558
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,793
-I'm not.
-I can tell.

559
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,503
-You're wrong.
-No, I'm right.

560
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,838
No, you're wrong!

561
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,507
Why do you keep
making me look superficial?

562
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,634
You're so annoying.

563
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,053
Me? Did I do that

564
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,513
to you?

565
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,017
All right.

566
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,776
You were a genius CEO
like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.

567
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:38,777
No.

568
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,030
Then were you an assemblyman's aide
who decided to live here

569
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,157
after being let down by politics?

570
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,575
That's not it.

571
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,828
Are you an illegitimate child
of a wealthy family?

572
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,497
Don't you speak ill of my grandpa.

573
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,582
Sorry.

574
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,549
Want some?

575
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,510
Were you a secret agent?

576
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,720
As if.

577
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,015
A spy sent to North Korea?

578
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,768
Does that make sense to you?

579
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,187
How could none
of your hypotheses be realistic?

580
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,398
Then what on earth happened?
Why won't you tell me?

581
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:23,279
I told you.
I don't want any secrets between us.

582
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,866
Are you that curious?

583
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,660
I am.

584
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,958
I just had a desk job.

585
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,876
Nothing special.

586
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,002
A desk job?

587
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,090
Then why didn't you tell me sooner?

588
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,971
This feels a bit unfair.

589
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,933
I thought you had
a huge secret or something.

590
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,560
But you just had a desk job?

591
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,353
Yes.

592
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,484
Which company did you work for?
There are various companies out there.

593
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,987
Why does it matter
when I no longer work there?

594
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,615
Well, you seeâ€¦

595
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,704
Do you have any plans to return to Seoul?

596
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,164
Not really. I like it here.

597
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,626
Right. It is nice.

598
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,754
What is it? Do you still want to go back?

599
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,840
Wellâ€¦ Not right now.

600
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:29,304
I'm not saying
I want to go back to Seoul right now.

601
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,558
I'm just saying
there's a possibility of going back.

602
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,184
Right, that's possible.

603
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,773
All that golfing has made me famished.

604
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,400
Want some noodles?

605
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,277
Sure.

606
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,698
I'll cook some eggs
and add it as a pretty garnish.

607
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,965
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

608
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,801
-Can you refill our side dishes?
-Which ones?

609
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,179
-Fried shrimp.
-And bean sprouts.

610
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,139
-And some bell peppers too.
-Sure.

611
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,224
-Thank you.
-I'll get them right away.

612
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:25,485
YEO HWA-JEONG

613
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,154
All right.

614
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,616
-Okay.
-Hello.

615
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,410
Hey, take a photo.

616
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,079
-A photo?
-Yes.

617
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,208
Don't look at the camera.

618
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,334
Move a bit back.

619
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,546
That's good.

620
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,843
The filming ended ages ago,
so why is this still in here?

621
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,388
There's still everything inside.

622
00:32:54,764 --> 00:33:00,061
Let's see. The paper with my name on it
that she crumpled up isâ€¦

623
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,730
YEO HWA-JEONG

624
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:10,196
YEO HWA-JEONG

625
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,329
-Thank you.
-Eat lots.

626
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,250
Darn it.

627
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,628
How could she still care for me
after everything?

628
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,550
Why did she do it for me
when she should despise me?

629
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,643
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

630
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,855
I'll do the dishes.
You can stop here and call it a day.

631
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,231
You said your back hurt.

632
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,900
I don't think
there are any more customers today.

633
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,527
Let's just wrap up early today.

634
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,989
No. I'm going to wait
for more customers and make more money.

635
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,701
-Fine, then. I'll go first.
-Go on.

636
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,536
Good work today. Bye.

637
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,204
You too.

638
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,888
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

639
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,981
Gosh.

640
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,817
When did I doze off?

641
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,745
Let's see.

642
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,414
The dishes are done.

643
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,291
Did she come back and do them?

644
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,140
I enjoyed the movie.

645
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,225
Me too.

646
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,185
I looked it up beforehand.

647
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,687
It was the most popular movie nowadays.

648
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,772
I see.

649
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,276
I liked the pasta too.

650
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,737
They're known for their ambiance.

651
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:19,117
It's the number one go-to restaurant
in Chung-ho when you're on a date.

652
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,203
I see. Did you look that place up as well?

653
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,329
Yes.

654
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,583
I'm a bit tacky
and don't know much about these things.

655
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,502
I didn't want to disappoint you.

656
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,046
I'll keep improving.

657
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,714
I'll do better.

658
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,802
Eun-cheol.

659
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,558
You don't need to improve.

660
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:45,852
What?

661
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,272
Even if I watch a terrible movie,

662
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,941
I'll still enjoy it
if I watch it with you.

663
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:56,404
And remember that
spicy stir-fried pork with rice we had?

664
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,447
It was really delicious.

665
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,787
Really?

666
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,916
There's no manual for dating.

667
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,879
Just follow your heart.

668
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,140
I'm sorry for hugging you
before holding hands.

669
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,268
I was going to take it slowly,

670
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,273
but you said there was no manual.

671
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,778
Okay.

672
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,989
Well done.

673
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,034
You're quite the smart one.

674
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,037
I bet you could skip more bases.

675
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,985
Do you have any plans to return to Seoul?

676
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,072
Not really. I like it here.

677
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,783
Right. It is nice.

678
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,036
What is it? Do you still want to go back?

679
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,415
He could've said we could go back together
even if he didn't mean it.

680
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,757
I feel so awkward
because I've never worn a suit before.

681
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,469
-Seon-a, look at me. Do I look okay?
-Yes?

682
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,140
Gosh, you look really nice.

683
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,975
-Really?
-Yes.

684
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,071
I couldn't even throw it away.

685
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,336
Typhoon Gaia, approaching from the south,

686
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,839
is expected to strike
Gangwon Province this afternoon.

687
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,050
According to
the Gangwon Meteorological Officeâ€¦

688
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,885
-Hey.
-Hey, you're here.

689
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,429
Yes. Why did you call?
What's the emergency?

690
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,890
Could you bring in the fruit from outside?

691
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,351
I managed to put them there,
but they're too heavy.

692
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,312
Why did you go through that hassle
when a typhoon is coming?

693
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:20,107
I wanted to sell as much fruit as possible
since we're open today.

694
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,151
Why are you being so greedy?

695
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,904
There will be at most 300mm of rainâ€¦

696
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,324
That's a lot.

697
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,117
You put out all sorts of fruits.

698
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,745
Can't you just be nice and help me?

699
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,122
I will. I never said I wouldn't.

700
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,309
Green tea? No coffee?

701
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,104
No. The coffee maker here is broken.

702
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,314
Thenâ€¦

703
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,151
How about this?
This will help wake you up.

704
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,194
Okay.

705
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:22,628
Now we only have one more shoot left.
Time flies.

706
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,171
You're right.

707
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,384
Will you be working on
the next variety show right away?

708
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,761
Are you nuts? I'm going to take a break.

709
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,515
Thanks to someone,
I barely rested for the past few years.

710
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,269
A show would end,
and I'd think about going on a trip.

711
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,856
But then you'd call every 30 seconds
and spitball new ideas.

712
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:46,068
One time, you even flew
to where I was. Was it Rome?

713
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,028
No, it was Florence.

714
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,238
Right.

715
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,825
Hey, I couldn't even visit
the cathedral and stayed up all night

716
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,493
brainstorming with you.

717
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:58,038
He's the worst.
Who is that? He's so awful.

718
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,457
He's unbelievable.

719
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,877
Why did you continue working with him?

720
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,628
Because I enjoyed it.

721
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,132
You see,

722
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:13,971
it felt like I was doodling
on an invisible sketchbook with you.

723
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,599
We'd come up with ridiculous ideas.

724
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:21,770
Then suddenly, there would be a spark,
and we'd find our next idea.

725
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,023
It was electrifying.

726
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,735
But? Are there no more sparks now?

727
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,069
There are.

728
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,323
There are sparks all the time.

729
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,241
That's the problem.

730
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,207
Unbelievable. What are the odds?

731
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,251
That really surprised me.
I thought it was intentional.

732
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,920
I almost got a heart attack.

733
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,923
-Pick up.
-What?

734
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,841
Right.

735
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,885
Hello?

736
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,723
Hey. It's been ages.

737
00:41:58,974 --> 00:41:59,934
How's Ha-rang doing?

738
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,858
Is that all?

739
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,027
Yes. Thank you.

740
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,325
Honey, could you stay here
while I go to the bathroom?

741
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,826
Okay.

742
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,621
The baby is pressing down on my bladder.

743
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,088
Honey, can you tie my shoelaces?

744
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:32,174
Sweetie, can't you see
that I'm drinking water right now?

745
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,012
You're not a kid.

746
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:42,226
So why would you ask me
to tie your shoelaces?

747
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,068
Are you crying?

748
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,030
Why are you crying?

749
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,199
-Okay. I'll tie them for you.
-Forget it.

750
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,535
-I'll tie them right now.
-No, forget it.

751
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:02,288
Come on. Are you sulkingâ€¦

752
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,457
You are.

753
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,794
This is all because of the hormones.

754
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,547
Our baby needs to come out
for you to be comfortable.

755
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,592
What?

756
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,470
Comfortable? Are you serious right now?

757
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,974
What is it? Did I say something wrong?

758
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,934
Do you think childbirth is easy?

759
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,020
My body gets ripped in the process.

760
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,940
It feels like all the bones in my body
are broken then mended again!

761
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,692
-You see, I--
-Imagine

762
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,903
breastfeeding late at night in that state.

763
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,032
Breastfeeding, putting it to bed,
changing its diaperâ€¦

764
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,327
But what?
I'll be comfortable after giving birth?

765
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,121
Is raising a baby a joke to you?

766
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,456
I never said that.

767
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,958
And I'm being greedy?

768
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,338
Do you think
I work this hard just for myself?

769
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,006
I also don't want to work.

770
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,510
I'm exhausted because our baby
is weighing me down. I want to rest!

771
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,347
Okay, Yun-gyeong. I'm sorry.

772
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,140
Gosh, you and your words.

773
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,144
I'm the only one lonely and scared.

774
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,355
You're just a bystander.

775
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,607
You have no idea how much I struggle.

776
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,194
My hands and feet are swollen,
my back hurts,

777
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,987
and I can't bend forward.

778
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,447
I just can't!

779
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,659
That's why I can't tie
these stupid shoelaces!

780
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,494
-I'm--
-Do you know how that feels?

781
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,995
I said I'm sorry.

782
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,997
Okay? I'll tie them right now.

783
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,957
Forget it and just leave.

784
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,669
I don't want to see you, so just leave.

785
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,629
What's the matter with you?

786
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,882
I can't stand being
in the same room with you. Go!

787
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,133
-Leave!
-Come on!

788
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,427
-What's wrong with you?
-Get out!

789
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,222
Fine! I'll leave! Darn it.

790
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,431
I'm leaving!

791
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:56,860
Darn it.

792
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,406
You're such an asshole!

793
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:06,370
Is it so hard to tie shoelaces for me?

794
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,876
It's quite windy.

795
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,213
I should prepare in advance.

796
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,051
Gosh, it's too high up.

797
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,518
I should hurry.

798
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,985
-Goodness.
-Hey!

799
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,879
What's wrong with you?

800
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,965
I told you to be more careful!

801
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,717
What the hell are you yelling for?

802
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,093
You almost got hurt!

803
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,471
That was nothing!

804
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,639
Gosh! Put me down.

805
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,099
I was about to anyway.

806
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:14,396
-Why are you here?
-I heard a typhoon was coming,

807
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,274
so I wanted to check on I-jun and stuff.

808
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,736
I-jun went to play the claw machine
with Bo-ra.

809
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,779
I see. Claw machine.

810
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,244
If you're going to wait, hold the chair.

811
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,623
No, step back. I'll do it.

812
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,259
Why would you rip today's newspaper?

813
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,844
I didn't even read it yet!

814
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:47,930
Wellâ€¦

815
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,641
Hold on.

816
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,277
Gosh, it's so windy.

817
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,536
Drink.

818
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,287
Thanks.

819
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,339
I heard taping the windows is of no use.

820
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,050
You should put newspaper
between the window frames.

821
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,512
Listen carefully. You see.

822
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,474
You can barely hear
the windows shaking, right?

823
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,021
You never skip the chance
to compliment yourself.

824
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:41,692
It's so unlike you
to do the dishes without telling me.

825
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,246
Why's she dozing off here?

826
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,375
How did you know it was me?

827
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:44,546
How could I not?
There was foam left all over the sink,

828
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,633
and the dish towels were twisted in lumps.

829
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,927
Didn't I tell you
to spray the sink with water

830
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,264
and hang the dish towels
so that they won't stink?

831
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,267
How do you still remember that?

832
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,813
I only remember
all the annoying things you did.

833
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,528
I'm sorry.

834
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,910
I was a terrible husband in many ways.

835
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,166
What's gotten into you?

836
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,461
I didn't poison your coffee.

837
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,506
I mean it.

838
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,389
And I have something serious to tell you.

839
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,731
About that man
Ms. Joo told you about the other dayâ€¦

840
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,902
A judicial scrivener, was he?

841
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,989
It seems he's a decent guy.
You should give him a chance.

842
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,493
You want me to go on a blind date?

843
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,332
Not all men are like me.

844
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,502
You deserve to meet someone nice

845
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,296
and live a happy life.

846
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,719
You're done, right?

847
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,387
Then leave.

848
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,723
Hey, I didn't even have a single sip.

849
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,142
So that's what you wanted to talk about?

850
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,853
I already agreed to meet him soon.

851
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,688
What?

852
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,692
I see.

853
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:30,986
Good.

854
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,532
Mom! Dad, you're here too.

855
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:39,745
-Hello.
-Hey. I came to see you, I-jun.

856
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,997
-Did you two have a fun time?
-Yes.

857
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,498
What did you win?

858
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,084
We didn't play it and just had ice cream.

859
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,086
-You had ice cream?
-Yes.

860
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,755
-Was it delicious?
-Yes.

861
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,966
Will you play tomorrow too?

862
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,885
Of course.

863
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,095
YOON HYE-JIN

864
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,768
Ding-dong.

865
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,519
Get out.

866
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,981
But I just came.

867
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,525
Aren't you being harsh to a guest?

868
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,319
I prefer a typhoon to you.

869
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,821
Why are you here?

870
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,282
I'm taking refuge
from my wife's terrifying nagging.

871
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,617
What did you do this time?

872
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,577
Why are you so sure it was my fault?

873
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,204
Yes, you're probably at fault.

874
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:26,875
Fine, I am. But she got way angrier
than she should have.

875
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,836
Do you know what I'm going through?

876
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,340
She said I was useless and didn't want
to be in the same room as me.

877
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,841
She had probably bottled it up.

878
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,469
She did overwork herself.
It's been hard for her.

879
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,888
-Are you my father-in-law?
-Hey.

880
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:42,349
She used to know everyone
in this neighborhood.

881
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,559
She was friends with everyone.

882
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,229
But what about now? How is she?

883
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,398
She's busy working, raising Bo-ra,
and even has a baby on the way.

884
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:55,320
She's fulfilled her role as a wife
and a mom, but what about herself?

885
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,114
Don't you remember what she did

886
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,950
when she got pregnant with Bo-ra?

887
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,828
She proposed to you.

888
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:07,290
She must've been more scared than
you were, but she wanted to make it work.

889
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:14,714
Geum-cheol, it doesn't mean
that she's more mature than you.

890
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,885
She's still young,
so it must be hard for her.

891
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,429
So what should you do?

892
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,474
What an annoying bastard.
You only say the right things.

893
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,934
Then get lost.

894
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,477
I was about to anyway.

895
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,397
-Go straight home.
-I have nowhere else to go anyway.

896
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,608
Your umbrella.

897
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,361
He'll manage.

898
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,957
POST

899
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,089
BORA SUPERMARKET

900
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,090
Hello.

901
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,889
Hello.

902
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,974
Don't worry about this. I'll clean it up.

903
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,310
No, please sit down. Let me.

904
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,986
Would you like me to tie your shoelaces?

905
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,071
It must be difficult to bend forward.

906
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,073
Thank you.

907
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,172
Did something happen?

908
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,758
Gosh. No, I'm fine.

909
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,511
I just envy you, that's all.

910
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,222
I know it's wrong of me to do so.

911
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,099
Why would you envy me all of a sudden?

912
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,017
It's just that

913
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:52,520
I feel so sorry for myself these days.

914
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,482
But you're living your own life.

915
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,027
You have a well-respected job

916
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,279
and are having fun dating a guy.

917
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,282
But I find your life more admirable.

918
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,661
What? What makes you think that?

919
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,164
Childrearing is definitely not easy.

920
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:17,587
But you've already been doing that
for some time now,

921
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,798
and you're doing a really good job.

922
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,718
I truly respect you for that.

923
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:29,099
Yes, you're right. Our Bo-ra isâ€¦

924
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,060
quite amazing.

925
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,561
I agree.

926
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,151
What's wrong?

927
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:41,903
What should I do?

928
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,572
I think my water broke.

929
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,490
What?

930
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,169
What is that?

931
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,969
Gosh, that bastard left his phone.

932
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,387
Let's see.

933
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,935
-Hello?
-Hello, Mr. Choi.

934
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:15,854
Ms. Dentist?

935
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,690
Why are you answering?

936
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,818
Geum-cheol left his phone at my house.

937
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,196
Really? Oh, no.

938
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,949
Then can you come
to the supermarket this instant?

939
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,452
Why? What's the matter?

940
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,372
-Gosh, that hurts.
-I'm sorry!

941
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:38,710
You see, Yun-gyeong's water broke.

942
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,921
I'm on my way.

943
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,600
Come out. Put the umbrella up.

944
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,858
Watch out.

945
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,195
I'm closing the door.

946
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,242
-Can you manage?
-Yes.

947
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,120
But the contractions are getting
shorter and shorter.

948
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,246
Really?

949
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,333
Hold on.

950
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,758
Hello? Hey, Du-sik.

951
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:31,137
Hello? Hey, Eun-cheol. It's me.
Do you know where your brother is?

952
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,640
-No. What's the matter?
-Choi Geum-cheol, you bastard.

953
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,768
Yun-gyeong is going into labor.

954
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,062
I'm heading to the hospital right now.

955
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,730
If you can reach him, tell him--

956
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:45,110
Songjin is blocked due to a rockslide.
The roads here are flooded too.

957
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,821
What? Then when will we have access?

958
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:51,074
I can't say.
The rain is pouring down for a while.

959
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,869
It's no use calling an ambulance too.

960
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,329
Okay. Let me hang up.

961
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,379
-Yun-gyeong, how far along are you?
-Yes?

962
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,839
I'm at 39 weeks.

963
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,966
How much does the baby weigh?

964
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,511
Last week, the doctor said it weighed 3kg.

965
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,513
It's not a breech baby, is it?

966
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,974
Did you have
gestational diabetes or preeclampsia?

967
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,183
No.

968
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,645
Chief Hong, start the car.
Let's go to my house.

969
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,981
-What?
-She can't give birth here.

970
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,941
But you're a dentist.

971
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,694
It's better than nothing.

972
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:29,946
Hurry up.

973
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,575
BORA SUPERMARKET

974
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,035
It's really windy.

975
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:41,708
Compared to the typhoon I had
back in the day, this is nothing.

976
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:45,795
Which one? Are you talking
about Rusa from 20 years back?

977
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:51,384
No, there was a terrifying one
back in 1959.

978
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,303
What was the name again?

979
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:56,055
-Sarah.
-That's right.

980
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,140
Sarah.

981
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:03,897
Hello?

982
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,024
Grandma, it's me.

983
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:09,319
Yun-gyeong is about to give birth.

984
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,323
What did you say?

985
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,367
But we can't go to the hospital right now,

986
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,953
so Ms. Dentist will be
delivering the baby.

987
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,789
Back in the day,
you all gave birth at home. Any tips?

988
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,250
Let me talk to her.

989
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:25,668
Here.

990
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,380
Hello, I'm listening.
You're on speakerphone.

991
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:33,259
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

992
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,518
What's going on?
Why didn't she lock the door?

993
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,311
And why are the lights out?

994
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,148
Did she go home already
because of the rain?

995
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,746
Hey, Yun-gyeong--

996
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:10,463
Yun-gyeong, I may not be an OB-GYN doctor,

997
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,298
but Ms. Kim told me what to do.

998
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,676
And I also studied anatomy as a freshman.

999
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,178
I'll do my best, so don't worry too much.

1000
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,638
Okay.

1001
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,266
My baby is in your care.

1002
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,852
-Do you know the Lamaze breathing method?
-Yes.

1003
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,565
There are three steps.

1004
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,526
Inhale twice through your nose,
and exhale through your mouth.

1005
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,663
-Come in.
-Okay.

1006
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,457
Where the hell have you been?

1007
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,002
-Where's Yun-gyeong?
-She's in labor.

1008
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,421
-Yun-gyeong!
-Hey, wash your hands first.

1009
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:54,132
-The bathroom is that way.
-Okay. Take this.

1010
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,186
Yun-gyeong! Are you okay?

1011
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:11,858
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you!

1012
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,110
I'm sorry, Yun-gyeong.

1013
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:17,655
I went to buy your favorite fruit.

1014
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,658
But then it started pouring.

1015
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:23,369
I was having contractions,
but you were nowhere to be seen.

1016
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,414
I was scared to death!

1017
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,334
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

1018
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:33,379
You have me, okay?
I'll be right by your side.

1019
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,174
Dr. Yoon, may I stay in the room with her?

1020
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,634
Yes, you may.

1021
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,093
Yun-gyeong.

1022
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:43,598
Yun-gyeong, do the breathing again
and push a bit more.

1023
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,060
Good.

1024
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,796
Momâ€¦

1025
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,513
Momâ€¦

1026
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,724
Momâ€¦

1027
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:30,645
Momâ€¦

1028
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,273
Why are you out here?

1029
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,484
Did you wake up?

1030
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,697
What will happen to my mom?

1031
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:45,201
Don't worry. She'll be okay.

1032
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:49,956
I heard some ladies
saying childbirth is very painful.

1033
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:53,126
What if she dies?

1034
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:57,130
Momâ€¦

1035
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,757
Momâ€¦

1036
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:06,639
You know what?

1037
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,059
Make a wish when lightning flashes,
and it'll come true.

1038
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,936
-Really?
-Yes.

1039
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:15,565
I read it in a book.
So make your wish now.

1040
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,904
I pray that
my sibling will be born healthy.

1041
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:26,784
I pray that my mom won't be in pain.

1042
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,078
We beg you.

1043
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:37,420
What if the lightning
only grants one wish?

1044
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:42,008
Then let's pray again
when another one flashes.

1045
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:59,942
I pray that
my sibling will be born healthy.

1046
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,030
I pray that my mom won't be in pain.

1047
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,116
We beg you. Please.

1048
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:22,590
You son of a bitch!

1049
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,682
You crazy bastard!

1050
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:34,435
I told you it was too much

1051
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:38,022
and that we should only have one kid!

1052
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:43,361
Honey. Sweetie. Yun-gyeong.
Let go of this, please?

1053
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,696
Anything but the hair!

1054
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,449
You little prick!

1055
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:53,204
You convinced me to have another baby.

1056
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:57,542
How dare you ask for another baby
when I'm the one giving birth?

1057
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,253
Do you know
how much pain I'm in right now?

1058
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:03,881
Yun-gyeong, don't waste your strength
on him. You need to push.

1059
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,049
Push a bit more.

1060
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:08,135
-Yun-gyeong, listen to her.
-Squeeze.

1061
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,054
I've been losing a lot of hair lately.

1062
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:12,932
You know hair loss runs in my family.

1063
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:16,143
Yun-gyeong, you don't want to live
with a bald husband, do you?

1064
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:19,689
I don't care.
I'm going to kill you tonight.

1065
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,943
Don't waste your strength.

1066
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,361
Squeeze a bit more.

1067
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:28,614
Try giving birth yourself
and see if it's that easy to do!

1068
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:30,908
Just grab his hair.

1069
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,876
Yun-gyeong! I see the head!

1070
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,253
Squeeze for the last time!

1071
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,364
You did well.

1072
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,491
You did a great job, Yun-gyeong.

1073
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,201
-Honey.
-Yes?

1074
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:17,788
Our baby has
all ten fingers and toes, right?

1075
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:21,167
Of course. I already counted them.

1076
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,127
That's a relief.

1077
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,179
Honey. Are you crying?

1078
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,934
Yun-gyeong, I'm sorry.

1079
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,520
I was so inconsiderate

1080
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:46,400
and didn't know how painful
it was to give birth to our kids.

1081
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,071
I'm truly sorry.

1082
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,864
I'm all right. Okay?

1083
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:53,908
It was painful,

1084
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,036
but I got such a beautiful baby in return.

1085
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,246
Yun-gyeong.

1086
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:04,085
I'm sorry. And thank you.

1087
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,212
I'll treat you better. I promise, okay?

1088
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,674
Then promise me
you'll change our baby's diapers.

1089
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:13,928
I promise. I'll do it. I'll do everything.

1090
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,808
-Can you help me up?
-Sure.

1091
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:21,978
Shouldn't you be lying down?

1092
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,938
This is fine.

1093
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:28,025
Thank you so much

1094
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:31,278
for helping me
give birth to a healthy baby.

1095
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,906
I should be the one to thank you

1096
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:37,410
for having trust in me.

1097
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:42,289
Dr. Yoon, would you like to hold our baby?

1098
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:44,959
Can I?

1099
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,254
But I've never held a baby before.

1100
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,172
Yes, you have.

1101
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,008
You delivered the baby.

1102
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,094
You're right.

1103
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:58,305
Here. Come on.

1104
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:13,863
Excuse me.

1105
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,866
May I come inside?

1106
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:20,494
Sure.

1107
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:29,045
Chief Hong, isn't the baby beautiful?

1108
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,007
Even this one takes after Geum-cheol.

1109
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:36,385
Yun-gyeong, your genes must be too weak.

1110
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:40,347
Tell me about it. I was the one
who gave birth. It's so unfair.

1111
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,809
You've done so well. Congratulations.

1112
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,104
Now you're parents of two children.

1113
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:50,274
Du-sik.

1114
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,486
Thanks.

1115
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:57,239
Goodness.

1116
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,955
Isn't the baby so tiny and cute?

1117
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,040
Yes.

1118
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,626
Hold the baby yourself.

1119
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:11,337
Gosh, no. It's okay.

1120
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,798
-She's right. You should.
-It's okay.

1121
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,134
-Careful.
-Okay.

1122
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:26,977
Hi.

1123
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,189
Welcome to the world.

1124
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,758
It must've been exhausting.

1125
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,093
It was.

1126
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,804
My entire body feels drained.

1127
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,977
That's because it's all over now.

1128
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,146
Well done.

1129
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,982
I'm proud of you. Really.

1130
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,944
I'm also proud of myself.

1131
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:19,321
Where did you get the courage to do that?

1132
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,574
At that moment,

1133
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:26,328
all I could think about
was saving Yun-gyeong and her baby.

1134
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,623
-I'm afraid I'll have to retire now.
-What?

1135
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:32,751
Whenever something urgent pops up
in Gongjin,

1136
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,337
people will be looking for you, not me.

1137
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:37,798
Oh, please.

1138
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,593
I'm so sleepy.

1139
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:41,677
Then sleep.

1140
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,931
But where? My bedroom's taken.

1141
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:47,558
Let's go to my place.

1142
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:49,226
Okay.

1143
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:53,772
Let me just get changed.

1144
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,983
-Okay. What if she wakes up?
-I'll be quiet.

1145
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,363
Goodness.

1146
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:02,615
Watch your step.

1147
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:05,659
Gosh.

1148
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,786
Here. Give me that.

1149
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,871
Okay.

1150
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:17,171
Get some sleep.

1151
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,089
What about you?

1152
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:21,675
You didn't sleep a wink either.

1153
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:23,510
I can sleep on the sofa.

1154
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,971
No, come sleep next to me.

1155
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,059
Sleep by my side. Come on.

1156
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:32,436
Okay.

1157
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:38,734
You were amazing today.

1158
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:40,402
I know.

1159
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,281
But it felt strange.

1160
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,617
What did?

1161
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:49,703
I never thought of myself as a kid lover.

1162
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,582
But when I held the baby in my arms,

1163
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,043
I got emotional.

1164
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:03,550
It was tiny, warm, and soft.

1165
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:09,223
It's amazing that little baby
brought so much happiness to us all.

1166
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:14,770
I'm sure you brought happiness
to many as well when you were born.

1167
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:16,480
You too.

1168
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,902
Then this thought crossed my mind.

1169
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:27,074
"My parents gave their all
to have me in this world,

1170
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,451
so I must do my best to find happiness."

1171
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:35,249
Chief Hong.

1172
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,752
-Yes?
-In the futureâ€¦

1173
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,046
Much later in the futureâ€¦

1174
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:44,258
You know how everyone thinks about it.

1175
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:48,304
When you're ready to have kids,

1176
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,307
how many kids do you want?

1177
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:54,727
How you'd want a son
or a daughter for your first child?

1178
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:58,272
Have you ever thought of that?

1179
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:06,322
I'm not sure. I've never reallyâ€¦

1180
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:09,950
thought of that before.

1181
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,199
WHAT MEN LIVE BY BY LEO TOLSTOY

1182
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,801
Why aren't you sleeping?

1183
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:09,718
Wellâ€¦

1184
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,101
Why are you going through my books?

1185
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:22,940
I'm sorry.

1186
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,485
No, I'm sorry. I overreacted.

1187
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:30,489
Who are those people in the photo?

1188
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,368
They're just some people I know.

1189
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:40,416
Let's go inside.

1190
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,126
Will you keep doing that?

1191
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,086
Do what?

1192
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:47,381
"Just some people I know."
"Just a desk job."

1193
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:53,095
Will you continue giving vague answers?

1194
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,226
I've shown you everything.

1195
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:03,480
My dad, my stepmomâ€¦

1196
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:06,483
even my stupidly drunk self.

1197
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,613
I don't mind showing my true self to you.

1198
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:13,907
Do you not feel the same way?

1199
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,086
You see,

1200
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:29,756
I was so jealous of Yun-gyeong today.

1201
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,093
For having someone
who vowed to be by her side

1202
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:36,513
through thick and thin.

1203
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,562
You kept your promise
about my bucket list wishes.

1204
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,648
You agreed to do all sorts of things.

1205
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:51,111
But why won't you do
the most important one?

1206
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:55,574
Why won't you open up to me
about yourself?

1207
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:05,792
Why is it so difficult for you?

1208
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,547
You see,

1209
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,800
I really like you.

1210
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:17,763
So I want to knowâ€¦

1211
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,017
what kind of life you've lived

1212
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,145
and what's on your mind.

1213
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,200
I've been dreaming of the day

1214
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,161
you and I become family.

1215
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:57,135
Say something. Anything.

1216
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:07,145
I'm sorry.

1217
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,362
Why are you turning into someone else?

1218
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,616
Why are you drifting away?

1219
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,997
Why are you becoming a stranger?

1220
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,963
I don't know who you are anymore.

1221
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:36,425
I don't understand you.

1222
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:41,346
Me neither.

1223
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:50,814
I don't know either.

1224
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:17,507
Bo-ra, have some pork rinds.

1225
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,510
I-jun, your meat is on this side.

1226
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:21,845
What about the bean powder?

1227
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:25,766
It's right here.
You sure know how to eat your pork rinds.

1228
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:28,310
Eat up.

1229
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:29,394
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1230
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:30,354
My pleasure.

1231
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,070
Do you like Seumseum as well?

1232
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,739
Of course. I love all kinds of animals.

1233
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:43,033
Hedgehogs, dogs, catsâ€¦

1234
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:46,370
Then why did you refuse
to take care of it back then?

1235
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:52,250
Bo-ra, it's rude to bring up
the past like that.

1236
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,169
I-jun, do you want to die?

1237
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:56,046
Violence is bad.

1238
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,715
You should stop right now.

1239
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:00,884
I think

1240
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,887
I'm still afraidâ€¦

1241
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:07,933
of saying goodbye.

1242
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,181
What's the matter?

1243
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:52,310
Do you know why he quit his job
and came back to Gongjin?

1244
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,855
What may be easy for one person

1245
01:18:54,938 --> 01:18:57,858
can be something difficult for another.

1246
01:18:57,941 --> 01:19:00,736
I think we need to have some time apart.

1247
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:03,488
Just be honest.
Show her what kind of person you are.

1248
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,741
And you let her decide
how she feels about it.

1249
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:10,245
Du-sik. Eat a lot of good food,
and be happy.

1250
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,414
My grandfatherâ€¦

1251
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:14,583
I hate it when things are vague.

1252
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:17,711
Things that are ambiguous
don't sit well with me.

1253
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:19,087
So what I want to say isâ€¦

1254
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,255
Hye-jin.

1255
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:26,052
