1
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,552
There's something I want to know.

2
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,553
Okay.

3
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,640
Is Hye-jin seeing anyone?

4
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,482
Is she seeing anyone or not?

5
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,193
I don't think she is.

6
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,237
That's good.

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,326
-Why are you asking me that though?
-What?

8
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,037
Ask her directly. Why are you asking me?

9
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,248
A, e, i, o.

10
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,250
See? My voice's getting hoarse.

11
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,879
What are you going on about?
It's not like it required a long answer.

12
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,632
Aren't we here to discuss the contract?

13
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,675
Don't you dare go back on your word

14
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,135
and trick me in any way.

15
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,721
"In the name of the moon,
I'll punish you!"

16
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,223
What's gotten into you?

17
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,687
-Hello.
-Hi. Chief Hong, you're here too.

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,815
We're done here,
so I was just about to leave.

19
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,691
Where are you off to?

20
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,902
What's with all the questions today?

21
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,779
Don't ask, all right?

22
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,659
-What's gotten into him?
-Did you fight?

23
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,452
It's nothing. Have a seat, guys.

24
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,998
We came to a great agreement.

25
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,168
Chun-jae, can we get a refill
on the popcorn?

26
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,630
Are you trying to
fill yourself up with these?

27
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,217
-Order some food--
-It's just that delicious.

28
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,344
-We're only here for a glass.
-Have it all.

29
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,638
There aren't any customers,
so sit with us.

30
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,390
-I was just about to.
-Good.

31
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,267
That reminds me.

32
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,893
-Have you seen it?
-Seen what?

33
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,730
The blue dress I love.
The one with the floral print.

34
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,191
Oh, that? I haven't seen it.

35
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,651
That's weird.

36
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,654
I hung it out to dry after washing it,
but it's gone.

37
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,282
Maybe it flew away.
It's been windy these days.

38
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,283
-You think so?
-Yes.

39
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,327
-One of my stuff is missing too.
-What is it?

40
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,871
My red bra.

41
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,540
-Seriously?
-Come on!

42
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,041
-Nam-suk!
-I almost pictured it.

43
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,460
-The color…
-Who would steal that crap?

44
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,046
It's not crap. It's my underwear!

45
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,134
You'll give me yet another bruise.
You're turning me into a dalmatian.

46
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,927
No, a zebra.

47
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,554
Guys, that's enough.

48
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,056
Say that to her.
She's the one who's hitting me.

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,435
By the way, how's the tooth
you got treated for nerve pain?

50
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,022
It hurts. My heart aches due to the cost.

51
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,983
Still, I hear Dr. Yoon
is quite the skilled dentist.

52
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,235
-Dr. Yoon.
-Yes?

53
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,280
Don't you think there's something
between her and Director Ji?

54
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,865
-Really?
-Not this again.

55
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,325
I heard they're old friends.

56
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,411
Gosh. Listen to this innocent soul.

57
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:28,291
Dr. Yoon slept with Chief Hong
but also hooks up with Director Ji.

58
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,127
That's true talent if you ask me.

59
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,630
And in my eyes, the men could do better.

60
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,715
-That's ridiculous.
-Nam-suk!

61
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,926
How could you say that?

62
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,094
Goodness, Ms. Pyo. When did you get here?

63
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,430
-Just now.
-Right.

64
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,098
Anyway, Hye-jin's not like that.

65
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,309
She's famous for
not living up to her beauty,

66
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,645
so why are you spreading such rumors?

67
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,648
There's no need
to get so serious about it.

68
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,609
I'm just telling them
what I saw with my eyes.

69
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,945
I'm not spreading rumors online,

70
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,280
-so why--
-What can I get you, Ms. Pyo?

71
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,824
Some coffee or some fried chicken?

72
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,993
-What do you have?
-Just name it.

73
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,662
I only stated the facts.

74
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,456
-Can't one speak freely?
-You didn't make a sound coming in.

75
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,416
She must know Dr. Yoon slept out.

76
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,753
-That's enough.
-Guys, cut the gossip and leave.

77
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:14,671
Right, sure.

78
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,550
A cola for Ju-ri,

79
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,514
milk for Bo-ra, and green tea for I-jun.

80
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,976
What the hell? This isn't diet cola.

81
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,686
Don't you have strawberry milk?

82
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,562
Thank you, ma'am.

83
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:35,024
Why on earth are you kids
in my house though?

84
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,860
Because you have a bigger and better TV.

85
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,946
So I can see my JUNE even clearer.

86
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,240
Hye-jin, can you move over?

87
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,742
-You're blocking the TV. Move.
-Sorry about that.

88
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,454
And we're here to see the hedgehog.

89
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,250
I apologize for interrupting
and ruining your Sunday.

90
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,129
Dr. Yoon, we named it.

91
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,840
Please call it "Seumseum" from now on.

92
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,301
But this hedgehog--

93
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,720
Seumseum. That's its name.

94
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,432
Right, Seumseum.
When will you take it home with you?

95
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,356
Hi, everyone.

96
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,235
So, did you start up a kids' cafe?

97
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,031
I should've pretended to be out
when they rang the bell.

98
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,242
The lack of caffeine in me
led to this miscalculation.

99
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,663
Hey, I just met Ms. Cho
at the coffee shop.

100
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,207
What the hell's her problem?

101
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,876
What did she say?

102
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,754
She said you slept with Chief Hong--

103
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,848
She was telling others
that you slept with Chief Hong

104
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,643
and now are two-timing him
with Ji Seong-hyeon. She's so annoying.

105
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,731
It doesn't surprise me.
That's so typical of her, it bores me.

106
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,610
-Aren't you pissed?
-Over something like that?

107
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,320
Besides, she's my patient.

108
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,406
They said the men could do better.

109
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,825
-Who could do better?
-The men.

110
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,993
The "men"?

111
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,704
-Who said that?
-All of them.

112
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,498
Tell me who.

113
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,209
Just everyone.

114
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,171
Aren't we supposed to go in the water?

115
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,466
Did they give you a camera
the second you got a job as a director?

116
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,968
That's a perfect analogy. Very convincing.

117
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,637
I never say what's wrong.

118
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,430
Must he do it himself?

119
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,391
So that he can have others do it too.

120
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,978
Surfing is very similar to life.

121
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:40,358
If a good wave comes along,
you ride it and slide off it gently.

122
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,903
Whether the waves are vicious or stagnant,
accept it as is.

123
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,114
That's philosophical. It suits me well.

124
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,907
I can say it surely doesn't.

125
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,701
It's just like I said before.

126
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,286
-Lift your upper body
-Right.

127
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,205
-and look ahead.
-Right.

128
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:58,209
Here comes a wave, start paddling.

129
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,169
Lift your chest more and push.

130
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,756
Now, we take off.

131
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,759
Draw your left leg closer to your chest.

132
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,845
Slowly stand up while looking ahead.

133
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,264
-Hold on a second.
-Look straight ahead.

134
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,431
What the…

135
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,103
-Again. Paddle.
-Paddle.

136
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,396
Paddle and push.

137
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,815
Left leg at your chest.

138
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,860
That's it. Now keep your balance.

139
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,612
-Is this the best you can do?
-This is me at 99 percent.

140
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,532
-I must not have the talent.
-Stop talking and try again.

141
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,200
Look straight ahead.

142
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,787
For three seconds,
shout at the top of your lungs!

143
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,458
Good. Down on the board!

144
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,211
Why does it seem like he's being hazed?

145
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,504
Here we go. Eyes forward.

146
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,423
-It's like being back at boot camp.
-Chest up.

147
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,799
Look ahead!

148
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,259
It seems he has a grudge.

149
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,719
Now, push.

150
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,285
Once more. I can do it this time.

151
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:34,305
Is he filming
an apocalyptic disaster film?

152
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,308
What are you talking about? It's a comedy.

153
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,727
One with a sad ending.

154
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,563
-I can do this.
-Can't you swim?

155
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,023
I never learned.

156
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,005
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

157
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,383
I should've taken a different path.

158
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,134
Damn this habit of mine.

159
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,055
You must've seen a doctor.

160
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,974
Was any clinic open today?

161
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,770
Yes, an orthopedist in Jinseon-dong
was open, so I went there.

162
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,814
So? Did he say you're fine?

163
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,732
Only because I have strong bones.

164
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,694
They said most people
would've cracked their bones.

165
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,654
I never guessed otherwise.

166
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,740
Your skull hasn't split open
from the fall.

167
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,661
You and your harsh choice of words.

168
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,163
Even the harshest sandpaper
would be less gritty.

169
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,165
Leave before I grind you down.

170
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,336
Wait.

171
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,216
Could we talk? I have something to say.

172
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,968
-You can come in.
-No.

173
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,179
Not in there, but somewhere else.

174
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,651
Say what you need to say.
It's hot outside.

175
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,989
Hwa-jeong.

176
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,995
Our relationship as a married couple
might have ended,

177
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,831
but we're still old friends.

178
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,543
It must be something serious,
considering that grand opening.

179
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,297
You're probably aware
of my past feelings for Cho-hui.

180
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,426
I thought about it a lot,

181
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,597
and I don't want to lose her
this time around.

182
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,768
I'm planning to tell her how I feel.

183
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,313
-I thought you should know first--
-Not her.

184
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,109
-Why not?
-Just know that she's off-limits.

185
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,320
-Why not?
-Because you can't.

186
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,572
Give me a reason why you're against it.

187
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,575
I'm just saying you can't,
so why do you need a reason?

188
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
Do you have memories
of your past life or something?

189
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,787
What do you mean?

190
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,373
Did I wrong you in some past life?

191
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,208
Are you avenging your family?

192
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,462
If not, why… Why are you doing this to me?

193
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,339
I mean…

194
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,925
What did I do that's so wrong?

195
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,761
I married you because you wanted to,

196
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,223
and divorced you as you wanted.

197
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:26,977
What did I ever do
for you to ruin my life?

198
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,773
Hey, Hwa-jeong! Wait!

199
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,110
Fine, just leave. Cho-hui and I will--

200
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,324
I'll have a good life with Cho-hui,

201
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:45,830
so serve us a free bottle of soju
when we go to your restaurant on a date.

202
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,464
I had a blast.

203
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,341
It was tricky but I want to try again.

204
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,676
Do it on your own.

205
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,928
I've had it with anything
that starts with an S.

206
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:06,600
Spaghetti, samseon jjajangmyeon,
Sichuan-style noodle soup, fried shrimps.

207
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,810
-What are you doing?
-S…

208
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,312
What's for dinner?

209
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,899
Someone this childish is the nation's
top TV variety show director?

210
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,110
The future of Korean TV shows is bright.

211
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,988
Hey, I know what I want. Mul-naengmyeon.

212
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,948
Even after drinking all that seawater?

213
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,408
Have it by yourself.

214
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,368
But it's an essential summer dish!

215
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,619
It's still a no.

216
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,455
-Let's have it.
-No.

217
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,415
-You…
-Seong-hyeon?

218
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,003
-Hello.
-Hey, Hye-jin. Where are you off to?

219
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,922
-We're on our way to get dinner.
-I see.

220
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,050
-Thanks for the brunch, Seong-hyeon.
-Sure.

221
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,595
I enjoyed it too. Thank you.

222
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,346
Did you say "brunch"?

223
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,016
-Hey, Chief Hong.
-Hi.

224
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,560
He delivered brunch to us himself
this morning.

225
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,188
Bread and heavy butter for breakfast?

226
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,191
Koreans should have rice
and a hot bowl of soup.

227
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,985
Do you not know
how bad that is for your health?

228
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,987
-She's right.
-It's high in sodium

229
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,614
and bad for your digestive system.

230
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,533
I guess you'll live
a long and healthy life.

231
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,535
Yes, that's my ultimate goal.

232
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,704
-What the…
-Okay, that's enough.

233
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,872
So what are you having?

234
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,957
We're going to have naengmyeon

235
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,626
-since it's so hot.
-Really?

236
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,961
-I was about to go for some myself.
-Really?

237
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,963
-Can I join you?
-Sounds good.

238
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:23,636
Wait, that reminds me. I've gained
so much weight recently, haven't I?

239
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,138
So I was planning
to go on a diet, you see.

240
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,225
-Don't be ridiculous. What weight?
-I've gained tons.

241
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,602
They say you should
strike the iron while hot,

242
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,312
so today will be day one.

243
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,398
So go without me.
Go enjoy it, the two of you.

244
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,651
Have a fun time, all right?

245
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,195
What's with her?

246
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,905
-So it'll be just us two?
-Sure.

247
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,782
Why is it just you? I'm here too.

248
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,116
You didn't want naengmyeon.

249
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,952
I was against mul-naengmyeon.

250
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,912
Bibim-naengmyeon is the way to go.

251
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,206
Let's go. I'll lead the way.

252
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,417
Follow my lead. I know a decent place.

253
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,127
-Come on.
-Gosh.

254
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,088
-Let's go.
-Sure.

255
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,092
-They serve a mean mul-naengmyeon here.
-Really?

256
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,636
-Bibim-naengmyeon is good too.
-Right.

257
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,770
It's so hot.

258
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,148
I can't wait.

259
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,407
Mr. Ji, you love conquering
the menu alone.

260
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,158
Go ahead. We'll share this one.

261
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,037
Right. Read that one yourself.

262
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,539
We'll share this one.

263
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,082
Here.

264
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,585
-All right.
-Let's see.

265
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,295
She said "we."

266
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,881
-Why don't we order dumplings too?
-Sounds good.

267
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,924
How many? Two plates?

268
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,551
Two plates?

269
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,971
How many should we order?

270
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,431
Well…

271
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,766
I'm good with anything.

272
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,852
"Anything"? We asked how many.

273
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,645
Let's go with three.

274
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,156
Aren't three plates too many?

275
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,619
There's no need to worry about that.
He'll probably clear all our plates.

276
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,873
Then go ahead and have some more.

277
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:16,790
What?

278
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,084
I can't eat all these.

279
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,631
Are you sure you can give me this many?

280
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:28,469
Of course. Just watching you eat
is satisfying enough.

281
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,225
Have one more.

282
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,352
That's for me.

283
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,313
I had dibs on it, you see.

284
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,523
What on earth are you doing?

285
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,984
What was that?

286
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,819
Why did you do that?

287
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,490
It's just that hers seemed bigger.

288
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,868
Don't tell me you hog food too.

289
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,083
Look at you working so hard.

290
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,795
Why aren't you preparing
for the dinner rush?

291
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,588
Everything is prepped.

292
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,926
I heard you met with Yu Cho-hui
at a restaurant the other day.

293
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,053
What did you two do?

294
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,681
I hope you didn't clobber her like this

295
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,349
or spray salt on her.

296
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,017
-Is it raining?
-What?

297
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,979
It's great weather today.
Hardly a speck of dust.

298
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,313
-That's too bad.
-What?

299
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,357
You should still get a beating though.

300
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,317
-What are you doing?
-Get over here!

301
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,112
-What's wrong?
-I have a cramp right here.

302
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,071
-A cramp?
-Yes.

303
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,698
-Out of the blue? Where?
-Yes.

304
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,075
-Right here.
-Here?

305
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,493
Are you nuts?

306
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,954
-Goodness me.
-Get out of here.

307
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,706
You and your foul temper!

308
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,667
-Stop hitting me. It really hurts!
-Leave!

309
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,419
-Goodness.
-Hello.

310
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,963
Hey. It's you.

311
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,172
Hi, Cho-hui.

312
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,799
-Go on in.
-Right.

313
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,009
Don't mind me.

314
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,220
Hwa-jeong, could you spare me some time?

315
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,848
Sure thing. Come on in.

316
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:56,849
Thanks.

317
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,684
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

318
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,186
I'm a little busy. What's it about?

319
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,271
Well,

320
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,274
I came to give you this.

321
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,862
I bought a set for you
while buying cosmetics for myself.

322
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,155
It reduces wrinkles.

323
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,282
Why are you giving me this?

324
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,036
Do I seem to have too many wrinkles?

325
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,912
No, it's not like that.

326
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,541
I found it to be effective,
so I wanted you to try it too.

327
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,045
Cho-hui,

328
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,924
I don't want
to use the same cosmetics as you

329
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,634
or spend time with you.

330
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:34,928
Sorry?

331
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:39,308
You wanted the three of us
to be good friends like before,

332
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,684
but I can't.

333
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:46,398
How can I be
when Yeong-guk and I are divorced?

334
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,280
You see, my life isn't
going well enough to play along

335
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,783
with your childish requests.

336
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,330
I'm sorry, Hwa-jeong.
It was inconsiderate of me.

337
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,291
Ms. Yu,

338
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,837
please don't come by
unannounced like this again.

339
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:13,759
People don't appreciate teachers
meeting certain parents separately.

340
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,016
I'm sorry, ma'am. It was careless of me.

341
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,466
I had no idea you'd go into variety shows.

342
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,718
I thought you'd become a reporter.

343
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,804
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

344
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,889
When I interviewed for the newsroom,

345
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,725
they said my voice was good enough
to be an anchor,

346
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,102
so I became one.

347
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,019
An anchorman?

348
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,232
You have no idea
how popular Seong-hyeon was.

349
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,278
Girls would sit around the campus lawn
just to get a glimpse of him

350
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,029
-and hear his voice.
-God…

351
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,199
-He was that popular.
-Talk about blowing it out of proportion.

352
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,284
It's true.

353
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,371
Not you though, Hye-jin.
You were always so busy.

354
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,915
You were busy? Why?

355
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,168
To earn my tuition,

356
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,753
I had several part-time jobs
and tutoring gigs.

357
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,091
You were busy when we first met
in the lecture room.

358
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,260
-Do you remember that?
-Of course.

359
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,763
You sure have a good memory.

360
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,310
How did you two first meet?

361
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,774
Excuse me.

362
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,695
Are you Yoon Hye-jin, the dental major?

363
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,030
Yes, that's me.

364
00:19:58,822 --> 00:19:59,656
I'm Ji Seong-hyeon.

365
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,659
Hello.

366
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,580
We're on the same group presentation,
so why don't we talk about it over dinner?

367
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:11,501
I'm really sorry about this,
but I have a student to tutor.

368
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,878
Just a second.

369
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,801
Here's my number.

370
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,597
Let me know what I should do,
and I'll get it done.

371
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,932
Then when do you eat?

372
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,684
How can you work on an empty stomach?

373
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,852
My dinner?

374
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,896
It's here.

375
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,107
This. My dinner.

376
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,070
Can you survive on that?

377
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,738
Sure. It's more than enough.

378
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:42,866
Hold on a second.

379
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,789
Here.

380
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:55,879
Let's swap.

381
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,674
No, it's fine. Wait.

382
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,926
I'll enjoy this.

383
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,847
-But--
-I'll be in touch.

384
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,226
Wait. Hold on a second.

385
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,103
Bye!

386
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:21,321
Come to think of it,
you took meals seriously even back then.

387
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,157
How was I supposed to do nothing
when a junior student said

388
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,035
that one sausage was her dinner?
I had to give you what I had.

389
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,039
For a second,
I thought you had Mary Poppins' magic bag.

390
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,250
Food kept coming out of it.

391
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,459
What was it again?

392
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,045
You had a sausage and I…

393
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,755
-A fish cake bar?
-No, not that.

394
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,549
A sandwich. What the hell?

395
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,967
-Gosh.
-Are you all right?

396
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,677
-Chief Hong, come on.
-Are you okay?

397
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,970
-What…
-Watch it, will you?

398
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,222
-I was trying to pour you some water.
-Jeez.

399
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,600
I didn't mean to, you know.
Don't be like that.

400
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,894
Jeez.

401
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,980
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

402
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,528
I was hoping to get the bill this time.

403
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,697
You can't buy two meals in one day.

404
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,825
Buying a meal for a junior
makes the senior proud.

405
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,535
Don't take that away from me.

406
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,911
-Unbelievable.
-Here.

407
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,871
What's this?

408
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,874
For naengmyeon and dumplings.
And I ate one of her six dumplings,

409
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,876
so in total, it's 13,000 won.

410
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,003
It's fine. Just call it my treat.

411
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,173
Forget it. Why would I let you pay
when you're not my senior?

412
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,926
Repay me with a meal then.
It seems cold to go Dutch like this.

413
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,554
Thinking so is a strong prejudice.

414
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:31,349
He's right. You should respect his ways.

415
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,728
Okay, fine. I'll accept it. Gosh…

416
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,730
I'll get going then. See you.

417
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,277
-Shall we?
-He has weird taste in women.

418
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,321
How can he see her as a woman?

419
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,364
YOON DENTAL CLINIC
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

420
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,575
Your treatment ended well today.

421
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,077
Since the filling could break,

422
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,246
we'll use a gold inlay
as I suggested last time.

423
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,706
So we'll get a mold today.

424
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,124
Dr. Yoon, hold on.

425
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,460
I'd rather just leave it as is.

426
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,503
Sorry?

427
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:04,049
You don't have to give me
that gold thingy.

428
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,969
Are you saying you want to skip the inlay?

429
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,137
That's right.

430
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,265
I drilled into the tooth
so the inside is exposed.

431
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,683
There'll be an acute pain.

432
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,520
It's okay. I can manage the pain myself.

433
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,105
-But--
-So,

434
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,024
I just have to pay
for the treatment up until today, right?

435
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,612
Thank you, doctor.

436
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,863
Thank you.

437
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,367
-What?
-Ms. Pyo, I'd like to pay my bill, please.

438
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,167
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

439
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,804
It seems like she found a dentist
who offered a cheaper procedure.

440
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:54,307
I've met my fair share of weird patients,

441
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,767
but she's a first.

442
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,395
What a cheapskate.

443
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,731
She has never once given us
free fried dumplings

444
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,484
-when we ordered tangsuyuk.
-Right.

445
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,527
That's not all.

446
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,573
The other day, she took
all our complimentary coffee packets.

447
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,534
I was wondering why
you were drinking so much coffee.

448
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,035
Of course, it wasn't me.

449
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,704
She's the worst.

450
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,291
Am I really allowed
to get all this free coffee though?

451
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,668
Of course. You're a VIP customer.

452
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,379
But I don't feel like I'm one.

453
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:28,175
The low interest makes me sad
whenever I check my bank account.

454
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,094
Speaking of which,
could you give me a heads-up

455
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,264
when a high-interest savings plan
comes out?

456
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,682
You promised.

457
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,976
Thank you. I'll hold you to that.

458
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,060
Have a good day.

459
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,438
Yun-gyeong, wait!

460
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,816
You can't lift these when you're
this far along. You should've called me.

461
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,526
But it's…

462
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,280
-Head inside and I'll carry them.
-It's all right.

463
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,657
How were you going
to manage this yourself?

464
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,701
Gosh, these are heavy.

465
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,621
-Hey, Chief Hong.
-Hey, Director Ji.

466
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,081
I was passing by
when I saw her with these.

467
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:04,002
It's all right. I've got it from here,
so get going. You're a busy man.

468
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,462
I have enough time for this.

469
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,671
I'll get it done.

470
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:11,426
It's fine. Director Ji
offered to help first,

471
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,386
so I'll call if I need extra help.

472
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,304
What?

473
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,473
Where do these go?

474
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,099
Those go in the fridge.

475
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,268
-That way.
-Got it.

476
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,479
-See you!
-Right.

477
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,529
What…

478
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,365
Jeez.

479
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,458
What delicious treat
are you guys enjoying?

480
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,337
That TV show director bought this for us.

481
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,047
What are they called again?

482
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,132
-Canola?
-The TV show director?

483
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,761
How could you have such a bad memory
when you are years my junior?

484
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,598
These are éclairs while these are canelés.

485
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,225
Who cares what they're called

486
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,852
-as long as they're delicious?
-Director Ji again?

487
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:07,232
He sure has been busy
showing up all over this town.

488
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:11,486
What is he, Hong Gildong?
I'm the Hong in this town.

489
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,870
Ms. Gam-ri, what's with that bundle?

490
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:26,710
I agreed to rent out my house
for a whole month.

491
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:31,006
Those coming and going
would feel uncomfortable if I stay.

492
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,717
Do you have a place to stay for the month?

493
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,845
-Well…
-Stay at my place.

494
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,725
As if I would put out a grown young man.

495
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,438
I have many offering me a room.

496
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:53,278
-Hold on. Can you follow me for a second?
-Why?

497
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:57,699
My suitcase is on a high shelf,
so I can't get it down.

498
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,869
Really? Let me. Is it in the other room?

499
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,203
-Yes.
-Okay.

500
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,663
I need your help.

501
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,836
She should stay with you.

502
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,339
No way. You're better friends with her.

503
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,300
You have it all wrong.
She prefers you, you know.

504
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,761
-No, she prefers you.
-No, it's you.

505
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,471
It sure was on a high shelf.

506
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,516
-She can stay with me.
-No, she'll stay with me.

507
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,894
-She can come to my place.
-Are you kidding me?

508
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,521
-She'll stay with me.
-Come on!

509
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:32,275
-She can stay with me.
-Since you're this willing,

510
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,736
I have no choice but to give up.

511
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:39,783
Hold on a second.
This is some tough competition.

512
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,328
How about we play a game for it?

513
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,412
All right.

514
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,874
Here we go.

515
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,168
You all know the rules.

516
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,714
The one with the highest card
will offer Ms. Gam-ri a room. Okay?

517
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,301
All right. Take your pick.

518
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,136
This one.

519
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,348
This is what I call cut-throat.

520
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,101
That's nice to see.

521
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,311
Drum roll, please. Show us!

522
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,688
-Here.
-There you go!

523
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,816
-You won.
-Yours is four while yours is five.

524
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,902
Ms. Mat-i, congratulations.

525
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,071
It's too bad that I lost.

526
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,991
Lucky you, Mat-i.
It'll be nice to have fun with her.

527
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,454
When we leave later,

528
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,916
make sure you carry my bags with you.
There's a lot of stuff.

529
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,919
-Sure.
-Ms. Gam-ri, you're one lucky lady.

530
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,463
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

531
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,678
Look at you.

532
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:45,181
Why are you here during office hours?
What about your patients?

533
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,559
-I have some time before my next one.
-I see.

534
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,562
Are you a cashier today?

535
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,231
I'll be retiring at exactly 17:00.

536
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,082
-Why are you putting that to the side?
-Eating this

537
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,209
will shatter your dream of longevity.

538
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,962
-As if you care.
-Credit card, please.

539
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,466
What's that around your neck?

540
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,552
A neck brace.
It helps with my herniated neck.

541
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,389
I can't believe I left this on.

542
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,457
Get on with it then.

543
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,251
-What?
-My card and receipt.

544
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,753
Sure.

545
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,547
Here.

546
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,134
A herniated neck?

547
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,094
It comes with the job.

548
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,555
I look down into people's mouths all day,

549
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,557
so how can I not have a sore neck?

550
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,393
I bet you thought I had it easy.

551
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,562
When did I ever imply that?

552
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,358
My vision is getting worse,
and I deal with chemicals all day.

553
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,819
It's got its own hardships. See you.

554
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,244
What's wrong with me?

555
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,579
Get a grip, Du-sik.

556
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:34,958
Darn it.

557
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,125
A neck brace.
It helps with my herniated neck.

558
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,259
Why'd I ask? Now it's on my mind.

559
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,268
Ding-dong.

560
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,811
What brings you by at this hour?

561
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,731
What's with all the pieces of wood?

562
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,358
What's that,
a cutter used to behead people?

563
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,235
That's not even funny.

564
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,988
So tell me. What are these for?

565
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,531
Tell me why you're here.

566
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,285
Seeking shelter. I can't go home
until Yun-gyeong's asleep.

567
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,369
What is it this time?

568
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:58,041
She suddenly started craving durian
we had in Thailand on our honeymoon.

569
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,376
She told me to get some at this hour.

570
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,755
Why would she crave
that stinky fruit anyway?

571
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,424
The child she bears
is the one who wants it.

572
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,675
I know that.

573
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,428
That's what scares me more.

574
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,805
What if the kid is worse than Bo-ra?

575
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,515
What? Bo-ra is adorable.

576
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,767
Then raise her yourself.

577
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,894
-That attitude of yours--
-That reminds me.

578
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:21,356
The POS crashed again.
Maybe it's time for a new one.

579
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,482
Why didn't you call me?

580
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,526
Director Ji saw it while passing by
and fixed it.

581
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,111
-What?
-Being a TV show director

582
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,488
must've made him tech-savvy.

583
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,783
You idiot. You should've called me.

584
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,577
But you make me pay. He did it for free.

585
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,791
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

586
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,793
Who do you think you're taking?

587
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,211
How dare you touch her!

588
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,754
Damn bastard!

589
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,259
My gosh. Cho-hui.

590
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,468
Are you all right?

591
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,680
Cho-hui? My goodness.

592
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,808
Cho-hui, it's Hwa-jeong. Open your eyes.

593
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,998
-My goodness.
-Is that true?

594
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,333
-What a sick bastard.
-Hello, everyone!

595
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,752
Yes, hello.

596
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,545
What are you all doing here?

597
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,797
-Did you hear the news?
-What news?

598
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,592
-Something terrible happened last night.
-What?

599
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,804
Ms. Yu Cho-hui was almost
abducted by a man last night.

600
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,181
What?

601
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,432
It's true.

602
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,478
Is she all right?

603
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,238
Hwa-jeong.

604
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,741
You're awake.

605
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,662
What happened?

606
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,165
Why am I in the hospital?

607
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,877
How could you drink to the point
you can't walk properly?

608
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,089
Some sick bastard
almost took you last night.

609
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,548
What if I didn't walk by?

610
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,593
Are you saying you saved me?

611
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,305
Cho-hui!

612
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:04,393
Cho-hui, are you all right?
You're not hurt, are you?

613
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,230
I almost lost it when I heard the news.

614
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,815
-Yeong-guk.
-That's right.

615
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,818
I'm Yeong-guk. It's me.

616
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,196
The test result came out,
and she only has a mild concussion.

617
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,199
The doctor will be here to see her soon.

618
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,534
Right. Is that so?

619
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,661
Since you're here, I should go.

620
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,995
I have a restaurant to run.

621
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,872
Yes, you're busy. Get going.

622
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,957
Hwa-jeong,

623
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,836
-thank you.
-Sure. Rest up.

624
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,589
Cho-hui, let me see you.

625
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,882
-Can you see well?
-Yes.

626
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,967
My gosh.

627
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,265
YOON DENTAL CLINIC
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

628
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:46,727
You want the nerve pain treated,
but you don't want a dental crown?

629
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,729
That's right.

630
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,606
-Why's that?
-Sorry?

631
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:56,028
You're not the first patient who wants
to skip the inlay or crown.

632
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,406
May I ask you the reason?

633
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,283
Well…

634
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,202
Gosh, I'm not supposed to say.

635
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,628
-Ju-ri!
-Ms. Cho!

636
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:16,507
Why is my sweet Ju-ri all upset?

637
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,843
-Did you argue with your dad?
-No, it's not that.

638
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,137
A new DOS fan merchandise
has been released,

639
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,181
but my dad won't give me more allowance.

640
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,974
Is that so?

641
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:28,477
You got the photo cards and phone holder
before. What's the new release?

642
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,813
A t-shirt with an embroidery
that spells "Hacker."

643
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:35,526
It comes in four colors,
red, yellow, black, and white.

644
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,528
-Four in total?
-Yes!

645
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,780
-Then you should at least get one.
-Right?

646
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,033
Ta-da!

647
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,410
You're the best.
I'll place an order right away.

648
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,121
Get the red one. It looks best on you.

649
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,414
You're the best.

650
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,458
-Your dad can't know about this.
-Okay.

651
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,460
But promise me one thing.

652
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,879
Just name it and consider it done.

653
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,131
-You heard about Ms. Yu, right?
-Yes.

654
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,425
Don't you wander alone late at night.

655
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,803
Call me if you ever stay out late,
and I'll pick you up.

656
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,264
You're the best!

657
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,432
My sweet little puppy.

658
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,809
-Ms. Cho.
-Yes?

659
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,479
Did you call me?

660
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,314
I've run out of patience.

661
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:18,903
Even though I was offended by the rumors
you spread, I let it slide.

662
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:22,907
But not this. How could you do this to me?

663
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,578
Why on earth are you biting my head off
when I did nothing wrong?

664
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,830
Tell me what this is about at least.

665
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,834
You introduced my patients
to a dental technician you know.

666
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,961
A dental technician?

667
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,422
You told them
to get their cavities treated at my clinic

668
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,384
and go to the technician
to get them filled at a lower price.

669
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,426
Well, that's--

670
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,429
It's an illegal,
unlicensed medical activity.

671
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,682
How could you expose my patients to that?

672
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,433
Gosh, Ju-ri.

673
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,894
-You should head home.
-Yes, to buy this.

674
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,355
-I'll see you around.
-The grown-ups need to talk.

675
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,439
Bye.

676
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,194
Dr. Yoon, what do you mean it's illegal?

677
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,780
Let's face it.
The only difference is the dental degree.

678
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,033
It's not like dentistry
requires some great skill.

679
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,285
What did you just say?

680
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,245
I heard it all, you know.

681
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,747
The mold you create
is taken to a dental technician

682
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,874
who makes it for you and brings it over.

683
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,712
All you do is stick it on,
but you charge so much.

684
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,838
Just stick it on?

685
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,757
When any inlay or crown is fitted,

686
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,968
it shouldn't affect the bite.

687
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,762
Ensuring that is key
when it comes to fillings.

688
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,347
Whatever.

689
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,393
Everyone in the neighborhood
knows all dentists are frauds.

690
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,271
Why else would they have listened to me?

691
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,941
It's excessively pricey,
and you haven't earned their trust.

692
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:43,237
What you just said is
an insult to my profession.

693
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,739
Apologize right now.

694
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,033
Apologize right now.

695
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,659
-I--
-Say you're sorry.

696
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,202
-Du-sik?
-I heard it all

697
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,537
and you crossed the line.

698
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,830
What?

699
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:57,043
How would you feel if Ms. Dentist
badmouthed all Chinese restaurants?

700
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,212
Come on, Du-sik.
How could you immediately take her side

701
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,922
without knowing the full story?

702
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,216
-I wasn't--
-That's what you just did.

703
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,677
Is it because you two…

704
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,513
You've known me
much longer than her, but you…

705
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,558
Forget it. I won't apologize.

706
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,311
Do whatever you want. I'm just so upset.

707
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,604
Why are you crying--

708
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,481
Darn it.

709
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,358
There was no need to be so harsh.

710
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:29,575
I know the character is supposed
to lounge around and have fun all day,

711
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,870
but doing some work brings the fun.
Like diving to catch fish.

712
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:33,788
Right.

713
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,376
Director Ji?

714
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,794
-What?
-What's up?

715
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,420
-Why weren't you listening?
-I was.

716
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,589
His mind seems to be elsewhere.

717
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,885
And why do you keep fidgeting
with the stuffed llama? It'll get dirty.

718
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,096
What? When did I do that?

719
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,975
The whole neighborhood is unsettled today.
So much for shooting in a good mood.

720
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,853
Tell me about it. An attempted abduction?

721
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,023
Ladies living alone must be terrified.

722
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,608
Of course.

723
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,529
We hear about women
being victims of crimes almost every day.

724
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,115
So what now?

725
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,784
How about an early dinner and a break?

726
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,870
Sounds great.

727
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,831
-What was that?
-Jeez.

728
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:17,915
Enjoy your break.

729
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,042
What?

730
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,585
What now?

731
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,421
Didn't I call for a break?

732
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,382
Du-sik?

733
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,428
What took you so long? I've been waiting.
You'll patrol the area, right?

734
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,638
Yes. How did you know that?

735
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,725
Because I know you. You're not
the type to do just as you're told.

736
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,727
Let's go.

737
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,688
-Are you coming with me?
-Of course.

738
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,275
It's this chief's job

739
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:48,320
to protect people from danger
and tighten security, I think.

740
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,072
-Really?
-Of course.

741
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,490
Where is it written?

742
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,827
-I guess you didn't read the thing.
-No, I didn't.

743
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,204
-But--
-We're off.

744
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,290
Where is that written? Are you sure?

745
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,250
I don't think I've ever come across it.

746
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,210
I'm going to call the cops.

747
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,963
The dental technician will be arrested.

748
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,048
Ms. Cho too, as a broker.

749
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,634
Come on. I wouldn't call her a broker.

750
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,678
I don't think she had evil intentions.

751
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,599
She is the source of evil to me.
Absolute evil. A villain.

752
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,142
Come on.

753
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,770
The true villain around here
is that man who tried to abduct Ms. Yu.

754
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,230
I know.

755
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,693
It must be true
how small towns are more dangerous.

756
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:28,944
It's terrifying.

757
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,697
Eun-cheol will be busier now,

758
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,116
so my dating life
will be put on hold some more.

759
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,784
Would that really be

760
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,204
the only reason?

761
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:46,295
Just so you know, Eun-cheol and I
had a rotisserie chicken moment.

762
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,088
A rotisserie chicken moment?

763
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,842
A dating rookie like you
couldn't possibly understand.

764
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,344
That's harsh.

765
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,929
You're definitely not an expert.

766
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,848
Anyone else would've picked up
on Ji Seong-hyeon's signals.

767
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:03,020
Being kind is just
a part of Seong-hyeon's nature.

768
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,104
He's nice to everyone.

769
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:09,401
Look here, my friend.
Guys aren't nice for just any girl.

770
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:14,031
What guy would deliver brunch
to your doorstep on a Sunday morning?

771
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,078
Fate made you cross paths again,

772
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,454
so think about it.

773
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,289
You and Chief Hong are friends anyway.

774
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,833
Hey. What does this have to do with him?

775
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:29,296
I'm just asking
because it's all in the past now.

776
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,216
Is Chief Hong a good kisser?

777
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,010
Are you nuts? Unbelievable.

778
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,138
It's just that he's good at everything.
Since he is,

779
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,891
I was wondering about that department too.

780
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,518
-It had me curious.
-No.

781
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,520
I don't remember at all.

782
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,105
My gosh. It sure is hot.

783
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,941
Your cheeks tell me you do remember.

784
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,359
-Let's go home.
-You do.

785
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,236
-You remember it clearly.
-I don't.

786
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,404
Hye-jin!

787
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,615
Seong-hyeon, what brings you by?

788
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,201
I have some free time. Are you off work?

789
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,327
-Well--
-Yes!

790
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,830
Also, I have plans

791
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,457
and should be heading this way.

792
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,543
-What--
-You don't have any plans.

793
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:11,755
Yes, I do. Have a great time then!

794
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,048
Wait…

795
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,343
She gets cheeky like that a lot.

796
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,473
Gosh, you're sweating like crazy.
Did you run over here?

797
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,517
Yes, this couldn't wait.

798
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,102
Is something up?

799
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,979
I had something to give you.

800
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,817
Damn it.

801
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,068
What's this?

802
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,154
-My gosh!
-Hold on.

803
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,156
-That's loud.
-Sorry.

804
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,619
Here.

805
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,579
What are all these?

806
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,247
A gift…

807
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,459
for opening your clinic.

808
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,462
-It's so random, isn't it?
-Well…

809
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,381
I heard about what recently happened
in the neighborhood.

810
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,301
I see. You heard it too.

811
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,678
Yes. It had me worried,

812
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,931
so I bought
what I could find at the local store.

813
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,768
Lastly, take this too.

814
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,354
A doll?

815
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,105
Not just any doll. It's a talisman.

816
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,399
I once went to Peru to film something

817
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,152
and learned that the people there believe

818
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:18,030
that a mummified llama
attached to the roof brings good luck.

819
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,573
A real llama?

820
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,951
Yes. But I couldn't board a plane
with a mummified animal,

821
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:26,789
so the local guide gave me this
to keep with me at all times.

822
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:31,293
Then it's a gift that means a lot to you.
You can't give this to me.

823
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,836
It's not permanent.

824
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,422
I'm renting my luck out to you.

825
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,092
Thanks, Seong-hyeon.

826
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,303
Your luck sure is adorable.

827
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,184
Come on. I'll walk you home.

828
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,478
Sure. It's this way.

829
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,396
Let's go.

830
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,731
It's an expandable baton.

831
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,150
Gosh, that's loud.

832
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,319
My ears.

833
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,412
It's raining.

834
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,415
It wasn't mentioned in the forecast.

835
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,583
You should go home. I can do this alone.

836
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,544
Forget it. A bit of rain won't kill me.

837
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,587
Should we split up? That'd be faster.

838
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,089
I'll go this way then.

839
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,841
-Be careful.
-You too.

840
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,895
The light still hasn't been fixed.

841
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,314
It's been ages since I sent in a request.

842
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,650
Darn it.

843
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:44,491
It's gotten dark.
Is Ms. Dentist not home yet?

844
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,958
Hold on.

845
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,261
Good, it's not wet.

846
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,054
Then…

847
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,020
Will this stay up here?

848
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,730
Tell me about it.

849
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,817
Seong-hyeon, you should take that home
with you later. I'll lend it to you.

850
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,944
Then we both lent each other something.

851
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:21,904
Right.

852
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,449
-Chief Hong.
-Ms. Dentist, Director Ji.

853
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,242
Why are you out in the rain?

854
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,827
I'm on patrol.

855
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,954
I'm glad I ran into you.
This is Acanthopanax.

856
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,665
I got too much at home
and didn't want it to rot.

857
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,792
-So I brought it for you.
-Okay.

858
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,712
Why are you out in the rain? Get in here.

859
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,172
Right. We can walk together.

860
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:43,592
It's fine. It won't kill me.
I only need to patrol up there anyway.

861
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:46,637
Wait. Let me go inside
and get you an umbrella.

862
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,014
No, it's fine. Good night!

863
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,016
But…

864
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,526
How adorable.

865
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,495
I offered an umbrella,
so why didn't he take it?

866
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,256
So is this Acanthopanax?

867
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,427
Acanthopanax.

868
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,765
ACANTHOPANAX

869
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,559
"Good for herniated discs."

870
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,608
But he was going to throw them away?
Lucky me.

871
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,404
How does one eat this though?

872
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,658
Should I brew it?

873
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,382
Gosh, it's bitter.

874
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,427
How is anyone supposed to enjoy this?

875
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,446
I should at least say thank you.

876
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,120
MS. DENTIST

877
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,804
The call cannot be picked up right now…

878
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,973
He's not answering.

879
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,611
Hello.

880
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,658
Chief Hong, shouldn't we
get the tarp ready

881
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,827
in case it rains like yesterday?

882
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,912
We can have it cover this area.

883
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:03,458
Right. That way, it can block the sun too.

884
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,545
Chief Hong, you look terrible.

885
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,464
Exactly. I told him to rest,
but he won't listen.

886
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,758
I'm perfectly fine.

887
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,884
You're coughing.

888
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,638
-Is it because of the rain?
-What do you take me for?

889
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,515
Getting soaked in rain won't kill you.

890
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,560
Do I need to get you a tarp then?

891
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,730
Yes, that's right.
But take it easy, will you?

892
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,606
It's fine. I'll get one for you.

893
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,816
Gosh.

894
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,780
Hello?

895
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,615
Hi, I'm calling from Duri Bank.

896
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,952
-Ms. Kim, it must be you.
-Yes, that's right.

897
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:43,248
Well, I'm calling you about
a new high-interest savings plan.

898
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,001
Finally. My goodness!

899
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:49,337
Hold on a second.
Doesn't the bank close on Sundays?

900
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,257
It does,
but only a handful of people can get it.

901
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,926
It'll be too late
if you wait until Monday.

902
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,345
I'm calling in secretly
to get you in before the slots fill up.

903
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,723
Goodness, I'm so grateful!

904
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:33,507
Excuse me.
Were you perhaps sent by Ms. Kim?

905
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,841
That's right.

906
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,929
Hello. So this would
get me into that savings plan

907
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,223
with an interest rate
of 15 percent, right?

908
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,307
Of course.

909
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,185
Please don't lose it then.
I need it for something important.

910
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,521
All right. Then…

911
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,855
Hold on a second.

912
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,984
Dr. Yoon, what are you doing here?

913
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,945
Do you have money in there?

914
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,614
Is this someone you know?

915
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,827
Why are you giving him cash out here?

916
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,162
Well, that's…

917
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:08,166
I don't need to explain this to you.

918
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,795
-This is a phishing scam, isn't it?
-Sorry?

919
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,255
What did he say?

920
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,757
The prosecution? A loan?

921
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,261
That's not the case.
I'm not a fool, you know.

922
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:22,389
You're making a big mistake.
He was sent by a bank employee.

923
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,975
I also talked to
my financial consultant this morning.

924
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,393
What's the consultant's name?

925
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,811
Ms. Kim Mi-yeong.

926
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,564
Shit!

927
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,858
Damn it.

928
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,067
What?

929
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,360
Damn it.

930
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,612
-No!
-Darn it.

931
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,531
Hey, you're sweating.

932
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,450
-Can't you please go rest?
-Stop.

933
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:47,289
I value one's welfare, you know.
You're making me the evil employer.

934
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:52,043
It's fine. I called Geum-cheol,
and his store has the right kind of tarp.

935
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,754
-The hardware store?
-Yes.

936
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,424
I wonder if the POS works better now.

937
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,719
Why are you all up in people's business?

938
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,929
-That's my job, you know.
-I was only--

939
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,014
What was that?

940
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,182
-Get him!
-Ms. Dentist?

941
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,100
Was that Hye-jin?

942
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,940
Damn it.

943
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,819
-Damn it.
-Stop!

944
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,362
If only I hadn't jogged today.

945
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,742
Damn it.

946
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,956
God damn it.

947
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,124
Don't follow me.

948
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,173
Damn it. God, that bastard.

949
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,799
-Hey!
-Damn it!

950
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,302
Stop following me, you prick.

951
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:44,971
Chief Hong, where did you go?

952
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,640
Chief Hong!

953
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,974
Damn it.

954
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,734
Damn it.

955
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,320
Hey.

956
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,659
-Let go!
-Would you if you were me?

957
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,370
Anyway, what have you done?

958
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,288
Theft? Fraud?

959
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,624
You came after me not knowing why?

960
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,542
Because Ms. Dentist told me to.

961
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,127
Gosh, that was exhausting.

962
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,963
-You caught him.
-Took you long enough.

963
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:21,758
Director Ji, can you pick up the money?
As you can see, my hands are full.

964
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:22,926
Right.

965
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,011
-Just lie still.
-You little…

966
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,516
Yes, that over there.

967
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,269
-That hurts.
-Give me your arm.

968
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,105
-Your arm.
-Fine, take it.

969
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,856
-Your arm.
-Here you go.

970
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:41,403
GONGJIN KOREAN-CHINESE RESTAURANT

971
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,200
I can't afford to lose that money.
Hwa-jeong, my A-ram…

972
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,329
Are you hurt anywhere?

973
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,124
I can't afford to lose that money!

974
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,002
Du-sik?

975
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,586
Arrest him.

976
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,549
-Ma'am…
-My money!

977
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,636
I need that money!

978
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,515
Please calm down. Your money's right here.

979
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,435
What? Director Ji!

980
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,564
Director Ji, thank you so much.

981
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,900
Actually, it was Chief Hong
who caught the guy.

982
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,903
Du-sik, thank you.

983
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,238
Keep it safe.

984
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,823
I will. Thank you.

985
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,491
Come with us to the station.

986
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,660
Ms. Cho, you sure are gullible.

987
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,830
You should've been more careful.
How could you have fallen for that?

988
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:37,000
Why are you yelling at the victim
when he's the one at fault?

989
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,127
I didn't mean it like that.

990
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,755
That damn scumbag is the problem. Hey!

991
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,922
This way, ma'am.

992
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,341
Can I ride with you?

993
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,552
But you'd have to sit with the culprit.

994
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:50,847
If that's the case,
you should be more worried about him.

995
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,142
-Be careful, guys.
-Thank you.

996
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,771
You rat bastard!

997
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,647
-I'll keep you updated.
-Sure thing.

998
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,200
Thanks, Seong-hyeon.

999
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,910
No, I didn't do much.

1000
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,371
Thanks, Chief Hong.

1001
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,332
I only did what I had to.

1002
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,252
-What?
-Did you get hurt?

1003
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,463
It's nothing.

1004
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,716
You don't look so good either.

1005
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,553
I'm sorry, but I need to call it a day.
Geum-cheol knows what you need.

1006
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,847
Good thinking.
Don't worry and get some rest.

1007
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,015
See you.

1008
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,272
Hye-jin,

1009
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,109
you even chase phishing scammers now?

1010
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:48,780
No. It was all thanks to you
and Chief Hong that he was caught.

1011
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,365
It was cool of you.

1012
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,395
Ms. Dentist?

1013
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,440
What's up?

1014
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,358
I'm here on a house call.

1015
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,318
I'm good, so go back.

1016
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,704
You sure talk a lot
for someone at 38.9°C. Move.

1017
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:38,788
But…

1018
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,098
Come sit.

1019
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,142
Just leave the medicine and go.

1020
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,602
Listen to your doctor.

1021
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:07,192
Doctor? Didn't you say
you were only a dentist?

1022
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,905
Let's see that arm first.

1023
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,951
Is it that red ointment?
That stings a lot.

1024
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,078
Nothing is a better antiseptic.

1025
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,413
Give me your arm.

1026
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,251
This will sting a little.

1027
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,632
Gosh, that stings.

1028
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,029
Your face is even redder than before.

1029
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:57,617
That's because I'm running a fever.

1030
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,120
They say not even dogs
catch colds in the summer.

1031
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,873
Have you eaten anything?

1032
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,167
No.

1033
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,752
Is there anything you're craving?

1034
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:11,005
It's fine. You treated me,
so I'd rather rest now. Go on.

1035
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,424
You're not well. Just tell me.

1036
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,135
Who knows?
Maybe it''ll appear from thin air.

1037
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,512
As if.

1038
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,348
What could I want? Tangerines?

1039
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,643
-Tangerines?
-I don't have an appetite,

1040
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,395
so something tangy came to mind.

1041
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:28,106
Acidic food is bad for an empty stomach.

1042
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,691
You should have porridge instead.

1043
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,693
Hold on.

1044
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,196
Everything gets delivered these days.

1045
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,827
There's no porridge place
in this small town.

1046
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:42,954
How about jokbal?

1047
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,456
Seriously…

1048
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,917
Raw fish isn't bad
with a drizzle of citrusy lemon.

1049
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,419
Just go home, will you?

1050
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,798
Do you have rice?

1051
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,050
What for?

1052
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,927
It's sad when you're sick alone.

1053
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:01,347
Everyone knows that. Why don't you?

1054
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,311
-What now?
-Lie down.

1055
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:14,527
Even if you hear plates breaking
or some screaming,

1056
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,697
keep away from the kitchen, okay?

1057
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,283
Just don't burn my house down.

1058
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,701
Got it.

1059
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:32,170
Wait. Something just shattered.

1060
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,380
Did you break something?

1061
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,590
No, I didn't.

1062
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,136
I'm too sick to see what happened.

1063
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,223
My kitchen…

1064
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,143
She's tearing it down.

1065
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,606
Nothing will be left.

1066
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,326
He really fell asleep.

1067
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,704
It's not like him to listen to me.

1068
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,150
Is Chief Hong a good kisser?

1069
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,406
I must be going nuts. What's with me?

1070
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:31,247
I'm out of it. Hye-jin, you're going nuts.

1071
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,832
You're completely losing it.

1072
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,044
-You--
-Dr. Yoon, are you all right?

1073
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,922
-Sorry?
-You slapped yourself just now.

1074
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,383
Your cheeks are red.

1075
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,594
Well…

1076
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,764
-I did something that deserves it.
-What?

1077
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,892
TANGERINES

1078
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:11,120
Eat it all, down to the last drop.

1079
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:43,820
Seriously?

1080
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,240
How can porridge taste like this?

1081
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,537
It couldn't possibly taste any worse.

1082
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,873
What's there to ruin
when it's just rice and water?

1083
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,751
Why is it sour?

1084
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,799
And she wants me to finish it?

1085
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,676
Where's her conscience?

1086
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:13,850
Okay, let's eat.

1087
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,353
Seriously?

1088
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,990
I can't possibly have more.

1089
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,711
Ms. Dentist, you…

1090
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,840
Gosh, my head.

1091
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:38,893
What?

1092
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,773
When did she leave it here?

1093
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,072
It sure is nice.

1094
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,169
It's tasty.

1095
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,438
-Dr. Yoon.
-Hi, Ms. Yeo.

1096
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,648
Are you here for coffee?

1097
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:27,191
That's right.

1098
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:30,361
How about I treat you to some coffee
at my restaurant today?

1099
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:31,904
It'll only take ten minutes.

1100
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,240
Sure.

1101
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,286
-Doctor.
-Goodness.

1102
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,788
-It's black coffee.
-Yes.

1103
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,832
They have all sorts of instant coffee.

1104
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,834
I see. Thank you.

1105
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,588
Thank you for helping Nam-suk.

1106
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,717
I didn't do it because it was Ms. Cho.

1107
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,260
He just seemed suspicious.

1108
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:57,263
Did Nam-suk call to thank you?

1109
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,141
Of course not. I don't expect her to.

1110
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:03,728
Gosh. She gets
on your nerves, doesn't she?

1111
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:05,896
She spews a lot of nonsense.

1112
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,691
She's the type to ask for trouble.

1113
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,903
I know that.
Everyone in this neighborhood does.

1114
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,156
But you all still let it slide.

1115
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,326
To be honest, she takes it a bit too far.

1116
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,246
The rumors were annoying enough,

1117
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,624
but she really crossed the line
about my work.

1118
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,835
How could she get illegal tooth inlays

1119
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:30,129
and even persuade others too?

1120
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:33,382
She only thought it'd help.

1121
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,843
What is she saving
all that money for anyway?

1122
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:40,848
Nam-suk used to have a daughter.

1123
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,725
Her name was A-ram.

1124
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,978
She was the same age as Ju-ri.

1125
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,064
Why don't we wash up a little?

1126
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:59,366
Look how clean your hands are now!

1127
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,203
How can my daughter
have such pretty hands?

1128
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:04,246
-Who do you get all this beauty from?
-You.

1129
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,291
Yes, you take after me. Give me five!

1130
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:08,667
Nice!

1131
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:11,796
My girl even has the prettiest fingers.

1132
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:17,051
What kind of magic
will you show me this time around?

1133
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:20,304
I'm going to cast a spell
that makes my illness go away

1134
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,307
and lets me live with you for centuries.

1135
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,436
I want to cast that spell too.

1136
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:29,939
-Why don't we try it together?
-Sure.

1137
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,899
One, two, three.

1138
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:36,070
-Abracadabra, A-ram power!
-Abracadabra, A-ram power!

1139
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,990
-A-ram power!
-A-ram power!

1140
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:42,701
Goodness me.

1141
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,373
-Why don't we go to sleep?
-Sure.

1142
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,500
Come here, my princess.

1143
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,460
I love you, Mom.

1144
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,631
My baby, I love you more.

1145
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:05,099
Rock-a-bye baby, on the treetops

1146
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:29,456
Abracadabra.

1147
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:34,336
A-ram power.

1148
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:42,344
A-ram power…

1149
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:09,079
I-jun.

1150
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:12,958
He's so smart.

1151
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:23,677
GONGJIN KOREAN-CHINESE RESTAURANT

1152
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:36,357
After she lost her daughter,
she wasn't herself for over a year.

1153
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,780
She only found herself again
after she started

1154
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:45,908
making donations in A-ram's name
to the children's hospital.

1155
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:51,080
-She's been doing it yearly ever since.
-You know it tastes amazing!

1156
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,124
It may be because
we've seen her wither away,

1157
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,543
-but her being a pain in the butt
-Ju-ri!

1158
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,504
is better than the alternative.

1159
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:01,298
We know it's only because she's lonely.

1160
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,259
I got you what you love.

1161
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,385
There you go!

1162
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,179
So despite all the trouble she causes,

1163
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:10,724
I'd rather see her be all right.

1164
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:33,455
-Can you open your mouth?
-What?

1165
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,375
Open your mouth so I can check your inlay.

1166
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:39,962
How can I do that on the street?

1167
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:41,505
Then come to the clinic.

1168
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:46,844
I must check if that quack technician
put it in correctly.

1169
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:48,971
Got it.

1170
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:53,434
Do it again,
and I'll report you both to the police.

1171
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:55,519
Sure.

1172
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:56,979
Come by today.

1173
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:03,569
Also, we'd like some free dumplings
now and again when we order tangsuyuk.

1174
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,323
And stop taking so much
of the free coffee we offer.

1175
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:08,824
I'll see you.

1176
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:11,410
Thank you.

1177
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:12,745
Sorry?

1178
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:15,456
Thank you!

1179
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,167
Sure.

1180
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:20,252
Please come by today.

1181
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,545
All right.

1182
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:25,632
Dr. Yoon, you look
exceptionally pretty today.

1183
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,551
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

1184
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,098
Wait for me.

1185
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,935
-Check out the seagulls.
-There are loads.

1186
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,771
I haven't been to the sea in a while.

1187
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,192
-This must be the place.
-It is.

1188
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:51,825
Check those out.

1189
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:54,620
What a cozy town.

1190
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:59,541
Seong-hyeon, what do we do now?

1191
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,377
Just be at ease and look stylish.

1192
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,920
-Look stylish?
-Stylish.

1193
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,713
What do you think?

1194
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:08,258
Can you refrain from sweeping
your hair back? Do something else.

1195
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,385
Don't discourage him.

1196
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:11,011
What's so weird about that?

1197
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,763
As if there's anything to see.

1198
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:14,139
-Seriously?
-Go alone then.

1199
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,225
Come on. Don't be like that.

1200
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:17,559
They must be here already.

1201
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:20,145
-Hurry!
-Gosh, all these people…

1202
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,355
They must be filming.

1203
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:24,149
Can you guys let Ju-ri see?

1204
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,819
Ju-ri, there's JUNE that you love
over there.

1205
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,112
Dad, I can't see.

1206
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:31,073
Hold on a second. Step on that.

1207
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,449
-There.
-All right.

1208
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,701
-It's JUNE, your favorite!
-Quiet, please.

1209
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,703
Right. Sorry about that.

1210
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,080
Careful now.

1211
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,386
-Is this working?
-I don't know.

1212
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,809
Chief Hong!

1213
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:00,936
What are they filming? Can I come in?

1214
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:01,937
Sure.

1215
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:57,075
The light has gone out.

1216
01:14:58,535 --> 01:15:00,537
Why won't my phone's flashlight turn on?

1217
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,414
Darn it. My phone died.

1218
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:04,541
I should've charged it.

1219
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:45,707
Ms. Dentist?

1220
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,338
Your clinic closed hours ago.

1221
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:53,757
You shouldn't be out so late--

1222
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,676
I must be going nuts. What's with me?

1223
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,776
So you're Chief Hong?

1224
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,946
I'm Ms. Dentist--
I mean, Hye-jin's boyfriend.

1225
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:26,326
Hello! I'm Ji Seong-hyeon,
Hye-jin's senior from college.

1226
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,620
It's an honor to meet you, Father.

1227
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:32,082
How long have you two met?

1228
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:33,542
What is the matter?

1229
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:35,961
It's nothing personal against him,

1230
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:37,838
but you shouldn't be seeing him.

1231
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:40,674
-Dad.
-Break up before it gets any deeper.

1232
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:43,844
Hye-jin, when I go back down to Gongjin,

1233
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:45,053
can you meet up with me?

1234
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:48,098
Do you like her a lot?

1235
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:51,351
Yes.

1236
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:56,857
