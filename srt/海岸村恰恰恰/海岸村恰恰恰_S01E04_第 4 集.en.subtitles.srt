1
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,308
Hey, Ms. Dentist.

2
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,354
Hey, Ms. Dentist.

3
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,484
Hey, Ms. Dentist.

4
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,446
Ms. Dentist!

5
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,184
Mi-seon.

6
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,230
Mi-seon!

7
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,608
-Did you sleep in again?
-Yes.

8
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,735
-I'll get going first.
-Wait for me.

9
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,613
-No way. I'll be late.
-Give me three minutes.

10
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,049
Hey there.

11
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,724
You can actually form a bond with them.

12
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,184
And when you do,

13
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,272
they lay down their spines
so you can pet them.

14
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:29,899
Ouch!

15
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,069
Damn prickly, aren't you?

16
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,488
You guys are similar.

17
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,198
The hedgehog is just like you.

18
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,160
You're both spiky.

19
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,245
No, we're not similar.

20
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,376
Mi-seon, three minutes are up.
I'm leaving!

21
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,502
Let's go.

22
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,673
Did you replace your face or something?

23
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,679
EPISODE 4

24
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,850
Why isn't he around today?

25
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,934
What do you mean?

26
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,311
It's nothing.

27
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,357
What do you want for lunch?

28
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,650
How about jjajangmyeon?

29
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,779
Are you already thinking about lunch
on the way to work?

30
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,990
That I approve of.

31
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,785
Jjajangmyeon?

32
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,538
GONGJIN KOREAN-CHINESE RESTAURANT

33
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,750
What's with the long face since before?

34
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,627
What do you mean?

35
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,921
You've been like that
since our food got here.

36
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,797
This is what you wanted for lunch.

37
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,341
Did you get another craving?

38
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:40,178
I guess the warmer weather
made me crave naengmyeon.

39
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,930
Then we'll have that for dinner.

40
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,932
Now, take these out.

41
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,600
Right.

42
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,185
Miss?

43
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,146
I think the heat got to you.

44
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,280
He's always around
when you least expect it,

45
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,782
so where is he today?

46
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,790
Hye-jin, isn't this that guy?

47
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,376
Hey, it's Seong-hyeon.

48
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,710
RISING STAR TV PRODUCER
JI SEONG-HYEON

49
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,254
No wonder.

50
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,548
You rarely watch TV,
but you tuned in to his shows.

51
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,052
We went to school together,
so I hoped he'd catch a big break.

52
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,930
As if. I'm no fool, you know.

53
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,723
You have a crush on this guy.

54
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,934
No, I don't!

55
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,186
A man and woman can be just friends.

56
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,438
You're so old-fashioned.

57
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,068
When it's not meant to be, it just isn't.

58
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,238
Why does he have to be
Lee Gang-uk's friend of all people?

59
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,201
Why do you have on all that makeup?

60
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,787
Who are you waiting for?

61
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,747
Choi Eun-cheol?

62
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,957
He's not coming today.

63
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,168
-Welcome.
-Hello.

64
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,420
Hello and welcome.

65
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,965
It's my first time here, so I didn't
make an appointment. Is that all right?

66
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,383
-Sure.
-Of course.

67
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,677
-Please fill in this form.
-Right.

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,595
-I'll see you in the exam room.
-Okay.

69
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,643
Judging by the level of your pain,

70
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:15,064
I'm guessing that your tooth decayed
under the old crown.

71
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,110
It's tough to see
with just an X-ray though,

72
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,029
so I'll have to lift it up to be sure.

73
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,947
Once I verify the decay,

74
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,575
we'll treat the nerve damage
or decide on an implant.

75
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,412
However, there's a price gap
between the two options--

76
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,582
That's no problem.
I trust your judgment, doctor.

77
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,126
Thank you. I'll do my best then.

78
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,256
I hear a lot of patients throw a fit
regarding the cost of dental procedures.

79
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,343
Many have been installing cameras
inside the exam room.

80
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,095
The thing is

81
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,432
in order to install cameras,
I need the patients' consent,

82
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,476
so I haven't gotten around to that yet.

83
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,393
I see.

84
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,146
Doctor, you're quite the beauty.

85
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,273
Thank you.

86
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,568
But I prefer to hear
that I'm a good doctor.

87
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,820
I hope I didn't cross any lines just now.

88
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,280
No, it's fine.

89
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,408
-Let me take a look then.
-Sure.

90
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,577
Did it hurt a lot?

91
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,831
Here is your card and receipt.

92
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,291
Thank you.

93
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,962
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Have a nice day.

94
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,594
TREATMENT ROOM

95
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,263
I love patients who are polite.

96
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,809
He'll trust my judgment
regardless of the cost.

97
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,187
He must be loaded.
Everything he wore was a designer label.

98
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,317
Really? Does being financially well-off
give you that level of politeness?

99
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,070
Isn't that a little sad though?

100
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,240
It's all the more reason
to earn lots of money.

101
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,618
All right.

102
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,707
You're buying apples? What's the occasion?

103
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,168
You only buy fruits that are in season.

104
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,504
It's my mom's death anniversary tomorrow.

105
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,924
I'm sorry I forgot.

106
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,844
How can you remember it
when you're busy making a living?

107
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,763
-I'll take these.
-Sure.

108
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,313
You're definitely showing now.

109
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,233
It's going to get heavier.
It'll get harder and harder.

110
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,609
Not like it's my first time.

111
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,403
It's still just as hard.

112
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:29,407
I guess. Maybe it's because
I'm aware of the pain,

113
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,242
but I already have dreams about it.

114
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,121
Is Geum-cheol upset
that your second child is a daughter too?

115
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,958
Of course not. He's thrilled
to finally raise a proper girl.

116
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,586
He's even been practicing braiding hair.

117
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,423
Come to think of it,
Bo-ra never had long hair.

118
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:49,427
Exactly. She's not like
your usual young girls.

119
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,556
When other girls sing "Let It Go"
in Elsa dresses,

120
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,100
she dances like a boy
in a taekwondo uniform.

121
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,187
Wait and see. Kids like that make it big.

122
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,813
I really hope so.

123
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,027
-Funny, isn't it?
-It's embarrassing.

124
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,071
What? Get over here!

125
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,368
Bo-ra, I told you not to do that again!

126
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,996
Bo-ra will knock out
all of I-jun's baby teeth for him.

127
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,289
-Stop it!
-Hey!

128
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,335
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,965
-Would this be enough?
-My gosh.

130
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,759
YOON DENTAL CLINIC
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

131
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,552
Goodness, where are you two off to?

132
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,221
-Hello.
-Hi.

133
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,598
We're on our way home.

134
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,184
I see. Then I guess I came right on time.

135
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,896
If you're free today,
I was hoping to invite you somewhere.

136
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:42,980
Where?

137
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,859
the shopkeepers' meeting
that is the heart of Gongjin's economy.

138
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,236
I see.

139
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,614
All the business owners here are members.

140
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,159
If you wish to run a business here,
you should join…

141
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,412
Not that your practice
is a store like ours.

142
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:03,167
Anyway, in order to raise profits,
you should join as a member.

143
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,836
We'd love to be at the meeting today,

144
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,547
but I'm afraid we have other plans.

145
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,966
-Right.
-I see. That's too bad then.

146
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,884
I'd love to change the date for you,

147
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,721
but our treasurer Chief Hong
only has today to spare.

148
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,641
-The treasurer?
-Yes, Chief Hong is the treasurer

149
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,184
and I'm the chairwoman.

150
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,603
-I'll be there.
-Really?

151
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,649
Yes, I'll go to show my support
as a fellow business owner

152
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,986
and to do what I can
to help the community thrive.

153
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:35,116
I'm so glad you think that way!
Let's get going then.

154
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,742
-Hold on.
-Goodness.

155
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,036
I have somewhere else to be.

156
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,665
I guess we only need the owner to attend.
The employee can go about her day.

157
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,543
Dr. Yoon, shall we? My gosh, Dr. Yoon!

158
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,296
-That hurts.
-Did it? Well, I'll try to refrain myself.

159
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,797
Why don't I carry this for you?

160
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,173
What's with her?

161
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,883
For our shopkeepers' meeting!

162
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,093
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

163
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,095
-Dr. Yoon, cheers.
-Cheers!

164
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,388
This is nice.

165
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,310
This hit the spot.

166
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,773
As you know, we have
too many officials here in Gongjin.

167
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,569
Village chief, zone chief, area chief.

168
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,571
However, I believe

169
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,949
that my role as
the shopkeepers' meeting's chairwoman

170
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,369
is the most important.

171
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,748
Of course.
You're the Minister of Economy in Gongjin.

172
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,708
The Minister of Strategy and Finance.

173
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,084
-Sorry?
-What was that?

174
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,210
It's nothing.

175
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,796
-Right.
-Anyway, Dr. Yoon,

176
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,424
since it's your first time here,

177
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,594
could you say a few words
regarding this meeting?

178
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,304
-Me?
-Yes.

179
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,183
-Like what?
-Goodness. It's embarrassing to say this,

180
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,061
but the meeting has been in a rut lately.

181
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,438
Not many attend the meetings anymore.

182
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,774
So I was hoping to know

183
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,778
if you had any ideas on how to make it
lively again since you're smart and all.

184
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,364
It's my first day,

185
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,115
so I don't know what to say--

186
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,451
Just say whatever comes to mind.

187
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,744
Yes, no pressure.

188
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:06,207
Then how about we make a member directory
that include contact numbers?

189
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:11,253
You know, when someone
who's attended it regularly stops coming,

190
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,091
if we have a contact list, we can have

191
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,967
better communication--

192
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,054
Here's our member directory. Unbelievable.

193
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,348
-Hey.
-Did you really think we didn't have one?

194
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,101
Even grade school students
would have better ideas.

195
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,977
That's because I was put on the spot.

196
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,522
Chief Hong, why are you so late?

197
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,607
It's my day off, you see.

198
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:32,983
Gosh.

199
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,819
I wasn't aware of the time.

200
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,278
Do you have days off?

201
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,155
Yes, whenever I feel like it.

202
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,450
-You sure have it easy.
-Live like me if you're jealous.

203
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,368
Forget it.

204
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:47,164
Are you the treasurer
of the shopkeepers' meeting?

205
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,418
-Yes.
-How so? You don't even own a business.

206
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,711
I'm a freelancer hired by Ms. Cho.

207
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,047
I see.

208
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,007
Who knew this could be a freelancing job?

209
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,928
Hwa-jeong still puts down
Yeong-guk's number as hers.

210
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,513
This isn't Hollywood, you know.

211
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,349
As if their divorce made
things awkward enough.

212
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,310
One's a village chief
while the other's a zone chief.

213
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,979
It's super awkward.

214
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,611
We were given garbage bags
to hand out to the elderly.

215
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,489
I'll come by soon to collect them.

216
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,782
Sure.

217
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,576
We have the finalized list

218
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,537
of those who'll be cooking
at the Lighthouse Song Festival.

219
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,790
I see. Bring it over
when you come for the garbage bags.

220
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,586
That reminds me. Tomorrow…

221
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,258
I hear that the zone chief committee
will be cleaning the streets tomorrow.

222
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,803
Just know that it gets especially dirty
behind the marketplace.

223
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,847
The smell is unbearable.

224
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,390
I'll keep it in mind.

225
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,438
Have you had dinner?

226
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,527
No matter how hard I try,
I can't seem to understand them.

227
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,779
-What do you mean?
-How should I put it?

228
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,992
You need to be really cold-hearted
to get a divorce. Don't you agree?

229
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,287
-That's an old-fashioned view.
-What?

230
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,165
There's nothing wrong with divorcing.

231
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,293
Just like marriage,
it's one of the life choices we make.

232
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,836
Yes, Ms. Dentist is right.

233
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,296
Yes, of course.

234
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,673
You're right. I get that too,

235
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,009
but there didn't seem
to be any reason for it.

236
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,804
They were fine together then got a divorce
all of a sudden. You all know that.

237
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,599
-Right.
-I doubt anyone was in the wrong.

238
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,727
-You can't be so sure about that.
-Really?

239
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,939
But if something big had happened,
one would've moved away.

240
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,358
-Of course.
-Right?

241
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,984
Can we join you?

242
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,402
-You're here.
-Hey!

243
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,613
Please have a seat.
Chief Chang is here too.

244
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,032
We both haven't had dinner yet, so…

245
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,076
-Good evening.
-Dr. Yoon, you're here too.

246
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,871
-You won't even offer me a seat?
-Come sit. That's your seat.

247
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,708
The talk must've been so fun.
I could hear your voice from outside.

248
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,961
No, it wasn't that fun.

249
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,381
Since you're here,
you should order something.

250
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,591
Chun-jae, can we get the menu?

251
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,968
The menu, please!

252
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,177
Over here.

253
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,680
Couldn't you come and fetch it yourself?

254
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,057
Right here. Leave it there.

255
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,434
Hey, guys. Order whatever you want.

256
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,644
What's with your voice?

257
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,895
I have laryngitis.

258
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,814
-What?
-Laryngitis.

259
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,066
All the singing--

260
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,444
In that case, it's better not to talk.

261
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,612
Then I should shut up.

262
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,156
She's right. You're a singer,
so you should be careful.

263
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,951
Fine. Place your orders then.
Just yell it out.

264
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,536
-Got it.
-Don't talk too much.

265
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,748
Why would his throat give in
when his songs don't have any high notes?

266
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,376
-Right?
-Come on!

267
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,421
-Exactly.
-That's hilarious!

268
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,048
-You're wrong.
-If you think about it,

269
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,675
-that's how it is.
-No way.

270
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,176
I'm curious though.

271
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,387
Why do you two hang out together so often?

272
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,181
-Don't.
-Must you put it like that?

273
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,349
I smacked him for you.

274
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,269
-I'm just curious, that's all.
-Unbelievable.

275
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,941
Damn. Why did I agree to come here?
What was I thinking?

276
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,153
They talk too much.

277
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,950
Hi.

278
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,632
Kids these days are terrifying.

279
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,885
What has the world come to?

280
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,270
They're so gorgeous.

281
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,569
You must be a Hacker.

282
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,698
Isn't Hacker the name of DOS' fandom?

283
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,866
You're a Hacker?

284
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,286
No, not exactly.

285
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,165
But JUNE, one of the members…

286
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,833
Don't touch it.

287
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,378
I treated him two years ago.

288
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:03,963
Stop lying.

289
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,132
Why would I lie about something like that?
I really did.

290
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:11,637
Look here, old lady. Many people lie
about knowing the members of DOS.

291
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,514
-Unbelievable.
-But it's true.

292
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,350
Why would I lie about something like that?

293
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,935
Do you have proof?

294
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,145
-Do you?
-Proof?

295
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,983
Look at you all flustered.
I knew it was a lie.

296
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,485
I don't remember it clearly,

297
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,071
but I took a photo with him.

298
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:33,117
People always say they don't remember
when put on the spot. Right, JUNE?

299
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,368
She drives me nuts.

300
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,251
What? Where'd he run off to now?

301
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,378
-The popcorn tastes the best.
-Give me some.

302
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,547
-Better than all these.
-Where are the freebies?

303
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,590
-Yes, where's the free food?
-You're right.

304
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,675
Get out--

305
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,052
He's faking the pain again.

306
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,971
I told you I'd take care of it.

307
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,681
-Give us freebies!
-You're so slow.

308
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,433
Let's gather at my place next time.

309
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,601
-Give us tangsuyuk then.
-Yes, tangsuyuk.

310
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,895
-Tangsuyuk and--
-And free grilled dumplings.

311
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,273
-But don't grill them too much.
-I want to go home.

312
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,317
But they're grilled dumplings.
It's not like I can steam them.

313
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,820
-Do you have boiled dumplings?
-Don't be unreasonable.

314
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,363
Unbelievable.

315
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,657
They seem to have
such a good relationship.

316
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,534
-Dr. Yoon must be drunk.
-What?

317
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,244
You're right.

318
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,121
But she didn't drink a lot.

319
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,873
Shouldn't she go home?

320
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,960
Like always, my killer move works.
"Pretending to be drunk."

321
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,254
-Guys.
-What is it?

322
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,882
Hold on. Is Chief Hong singing today?

323
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,134
He must be filling in for Chun-jae.

324
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,304
Chief Hong will sing?

325
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,276
Without anyone knowing

326
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,197
I hung around and cried

327
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,037
Past moments sank deep into my heart

328
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,582
Under the empty sky

329
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,836
As the lights switch on

330
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:15,052
I carefully call out my old lover's name

331
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,014
Cold wind blows

332
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,976
And I adjust my collar

333
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:30,651
In regret and anger
Tears drop from my eyes

334
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,238
I once believed

335
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,450
No one could hurt me

336
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:45,916
But was my past self all a lie?

337
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:52,631
What I long for

338
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:59,596
I will keep as is inside my heart

339
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,647
My wife keeps calling me,
so I should go now.

340
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,107
-Sure.
-Right.

341
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,483
I'm too tired

342
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,277
-to stay any longer.
-Sure thing.

343
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,445
Why won't they wake me
and tell me to go home?

344
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,488
-Let's go.
-Bye!

345
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,282
What about Dr. Yoon?

346
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,242
I'll manage her, so go home.

347
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,910
-Will you?
-Go ahead.

348
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,078
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

349
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,329
-Go on.
-Thanks for this.

350
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,414
Bye.

351
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,874
-We're going.
-Bye.

352
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,042
-Chun-jae, we're leaving.
-Bye!

353
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,422
What do I do? Should I just get up?

354
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,179
One, two, three.

355
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,808
What do I do?

356
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,352
One, two, three.

357
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,646
What is he doing?

358
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,863
Darn it.

359
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,535
Chun-jae, I'm off!

360
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,089
Wait. My shoe!

361
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,802
Hey, my shoe!

362
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,597
Don't leave it behind. Unbelievable!

363
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,851
Drop the act and hop off.

364
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,646
I know you're not asleep.

365
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,325
Unbelievable.

366
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,541
My body aches all over.

367
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,878
Thanks to your lie, I carried something
as heavy as a sack of rice.

368
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,048
How heavy is a sack of rice?

369
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,466
Forget it if you don't know.

370
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,760
Why did you even pretend to sleep?

371
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,012
Because I wanted to hurry home.

372
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,889
We live in a society.

373
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,267
You can't hate being around people.

374
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,102
I bet you have no friends.

375
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,815
-You're wrong. I have tons.
-Name three in five seconds then.

376
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,651
-Five, four, three, two,
-Pyo Mi-seon, Mi-seon.

377
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,944
-one.
-and Pyo Mi-seon.

378
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,737
So one Mi-seon and two Pyo Mi-seons.

379
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,699
-Are they different people?
-What's it to you

380
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,117
if I have friends or not?

381
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,618
What a jerk.

382
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,128
She really likes those shoes.

383
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,344
ONE SACK OF RICE WEIGHT

384
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,597
Eighty kilograms? That jerk.

385
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,391
Unbelievable.

386
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,812
That's odd. Did someone move in?

387
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,107
What a jerk.

388
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,535
Why are you following me?

389
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,663
What are you talking about?
I'm only on my way home.

390
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,206
Then take another route.

391
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,917
Why should I take the long way home?

392
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,836
Move out, why don't you?

393
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,630
Moving is so much work.
You want me to do it again?

394
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,759
Taking your things after the divorce
doesn't qualify as moving.

395
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,720
Yes, it does. A change of residence
is called moving.

396
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,930
Whatever. Forget it. Just take this.

397
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,391
What is it?

398
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,518
Can't you tell? It's the kimchi container.

399
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,648
I enjoyed it.

400
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,154
Did you scrub it clean?

401
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,282
It's hard to remove the smell.

402
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,613
Gosh.

403
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,912
Let me see.

404
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,916
It should be here.

405
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,715
Found it. Just wait to see this, brat.

406
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,834
Where's the kid?

407
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,962
The one who talks back to adults.

408
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,130
Ju-ri? She's at school, of course.

409
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,217
Right. I should come back later then.

410
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,343
What about coffee?

411
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,390
I do need some caffeine.

412
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,101
But I'm a little busy,
so could it be delivered?

413
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,102
Of course.

414
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:07,816
Then one Americano and one latte, please.
With lots of ice and syrup.

415
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,109
It'll cost 2,000 won more.

416
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,611
You cheapskate.

417
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,738
How can you charge me
when you're right by?

418
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,991
I get paid whenever I move.

419
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,993
-Manual labor--
-Whatever.

420
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,995
-Cancel my order.
-Jeez.

421
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,504
You did great today.

422
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,006
I bet it hurt.

423
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:35,427
How could it not when my gums were slit?

424
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,929
It doesn't stop me
from living my life though.

425
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,849
We'll check it again in two weeks.

426
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:46,271
Sure. You're my dentist,
so I do as you say.

427
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,276
-Hello.
-Hi.

428
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,862
-Get home safely then.
-Have a good day.

429
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,324
-So how was your temporary crown?
-It wasn't bad.

430
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,951
-Let me take you inside then.
-Sure.

431
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:08,251
Hold on a second.
Where have I seen him before?

432
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,839
The needle stung, didn't it?

433
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,175
My gums are a bit stiff.

434
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,804
Scaling will be done while your gums
go numb, and the treatment will follow.

435
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,098
-Ms. Pyo?
-Sure.

436
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,617
Hey. Here's the coffee you ordered.

437
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,287
But I canceled my order.
Are you forcing this coffee on me?

438
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,290
It wouldn't be right
to ignore the order that came in.

439
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,377
What are you waiting for? Pay up.

440
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,966
"How to sterilize."

441
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,135
I guess that's important these days.

442
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,180
Here you go.

443
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,849
With the loyal customer discount,

444
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:09,312
the Americano is 3,000 won
and the latte is 3,500 won. So 3,000 won

445
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,399
and…

446
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,442
here's 500 won.

447
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,239
That's a lot of change.
I thought there was a delivery fee.

448
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,700
It's fine. I stopped by since no one
was at the cafe. I'll get going then.

449
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,289
What? That's not like him at all.

450
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,542
Lucky us.

451
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,841
Eodongyukseo.

452
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,178
Fish sits in the east
and meat sits in the west.

453
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,515
Hongdongbaekseo.

454
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:50,103
Red fruit sits in the east
and white fruit sits in the west.

455
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,566
Mom.

456
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,445
How can you serve that
at a memorial service?

457
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,197
My mom loved roll cakes, you see.

458
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,452
I know you're a stickler for the rules,

459
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:09,080
but can I serve what she loved
since the service is for her?

460
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,350
Let's bow.

461
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,044
Uncle Du-sik, can you make me
a cup of vanilla latte?

462
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,629
-No.
-I'll pay.

463
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,006
Don't be cheeky.
I don't sell coffee to kids.

464
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,633
We all drink coffee these days.

465
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,052
-Not you though.
-Why not?

466
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,804
The recommended amount of caffeine

467
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,889
is 2.5mg per 1kg of body weight
for minors.

468
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,182
By the looks of it,

469
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,684
-you weigh around 45kg.
-What?

470
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,020
Your caffeine intake
should only be 112.5mg,

471
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,981
but you had chocolate
that contained caffeine earlier.

472
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,399
You had two pieces, so 30mg.

473
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,069
Vanilla latte has around 100mg,

474
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,657
so drinking that means you'll have
more caffeine than recommended.

475
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,908
That's so unfair.

476
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,369
-Take this.
-No, you can have it.

477
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,578
What if I have three?

478
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,788
That's 15 plus 15 plus 15mg.

479
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,875
Ms. Dentist, I'd rather
not see you three times a day.

480
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,419
Likewise, so don't talk to me.

481
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,296
I'm here to see someone else.

482
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,176
I brought you proof.

483
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,636
Proof?

484
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,347
My gosh. No way!

485
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,851
Did you really meet him?
I thought you were lying!

486
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,060
Look how handsome he is.

487
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,186
-Wait--
-No way!

488
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,313
-I want to be a dentist too!
-What's that?

489
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,942
-What is it? God, you're so loud.
-He's super handsome!

490
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,361
-Look at it over there then.
-He's so handsome!

491
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,821
-Fine, I get it.
-So handsome!

492
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,073
I'm speechless by his beauty.

493
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,286
What does he look like in person?
Is he handsome? Of course he is.

494
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,954
What was he like?

495
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,624
He's handsome, much more so in person.

496
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,459
I'm so jealous.

497
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,837
Did JUNE handle the pain well?

498
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,799
According to his vlog,
dental procedures scare him. Poor JUNE.

499
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,469
I'm afraid I can't disclose
a patient's personal information.

500
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,348
Is that so? Then what should I ask?

501
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,601
Did he bring his doll with him?

502
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,895
There's one he carries everywhere.

503
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,980
What did he wear? His shoes?
Can we be friends?

504
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,190
Be informal with me too.
Sit back, get comfy.

505
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,609
-Have some chocolate.
-Thanks.

506
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,777
Leave your bag to the side.

507
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,363
-Ask me one at a time.
-All right, then…

508
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,159
What's this? I didn't order anything.

509
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,162
A teenager should eat.
Eat with her if you want.

510
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,789
God, I'm so grateful that I might cry.

511
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:00,710
Don't you cry.
So is he that Jin guy or whatever?

512
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,088
-It's JUNE.
-Uncle Du-sik,

513
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,175
can you not mistake the sacred name
bestowed upon my JUNE?

514
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,136
Now I'm upset.
I see laser beams coming from your eyes.

515
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,056
If you ask me, he's not handsome at all.

516
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,392
-He's better looking than you!
-He's better looking than you!

517
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,479
-Unbelievable. Just go.
-Yes, leave us.

518
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,022
-Gosh.
-You two are so alike.

519
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,107
Have fun then.

520
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,902
-You're so alike.
-We got rid of him.

521
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,947
-We did. You know, this is…
-I can hear you, Ju-ri.

522
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,658
It was my first time seeing a celebrity
and he was glowing.

523
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,242
-I bet his face was tiny.
-It was.

524
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,703
-How does a person glow?
-No way!

525
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,288
That I can never understand.

526
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,457
-What's up with him?
-What's with him?

527
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,459
-I hate him.
-So do I.

528
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,961
You two are so alike.

529
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,337
-Unbelievable.
-Unbelievable.

530
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,279
-Gosh.
-Goodness, Chief Hong!

531
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,407
Why won't you answer your phone?

532
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,535
Du-sik, this is me in line.
I got here before Nam-suk did.

533
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,578
No. I can't. No way.

534
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,414
Don't be like that. Help me out.

535
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,207
Delivery orders are piling up.

536
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,668
I can't deliver
mushy jjajangmyeon, you know.

537
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,253
Jjajangmyeon is good either way.

538
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,047
Du-sik, the air conditioner
at my store broke down.

539
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,592
If it's not fixed,
I'll be steamed alive today.

540
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,845
-Let go of me. Is Nam-gyu still asleep?
-Yes.

541
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,638
Then smack his back and wake him up.

542
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,807
He's your brother,
but he's also your employee.

543
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,184
Why go easy on him?
You shouldn't have hired him.

544
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,978
He doesn't listen to a word I say.

545
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,229
Why are you weeping?

546
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,355
-And you.
-Yes?

547
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,524
It's about time you fixed things yourself.

548
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,693
For God's sake, you run a hardware store.

549
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,903
How dare you? That's my biggest weakness.

550
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,447
Are you both in tears? Damn it.

551
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,366
Just know that I won't
be working at all today.

552
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,410
I have a right to have the day off. Bye.

553
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:01,414
-Asking you is our right. Please.
-I'll have to close up if you don't help!

554
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,155
Mi-seon, how does fried chicken
and beer sound tonight?

555
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,118
Maybe some other time.
I'd rather rest at home today.

556
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,330
What's gotten into you?
You never say no to fried chicken.

557
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,919
Hey, you don't look so well.

558
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,630
-What?
-Are you sick?

559
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,049
No, I'm just a little tired.

560
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:39,095
Gosh, I guess I should
get you some herbal tonic.

561
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,058
-Hello.
-Yes, welcome.

562
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,228
-You can follow me right away.
-Sure.

563
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:53,025
Thankfully, the nerve damage
was well-treated.

564
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,778
We'll check for any pain,
then get you a crown.

565
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,780
Ms. Pyo, can you make a mold?

566
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,365
Sure.

567
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,468
What should we have today?

568
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,556
A street food diner
opened across the street.

569
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,225
Street food? What are we, kids?

570
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,436
But we get to order various dishes.

571
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,485
Yu Cho-hui?

572
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,695
Yeong-guk?

573
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,577
You guys should go ahead without me.

574
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,495
-I'll be right there.
-Sure.

575
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,749
-You go ahead too.
-I'm fine, though.

576
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,751
Go order our food.

577
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,295
Right. What should I order though?

578
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,881
Tteokbokki with
flour-based rice cakes and a boiled egg.

579
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,927
As for sundae, I only want the middle
part. No liver, only lungs, and gimmari.

580
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,428
-Get going already.
-Sure.

581
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,138
-Wait. Don't pour the sauce.
-Sorry?

582
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,140
Don't pour the sauce on the fritters.

583
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,442
Has it been 15 years?

584
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,738
Yes, but you haven't changed at all.

585
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,949
You're the one who hasn't changed one bit.

586
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,033
Gosh.

587
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,952
What brings you here?

588
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,830
I've been assigned to work
at Cheongjin Elementary School.

589
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,458
I came to introduce myself today,
and I start next week.

590
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,336
Are you staying in Gongjin for good then?

591
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,171
Yes, I already moved here.

592
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,506
I see.

593
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,301
Goodness, look who it is.

594
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,930
What do you mean? It's Mr. Chang.

595
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,182
No, the woman next to him.

596
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,059
Isn't it Yu Cho-hui?

597
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,185
Who's that?

598
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,853
Yeong-guk's first love.

599
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,772
Really?

600
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,775
Yes. Hey, I got to go.

601
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,195
Where are you off to?

602
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,447
Where is she going?

603
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,867
-Have you had lunch?
-I was actually on my way to have it.

604
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,704
Hwa-jeong?

605
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,206
Ms. Yeo went home for a bit.

606
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,792
Really? Why now of all moments?
Okay, see you.

607
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,002
Bye.

608
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,388
Mom.

609
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,933
Why are you making so much food?

610
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,562
What?

611
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,564
No reason.

612
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:41,444
It's nice to have a lot of food
in the house, isn't it?

613
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,204
You're all done, sir.

614
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,583
You can gargle.

615
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,298
I can still feel residue in my mouth.

616
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,635
There's a mirror next to you,
so please check yourself.

617
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,389
I'd rather have you take a look.

618
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,318
All right.

619
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,156
That's it.

620
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,960
Get your hand off her!

621
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,717
You damn bastard.

622
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,885
What?

623
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,553
Let go of me for a second.

624
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:53,474
-Hold on--
-You crazy bastard. How dare you.

625
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,892
What did I do wrong?

626
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,937
Don't think about lying.
I saw it with my own eyes!

627
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,981
What did you see?
That I grabbed her for a second?

628
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,191
Get away!

629
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,651
Hold on.

630
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,279
I just leaned on her a little
since I felt uncomfortable.

631
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,240
There's nothing wrong about it.

632
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,201
Don't you know the difference
between leaning and groping?

633
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,539
A sexual predator like you
should be behind bars.

634
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,582
-Mi-seon, call the police.
-What?

635
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,254
Is this the police?

636
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,674
Yes, this is Yoon Dental Clinic
in Gongjin.

637
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,260
I'm being accused
of sexual harassment right now.

638
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,096
No, I'm the victim here.

639
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,681
Is that so?

640
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,766
Got it. We'll be right there.

641
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,603
-Are we being dispatched?
-It's Yoon Dental Clinic.

642
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,564
-They need us there.
-Yoon Dental Clinic?

643
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,859
Some guy called and said
he was being framed for sexual harassment.

644
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:45,985
What?

645
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,404
I should head over there
to get the full story.

646
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,030
-I'll go with you.
-Stay alert!

647
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,407
-See you later.
-See you.

648
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,247
I've never been so aware
of the word "shameless" before.

649
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,791
How brazen of you
to call the police yourself.

650
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,836
I did nothing wrong,
so let the law decide.

651
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,921
-You did nothing wrong?
-No.

652
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,756
-You did nothing wrong?
-No.

653
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,049
What a lunatic.

654
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,429
Look here, Ms. Yoon Hye-jin.

655
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,515
You may not know this
since you're a newcomer here,

656
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,976
but everyone in Gongjin knows me.

657
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,312
My father owns a concrete business here,

658
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,939
and my uncle is a city councilman.

659
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,566
So what? What about it?

660
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,067
You just opened this clinic.

661
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,696
If people find out
you're accusing an innocent person,

662
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,364
you'll have to close up shop.

663
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,367
Just let him go.

664
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,038
-Are you nuts?
-I'm fine, so don't

665
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,248
make a big deal out of it.

666
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,126
Are you kidding me?
After what he did to you?

667
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,546
I'm fine. It's not like
this is my first time.

668
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:52,009
Which is why I can't let this go.
I'll have him punished, no matter what.

669
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,427
-Right.
-Crazy bastard.

670
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,846
I see she's the smarter one here.

671
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,975
I mean, she's well aware that
she doesn't have the upper hand.

672
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,352
Just think about it.

673
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:05,397
Why would I even bother with a girl
like her? She's not on my level.

674
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,899
You bastard!

675
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,069
-Hye-jin--
-You little… Hey!

676
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,195
Are you all right?

677
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,490
You crazy bitch.

678
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,336
-Are you okay?
-Chief Hong?

679
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,922
So you're okay. That's a relief.

680
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,341
I'm glad you're okay.

681
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,676
Oh my.

682
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,181
Did someone call the police?

683
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,188
Du-sik, are you all right?

684
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,440
-Are you all right?
-Water…

685
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,775
Who made the call?

686
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,860
-Water.
-Hye-jin?

687
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,283
Damn it.

688
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,036
This is so annoying.

689
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,414
Something must be broken.

690
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,375
According to the doctor,
you have minor contusions.

691
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,294
As if one can tell so easily.

692
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,879
Let's see what the CT tells us.

693
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,799
Anyway, I don't intend to settle

694
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,136
and will sue them both for assault.

695
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,887
The police are investigating.

696
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,182
Protocol says you should be
investigated for sexual harassment too.

697
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,936
You were brought here
only because you were in pain, so shut it.

698
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,398
You sure love sexual harassment charges.
There is no evidence.

699
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,359
The victim's testimony can
be evidence in this case.

700
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,653
The law in Korea is a load of crap.

701
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:38,532
Because you listen to gold-diggers,
innocent people like me are victimized.

702
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,825
I told you to shut it.

703
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,370
I should call my lawyer.

704
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,969
Where's my phone?

705
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,105
NORTHERN CHUNG-HO POLICE STATION

706
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,567
How is this fair?

707
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,612
That sick pervert should be arrested,

708
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,614
not us.

709
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:23,786
Also, you should have
separate holding cells for men and women.

710
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,749
Excuse me. Can't you hear me?

711
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,251
Excuse me!

712
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,128
Damn it.

713
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,382
One might think this is your bedroom.

714
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,843
Where I sleep is my home.

715
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,429
You should lie down too.

716
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,974
Are you nuts?
What if someone gets the wrong idea?

717
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,270
Don't just lie there, and do something.

718
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,857
Leave me be.
I'm in the middle of recharging.

719
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,401
But it was your day off today.

720
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,325
How did you know
what was happening at the clinic?

721
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,205
-Lieutenant Kim.
-Chief Hong, do you need anything?

722
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:12,334
This wetsuit is so tight.
Can I change into something else?

723
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,044
It must be suffocating.

724
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,379
Tell me about it.

725
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,922
Would my clothes be all right?

726
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,132
I'd be grateful.

727
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,842
-Then come out here.
-Sure.

728
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:23,345
What the hell?
You pretended not to hear me just now.

729
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,098
Excuse me.

730
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,516
You completely ignored me.

731
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,019
Where are you going?

732
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,355
I'll be right back.
Keep the cell warm for me.

733
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,315
-You changed the lock.
-Yes, we did.

734
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,109
-Don't forget the key.
-Right.

735
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,819
Why are you wearing this anyway?

736
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,363
-Where are you going?
-Isn't the weather hot?

737
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,198
-Did you catch sharks?
-What the hell?

738
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,827
Gosh. Lieutenant Kim,
your taste in clothes

739
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,705
is quite exotic.

740
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,333
It puts me in a good mood
when I change after shifts.

741
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,420
I love how smooth the fabric is.

742
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,923
-Chief Hong.
-I'm thirsty. Got anything to drink?

743
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,384
How about a cup of coffee?

744
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,637
Sounds good. That was adorable.
Don't you have ice in the freezer?

745
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,598
-Of course.
-Chief Hong!

746
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,642
Okay, I hear you.
She wants one too, so make it two.

747
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,935
-Two. Got it.
-Thanks.

748
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,687
-I'm back.
-Hey, you're here.

749
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,814
-Du-sik.
-How's he? I bet he's faking it.

750
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,150
The CT scan shows no damage.

751
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:21,320
Lieutenant, can't we now
release them both…

752
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,238
-I guess it's just the doctor.
-Sure.

753
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,284
Ms. Dentist, get out here
and enjoy some iced coffee.

754
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,371
Why haven't you arrested the pervert?

755
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,833
He's currently in the hospital
and needs two weeks to recover--

756
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,085
-I'm staying.
-What do you mean?

757
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,506
I'm objecting to injustice.

758
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,384
I won't leave
until that prick is arrested too.

759
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,471
Why make life harder for yourself?

760
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:50,849
Hye-jin!

761
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,603
Hye-jin.

762
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,524
-Mi-seon.
-Hey.

763
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,442
Why on earth are you in here?

764
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,402
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

765
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,572
I'm fine. What about you?

766
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,325
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

767
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:12,329
Why are you apologizing?
You didn't do anything wrong.

768
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,456
I tried to put up with it--

769
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,544
Nonsense! You should've told me sooner.

770
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:23,131
If I had known, I wouldn't have
kept leaving you with that pervert.

771
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:27,302
I know you went through a lot
to open the clinic.

772
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,513
You're in the red,

773
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,558
but you still gave me my paycheck
and a bonus.

774
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,352
Your clinic was finally running smoothly.

775
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,355
I was afraid it might be all ruined
if I told you.

776
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,732
None of that is important!

777
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,736
You should've told me. I'm your friend.

778
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,116
You must've been so scared, Mi-seon.

779
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,077
I'm so sorry.

780
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,832
No, I should be the one apologizing.

781
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:00,294
No, I'm the one who let you down.

782
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:08,051
I'll make sure
that the bastard is behind bars, Mi-seon.

783
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,221
That freaking bastard!

784
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,436
Guys, the door is open, you know.

785
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,024
You can come out.

786
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,492
-Hey.
-Ms. Gam-ri, what brings you by?

787
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:37,539
Well, I came to report lost property.

788
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,587
You see, I found this
on the floor of the dental clinic.

789
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,922
Doesn't it belong to that guy?

790
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,091
Here.

791
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,346
Wait. He did say he lost his phone.

792
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,813
I see you're reading a comic book.

793
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,274
What? What are you doing here?

794
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,901
I'm here to see how you're doing.

795
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,571
Don't you remember?
We went to middle school together.

796
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:14,451
The deep blue energy of the East Sea

797
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,995
Flows within us

798
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,539
The assailant shouldn't visit the victim.

799
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,501
You must've hurt your brain
when I beat you up.

800
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,379
You're the assailant here.
A sick sexual predator.

801
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,424
Assault and falsely accusing someone
without any proof?

802
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,886
Proof? I have it somewhere.

803
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,555
Wait. Where did I put it?

804
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,684
Where did I put it?

805
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,811
You sure are a crazy bastard.

806
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,063
Here it is.

807
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,565
Where did you get that?

808
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,234
A fairy godmother gave it to me.

809
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,069
Bullshit. Give it back.

810
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,823
Why? Does it make you
anxious that I have it?

811
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,158
-What's in it?
-Give it back!

812
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,284
Give it back.

813
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,163
What--

814
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,624
Wait, that hurts. Let go!

815
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,917
-Should I let go?
-Yes!

816
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,836
-Would you if you were me?
-Let go of me!

817
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,421
Let's wait here a bit

818
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,631
-until your warrant is served.
-What?

819
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:13,218
You took so many photos
that your phone memory's full.

820
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,512
You dirty little Peeping Tom.

821
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,974
Wait! Okay, fine.
Let go of me so we can talk. It hurts.

822
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,601
-Does it hurt? A lot?
-It does. Yes!

823
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:26,481
If that hurts,
can you imagine how hurt your victims are?

824
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,110
Just you wait.
I'll make sure you pay for what you did.

825
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,530
What's it to you?
Why are you so hellbent on this?

826
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:36,908
Do you have something going on
with one of those women?

827
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:40,412
That's right. There's something huge
going on between us.

828
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,998
Really? Wait, that hurts!

829
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:46,001
You chose the wrong people to mess with.

830
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,253
Fine. Just let me go first. Hold on!

831
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,921
-Cut your hair.
-Fine, I will.

832
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,548
You never shut up.

833
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,759
I'll cut my hair.
I will as soon as you let go.

834
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,302
Okay, hold still.

835
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,553
I tapped out. Let me go.

836
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,013
-You tapped out?
-Let go.

837
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,148
I hear Chief Hong
caught a Peeping Tom yesterday.

838
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,691
So I heard.

839
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,360
No wonder he's the hero of Gongjin.

840
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,654
He's like Superman and Iron Man
wrapped into one.

841
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,115
-Mr. Ban, what about me then?
-Sorry?

842
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,161
If Chief Hong is everyone's fixer,
what am I in this town?

843
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,496
Mr. Chang…

844
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,208
Where do you think you're going?

845
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,881
-Cho-hui?
-Hi, I'm here to register my move.

846
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:36,218
I see. I'm glad you're here.

847
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,220
That way. Come with me.

848
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,138
-Come on.
-Okay.

849
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,644
Hwa-jeong, why aren't you
picking up your phone?

850
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,562
What? What's this about?

851
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:51,107
I saw someone yesterday, you see.

852
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,275
Who?

853
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,492
RESIDENT REGISTRATION

854
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,119
RESIDENT: 1 PERSON

855
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,664
Wait.

856
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,667
Are you still single?
Didn't you get married?

857
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,127
I never got around to doing it.

858
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,799
I see.

859
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,802
So you're single. You aren't…

860
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,389
I heard you got married though.

861
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,599
Me? Well…

862
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,646
I did but I'm single now.

863
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,356
I'm completely on my own now.

864
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,567
You and Hwa-jeong got divorced?

865
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,486
My goodness.

866
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,871
So this must be the front row seat.

867
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,247
Your wife is here. Hello.

868
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,665
Hey, jerk!

869
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,753
I told you not to call her that anymore.

870
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:57,924
I guess I'll always be your wife to him.

871
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,596
-Hwa-jeong.
-Goodness, it's been so long.

872
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,640
Did you move here?

873
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,850
Yes.

874
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,810
Have you been well?

875
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,771
Yes. Although not all the time.

876
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,443
You haven't changed a bit.
You're still so pretty.

877
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,329
-Mr. Ban.
-Yes?

878
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,498
Ms. Yeo is here to get the garbage bags.

879
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,208
Please take her to them.

880
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,419
Got it. Ms. Yeo, this way.

881
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,463
-I'm coming.
-Good.

882
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:43,678
Let's take it outside.

883
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,098
Hold on. Why are they leaving?

884
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,726
Please sign here.

885
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,564
Here you go.

886
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,733
Have a good day.

887
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,654
Hey, Hwa-jeong.

888
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,280
They went out together.

889
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,724
Gosh, they don't fit.

890
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,816
We're set for a month.

891
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,611
Let me see.

892
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,989
Hwa-jeong, my gosh.

893
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,548
I'm going out to pick up a sandwich
for lunch. What would you like?

894
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,966
I'll go with you.

895
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:06,094
No, it's fine. Do what you were doing.
It's only around the corner.

896
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,930
Are you sure? Then I'll have the same one.

897
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,432
Wheat bread, roast chicken,

898
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,893
mozzarella cheese, minus pickles,
but with lots of sliced olives. Right?

899
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,356
A good best friend is worth
ten boyfriends. I'll be right back.

900
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:19,983
Mi-seon.

901
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,484
Yes?

902
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:25,030
From now on, whatever happens,
don't hide it from me.

903
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,908
Friends are supposed
to have each other's backs.

904
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,744
Pyo Mi-seon.

905
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,247
You're the only friend I have, you know.

906
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,206
I know that.

907
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,752
Get going then.

908
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,253
Get me the same!

909
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,436
Ms. Pyo!

910
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:02,442
"Serving the people
are the warm, trustworthy police."

911
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,613
That's our catchphrase.

912
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,283
Calling 112 will surely be faster,

913
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,995
but have this with you, just in case.

914
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,044
CHOI EUN-CHEOL

915
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,798
And if anything like that happens again,

916
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,093
don't try to endure it on your own.

917
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:31,888
Have a good day.

918
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,273
DOCTOR YOON HYE-JIN

919
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,238
He admitted to his crimes

920
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:52,617
and will be investigated soon
by the Women Sex Crime Unit.

921
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,202
I thought you should know.

922
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:02,877
Come to think of it,
I never thanked him properly.

923
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,592
I guess I could just leave it here.

924
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:18,935
This wine wasn't easy to get.

925
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,728
I guess the fruit will do.

926
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,690
No.

927
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,734
I should repay him properly.

928
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:34,993
This is killing me.

929
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,830
I bet it's really good.

930
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,458
It's so hard to let go.

931
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,128
I hear it's spicy, fragrant,

932
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,421
-and sweet.
-What's up?

933
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,755
My gosh!

934
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,659
I enjoyed the monologue.

935
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,078
I felt so many emotions
in such a short time.

936
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,498
It was so hard to get the wine.
That's why.

937
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,502
You must've wanted it so bad that you
agreed to drink it together right away.

938
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,213
Your place is really nice.

939
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,965
I thought it'd be a stinky bachelor pad.

940
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:34,135
Don't judge a book by its cover.
That's being prejudiced.

941
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:38,640
Why do you have so many books and records?

942
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,601
I collected them
hoping they'd be worth a lot someday.

943
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:45,772
I see. It may seem fancy,
but it's actually a junk collection.

944
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,691
Junk? Unbelievable.

945
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,612
What?

946
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,699
I saw this photo at the photo studio.

947
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,159
Is this you?

948
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,370
Yes.

949
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,873
I see.

950
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,960
Is the old man your grandfather?

951
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,462
Yes. He passed away
when I was in middle school.

952
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,841
What about the rest of your family?

953
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,009
I have no one.

954
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,761
No one?

955
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,555
My parents died when I was six,

956
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,889
so I live here alone.

957
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,059
Sorry.

958
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,729
You don't have to be.
Can you fetch the glasses?

959
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:27,689
Sure.

960
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:39,492
You made all this just now?

961
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,452
It's not much.

962
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,082
It seems like
it'll pair well with the wine.

963
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,335
This particular wine

964
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,630
is from the Rhône region
in Southern France.

965
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,634
Since it's a vintage wine,
it should be decanted…

966
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,472
Let me explain what decanting is.

967
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,851
You pour wine into another vessel
without disturbing the sediment--

968
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,813
Old wine like this may
lose the scent if you decant it.

969
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,940
I uncorked it as soon as we got in.

970
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,526
-Are you well-versed in wine?
-No.

971
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,445
It's just something I picked up.

972
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:19,115
I see. Hand it over then.
Let me pour you a glass.

973
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:21,868
Hear that?

974
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:25,955
Gosh.

975
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,586
Just a second.

976
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,048
When drinking wine,

977
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,218
you should first enjoy it
by breathing in its scent.

978
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:45,099
Like this. Then, sip the wine
while letting in air as well.

979
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:47,894
Here.

980
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,189
Seriously?

981
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,524
That's gross. What are you doing?

982
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:01,532
You should lower your head to close
your airway and then breathe in the air.

983
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,160
It was a mistake. Gosh, that stings.

984
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,703
Stop that and just drink it.

985
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:09,457
You might sneeze
the expensive wine out of your nose.

986
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,421
Can you stop that already?

987
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,299
Gosh.

988
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,514
That's how you do it.

989
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:26,891
Give it a go.

990
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,232
Hello. Come on in.

991
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,858
Yes, hello.

992
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,318
Please sit anywhere you want.

993
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,404
Okay. JUNE, where do you want to sit?

994
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,365
-By the window.
-Sure thing.

995
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,830
You were quite the singer.

996
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,667
I only sang because Chun-jae asked.

997
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,129
So…

998
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,716
will you sing for me if I ask?

999
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,969
-Go home already.
-We didn't finish the wine.

1000
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,647
You seemed close with the police officers.

1001
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:19,068
You were practically at home
at the station.

1002
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,446
Have you been there often?

1003
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,197
I guess you can say that.

1004
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,700
-So you were a troublemaker.
-Not like that.

1005
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,910
I've won the Brave Citizen Award twice.

1006
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,620
-Really?
-Yes.

1007
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:34,041
I once caught
a purse snatcher on the street.

1008
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,376
Stop!

1009
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:51,017
And this other time, I saved a drunk
old man sleeping on the train tracks.

1010
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,562
Sir!

1011
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,242
That's courageous of you.

1012
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,120
How did you manage to jump on the tracks?

1013
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,414
I didn't think. My body just reacted.

1014
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,834
Does anyone appreciate it though?
I bet there wasn't any reward.

1015
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:17,919
I got a million won.

1016
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:20,046
I bought a new fridge
for the senior center.

1017
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:24,091
You should be generous
only when you're financially stable.

1018
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,636
You barely make a living.

1019
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,722
Don't worry about me,
and drink your wine. Here.

1020
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,811
I guess how you live your life
is none of my business.

1021
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:47,782
We're out of wine.

1022
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,169
That I can't offer you,
but I do have some whiskey.

1023
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,927
Ju-ri, can you get this
to those customers?

1024
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,470
-I'm good, Dad.
-Well, I'm not.

1025
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,806
I have something else on the stove.
Now, hurry.

1026
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,516
-Be careful.
-Come on.

1027
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,809
Help your dad out.

1028
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:17,478
He can't do anything properly, seriously.

1029
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,483
Here. Your food's here.

1030
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,693
Thank you.

1031
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,037
Enjoy.

1032
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,330
Thank you.

1033
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:44,130
God, he must've put so much effort
to look like JUNE.

1034
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:48,092
Ju-ri, you almost fell for a copycat.

1035
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,344
Jeez, he gives me the creeps.

1036
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,975
Let's eat. Dig in.

1037
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,019
Check this out.

1038
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,315
It must be because we're by the sea.
Look at the size of the seafood.

1039
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,566
This shrimp is huge.

1040
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,484
You're right.

1041
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:07,486
Dig in.

1042
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:10,990
JUNE, I guess you should work even harder.

1043
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,493
People don't even recognize you,

1044
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:16,662
so will this show survive?

1045
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,289
I think it'll tank.

1046
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:21,459
We'll still get paid though.
Can I order a pajeon too?

1047
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:22,668
Go ahead.

1048
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,712
-Sir.
-Yes?

1049
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,384
Are you already drunk?
I thought you could hold your liquor.

1050
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,679
I'm not drunk.

1051
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:40,311
It just feels like I'm on clouds.

1052
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:44,190
You'll soon fly in the sky then.

1053
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:49,654
I never get drunk if I can help it.

1054
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,280
Why not?

1055
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,115
Because I hate it.

1056
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,202
Being out of it,

1057
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,413
being vulnerable,

1058
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,624
and being more honest.

1059
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:07,380
When I feel close to being drunk,

1060
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:13,219
I clench my fists tight like so.

1061
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,974
You live an exhausting life,
with such small fists.

1062
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,727
-I have a big fist.
-Here.

1063
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:36,409
Don't you get lonely living here alone?

1064
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:42,164
That has never occurred to me
since the people here are like family.

1065
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,792
How long have you been living in Gongjin?

1066
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:46,585
Since birth.

1067
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,422
Have you ever left this place?

1068
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,174
I have.

1069
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,427
When?

1070
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,098
You told me not to cross the line,

1071
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:01,350
but you ask so many questions.

1072
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:04,353
Right.

1073
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,106
What's with me today?

1074
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,525
I'm usually not like this.

1075
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,403
You don't seem to know yourself that well.

1076
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,032
Maybe I'm fascinated by you.

1077
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:19,118
We're from two different worlds.

1078
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:23,247
If a penguin from Antarctica
met a polar bear from the North,

1079
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,790
would it feel this way?

1080
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,668
They're both from
freezing climates though.

1081
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,211
Right, of course.

1082
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,840
Well, I guess opposites attract.

1083
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:38,637
Okay. You can ask me just one question.

1084
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,515
I'll answer it this one time.

1085
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,268
I don't have any questions.

1086
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,650
I've got one.

1087
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,111
Why did you come to Gongjin?

1088
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,659
And don't say you came here
to open a dental clinic to make money.

1089
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,121
If that was the case,
it didn't have to be Gongjin.

1090
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,832
My face is red, isn't it?

1091
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,002
It's so hot in here. Maybe I'm drunk.

1092
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,465
Don't answer if you don't want to.

1093
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,389
That day.

1094
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:26,519
The day I came to Gongjin…

1095
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,272
was my mom's birthday.

1096
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,445
It's sad

1097
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:42,409
how your birthday gets erased after
you die and only the day you died remains.

1098
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:52,962
It feels like the fact that my mom
even existed has been slowly fading away.

1099
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:01,303
If she had been alive,
she would've turned 60 that day.

1100
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:09,895
I would've gone on many trips with her

1101
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:14,108
and bought her expensive purses.

1102
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,779
Actually, no.

1103
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,491
Just a meal together
would've been nice enough.

1104
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,789
Before she died,

1105
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,251
we went on a family trip

1106
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,670
to Gongjin.

1107
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:47,099
What am I doing?

1108
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:50,144
I must be drunk.

1109
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,022
My face is burning up.

1110
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,774
I think I have a mild fever.

1111
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,238
Is my face red?

1112
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,635
It's so hot.

1113
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,682
Hey, Ms. Gam-ri.

1114
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:12,142
Chief Hong, where are you now?

1115
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,936
Why? What's wrong?

1116
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,772
There's a commotion at the dentist's.

1117
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,610
Chief Hong wouldn't budge
no matter how much I begged.

1118
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,863
-Tell me about it. He didn't even listen.
-I know.

1119
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:28,200
What did I tell you?
Chief Hong has one rule in life.

1120
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,829
He works when he wants
and has fun when he feels like it.

1121
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:34,248
The man may bend backwards for everyone,

1122
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:36,625
but he never works on his day off.

1123
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,172
He runs that hard on his day off?

1124
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,340
I take it back.

1125
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,757
There are three mysteries in Gongjin.

1126
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,717
Just eat as casually as possible.

1127
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,927
-The two slept together?
-Gosh.

1128
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:32,514
How can you pair Du-sik with the dentist?

1129
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:34,516
I'm a doctor.
I graduated dentistry school.

1130
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,018
Chief Hong is from
Seoul National University.

1131
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:38,270
Why does my ear itch so much?

1132
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,525
-Actually, I'm…
-You must be a mukbang Youtuber.

1133
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:47,446
-What?
-I think I blacked out yesterday.

1134
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:48,989
But when you blacked out,

1135
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,158
-did it become rated R?
-Hey!

1136
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:54,286
So anyway, did anything happen yesterday?

1137
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,371
Well…

1138
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:57,915
A lot happened.

1139
01:12:57,998 --> 01:13:03,003
