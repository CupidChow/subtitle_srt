1
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,487
One, two, three.

2
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,199
That was cool.

3
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,161
What is this?

4
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,788
Open wide.

5
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,305
I couldn't be happier.

6
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,641
I'm happy too.

7
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,031
Hye-jin.

8
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,368
Hye-jin?

9
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,136
You're happy?

10
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,057
Do you think you deserve to be happy?

11
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,627
Chief Hong.

12
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,046
Chief Hong?

13
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,389
What's wrong?

14
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,350
Was it a nightmare?

15
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,268
Yes, a nightmare.

16
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,604
A very bad one.

17
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,565
Goodness.

18
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,984
Were you scared by a nightmare?

19
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,489
It's all right. They say nightmares
are signs that you'll grow taller.

20
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,616
What time is it?

21
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,786
About 4:30 a.m.

22
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,747
What?

23
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,542
Why are you here so early?
Is something up?

24
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,464
EPISODE 12

25
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,632
No way.

26
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,218
The sun has already risen?

27
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,804
Yes, see how bright it is.

28
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:27,976
Damn it. I wanted
to watch the sunrise with you.

29
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,646
The forecast said we'd have a clear sky.

30
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,148
Weather by the shore
is always unpredictable.

31
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,317
What's with the sudden urge
to see the sunrise?

32
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,361
I just wanted to.

33
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,739
-Shall we come again tomorrow?
-Again? Tomorrow?

34
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,575
Yes, let's come here every morning

35
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,995
until we finally see a clear sunrise.

36
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,830
Hold on. Look over there.

37
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:52,500
Can't you see the sun behind the clouds?

38
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,252
Where?

39
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,462
Open your eyes wide and look carefully.

40
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,507
Don't you see reddish colors spreading?

41
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:00,925
I don't.

42
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,095
You need to focus
as if you're looking at autostereograms.

43
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,680
Look.

44
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,515
I really don't see it.

45
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,147
I knew there wasn't anything there!

46
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,858
No, look. Right over there.

47
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,694
-You can't see a thing!
-Look.

48
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,323
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

49
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,915
What are you working so hard on?

50
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,210
Well, it's this.

51
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,254
Ta-da.

52
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,675
What's this? "100 Things
I Want to Do with My Boyfriend"?

53
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,886
A bucket list.

54
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,723
Seriously? No one makes
lists like this these days.

55
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,558
-What?
-And in Excel?

56
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:55,438
You know how I give it my best and
then some when starting a new thing.

57
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,065
Besides, it's fun.

58
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,943
But you're missing
the most important thing.

59
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,195
What's that?

60
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,449
Going all the way.

61
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,951
Gosh, you're gross.

62
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,578
Go all the way.

63
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,872
Come on. Stop saying that.

64
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,960
You know, we're trying to
get to know each other very slowly.

65
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,213
Connecting our souls comes first.

66
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,173
That's ridiculous.

67
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:26,177
The end goal
to a romantic relationship is lovemaking.

68
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,263
Platonic love has nothing on eros.

69
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,973
Unbelievable.

70
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,101
-Is anybody here?
-Coming!

71
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,563
She can be such a pervert sometimes.

72
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,735
Eros?

73
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,030
DRYING EACH OTHER'S HAIR,
BEING UNDER THE SAME UMBRELLA…

74
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,663
Ms. Yeo!

75
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:59,460
Goodness, Bo-ra. Do you have no homework
today? Why are you so excited?

76
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,837
No, that's not it.

77
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,006
I-jun won a prize!

78
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,216
What?

79
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,426
Goodness.

80
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,681
Let me see.

81
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,101
I won the silver prize
at the mathematics competition.

82
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,603
I can see that.

83
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,940
Chang I-jun in Class One, Grade Two
of Cheongjin Elementary School.

84
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,318
My son, Chang I-jun. This is amazing!

85
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,904
I-jun, you did great.

86
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,656
I'm proud of you.

87
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,410
I-jun, aren't you happy
about winning this prize?

88
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,454
I am.

89
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,957
Ms. Yeo, this is I-jun being really happy.

90
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,793
His mouth is usually…

91
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,213
like this.

92
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,550
But now, the corners
of his lips are slightly raised.

93
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,846
Is that so? I-jun, did you tell your dad?

94
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,141
-No.
-Then tell him yourself.

95
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,268
I'll video call him for you.

96
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,200
Gosh.

97
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,368
Have you lost your mind?

98
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,913
Why are you spooking me
with a video call--

99
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,209
Hey, I-jun! It's Dad.

100
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,880
Did you ask your mom
to make a video call for you?

101
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,009
Dad, I won a prize
at the mathematics competition.

102
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:34,514
What? You won a prize
at the mathematics competition?

103
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:39,435
My gosh.
I must've given birth to a genius!

104
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,731
-I'm the one who gave birth to him.
-Well, I contributed.

105
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,983
Watch your mouth in front of him.

106
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,321
Anyway, make some time this weekend
for I-jun's party.

107
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,157
Right. Of course.

108
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,161
I-jun, we'll get together this weekend
and have a feast. Okay?

109
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,955
Sure.

110
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,916
Good going, my boy. I'll see you then!

111
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,670
Ms. Yeo, look at him.
You can see that he's smiling.

112
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,587
Yes, I see.

113
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,298
No, I'm not.

114
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,925
Yes, you are.

115
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,594
The smile's even bigger now.

116
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,555
My gosh.

117
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,931
Mr. Chang!

118
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,560
Yong-hun, hear this. I-jun won a prize

119
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,687
at the mathematics competition.

120
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,398
That's great! You must be so proud of him.

121
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,109
Let me reward you
for having a great son then.

122
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,610
What? How?

123
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,946
They say it's good for the joints.

124
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,075
You had it rough
when you pulled your back a while ago.

125
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:36,993
Gosh.

126
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,795
Hold on. Why are you
giving me this though?

127
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,464
Just go ahead and try it first.

128
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,225
Do you already feel better?

129
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,268
I get it.

130
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,771
I know why you're doing this.

131
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,190
What do you mean?

132
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,527
This is because of
the Best Employee Award, right?

133
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,576
You idiot. I'm not the one
who decides who gets it.

134
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,121
The residents will vote on it.
How stupid can you be?

135
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,831
You got me.

136
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,585
Still, make sure you drink these.

137
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,757
Guys, my I-jun…

138
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,395
Chief Hong, how about a cup of coffee?

139
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,605
Sounds good.

140
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,315
-I'll go get it.
-Sure.

141
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,199
You're a life-saver, Chief Hong.

142
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,326
-Nonsense.
-Will you help for a few more days?

143
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,745
Of course. One shouldn't
bother picking up a saw

144
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,122
if he's not going to
at least build a table.

145
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,418
Are you throwing those out?

146
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,836
Yes, that's right.

147
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,215
What a waste. Some of them
even have growth ring patterns.

148
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,888
Chief Hong!

149
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,724
You're home!

150
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,935
You came in without permission again?

151
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,728
Pay rent if you'll keep doing it.

152
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,438
Maybe I will.

153
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,690
Anyway, go wash up.

154
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,569
Wash up?

155
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,405
-Yes.
-Why?

156
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,824
There's something we must do today.

157
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,136
Is this what you meant?

158
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,513
Yes, through couples yoga,

159
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,975
we can build intimacy
and enhance our flexibility.

160
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,519
I bet it's ended a few relationships.

161
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,772
It's tough, that's all.

162
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,609
Unbelievable.

163
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,153
Fine.

164
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,156
-Next pose.
-Could we please stop?

165
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,950
-Our knees--
-But I'm exhausted.

166
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,495
Bend your knees
and let the soles of our feet meet.

167
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,997
You're completely ignoring me.

168
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,207
That's it. Then we look
each other in the eye.

169
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,877
-Right.
-Now, grab my wrists.

170
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,129
-Like this?
-Hold my wrists

171
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,881
and gradually straighten this leg.

172
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,008
-One, two, three!
-Straighten my leg?

173
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,511
No, I can't! God, it hurts!

174
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,847
This is just wrong.

175
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,682
I just pulled something.

176
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,018
-You pulled something?
-It hurts like crazy.

177
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,437
There. Now it's back to normal.

178
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,775
All right, fine.
Sit with your legs crossed next.

179
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,154
And face me.

180
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,490
Is this another yoga pose?

181
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,950
Yes. We'll meditate.

182
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,537
Place your hands on your knees.

183
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,416
Close your eyes
and focus on your breathing.

184
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,460
This is my favorite pose.

185
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,802
You look so much like a dog.

186
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,725
-A dog?
-That's right. A big one.

187
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:33,020
With your fair skin and double eyelids.

188
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,438
Like a countryside mutt.

189
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,148
Oh, that kind of dog.

190
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,610
Meanwhile, you're more like a cat,

191
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:43,280
but there are hints of a dog too.
You're mixed in between.

192
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,658
Am I a "cat-dog" then?

193
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,579
-Right.
-You're killing me.

194
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,122
Look at your adorable dimple.

195
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,543
You also have dimples too.

196
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,462
Yours are deeper.

197
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,715
Yours are cuter and deeper.

198
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,801
Gosh.

199
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,901
I haven't brushed my teeth.

200
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,152
I don't care.

201
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,698
Let's brush our teeth.

202
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,075
-Together?
-Yes.

203
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,080
We'll do it together?

204
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,084
Wait, my knee really hurts.

205
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,091
-I have a question.
-Okay.

206
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,926
What on earth are we doing?

207
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,762
What do you mean?
We're brushing our teeth.

208
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,516
I know, but why are you
brushing my teeth for me?

209
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,809
Isn't this romantic?

210
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,811
This? How so?

211
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,187
You just don't know yet.

212
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,274
Once we get used to it,
it'll be as sweet as strawberries.

213
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,527
Since we're at it,

214
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,196
let's do it properly. Here.

215
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,493
Hey, you're getting it all over!

216
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,495
Well, my gums are bleeding.

217
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,789
My gosh, Chief Hong.

218
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,208
No wonder I was getting a bitter taste.

219
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,669
You've been making me
bleed often these days.

220
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,712
Sorry.

221
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,089
No, that's enough.

222
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,426
Don't you dare propose
anything weird like this again. Stop.

223
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,928
No way.

224
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,306
Ouch, ouch, does your teeth hurt?

225
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,767
-Orange candy--
-That's enough.

226
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,436
Come on. Clean teeth are key to longevity.

227
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,563
-Really?
-How adorable.

228
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,108
-No way.
-Chief Hong, please try this on.

229
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,235
-I don't want to.
-Won't it be cute?

230
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,821
-Take a look.
-Where do you get these things?

231
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,281
Okay, fine. Give it here.

232
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,703
There's nothing I can do.
It's up there now.

233
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,248
-Try it on just once.
-Seriously?

234
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,834
-Please try it on.
-But I don't want to!

235
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,169
I really don't want to.

236
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,337
You're so annoying.

237
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,093
There's no need to get upset though.

238
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,511
-Will you put it on?
-No.

239
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,641
Hold on. Just give me a second.

240
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,645
Wait. You can't take it just yet.

241
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,279
Putting makeup on a pumpkin?

242
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,031
Did you call me a pumpkin?

243
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,869
I mean, I find pumpkins
just so round and adorable.

244
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,123
You're already so pretty.
This will make you even prettier.

245
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,000
You have no idea.

246
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,169
I'm sure Ju-ri will speak
casually to me tomorrow.

247
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,421
"Hi, Hye-jin."

248
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,464
She'll think I'm her age!

249
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,219
She speaks casually
to everyone in Gongjin.

250
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,762
You're right.

251
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,514
-I'll apply some on you too.
-No way.

252
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,683
-Why not?
-Let's take the photo.

253
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,686
Get ready in one, two, three.

254
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,230
One, two, three.

255
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,275
I must ask. What's with that sound?

256
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,776
-It's fun.
-Okay, I love it.

257
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,194
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

258
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,238
One, two, three.

259
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,406
Yippy.

260
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,746
See? It looks nothing
like that old TV show.

261
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,915
We look great in this one. Cute, right?

262
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

263
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,544
Are you all right?

264
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,838
A middle schooler can handle it.

265
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,922
It's cute.

266
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,550
-The photos are cute.
-They are.

267
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,054
What else should we do?
Buy groceries and cook?

268
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,139
Read comic books?

269
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,600
What are you? A long-lasting battery?

270
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,727
Do you run on batteries? Let me see.

271
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,644
Are you tired?

272
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,523
I surely am.

273
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,734
Why don't we do nothing?

274
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,820
We'll sit here and rest.

275
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,866
Is there nothing you wish to do with me?

276
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,160
What? I didn't mean it like that.

277
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,162
I'm going home.

278
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,790
Come on. Don't go.

279
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,000
-No, I'm heading home. Bye.
-Hey.

280
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,418
What's this?

281
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,173
-Give that back.
-"See the sunrise together,

282
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,092
couples yoga, give boyfriend a shave,

283
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,802
-go to restaurants--"
-Give it back.

284
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,805
You wanted to do all these with me?

285
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,224
You even marked the ones we already did.

286
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,101
Forget it. Just give it back.

287
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,020
Let's do all of them.

288
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,773
What?

289
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,236
How can I not cave in
when you're this cute?

290
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,029
-Really?
-Yes.

291
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,367
What should we do first?
Should we do them from top to bottom?

292
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,205
Wait, not today.

293
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,000
How about we go on a date
to Seoul next weekend?

294
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,669
A date?

295
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,087
Yes, a date.

296
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,797
Let's go.

297
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,507
-Really?
-Sure.

298
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,469
Brace yourself because
we'll be ticking a lot off the list.

299
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,555
Prepare yourself.

300
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,891
You can take your time, you know.

301
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,852
Don't rush it.

302
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:10,399
Let's do everything on the list from top
to bottom together for a long time.

303
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,109
Sounds good.

304
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,243
Like this and like that.

305
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,079
There.

306
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,457
Thanks, Dad.

307
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,294
I-jun, eat your fill.

308
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,754
Order more if you want.
It'll be my treat today.

309
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,965
You talk big when it's just tonkatsu.

310
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,467
It's called pork cutlet.

311
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,679
Besides, I-jun ordered it,

312
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,182
unlike you who had to
order expensive steak.

313
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,683
So? Does it feel like a waste?

314
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,226
I didn't say that.

315
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,896
Just get eating.

316
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,860
Mom.

317
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,696
Yes, I-jun.
Is there something you'd like to say?

318
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,990
Can I have a pet hedgehog?

319
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,283
A hedgehog?

320
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,328
Gosh, I-jun. Do you want a hedgehog?

321
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,331
Yes, Dr. Yoon has been taking care

322
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,791
of the hedgehog Bo-ra adopted.

323
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,169
I was going to ask Mom for permission

324
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,545
once I won the prize.

325
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,796
I see.

326
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,675
Sure thing. We'll do it.
Bring the hedgehog home.

327
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,552
-Really?
-Of course.

328
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:25,641
But I-jun, know that I'm not allowing it
because you won a prize.

329
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,060
It's because you want it, that's all.

330
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,689
We're not having a party
because you won a prize either.

331
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,777
What are you saying?
I thought that's what this is for.

332
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,736
We're not.

333
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,449
I-jun, I'm so proud
that you won the prize.

334
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,410
But we would be still doing this
even if you hadn't.

335
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,706
What we're celebrating
is the fact that you worked hard.

336
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,252
To me, that's more important
than the prize itself.

337
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,962
I understand, Mom.

338
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:01,176
That's right, I-jun.
You don't have to get good grades.

339
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,138
All I want is for you
to have a happy childhood.

340
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,683
Says the man
who told the whole neighborhood.

341
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,351
I hear you told Yong-hun.

342
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,770
That's because I was proud…

343
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,605
How do you know that though?

344
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,400
Just eat the damn food.

345
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,484
The damn food?

346
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,445
-Did you just say "damn"?
-I didn't.

347
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,406
-You just said--
-Sorry.

348
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,490
"Sorry"?

349
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,118
-Is it good?
-It is.

350
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,496
Is it good? Really? Then eat your fill.

351
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,832
Eat as much as you want.

352
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,587
-Hye-jin.
-Hello.

353
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,965
-Are you going to work?
-Yes.

354
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,176
You two must be here to shoot the show.

355
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,013
Yes, we made it here early.

356
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:50,600
It's so hot these days, so be careful
with heat stroke. Both of you.

357
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,060
I will. Thanks.

358
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,646
I'll get going then.

359
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,732
Have a good day,
and don't skip your meals.

360
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,817
-Right. You too.
-See you.

361
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,277
-Bye.
-Have a good day.

362
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,585
Dr. Yoon!

363
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,504
Hi, kids. You must be off to school.

364
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:24,634
Yes. But you know what? I-jun won a prize
at the mathematics competition.

365
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,596
Really? Congratulations.

366
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,017
So Bo-ra wasn't kidding about
you acing 100 tests.

367
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,727
Thank you.

368
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,396
I still lack in many ways though,

369
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,274
so I'll keep
applying myself to my studies.

370
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,650
You'll apply yourself?

371
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,403
Anyway, his mom said
he could raise Seumseum at home.

372
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,323
Really? When will you take it home then?

373
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,166
What is it? Are you sad to see it go?

374
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,543
A little.

375
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,840
But I can't possibly fight with kids
over a hedgehog.

376
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,593
I was only its temporary guardian,

377
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,137
and I'm sure they'll take good care of it.

378
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,100
Besides, Seumseum

379
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,645
still raises its quills
when I try to touch it.

380
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,148
Come to think of it,
you're no longer like a hedgehog.

381
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,317
What?

382
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,362
I mean, you used to raise
your sharp quills.

383
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:29,783
But you don't raise them anymore
even when I pat you.

384
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,910
That's not funny.

385
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,580
You've changed a lot.

386
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,292
You're not the same person you used to be.

387
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,964
-How have I changed?
-What?

388
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,841
Do I look different?

389
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,885
Well, what I meant is--

390
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,513
Gosh, I'm tired.
The kids must be here. I'll get it.

391
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,640
-But I--
-Wait, I should take this with me.

392
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,602
Seumseum doesn't like it when it's cold.

393
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,147
The ideal temperature is 26°C,

394
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,232
so always spread the blanket under it.

395
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:06,027
Bo-ra and I-jun must be happy
to have a new friend.

396
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,573
You have no idea, Uncle Du-sik.
I'll hang out at I-jun's place every day.

397
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,741
You already do.

398
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,411
Whatever. I'll still come over every day.

399
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,414
Sure.

400
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,126
We'll come by your place
with Seumseum often as well.

401
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:25,672
Okay. Come by Uncle Du-sik's though.

402
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,466
It has become my den these days.

403
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,511
What, are you forming a group now?

404
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,431
Come over if you want.
I'll make something delicious.

405
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,475
I'd appreciate assorted tripe
and pork rinds.

406
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,393
Noted.

407
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,440
I see you don't have the palate
of a regular second grader.

408
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,526
Bo-ra's one to enjoy byproducts.

409
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,154
I see. How commendable.

410
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,699
-So everyone is here.
-Yes.

411
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,870
First, thank you all for attending
the emergency neighborhood meeting.

412
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,330
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

413
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,791
What's so urgent that you had
to gather all these busy people?

414
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:05,003
If you hadn't interrupted,
we'd be done by now.

415
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,215
What is it, then?
The curiosity is killing me.

416
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,383
Exactly. What's going on?

417
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:15,013
It's just that Director Ji
asked for a favor.

418
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,848
-What?
-Director Ji?

419
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,769
For the next episode,
we're hoping to treat the village elders

420
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,062
to a meal.

421
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,396
-A meal?
-Yes.

422
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,525
JUNE and In-u will cook themselves, and
we're thinking of inviting five people.

423
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,610
-Five?
-Yes.

424
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,488
And JUNE wants Ms. Gam-ri
to be one of them.

425
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,281
He enjoyed her meal last time.

426
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,618
I love how the young man thinks.

427
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,870
Tell me about it. Anyway, could you decide

428
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,206
on the other four
that are suitable for TV?

429
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,916
Four? Sure thing.

430
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,797
Anyway, that's why Ms. Gam-ri
is already on the list.

431
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,884
Goodness. That really isn't necessary.

432
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,595
It'll already be my second time on TV!

433
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,639
But you love it!

434
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,351
Director Ji put me in charge
of deciding on the other four.

435
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,103
-Me!
-Me!

436
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,981
-Me!
-I'm Oh Yoon, remember?

437
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,401
-Me!
-Come on!

438
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,945
Everybody, just calm down.

439
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,657
Of course I should be on that list.
I'm the village chief.

440
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,536
Don't be ridiculous.
The filming takes place in zone five,

441
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,205
so the zone chief in her third term
should be invited.

442
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:26,251
You're too SSS all the time
to be suitable for any variety show.

443
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,420
SSS? What's that?

444
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,213
Strict, stern, and serious. SSS.

445
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,216
How can you be on TV
when you don't know this stuff?

446
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,013
TV shows need a fun chatterbox like me
in order to get good ratings.

447
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:42,642
-She's not wrong.
-What can bring good ratings?

448
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,728
-A celebrity, of course.
-A celebrity?

449
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,730
-Dad, please.
-I'm Oh Yoon.

450
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,273
Once people hear about it,

451
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:52,277
articles will flood portal sites
and the show will be the talk of any town.

452
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,654
No. No way!

453
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,739
-It should be me.
-Why?

454
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,158
The show takes place in Gongjin,

455
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,993
so a native should appear on it.

456
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,244
-Just a second.
-No!

457
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,998
I should make an appearance and prove
that even grannies can be pretty.

458
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,293
-You're not wrong, but--
-When it comes to looks, I'm your man.

459
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,754
If it weren't for Du-sik's
unnecessary good looks,

460
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:14,090
I'd be considered handsome
when taken a closer look.

461
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,801
Worrying about our unborn child
taking after you

462
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,136
keeps me up at night.

463
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,804
-You sleep perfectly fine.
-Me!

464
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,349
My baby's due soon, and being on the show

465
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,226
will be a huge gift to the baby.

466
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,271
-Don't you agree?
-I want to be on TV too!

467
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,565
I'm the DOS fan here.
I even know their songs.

468
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,735
Please come back, just a feeling

469
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,613
So you're saying
you all want to be on the show.

470
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,366
-Me!
-No, me!

471
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,576
-It should be me.
-No, me!

472
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,662
-Do you have something to say?
-Count me out.

473
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,706
-What?
-Same here.

474
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,124
I'm good as well.

475
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,085
-There you go.
-We have a better chance!

476
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,213
Apart from the three of them,
everyone wants to be on the show.

477
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,714
Yes, me!

478
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,966
-There's only one option then.
-What is it?

479
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,636
The fairest way
that no one will argue about.

480
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,347
We'll draw names!

481
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,099
-What?
-Unbelievable.

482
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,934
-Seriously?
-It should be me.

483
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,977
-No way.
-This is wrong.

484
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,730
Hold on a second.
Ms. Yeo, you shouldn't be up there.

485
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,191
How can a candidate
take part in the drawing process?

486
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,194
Chief Hong is the host,
and I'm only his assistant.

487
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:20,031
If I cheat, I swear I'll discard
my family name.

488
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,574
-Gosh.
-Fine.

489
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,868
We'll then decide the four residents

490
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,247
that will join Ms. Gam-ri
on her adventure.

491
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,459
Who is the first resident
to be on The Seashore Grasshopper?

492
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,174
The anticipation is real,
so please give me some silence.

493
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,509
-First…
-Unbelievable.

494
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:43,346
-The star of Gongjin-dong.
-That's right.

495
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,889
-Oh…
-It's me!

496
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:45,932
Chun-jae.

497
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,810
-Oh Yoon in the house!
-Congrats.

498
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,563
-Neener-neener
-What the hell?

499
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,233
Ju-ri, Daddy will be on TV!

500
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,693
You're annoying like hell!

501
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,237
Let me now draw the second name.

502
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,739
-All right.
-The second name.

503
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,909
I have the piece of paper.

504
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,412
She's known to be quick-witted.

505
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,622
-Then it's me.
-No, it's me.

506
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,915
Cho Nam-suk!

507
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,836
Goodness! What a wonderful evening it is.

508
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,172
I'll introduce Gongjin to the world!

509
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:21,426
Congratulations.
Let me now draw the third name.

510
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,096
The third person will be…

511
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,307
This person has been busy
with work these days.

512
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,100
-Right.
-A person who works hard.

513
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,270
It sure has been exhausting.
Thank you, my friend.

514
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,730
Right. It's Ham Yun-gyeong!

515
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,065
This is freaking amazing!

516
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,276
Honey, what…

517
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,778
The delinquent in her speaks.

518
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,655
-My goodness. I guess I got carried away.
-My gosh.

519
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,617
Anyway, thank you.
My unborn child will love it.

520
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,993
I'm sorry, kids.

521
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,288
-We only have one name left.
-The last.

522
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,623
The last person.

523
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,625
-The man of the hour.
-Exactly.

524
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,627
-It has to be Ju-ri.
-Drum roll!

525
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,547
-Please let it be me.
-I can't wait to see who it is myself.

526
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,050
-Please.
-Who will it be?

527
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,093
-Let me see.
-It must be me.

528
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,514
-Darn it.
-What?

529
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,474
Why did it have to be Chang Yeong-guk?

530
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,559
-What?
-What the hell?

531
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,686
Me? Is it really me?

532
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:20,276
This is exactly why
one should be kind and generous.

533
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,654
-Unbelievable!
-Yes, it's you.

534
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,364
-You must be thrilled.
-I am.

535
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,741
-No way. I won't allow it.
-Seriously.

536
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,834
The filming will soon begin.
Don't be nervous,

537
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,086
-and just act like you normally do.
-Right.

538
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,839
Why are you all so nervous?

539
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,716
Everybody, relax your facial muscles.

540
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,386
It's my second time being on TV, right?

541
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,430
So I'm not nervous at all.

542
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,807
That pill…

543
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,017
I'm not nervous at all.

544
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,687
This is nothing compared to
when I talk with the mayor.

545
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,397
-What's he looking at?
-I'm Oh Yoon.

546
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,025
Did you know that I once performed
at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena?

547
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,068
Follow my lead.

548
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,529
You can worry about everyone else,
but not me.

549
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,031
Honestly, I couldn't… be calmer.

550
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,576
-I'm fine.
-Come on, Yun-gyeong.

551
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,327
Loosen up a bit.

552
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,495
-Honey.
-Yes?

553
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,747
What if I go into labor while filming?

554
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,165
That won't happen.

555
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,667
Why are you all nervous?

556
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,878
-Gosh.
-I won't, right?

557
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,256
Chief Hong, will our show be all right?

558
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:24,883
I'm not sure.

559
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,636
-All right.
-Here we go.

560
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,888
Yes, don't worry.

561
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,514
-Hello.
-Hi.

562
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,974
-I'm the village chief.
-Hello.

563
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:33,892
My gosh!

564
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,768
Goodness.

565
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,478
-What is it?
-Are you all right?

566
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,355
I'm sorry.

567
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,609
-I'm sorry about that.
-Goodness.

568
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,360
All right.

569
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,073
It's good.

570
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,034
-Yes, it's good.
-I know.

571
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,035
How is it?

572
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,662
-Are you asking me?
-Yes.

573
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,539
Well, it's delicious.

574
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,125
I can taste the flavors of the Gongjin sea

575
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,586
even though it's pork belly.

576
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,213
She seems so nervous.

577
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,633
-Isn't it so hot, by the way?
-It is.

578
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,594
I even had my hair done,
but now I'm sweating like crazy.

579
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,930
Do I still look okay?
My hair should stay up.

580
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,891
I feel like my hair isn't
how it's supposed to be.

581
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,225
Nam-suk, lower your arms!

582
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,685
Let's go!

583
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,145
-Lower them.
-Don't worry.

584
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,439
-Your shirt is wet.
-Good luck to you too.

585
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,441
Oh, no. Nam-suk…

586
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,321
-This is pajeon.
-Goodness.

587
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,656
Eat it while it's hot.

588
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,741
-Gosh, it looks great.
-Thank you.

589
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,326
-It's your favorite.
-Exactly.

590
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,203
-Please enjoy.
-Please enjoy.

591
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,038
-Shit, that's hot as hell.
-Goodness.

592
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:42,752
Sorry about that.

593
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,421
We'll have to edit that out.

594
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,340
Can't we beep it out?

595
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:51,719
Anyway, thank you so much
for having us over.

596
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:58,351
These are crabs that I marinated myself.

597
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,979
Not everyone gets to eat that.

598
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,272
-Thank you.
-Let's get a shot of that later.

599
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,691
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

600
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:05,900
Thank you.

601
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:10,530
A gathering like this wouldn't be complete
without a few tunes.

602
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:14,617
Let me sing a song
for my fellow singers here.

603
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,245
-Is he a singer?
-Which one's the main camera?

604
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,871
It's on you, so act naturally.

605
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,915
-Chun-jae, go ahead.
-Right.

606
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,375
He's a singer, you know.

607
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:27,588
I can't contain this feeling…

608
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,926
-Go, Chun-jae!
-Recently, I've done you wrong so often.

609
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,594
Why? I'm loving this.

610
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,014
It's raw and authentic.

611
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,306
Even Nam-suk?

612
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,393
Brings me to tears

613
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,853
-I'll edit well.
-Please do.

614
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,105
-Go, Chun-jae.
-She's too sweet, you see.

615
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,400
-Go, Chun-jae!
-She keeps raising her arms to cheer.

616
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,069
Come on in.

617
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,531
It was exhausting, wasn't it?

618
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,949
How was the shoot?

619
00:33:56,075 --> 00:34:00,329
Philosophically speaking,
one's dignity was thrown out the window.

620
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,541
But as variety shows go, it'll be fun.

621
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,585
It must've been rough out in the sun.

622
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,879
Come on. Let me give you a hug.

623
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,591
It wasn't that exhausting, but still…

624
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,886
You did great.

625
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,058
Hey, Mi-seon.

626
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,143
You guys are super annoying.

627
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,563
Mi-seon, I…

628
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,065
Gosh.

629
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,569
Unbelievable.
Hye-jin is just head over hells.

630
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,279
Damn lovebirds.

631
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,783
I really should get my own place.

632
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,702
Eun-cheol.

633
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,454
Ms. Pyo?

634
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,539
Where are you going alone?

635
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,834
I had to escape
a pair of cockroaches in my place.

636
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,087
Cockroaches?
I'll kill them for you right away.

637
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,672
No, that's not what I meant.

638
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,133
Their rate of reproduction is no joke.

639
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,345
If you let them be,
they could conquer the world.

640
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,806
-I meant Hye-jin and Chief Hong.
-Sorry?

641
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:03,351
I left the house because I couldn't
stand their displays of affection.

642
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,686
I see.

643
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,942
Then where are you headed?

644
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,529
To the rotisserie chicken truck.

645
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,198
I saw it on my way home from work.

646
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:21,410
Then let me escort you there.

647
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,289
-Shall we?
-Sure.

648
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,752
Watch your step.

649
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,172
It's a little uncomfortable here.

650
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,758
Why don't we just go to your place?

651
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,053
Actually, I have to go now.
There's an after-party.

652
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,390
I see. Will Seong-hyeon be there too?

653
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,349
Of course.

654
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,351
How is he doing?

655
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,105
What? Why do you ask?

656
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:53,484
I ran into him the other day,
and he seemed gaunt.

657
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,027
Did you see him? When?

658
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,406
I met him briefly
on my way to work the other day.

659
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,365
I see.

660
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:04,328
He told me not to skip meals
with his usual smile,

661
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,707
but he looked quite drawn, and I felt bad.

662
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,916
I didn't notice.

663
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,335
No, he definitely looked gaunt.

664
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,673
Look out for Seong-hyeon
when you see him today.

665
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,092
If you order fried chicken,
give him a drumstick.

666
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,263
What about me then?
Should I nibble on the neck?

667
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,017
Gosh. I didn't mean it like that.
I really didn't.

668
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,852
-I--
-Forget it.

669
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:31,772
Why not look out for him yourself?
Why ask me to do it for you?

670
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,232
Give him both drumsticks.

671
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,235
Actually, debone them for him
while you're at it.

672
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,696
-Are you upset?
-Why would I be?

673
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,535
I'm just making a reasonable suggestion.

674
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,080
You're worrying about another man
in front of your boyfriend,

675
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,917
so you should just tend to him yourself.

676
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,127
Honestly, I'm fine with it.

677
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,964
That's not what I meant.
It's not what I meant at all.

678
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,133
-Whatever. I'll be off.
-Wait, Chief Hong!

679
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,346
That's not what…

680
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,394
What did I do wrong?

681
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,689
I only meant…

682
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,199
You'll have to wait five minutes
for them to be cooked perfectly.

683
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,327
Yes, that's fine. I'll wait.
I'll be taking two.

684
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,370
-Two?
-Yes.

685
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,038
Got it.

686
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,251
Eun-cheol, one's for you.
You can take it home.

687
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,585
No, I'm good.

688
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,047
Please take it
since we share a fond memory over it.

689
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,133
We do?

690
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,888
-How come?
-It's the first gift you ever got me.

691
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:50,393
Yes, but I bought it with the 5,000 won
I won with the lottery ticket you gave me.

692
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:56,482
Exactly. So what do you think
my buying one for you now means?

693
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:57,942
Well…

694
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,280
I have no idea.

695
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,448
How dense can he be?

696
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,827
You're frustrated too, aren't you?
He's so dense.

697
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,538
"It's not that I don't like you.

698
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,292
I just want to get to know you slowly."

699
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,169
I didn't want to forget it,
so I even memorized it.

700
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,132
So you made out what I said that day?

701
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,925
Of course.

702
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,179
How can you give up
just because I played hard to get?

703
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,974
I never gave up! At times I can be…

704
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,893
a bit slow.

705
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,647
I'm not very smart,

706
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,859
so I studied 15 hours a day for 5 years
to become a cop.

707
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,486
I'm bad at sprinting,

708
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,864
but I've completed six marathons.

709
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:49,577
When it comes to tenacity,
I know I can come out on top.

710
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,372
I'm saying I never gave up.

711
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,004
Gosh, you can be so frustrating.

712
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,467
This is exactly why
I never date nice guys.

713
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,136
It'll be so frustrating to date you.
Don't you think?

714
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,348
I'm sorry.

715
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,392
I'm really sorry.

716
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:17,021
Seriously? The frustration will kill me.

717
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,691
-Why don't you get what she's saying?
-Sorry?

718
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,903
She isn't rejecting you.
That was a sign of approval.

719
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,947
That's a yes for the chicken.

720
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,368
And another yes to being a couple.

721
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,374
Thank you. For a number of things.

722
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,167
You can keep the change.

723
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,379
She's the sweetest and you're the densest.

724
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,256
Let's have our chicken at the seawall.

725
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,300
What? Then…

726
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,472
Are we…

727
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,767
Must I also be the one to ask you out?

728
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,352
No. Mi-seon!

729
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,564
Please go steady with me.

730
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,110
There's no need to make
such a grand gesture.

731
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,861
-Stand up already.
-Thank you.

732
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,823
I'll really be good to you.

733
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,117
I get it, so stand up. Now.

734
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,536
-Come on. People are looking.
-Of course.

735
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,830
Let me carry this.

736
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,124
Shall we?

737
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,878
-Thank you, sir.
-Have a good time.

738
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,547
Adore one another.

739
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,173
We'll…

740
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,551
Those are the good times.

741
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,596
Why am I suddenly jealous of them?

742
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,933
You all did great today.

743
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,519
-Likewise!
-Likewise!

744
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,813
Once again, thank you so much, everyone.

745
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:44,024
Especially you, Yun-gyeong.
When is the baby due?

746
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,943
Next month.

747
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,530
I'm actually worried though.
Our baby is almost ready to come out,

748
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,241
but my OB-GYN closed down.

749
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,911
-Then what shall you do?
-Chung-ho OB-GYN shut down?

750
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,205
That's where I gave birth to I-jun.

751
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,834
There are not many young people here
who want to have a baby,

752
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,919
so a dermatology clinic will open instead.

753
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,421
-I see.
-What will you do then?

754
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,465
I'll have to go to one far away.

755
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:12,011
A clinic that has a birthing center
is an hour and a half away by car.

756
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,637
That sounds exhausting.

757
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,680
Hardly.

758
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:18,058
She won't be doing anything.
I'll be the one driving her there.

759
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,019
You…

760
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,982
Having done it myself, I can say for sure
that being on a TV show is not a joke.

761
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,526
Exactly. I found it too stressful.

762
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,238
So why did you want to appear on it
when you couldn't do squat?

763
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,657
"Squat"? Seriously?

764
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,536
Why do you have to say things
in the roughest of ways?

765
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,539
Guys, that's enough.
Why do you always bicker like this?

766
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,626
I'll let you have the stage,
so have at it today.

767
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,587
Goodness. That's rich coming from someone

768
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,090
who stuttered like a broken cassette tape
when given the chance

769
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,468
in front of a camera.

770
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,969
Is it me you meant?

771
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,806
Watch what you say, damn it!

772
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,850
Keep your hands to yourself!

773
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,102
-Jeez.
-When will you stop smacking people?

774
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:06,774
-What else can I do when--
-Stop it, you two. Enough!

775
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,860
-I can't sit next to her.
-Stop bickering, will you?

776
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,863
Instead, enjoy this symbol of peace,
freshly-fried pigeon.

777
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,283
-What?
-I'm kidding.

778
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,828
A pigeon.

779
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,375
I mean, enjoy the chicken that is similar

780
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,211
-and continue chatting.
-Sure.

781
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:33,008
This drumstick will go to Director Ji
who had the hardest job today.

782
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,426
Gosh, thank you.

783
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,428
Here's the drumstick
I've been looking for.

784
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,183
-Du-sik must've starved all day.
-He had a tough job too.

785
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,434
-Right.
-Eat up.

786
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,813
Thankfully, a chicken
always has two drumsticks.

787
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,607
Here you go.

788
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,359
-Thank you.
-That's the one I wanted.

789
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,486
Hey! What's up with you today?

790
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,071
Damn jerk!

791
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,197
Spit it out.

792
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,200
It's all right.
I prefer chicken breasts anyway.

793
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,453
-Chicken breasts? Let me see.
-Yes.

794
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,664
-Here you go.
-Right. Thank you very much.

795
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,208
Why not fry a bigger chicken next time?

796
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,168
My piece was over in two bites.

797
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,795
It's tiny, right?

798
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,088
Smaller ones are cheaper.

799
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,573
Give me one too.

800
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,334
He seems to be eating well enough.

801
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,085
Hand me some more.

802
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,422
But you only asked for one.
Here. Take the whole bag.

803
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,135
Chief Hong,

804
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,013
are you upset with me?

805
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,806
Upset? Of course not.

806
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,933
You clearly are.

807
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,727
What is it?

808
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,980
Level with me
and say whatever's bothering you.

809
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,109
Hye-jin's worried about you.

810
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,655
She said that you looked gaunt
and should eat well.

811
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,032
-That's why you're sulking.
-No, I'm not.

812
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,241
Sulking, my foot.

813
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,118
You lucky jerk.

814
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,953
Damn, you're lucky.

815
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:28,999
I'd like to be jealous
rather than be pitied.

816
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,293
It sure would be nice to yell at her

817
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,588
for being concerned about another man
in my presence.

818
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,843
Do you get it now?

819
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,596
Do you see how lucky you are?

820
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:47,976
By the way, did you send her parents
tickets to Gag Big League?

821
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,395
I forgot about that.

822
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,689
-Get on it.
-I will.

823
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,023
And put on some weight…

824
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,235
so that my girlfriend doesn't worry.

825
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,071
I'm glad she still thinks of me though.

826
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,406
Do you have a death wish?

827
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,157
-I'm only saying--
-Hey, Ms. Wang.

828
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,451
-I wanted some fresh air.
-I see.

829
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,871
Why are you sitting like that?
You have a bad back.

830
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:08,914
What's it to you?

831
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,541
Let me get a chair for you.

832
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,127
Forget it. Since when
did you look out for me?

833
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,171
What are you talking about?
I always looked out for you.

834
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:20,467
Our show will come to a halt if you
fall ill, so of course I should serve you.

835
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,265
Hey. What brings you out?

836
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,766
They're arguing.

837
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,853
Actually, they're not.
They're just talking loudly.

838
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:36,233
You don't even have
the slightest respect for me.

839
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:40,237
How can I respect you
when you do nothing respectable?

840
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,031
-Goodness.
-How can a village chief be this childish?

841
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,826
What the…
What does that have to do with anything?

842
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,120
He's not wrong.
Have some respect for people.

843
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,372
Speaking of which,
you humiliated me earlier.

844
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,125
I'm proud of how I speak, so how dare you?

845
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,503
There's nothing hard for me
because I only sit there while you drive?

846
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,755
Do you know how hard it is to be pregnant?

847
00:45:58,839 --> 00:45:59,923
Just eat this, damn it!

848
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,675
I'm sorry. I must've lost my mind.

849
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:04,094
-You have no right.
-Close up for me, will you?

850
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,138
-I'm heading home.
-Good night.

851
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,848
-Whatever!
-Watch your words!

852
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:17,316
Would it be rude to just leave?

853
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,193
Absolutely. But I'm leaving.

854
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,903
Seriously? You can't--

855
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,613
I'll get going. Good night.

856
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,370
You and Officer Choi are dating now?

857
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,956
Well…

858
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,461
I'll have to teach him
everything starting with the basics,

859
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,462
but he's adorable.

860
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,881
It's new to me and it might be fun.

861
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:44,343
My gosh! I just got goose bumps.

862
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,513
Congratulations. I'm so happy for you two!

863
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:51,683
You know what?
We'll be able to go on double dates now.

864
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,354
Since Chief Hong
and Eun-cheol are quite close,

865
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,481
let's set one up soon.

866
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,983
-A double date?
-How about a camping trip?

867
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,902
-Sure. That sounds good.
-Right?

868
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,111
We'll go car-camping.

869
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,113
CHIEF HONG

870
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,199
But how will we do it?

871
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,576
Come out if you're not in bed.
I'm out front.

872
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,869
Just a minute.

873
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:12,996
Where are you going?

874
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,924
Why are you back here?

875
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,301
Come sit here.

876
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,637
Who are you to order me around?

877
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,310
I'm sorry.

878
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,021
About what?

879
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,900
I nitpicked when knowing what you meant,

880
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,736
sulked and acted out
after jealousy swept over me,

881
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,197
and slammed the door on my way out.

882
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,824
And it took…

883
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,368
so long to apologize.

884
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,082
Talk about a detailed apology.

885
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,670
Why were you like that though?
It wasn't like you at all.

886
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:05,549
I have no idea.
I thought things wouldn't get to me,

887
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:08,051
but I'm more childish
than I believed I was.

888
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,971
I even ate his drumsticks.

889
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,348
-Really?
-Yes.

890
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,559
I'm so pathetic.

891
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:19,479
Because of you, I've been discovering
a new side of me every day.

892
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,023
Same here.

893
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:25,068
I've been discovering
a new charming side of you every day.

894
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,487
Today, I found out…

895
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,240
how cute you are.

896
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,743
You're so adorable.

897
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:36,204
What do you mean I'm adorable?
Don't be silly.

898
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,205
Am I that cute?

899
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,582
It's a mosquito.

900
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,667
There was nothing there.

901
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,502
-You're adorable.
-Am I?

902
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,754
Absolutely adorable.

903
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,466
-Are you accepting my apology then?
-I don't know.

904
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,719
But you said I'm cute.
Again, I'm really sorry.

905
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:56,308
-Chief Hong!
-Don't run. I'll come to you instead.

906
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,273
I was too excited not to skip over.

907
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,609
How do I look?

908
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,737
Stunning. You're the only one
I see from 100m away.

909
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,365
-I'm dressed in pink.
-Pink?

910
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,325
You look pretty.

911
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,785
-Do I?
-Yes.

912
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,872
-You should drive.
-Me?

913
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:21,625
-Yes.
-But you don't let others drive.

914
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:25,379
It's not a new car anymore
since I've driven it around.

915
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,256
Besides, you're not just an "other" now.

916
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,258
Okay, I'll drive.

917
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,429
I was going to get the door for you.

918
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,766
I don't have the patience
to wait for others to get the door.

919
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,185
Got it. Watch your hands.

920
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,443
All right. I see
you already fastened your seat belt.

921
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,612
Let's go then.

922
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,080
Are you that happy?

923
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,418
Yes. I love that we're
going on a drive outside the city

924
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,545
and also your company.
I'm loving everything.

925
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,256
What from your bucket list
will we be doing today?

926
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,467
We need to make a stop
on our way to Seoul.

927
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,969
Okay, got it.

928
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,188
How is a gallery this pretty?

929
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,398
Tell me about it.

930
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,276
Did you know about this place?

931
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,029
What do you think? Isn't it pretty?

932
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,198
Yes, it's nice and unique.

933
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,909
I didn't know you were into art.

934
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,453
Actually, I'm not.

935
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,456
Then why is going to a gallery
on your bucket list?

936
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,415
Because it's fancy.

937
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,375
What?

938
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:50,046
Appreciating artwork with my boyfriend
at a gallery.

939
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,298
How cool is that?

940
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,009
It sure is.

941
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:05,061
Rather than detailed paintings,
I like simple ones like this.

942
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,398
Adding elaborate details is easy.

943
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,860
It's harder to express the essence
of something with ordinary drawings.

944
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,820
That's so cool.

945
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,448
You must know a lot about art.

946
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,950
No, not a lot.
But the field does intrigue me.

947
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,369
I took an art history class in college.

948
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,871
Art history?

949
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,167
What for? Did you have a girlfriend
who studied art?

950
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,800
Gosh, check this out.

951
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,885
Can't you feel the artist's soul?

952
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:39,763
-I--
-Don't change the subject like that.

953
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,557
So you did date an art student.

954
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,934
Are you sad right now?

955
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,978
Well, there's something about this piece.

956
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,399
Was she older than you? Or younger?

957
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,818
-The same age?
-Same--

958
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,779
Wait, that's east, isn't it?

959
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:59,783
Let's check out this one next.
It's titled "Family."

960
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,243
We already saw that one.

961
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,578
So you were the same age.

962
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,956
-I love this gallery.
-Was she pretty?

963
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,668
-There's a sense of naturalism.
-Does the art remind you of her? Does it?

964
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:13,213
-I doubt the relationship was deep.
-Naturalism is what I prefer…

965
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,305
I've been let loose.

966
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,224
Don't try to stop me.

967
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,561
That's too bad. If we were
at a racing track, I would've bet on you.

968
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,064
Giddy-up! Get going.

969
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:32,774
Giddy-up!

970
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,740
Hang on. Are you sure
we're in the right place?

971
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,618
Yes, this is where
I'm taking control over.

972
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:48,290
From head to toe, I'll be
transforming you into my style.

973
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,333
No way. I really don't want this.

974
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,752
-We should leave.
-Don't you think it'll be fun?

975
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:56,590
No, not in a million years.
I hate this stuff. I'm going downstairs..

976
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,718
But it's on my bucket list.

977
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,145
Darn it…

978
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,188
Good boy.

979
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,942
I really don't need new clothes.

980
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,944
Just do this for me.

981
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,489
-Just try on a total of ten outfits.
-Ten?

982
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:25,368
Are you telling me
to put on an outfit and show it to you

983
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,703
ten times over?

984
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:27,662
Yes.

985
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:33,251
Hye-jin, look. I feel so nauseated
that I might puke.

986
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,630
The restroom's that way,
and the fitting room is this way.

987
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,882
I'm not Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman.

988
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,636
That movie was released in 1990.
This is such a cliché.

989
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,472
This type of cliché
is known as classic these days.

990
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,684
By the way, I didn't realize
you liked romantic comedies.

991
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,228
You're super annoying.

992
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,730
How adorable.

993
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,899
I'm Richard Gere today!

994
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,737
This looks good too.

995
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,447
Hold on.

996
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,034
How do I look?

997
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,869
-You look great.
-I like it too.

998
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,746
-Let's take this.
-Try on the navy one.

999
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:10,872
-We'll take this.
-No.

1000
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,958
Try on the navy one. It's nice too.

1001
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,629
Who made you Michael Jackson?

1002
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,465
You look sexy!

1003
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,217
-So this is the one.
-No.

1004
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,219
-The gray one.
-This seems fine to me.

1005
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,638
No, you look too much like Michael Jackson

1006
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,348
which can be a problem.

1007
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,767
-I think it's nice.
-Go on.

1008
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,105
Looking dandy!

1009
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,107
This one's too hot for the weather though.

1010
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,361
-Sorry.
-Why are you stripping me?

1011
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,279
This one's a no. It's too revealing.

1012
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,823
Next! That one's a no.

1013
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:46,408
-This…
-Wait,

1014
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,535
-is it see-through?
-Well, this…

1015
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,328
Unbelievable, right?

1016
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,038
I don't think this is the one.

1017
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,249
-It's just wrong.
-It's absurd.

1018
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:02,215
This one's nice. I'm loving the colors.

1019
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:04,968
-I can't do this anymore.
-You look so good.

1020
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,970
-Let's stop.
-You'll wrinkle the pants.

1021
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,097
Okay, fine.
Let's go with the first outfit.

1022
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,640
-Try it on once more.
-The first?

1023
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,017
The gingham suit.

1024
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,811
-Why don't we just take that one?
-No, try it on first.

1025
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,771
-That's not necessary.
-The waist was big.

1026
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:17,939
No, it fit perfectly.

1027
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,691
Okay, just try it on once again.

1028
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,151
I don't think--

1029
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,070
Should I dress you?

1030
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,990
-Here you go.
-Right.

1031
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,324
I'll pay with this.

1032
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,993
No way. I'm buying it myself.

1033
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,369
Don't be ridiculous.

1034
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,497
Buying clothes for my boyfriend
is included on my bucket list.

1035
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:38,209
Besides, it's your birthday soon.

1036
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,296
Consider it an early birthday gift.

1037
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,006
Right, my birthday's coming up.

1038
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,216
Okay, I'll gladly accept it.

1039
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,259
Sure.

1040
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,845
-She's a cool girlfriend.
-Right.

1041
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,848
So where to next?

1042
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,184
-To eat something delicious.
-Something delicious?

1043
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,311
Wait. I need to stop by somewhere.

1044
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,021
-Stop by?
-Yes.

1045
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,407
-Could I take a look at that?
-Of course.

1046
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,330
Let me hold that for you.

1047
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,626
What do you think?

1048
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,337
It's pretty. It looks great on you.

1049
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,671
-Does it?
-Yes.

1050
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,965
-I'll take this then.
-Sure.

1051
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,593
-I'll check if we have a new one in stock.
-Sure.

1052
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,638
I've been eyeing it
for quite some time, you see.

1053
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,972
Do you like it that much?

1054
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,850
Yes, I love everything in this world
that is beautiful.

1055
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,478
-Then let me--
-There was a new one in stock.

1056
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,437
Really?

1057
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,023
That would be 5.55 million won.

1058
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,775
How would you like to pay?

1059
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,944
-With this credit card.
-Sure.

1060
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,154
-I'll pay in full.
-Yes, ma'am.

1061
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,491
I finally got it!

1062
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,285
So it must be a real diamond.

1063
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,122
Of course it is. I don't wear fakes.

1064
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:01,584
Why isn't I-jun picking up?
Maybe he's at the restaurant.

1065
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,546
I hope it wasn't salty.

1066
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,964
I think it was to his taste.

1067
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,842
I'm sorry for not returning this sooner.

1068
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:09,926
What the hell?

1069
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,262
What is he doing here?

1070
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,763
That insulated bottle.

1071
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,642
Have some of this.

1072
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,396
You didn't have to bring it back.

1073
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,983
-I'll get going then.
-Sure thing.

1074
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,025
-Bye.
-Bye.

1075
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,364
Oh, my God!

1076
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,658
Mr. Chang.

1077
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,669
So you're saying

1078
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,338
that the hangover soup was from Hwa-jeong?

1079
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,717
That's right. She dropped it off
after hearing about

1080
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,677
your nasty hangover.

1081
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,805
What is she playing at?

1082
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,349
She may speak harshly to you,

1083
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,435
but she cares a lot about you.

1084
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:03,271
As if. She doesn't care about me at all.

1085
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:04,647
I bet she gave me leftovers.

1086
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,150
No, that's not the case!

1087
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,320
You're so clueless.

1088
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,741
What now? Is there
something else I don't know?

1089
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,993
You see…

1090
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,036
What is it?

1091
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,914
Let's go have something nice to eat.

1092
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,503
Hong Du-sik?

1093
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,677
Tae-gyeong?

1094
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:38,181
It really is you.
Jeez, how long has it been?

1095
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,726
I know. It's been a while.

1096
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,771
I didn't realize you had company. Hello.

1097
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,105
Yes, hello.

1098
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,816
Hey. Do you know how worried I was?

1099
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,694
You suddenly vanished off
the face of the earth.

1100
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,029
Where do you live now?

1101
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,614
I moved back to my hometown.

1102
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,241
I see.

1103
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,535
I'm working at a new place now.

1104
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:03,706
Here's my business card.
Call me when it's convenient for you.

1105
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,917
I'm afraid I got to run now. I'm sorry.

1106
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:07,460
-Well, then.
-Bye.

1107
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,420
Call me.

1108
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,215
Who is he?

1109
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,302
We went to college together.

1110
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,805
I see. Were you in the same major?

1111
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,931
Let's go eat.

1112
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:25,770
Chief Hong, we ticked a lot of boxes
off my bucket list today.

1113
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,731
We'll do all hundred of them in no time.

1114
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,401
Don't worry though.

1115
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:34,571
I can come up with 200, 300,
and even 1,000 more.

1116
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,198
There are so many things
that I wish to do with you.

1117
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,036
Are you listening to me, Chief Hong?

1118
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:45,623
Chief Hong.

1119
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:47,875
Hey!

1120
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,337
Sorry. What did you say?

1121
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,509
It's nothing. Just enjoy your meal.

1122
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,012
Right.

1123
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,649
Actually…
I really shouldn't tell you this.

1124
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,568
It's all right. Go ahead.

1125
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,445
The tonic that's good for your joints

1126
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,864
was also from Ms. Yeo.

1127
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,032
What?

1128
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,075
She was adamant about making it seem

1129
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:22,994
like it was from me.

1130
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,750
What's gotten into her?

1131
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:32,086
Jeez, Yeong-guk.
This isn't like you at all.

1132
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,630
You never drink alone.

1133
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,132
You know, I just…

1134
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:39,427
I had to get out of the house.
It's depressing to be alone.

1135
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,137
Would you care for one?

1136
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,724
No, I need to run this place,
but there are no customers!

1137
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:45,892
Let me get my beer.

1138
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,019
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1139
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,153
Nothing beats draft beer in summer.

1140
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,989
Damn, that's sweet.

1141
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:03,910
I'm sure beer tastes
like honey to you now.

1142
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:04,869
What?

1143
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,496
Thanks to I-jun.

1144
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,957
I heard he won a prize
at the mathematics competition.

1145
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,294
Gosh, it's not a big deal.
He's the runner-up of Gangwon Province.

1146
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,545
My Ju-ri…

1147
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,174
has been running parallel
to her academics.

1148
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:22,178
It's okay though. Don't worry about it.

1149
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,597
As you know, my Ju-ri is so pretty.

1150
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,557
Of course.

1151
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,685
-Her eyes are almond-shaped.
-Exactly.

1152
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,354
And don't forget her chubby cheeks.

1153
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,649
She looks just like her mom, right?

1154
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,943
She looks more like her as she grows up.

1155
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:37,944
I know.

1156
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:43,491
These days, looking at her

1157
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,662
makes me miss So-yeon even more.

1158
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:53,042
Let me ask. Do you still miss your wife?

1159
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,210
Of course.

1160
01:01:56,129 --> 01:02:01,092
After I'm done raising Ju-ri, I'll be
waiting for the day I meet her again.

1161
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,889
Come on. Stop lying.

1162
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,642
Your marriage was such a long time ago.

1163
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,645
Actually, it's already been a long time
since she passed away.

1164
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,689
How can you still miss her?

1165
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:17,066
Why do you keep asking me
the same question?

1166
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,943
What? When did I ask you that?

1167
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:23,239
You asked me a few years back.

1168
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,158
We were having drinks.

1169
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:30,496
Liar. What a liar.

1170
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:35,042
Your marriage was such a long time ago.

1171
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,838
I mean, it's already been a long time
since she passed away.

1172
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:43,885
How can you still miss her
and love her the same way you did?

1173
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,471
That's hard to believe.

1174
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,848
It's true, you prick!

1175
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,016
Whatever.

1176
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,518
You know,

1177
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:58,274
I still remember the moment

1178
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:01,360
we walked down the aisle together.

1179
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,653
I…

1180
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,409
promised her my eternal love.

1181
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:13,039
Love, my ass.

1182
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:18,461
Marriage is all about
staying together out of attachment.

1183
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:22,089
That's how it was for me
from the start, you know.

1184
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:26,010
I needed to get married
before it was too late,

1185
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:30,306
but my first love had moved away.

1186
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:33,559
I ended up

1187
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:37,230
with the woman I was friends with.

1188
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:41,108
That's how marriage is for most people.

1189
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,194
My mother-in-law…

1190
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:46,739
I mean, Hwa-jeong's mother
had passed away around that time.

1191
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:55,289
I felt bad that she was all alone,
and that's how…

1192
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,999
I miss So-yeon so much.

1193
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:04,799
-Damn it.
-Don't you cry.

1194
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:09,679
All I'm saying is
that there's not much to marriage.

1195
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,808
There's nothing special about it.

1196
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:17,687
It doesn't have some grand meaning.

1197
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,813
It's…

1198
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:24,610
It's just boring.

1199
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,283
That night,

1200
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:34,704
we were so wasted
that I barely remember anything.

1201
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,205
Wait.

1202
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,668
I do remember
how Ms. Yeo dragged you home.

1203
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:44,005
Wait. Did Hwa-jeong come here then?

1204
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:45,631
Yes.

1205
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:50,553
It suddenly started to pour,
so she came by with an umbrella.

1206
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,721
It was weird though.

1207
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:57,560
Hwa-jeong… I mean, Ms. Yeo
had an umbrella in her hand,

1208
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:00,980
but she was soaked from head to toe
for some reason.

1209
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,817
Maybe I'm remembering it wrong.

1210
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,486
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

1211
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,403
Jeez. What time did I get in last night?

1212
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:54,116
Just how much did I have to drink?
I completely blacked out.

1213
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,244
Hey, you made dried pollack soup.

1214
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:03,751
Nothing cures a hangover
better than my wife's soup.

1215
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:06,128
Honey, you're the best.

1216
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,839
Jeez.

1217
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:26,899
What the hell?

1218
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:29,819
Are you insane?

1219
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:32,488
I told you not to
take off your socks inside-out.

1220
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,323
Socks?

1221
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:39,078
Are you insane?
You did this over some stupid socks?

1222
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,622
I've told you numerous times.

1223
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:45,042
I clearly told you
not to take them off inside-out.

1224
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:48,087
And not to throw them
everywhere around the house.

1225
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,882
How many times must I tell you this?

1226
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,301
I'm not your maid, you know.

1227
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:57,722
Is that so hard to do?

1228
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:01,142
This is how one wears their socks, right?

1229
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:05,354
So how hard is it to take them off
and put them in the hamper?

1230
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:08,566
Don't take them off inside-out, damn it!

1231
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:10,609
Don't throw them around the house!

1232
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,905
Don't take off your socks inside-out

1233
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:18,701
and don't throw them around the house.
Got it?

1234
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,121
Just don't!

1235
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:31,714
I'm such a jerk.

1236
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,804
I'm such an idiot.

1237
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,393
It was all my fault.

1238
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,897
I was to blame.

1239
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,079
Would you like to come in?

1240
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:06,207
What? No, it's already late.

1241
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,877
Right, of course.

1242
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,171
You must be tired from all the driving.

1243
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,590
-Go and get some rest then.
-Sure.

1244
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,718
-Thank you for the gift.
-Don't mention it.

1245
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,261
-Good night.
-I'll get going.

1246
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,179
Sure.

1247
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,705
I wonder why he became
depressed so suddenly.

1248
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,377
Did it seem
like I was showing off my money?

1249
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,590
Was it the necklace?

1250
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:59,593
Was it a bit too much?

1251
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,056
Why did I buy so much?

1252
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:13,941
MS. DENTIST

1253
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,362
It's only morning, but I miss you already.

1254
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,906
I hear it's scorching hot today.

1255
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,909
So drink water often and eat proper meals.

1256
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,954
And if you miss me,
come run over any time.

1257
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,295
-Yes, you too.
-"Yes, you too."

1258
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:36,964
"Yes, you too"?

1259
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,344
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

1260
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:47,391
The thing is I sent a text of 46 words,

1261
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:48,851
and he texted back three.

1262
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,728
What do you think of that?

1263
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:53,063
What? He must be busy.

1264
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:56,567
He might be, but I still think
it's too short. Isn't it?

1265
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:59,069
Maybe I hurt his feelings in some way.

1266
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,989
Why be bothered by it?

1267
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,116
It's how Chief Hong usually is.

1268
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:05,910
You think so?

1269
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,330
Seriously?

1270
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:10,289
What is it?

1271
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,957
-Are you kidding me?
-What's wrong?

1272
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:17,838
Check it out. I sent a text
with lots of hearts and emoticons,

1273
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:21,008
but all he wrote is "Good morning."
Seriously…

1274
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:24,762
Am I in the police? Am I his colleague?
Am I his superior or boss?

1275
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,473
Why is he being so formal?

1276
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,642
That's how Officer Choi usually is.

1277
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,269
It hurts, you know.

1278
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:36,815
It's so beautiful.

1279
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,202
Chief Hong.

1280
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,580
-Hey, Ms. Dentist. Is something up?
-Must something be up for me to call?

1281
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:56,293
Chief Hong, how about
we have dinner together later?

1282
01:10:56,377 --> 01:11:00,214
I'm afraid I'm working until late tonight.
Let's have it next time.

1283
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:02,800
Okay. It can't be helped.

1284
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:04,802
Sure.

1285
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:07,638
He hung up.

1286
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,896
I was right.
He's putting distance between us.

1287
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:24,071
Gosh. I'm so relieved
that we got good internal reviews.

1288
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:26,615
It wasn't just good.
They were eating it up.

1289
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,618
I forbid you
from popping the champagne too early.

1290
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,372
Anyway, why isn't our writer here
to enjoy this good news with us?

1291
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,417
Over there.

1292
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:39,795
Isn't that Director Yang Gyeong-min
from TCB?

1293
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,381
I heard from a friend there

1294
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:46,260
that he's been trying to get Ms. Wang
on board for his new variety show.

1295
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,474
I'm glad the higher-ups loved it.

1296
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,852
It would've been nicer to have you there.

1297
01:11:56,687 --> 01:12:00,858
You said you were meeting someone.
Was it Director Yang Gyeong-min?

1298
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,109
Yes.

1299
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:06,530
People can't get enough of you, right?

1300
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:10,451
Don't tell me he's been
trying to woo you for his show.

1301
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:13,162
Yes, he spreads his feathers
like a peacock

1302
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:15,205
and calls for me like a nightingale.

1303
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,166
No way.

1304
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:18,375
It's true.

1305
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:23,964
And I'm taking him up on his offer.

1306
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,216
What?

1307
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,218
This current show will be

1308
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,012
our last.

1309
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:34,516
-That's out of the blue.
-It actually isn't.

1310
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,269
It's been seven years.
It's time for a new scene.

1311
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,983
At this rate, I'll be stuck in a rut.

1312
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,943
I need to change things up.

1313
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,029
We'll change things up together then.

1314
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:49,073
Let's try something completely different.

1315
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:50,574
I've been meaning to, you know.

1316
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:52,826
No, I'd rather not work with you anymore.

1317
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:56,080
It should end here.

1318
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,874
If it's because
of the recent stuff I pulled,

1319
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:01,835
know that it won't happen again.

1320
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:04,713
I fully admit my wrongdoing.

1321
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,048
I'm sorry.

1322
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:11,512
It's true that I was briefly disappointed
in you, but that's not the reason.

1323
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:13,639
Then what is it?

1324
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,057
It's me.

1325
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:20,729
So don't try to find
the reason in your actions.

1326
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:23,023
Seong-hyeon,

1327
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:28,487
you're a good TV director and,
more importantly, a good person.

1328
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,698
You'll make good shows
with any other writer out there.

1329
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:40,958
I'll get going then.

1330
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:05,566
What are you doing here?
Were you waiting for me?

1331
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:08,861
You really are home late.

1332
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,654
I told you. You should've called.

1333
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:16,034
-Let's go.
-What?

1334
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:18,704
Won't you invite me in?

1335
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,249
But I have something to say.

1336
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,168
Then say it outside.

1337
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,257
Where are we going?

1338
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,720
Are we still not there yet?
Where are we going?

1339
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,013
You'll see.

1340
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,640
Where are we headed?

1341
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:48,233
This is the place.

1342
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,239
What's all this?

1343
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:57,743
-Did you put this together?
-Yes.

1344
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,872
I only stopped by the house
to get more light bulbs.

1345
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:05,667
I was going to make it look even better

1346
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:08,378
and get you later in the night.

1347
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,468
What is it? Don't you like it?

1348
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,304
It's a sigh of relief.

1349
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:23,352
You seemed upset,
and I thought it was my fault.

1350
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:24,269
What?

1351
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:29,358
I thought the necklace I bought
turned you off in some way.

1352
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,736
What? Jeez.

1353
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:36,156
What on earth goes through
that tiny head of yours?

1354
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,700
You were way off.

1355
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:41,745
Have a seat.

1356
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:46,667
-It's cute.
-Isn't it pretty?

1357
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:49,920
-Yes. My goodness.
-Watch your step.

1358
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:57,469
Hye-jin.

1359
01:15:58,095 --> 01:15:59,429
Yes?

1360
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:02,391
You don't have to worry
about how I view your actions.

1361
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:06,895
You bought yourself a gift
with the money you worked hard to earn,

1362
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,064
so why worry about what I think?

1363
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:11,984
I'm not fazed at all,

1364
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:15,070
so do whatever it is you want.

1365
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:17,614
Sorry.

1366
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:20,867
I guess I jumped to conclusions.

1367
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:26,373
A part of me thought
that it made you feel inferior.

1368
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:28,667
I'm very understanding, you know.

1369
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,962
My boyfriend is the best.

1370
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:36,925
Is that why you're not wearing
your new necklace? Not to bother me?

1371
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,761
Well, I already sold it.

1372
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:43,599
-What?
-It didn't seem right,

1373
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,309
so I sold it online.

1374
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:48,812
-I already sent it away.
-So you don't have it anymore?

1375
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,273
-No.
-This is bad.

1376
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:52,899
-Why?
-Because…

1377
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,405
What's this?

1378
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:01,116
Find out for yourself.

1379
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,292
It's so pretty. My gosh.

1380
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,086
I made it myself.

1381
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,464
-Really?
-Yes.

1382
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:17,799
It's so pretty.

1383
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,595
I wanted to buy the necklace for you,
but it was too expensive.

1384
01:17:22,262 --> 01:17:25,766
So I made a jewelry box for it instead.

1385
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:28,435
But now that necklace is gone.

1386
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:31,730
It's fine. I have many
other necklaces and earrings.

1387
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,649
I'll fill this up in no time.

1388
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,193
Thanks, Chief Hong.

1389
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:38,403
-It's beautiful.
-Do you like it?

1390
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,655
Yes.

1391
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:50,499
This place is amazing.

1392
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:54,336
Right? It's my favorite spot.

1393
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,798
You might say that the sea
looks the same from everywhere--

1394
01:17:57,881 --> 01:18:00,634
No, it's different.

1395
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:06,973
It becomes a special place
once a memory is made there.

1396
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:12,312
The sea Chief Hong took me to…

1397
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:16,817
has now become
one of my favorite spots too.

1398
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:23,782
You know, I love everything here.

1399
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,202
The bonfire,

1400
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,287
the sound of the waves,

1401
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:31,832
the sound of the water,

1402
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:34,292
the scent of summer,

1403
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:36,253
the stars,

1404
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:38,755
and you.

1405
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:44,344
Out of everything
that exists in this world,

1406
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:46,430
I like you the most.

1407
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:52,519
In that case, I should be the one
to say this first.

1408
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:56,857
Yoon Hye-jin,

1409
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,193
I love you.

1410
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,448
Me too.

1411
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:06,533
Hong Du-sik,

1412
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:08,994
I love you.

1413
01:20:04,424 --> 01:20:07,093
DU-SIK AND HYE-JIN'S BUCKET LIST

1414
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:31,535
1. GIVE HER A PRESENT I MADE MYSELF

1415
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:15,620
