1
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,597
FINALE

2
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,986
You're here.

3
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,329
Pay your respects first.

4
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,995
What are all these photos?

5
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,124
A while back,

6
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,752
Ms. Gam-ri saw a table of photos
at our neighbor's son's wedding

7
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,504
and said to me

8
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,884
that she'd like something similar

9
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,136
at her own funeral.

10
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,097
So I asked her what she meant by it,

11
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,435
and she said
that the next biggest event she'd throw

12
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,936
would be her funeral.

13
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,900
She said she'd want nothing more
than for the guests

14
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,527
to laugh and have a good time.

15
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,489
That she'll have gone to the good place,

16
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,492
so we should grill potato jeon

17
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,454
and chug down makgeolli.

18
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,293
That's why…

19
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,172
we're respecting her final wishes.

20
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,800
-Right?
-Don't be ridiculous!

21
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,761
You know I don't drink a lot.

22
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,845
As if.

23
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,597
Go ahead.

24
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,307
Aren't you going to help?

25
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,475
It tastes great.

26
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,977
-Try some.
-Goodness.

27
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,355
-Really?
-Thank you.

28
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,357
-Thank you.
-Let's call Du-sik over.

29
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,942
No way. I don't want to.

30
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,194
-Dr. Yoon, over here.
-Eat your food.

31
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,612
Okay.

32
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,489
Go ahead. They're waiting for you.

33
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,075
Want a bowl of yukgaejang?

34
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,245
Right. You wouldn't want any.

35
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,705
I will. I want a bowl.

36
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,334
Fill it to the brim.

37
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,295
Sure.

38
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,005
Take a look.

39
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,507
-Hey!
-Goodness. Hello.

40
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,342
-Director Ji!
-Welcome.

41
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,220
-Hello.
-Gosh, you came.

42
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,306
-Hye-jin.
-Seong-hyeon.

43
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,224
Chief Hong.

44
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,768
I'm so sorry.

45
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,605
You'll have some yukgaejang, right?

46
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,365
-What do you mean?
-Are you kidding me?

47
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,034
-Hwa-jeong, come here.
-I thought we were done!

48
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,161
-Gosh.
-Let me introduce you to someone.

49
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,539
-Hold on.
-Bo-ra, where are you?

50
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,333
I've always been like that though.

51
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,712
-Could I join you guys?
-Please have a seat.

52
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,879
You've come a long way.

53
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,548
Gosh, look who it is!

54
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,050
-What took you so long?
-Seriously?

55
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,721
REST IN PEACE

56
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,143
Thank you for coming.

57
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,562
Of course we should.

58
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,232
I was worried about you,
but I'm glad you seem to be doing okay.

59
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,278
Yes. It'll be a long drive,
so get on your way. You too, Ms. Wang.

60
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,574
I'm sure Ms. Gam-ri went to a good place.

61
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,992
She was such a good person.

62
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,827
Thank you.

63
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,497
Have a safe trip back.
Seong-hyeon, drive safely.

64
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,750
Sure. We'll get going then.

65
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,377
-Drive safely.
-Take care.

66
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,851
Let me walk you home.

67
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,354
Don't bother.
I'm staying with you tonight.

68
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,690
But it'll be uncomfortable there.

69
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,109
Sleep in your own bed
and come early in the morning.

70
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,112
-Will you be all right?
-What?

71
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,614
It seems to me

72
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,325
you're pretending to be okay.

73
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,868
I'm not sure.

74
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,622
I guess it hasn't sunk in yet.

75
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,793
This is not my first time,

76
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,462
but I can never get used to it.

77
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,592
I still remember Ms. Gam-ri's face
from when she sat on her wooden porch.

78
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:29,639
I can still hear her
calling me from the alleyway.

79
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,351
It feels like she's still here with me.

80
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,105
So I don't…

81
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,316
want to let her go yet.

82
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,950
Just for a little while longer,
I want her by my side.

83
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,583
Du-sik,

84
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,129
I…

85
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,591
can't quite…

86
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,011
picture my mother's face.

87
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,600
I've been staring at her photo all day,

88
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,437
but she looks strange to me.

89
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,356
My mother…

90
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,984
How did my mom seem to you?

91
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,488
Was she well?

92
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:09,906
Yes.

93
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,536
She laughed a lot, had fun here and there,

94
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,416
and helped others out. She seemed happy.

95
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,711
She was the same old Ms. Gam-ri.

96
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,049
I thought…

97
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,472
that my mom…

98
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,184
would stay in my life for a long time.

99
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,981
So I kept putting off seeing her because
I thought there'd be plenty of chances.

100
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,693
But there aren't any left now.

101
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,907
When parents pass away,

102
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,786
children who regret the most cry the most.

103
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,873
But I'm too ashamed…

104
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,209
to even cry.

105
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,339
It's not like implants cost a fortune,

106
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,303
but I never even got around
to taking her to the dentist.

107
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,350
She got her implants.

108
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,563
The procedure went well,

109
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,442
so she enjoyed meat and squid
as much as she wanted.

110
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,451
Jeez, I'm such an idiot.

111
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,081
Yet, I had my own kid study abroad.

112
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,379
My mom probably put me first
like I prioritize my children…

113
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,428
since I'm her son.

114
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,807
I'm such an idiot.

115
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,313
I don't know what to do about this guilt.

116
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,191
I can't even say sorry anymore.

117
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,529
I can't be a good son to her anymore.

118
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,491
How can I possibly…

119
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,078
carry on with my life?

120
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,123
Won-seok, don't be like that.

121
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,709
Ms. Gam-ri would've
never thought that way.

122
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,422
To her, you were…

123
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,969
a good son who never got into any trouble.

124
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:43,351
You were her proud son
who worked as an accountant in Seoul.

125
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,604
You were her joy.

126
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,776
You made her happy and gave her comfort.

127
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,447
You were the reason she lived.

128
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,038
Mom…

129
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,877
Mom!

130
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,258
Mom…

131
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,391
Mom…

132
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,854
Mom…

133
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,404
Mom…

134
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:42,947
Won-seok said he would not
sell the house and keep it as is.

135
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,990
Really?

136
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,785
It's his childhood home, after all.

137
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,620
He said he'd come by at times.

138
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,122
I should come around often then.

139
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,709
For some reason,
empty homes tend to deteriorate faster.

140
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,710
You're right.

141
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,298
You think she's on the other side by now?

142
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:06,512
Probably. I bet she's the prettiest
among everyone there.

143
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:11,600
Thanks to Dr. Yoon, she was able
to enjoy squid before passing away.

144
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,477
Absolutely.

145
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,398
Mat-i, promise me
that you'll live for many years to come.

146
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,817
I'll be too bored without you.

147
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,778
Wouldn't life be better
since I scold you all the time?

148
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,989
Scold me all you want.

149
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,575
Order me around and make fun of me.

150
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,578
Just make sure you stay around longer.

151
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,955
All right.

152
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,667
You must. Promise me.

153
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,129
I said I would.

154
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,321
I made too much.

155
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,038
Chief Hong.

156
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,956
Hey.

157
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,836
What is all that? Soap?

158
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,840
Yes. Do you want some?
I added a lot of tangerine peels.

159
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,342
Sounds good to me.

160
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,052
Have you eaten?

161
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,679
Not yet.

162
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,514
Why not?

163
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,392
Come on. I'll treat you to something good.

164
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,645
Why bother? Come inside.
I'll cook something up.

165
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,812
Then I'll cook.

166
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,946
This time,

167
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,157
I memorized the whole recipe.

168
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,618
It'll be good, so just wait a bit.

169
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,676
I see you still have these.

170
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,263
They're all dry now, aren't they?

171
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,057
I couldn't throw them out.

172
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,103
For some reason, I couldn't touch them.

173
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,704
You know,

174
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,709
they say when you lose a loved one,

175
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,253
you should mourn plenty.

176
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,423
If not,

177
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,636
Or else, the grief travels
all through your body,

178
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,973
and it bursts later.

179
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,021
FOR DU-SIK

180
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,750
Du-sik, you should eat.

181
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:28,338
No matter how hard life gets,
one should still eat.

182
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,679
Ever since you were a child,
you've been living with a broken heart,

183
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:40,392
and the only thing I could do for you
was cook you food.

184
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,856
You ate the food I made and grew so tall.

185
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,234
You have no idea how proud I was of you.

186
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,325
Du-sik, do you remember
what you said to me?

187
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,579
You said that the best thing
a parent can do for their child

188
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,414
is staying healthy.

189
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,667
It's the same with parents.

190
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,421
It tears our hearts out
when our children are in pain.

191
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:17,096
Du-sik, you are my son
and also my grandson.

192
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,058
Don't you ever forget that.

193
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:29,525
Du-sik, people should live
among other people.

194
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,237
Life may seem
like a burden to you at times,

195
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:38,492
but if you choose to be among others,

196
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,911
just like you did for me,

197
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,163
someone will carry you on their back.

198
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,460
So Du-sik,
stop locking yourself up in your house,

199
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,674
eat the food I made,
and come out to see us.

200
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,391
Doesn't she have the neatest handwriting?

201
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,272
Yes, it's very neat.

202
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:13,277
I once asked her…

203
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,573
why she never accepted my money.

204
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,159
and if it's because I wasn't family.

205
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,414
But she called me her son.

206
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,792
And also her grandson.

207
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,586
It's true.

208
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:09,166
That day, we said
our belated farewell to Ms. Gam-ri.

209
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,462
Despite so many losses
he's experienced in his life,

210
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,631
he's always kept his sorrow bottled up.

211
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,426
Not even once has he been
able to fully mourn or grieve.

212
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,429
For the first time, he cried his eyes out.

213
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,771
And the others, too, mourned Ms. Gam-ri

214
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,731
in their own ways.

215
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,818
She left this behind.

216
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,959
GONGJIN KOREAN-CHINESE RESTAURANT

217
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,384
BORA SUPERMARKET

218
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,842
And so we were able to learn

219
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,095
that as long as we have memories of them,

220
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:49,016
our loved ones are always with us.

221
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,630
ONE MONTH LATER

222
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,434
Ms. Wang, your hair is slick

223
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,561
as if you applied camellia oil.

224
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,396
Thanks.

225
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,025
You can also open
an oil shop with your hair.

226
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,026
It's that greasy.

227
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,989
We're done. We finally finished
editing the last episode!

228
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,115
Good job.

229
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,452
Let's applaud.

230
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,164
Thank you all for the hard work.

231
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,876
We should really shower on press day.

232
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,670
Right. We should
really go home for a change.

233
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,174
Another gastric pain?

234
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,427
-Yes, I must've been stressed out.
-I'll take you to the hospital.

235
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,763
No, it's not anything new.
It'll soon get better.

236
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,474
Do-ha, can you get her some warm water?

237
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,642
-Sure.
-Thanks.

238
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,356
At least rest at the lounge. Get up.

239
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,483
Come on.

240
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,368
There it is.

241
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,620
Here.

242
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:37,499
FAST-ACTING MEDICINE

243
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,960
This…

244
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:43,964
I figured you've run of this by now,
so I bought one in advance.

245
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,423
Take that for now.

246
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,802
Wait. I also should have…

247
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,097
Found it.

248
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:56,768
Jeez. Why do you have a heat pack
when summer only just ended?

249
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,354
Probably for this kind of occasion.

250
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,691
Here. Put it on your stomach.

251
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,073
Did you get a checkup?
An endoscopy too, right?

252
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,451
Yes, they said I was fine.
It's just the stress.

253
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,705
Let's stay away from spicy tteokbokki
for late-night snacks.

254
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,583
I'll get you some cabbage juice as well.

255
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,251
It does taste foul, but--

256
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,335
Director Ji.

257
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,421
Can you please…

258
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,632
stop being so nice to me?

259
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,679
You must know this by now,

260
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,473
but I have feelings for you.

261
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,519
I'm aware that you look out for me

262
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,147
and know everything about me

263
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,818
only because we've been
working together for so long.

264
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,654
It's like a habit now.

265
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,948
-Ji-won--
-But,

266
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,868
whenever you're like this,

267
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,080
I keep getting my hopes up.

268
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,795
It's why I can't work with you anymore.

269
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,614
Are you done packing?

270
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,033
I'm just getting started.

271
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,160
There's a lot to pack.

272
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,371
Thanks, Chief Hong.

273
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,499
Thank you for understanding.

274
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,962
It's a good opportunity, so you should go.

275
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,639
One might think that
you're moving to Seoul for good.

276
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,725
Hye-jin, why are you packing so much

277
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,270
for a three-day seminar?

278
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:13,113
Actually, I was offered
a clinical professor job.

279
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,283
In Seoul, I suppose.

280
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,743
Yes.

281
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,583
It's a good opportunity.

282
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,087
A very good one.

283
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,507
You always wanted to move back there.

284
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,176
I did.

285
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,638
Then, you should go…

286
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,392
since it's what you want.

287
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,024
You're quite dense, aren't you?

288
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,276
What?

289
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,862
"I did" as in past tense.

290
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,574
Do I have to rephrase it
in present or future tense for you?

291
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,118
I don't want to go to Seoul.

292
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,121
I'm staying right here.
I'm not going to Seoul.

293
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,456
Is it because of me?

294
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,541
What? Gosh.

295
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,960
Do you think of me as the submissive type?

296
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:13,298
I made this decision of my own free will.

297
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,926
There are a lot of things
I need to do here.

298
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,221
Cleaning the neighborhood,

299
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,058
visiting Seumseum at I-jun's,

300
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,145
and talking about DOS with Ju-ri.

301
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,648
Most importantly though,

302
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:35,320
I'm the one and only dentist Gongjin has.

303
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,282
And last but not least,

304
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,869
because you're here.

305
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,206
Thanks.

306
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,208
Thank you, Hye-jin.

307
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,794
I like this place too.

308
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,879
As much as you do.

309
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,718
I'm in love with Gongjin now.

310
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,061
Why not call a moving company?

311
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,313
Have professionals pack your bags for you.

312
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,401
Am I packing too much?

313
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,778
No, you can change 15 times a day.

314
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,655
Exactly. And it's doable for me.

315
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,656
It sure is.

316
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,493
-Good luck.
-I'll be back before you know it.

317
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,162
-Can you help me?
-This one still has its tag.

318
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,081
-Right.
-They must all be new.

319
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,542
Of course not. Not all of them.

320
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,045
What?

321
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,300
What are you looking for?

322
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,094
Yes, my lottery ticket.

323
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,888
I forgot to compare the numbers yesterday.

324
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,684
You really like
playing the lottery, don't you?

325
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,856
It's like a breath of fresh air
in this suffocating life of mine.

326
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,736
Can you look up
this week's winning numbers?

327
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,947
Sorry? Okay, just a second.

328
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,490
Here. Found it.

329
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,995
All right. Here you go.

330
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,038
Okay, let's see.

331
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,460
Six. Nice!

332
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,545
Eight.

333
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,173
Nine.

334
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,967
Twenty-four.

335
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,222
Thirty-six.

336
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,949
-Eun-cheol!
-Hold on.

337
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,786
We're good. We're all good now.

338
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,830
Our life is set.
We're settled for a lifetime.

339
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,290
My gosh!

340
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,464
-I can't believe it!
-Mi-seon--

341
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:03,593
-Is this really happening?
-These aren't right.

342
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,011
-It's…
-What do you mean?

343
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,596
They're not this week's numbers.

344
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,264
How can that be?

345
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,557
Well, I…

346
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,520
I think I showed you
last week's winning numbers.

347
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,979
WEEK 987

348
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,189
WEEK 988

349
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,573
Mi-seon.

350
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,078
I'm sorry.

351
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,042
Are you upset?

352
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,545
No.

353
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,215
I just feel like I lost my whole world.

354
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,718
My hopes and dreams are in shreds.

355
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,304
And I shaved years off my lifespan.

356
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,100
If you had really won the lottery,

357
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,102
what did you want to do?

358
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,231
I wanted to buy a house, of course.

359
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,694
A house that we could live in someday.

360
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,365
Mi-seon!

361
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,869
Follow me. We have someplace to go.

362
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,415
What do you think of this place?

363
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,499
What do you mean?

364
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:22,213
Would it be a nice spot for a house?

365
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,968
Of course, it would be nice.

366
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,973
However, my bank account says
it's pie in the sky.

367
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,558
Well…

368
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,022
BALANCE

369
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,358
Am I seeing things?
Why are there so many zeroes?

370
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,110
That's what I have left

371
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:48,072
from 1.4 billion won
after 33 percent in public charge and tax.

372
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,076
It was me.

373
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,704
The third mystery of Gongjin.

374
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,624
The lottery winner.

375
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:02,629
Hey, Eun-cheol.
I'm sorry. You must be busy studying.

376
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,422
The road hasn't been fixed, has it?

377
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,508
No, and it's still windy outside.
Is something up though?

378
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,929
Bo-ra hit I-jun again.
Can you believe her?

379
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,140
Can you close up the store
in about ten minutes?

380
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,934
Sure. Don't worry and take your time.

381
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,019
-Got it.
-Have a good one.

382
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,827
I mean, a ticket suddenly caught my eye,

383
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,996
so I tried it for the first time.

384
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,666
And I ended up winning.

385
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,418
But I never told anyone.

386
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:50,426
What's with all these withdrawals,
by the way? This is a lot.

387
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,428
I made donations.

388
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,932
-What?
-Back then,

389
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,143
I had been studying
to join the police academy for years.

390
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,438
But all this money

391
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,774
distracted me from my studies.

392
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,776
So I asked myself this.

393
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:10,989
"Choi Eun-cheol, what is it
that you really want to be?

394
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,491
Someone rich or a police officer?"

395
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,704
And it was a police officer.

396
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,458
And I wanted to be a police officer…

397
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,961
because

398
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,090
I wanted to make the world a better place.

399
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,301
And donating has the same purpose,

400
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,221
so I decided to contribute a little.

401
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:39,392
Eun-cheol, you really are too much,
you know that?

402
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,186
Sorry?

403
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,192
How can you be so cool?

404
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,820
How can a person be this perfect?

405
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,655
You're a diamond in the rough,

406
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:57,452
and I praise my own eyes
for actually discovering you.

407
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,538
Aren't you disappointed?

408
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,583
Well, truth be told,

409
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:08,880
for about three seconds,
I did think it was a pity a tiny bit.

410
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:14,719
But no. I'm never going
to besmirch your good deeds.

411
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:19,682
Besides, a man diligent enough to
get a job after winning the lottery

412
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,559
could do just about anything.

413
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,437
A house? We can build one if we decide to.

414
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,316
We can bring bricks here
and build it from the ground up ourselves.

415
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,694
Mi-seon, can you turn over the page?

416
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,864
You have some left.

417
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:46,667
A picturesque house up on that green hill.

418
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,712
What would you say to that?

419
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,884
With the man I love,

420
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,805
I'd spend a hundred years there.

421
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,852
-Eun-cheol.
-Yes?

422
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,354
I couldn't be happier.

423
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,583
Why are you groaning?

424
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,838
Seriously. I wish I didn't have to go.

425
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,466
Maybe it's not too late to cancel.

426
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,220
How can the presenter
not attend the seminar?

427
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,346
Still.

428
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,305
How can I manage

429
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,016
-without seeing you for days?
-Gosh.

430
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,228
I don't think I can.
Come to Seoul with me.

431
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,522
I'm afraid I can't
due to my busy schedule.

432
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,982
What do you have lined up?

433
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,441
Let's see.

434
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:56,529
I need to deliver anchovies, fix the nets,
and play with the chief's dog.

435
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,197
Bugyeong, right?

436
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,617
What? Are you saying they come before me?

437
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,955
Of course not. If I could,
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

438
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,582
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

439
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,041
I'd carry you in my suitcase.

440
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,459
-In your suitcase?
-Yes.

441
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:14,088
Get in my bag right now.
I'm going to run off with you.

442
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,756
-Should I?
-Is it too big for you?

443
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,341
No, it's the perfect size.

444
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,926
-The perfect size?
-I'm going in.

445
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,179
-I'm getting sick of this, you know.
-I mean it.

446
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,181
What do we do?

447
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,267
What am I going to do with you, Du-sik?

448
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,438
I feel a little under the weather.
Let's go to a sauna together.

449
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,690
I got a body scrub last week,
so go on your own.

450
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,483
It's already been a week.

451
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,028
Come on, let's go.
I'll treat you to sikhye.

452
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,321
You're offering to buy?

453
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,032
When have I never?
The offer stands just for you.

454
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,909
Scrubbing too often isn't good for you.

455
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,577
Come on. Let's go.

456
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,745
Hwa-jeong.

457
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,000
What the hell? Did you have plans?

458
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,544
No, I stopped by
after hearing she was here.

459
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,465
I see. Well, you two better
not have fun without me. Okay?

460
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,842
Can you stop being so clingy?

461
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,181
Hold on. Did you get a new phone?

462
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,724
Hello?

463
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,768
Right now? Got it.

464
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,020
Stay if you want.

465
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,146
Where are you off to?

466
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,815
-Yeong-guk wants to see me.
-What the…

467
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,317
Goodness.

468
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,902
Hwa-jeong, enjoy your date!

469
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,821
Goodness. Look at her run.

470
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,658
Be grateful to the one
who brought you two back together!

471
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,456
Gosh, hello.

472
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,460
Why did you ask me to come?

473
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:38,381
Because I wanted
to make something official.

474
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,216
Where do I work?

475
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,968
Is this a quiz? The town hall.

476
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,220
The name was changed ages ago.

477
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,472
It's now
the Administration and Welfare Center.

478
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,267
But I barely got used to Town Hall.

479
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,768
The new name's too long.

480
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,354
Then call it the AW Center for short.

481
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,733
Anyway, my official place of work is now
the Administration and Welfare Center,

482
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,779
and I also wish to be
your personal AW Center too.

483
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,660
I will be open 24/7
to answer your requests and complaints.

484
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,578
Look forward to timely solutions.

485
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,250
Are you sure you can
handle the complaints?

486
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,334
I'll be fine.

487
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,628
Bring it on.

488
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,715
Take a look around.
We're even giving out gifts.

489
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,967
No, wait. I'll bring it to you instead.

490
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,344
A gift? What would that be?

491
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,853
What's this?

492
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:38,316
Can't you see?
It's the same tonic you got me.

493
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,525
You call this a gift?

494
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,737
I know that it's not a fancy gift,

495
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,157
but all I could think of
was something for your health.

496
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,410
We're halfway through our lives,

497
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,788
so let's drink this and
travel until we're 80 with healthy joints.

498
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,832
You should dream bigger.

499
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,792
Make it 100.

500
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,629
Wow, Hwa-jeong.
You've always been the bolder one.

501
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,467
Give me one. I'll gulp down a packet.

502
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,553
A packet right now? Got it.

503
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,517
Here. Drink up.

504
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,771
Bottoms up.

505
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,400
Gosh.

506
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,904
My personal AW Center
provides good service.

507
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,158
I'm definitely happier.

508
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,207
Hwa-jeong…

509
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,085
Don't cry.

510
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,712
Don't you dare cry!

511
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,131
I won't. I won't cry.

512
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,536
No, no. Just stay seated.

513
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:17,039
Mother said that it's crucial
to recover well after giving birth.

514
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,374
I told you to stay home.

515
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,293
It's too stifling to stay in bed all day.

516
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,838
I'll be careful.
Besides, those boxes need to be moved.

517
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,840
I'll get to them, so sit.

518
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,175
-Yun-gyeong,
-Yes?

519
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,761
just sit there and watch. Okay?

520
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,438
Are you shitting me?

521
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,149
Yun-gyeong, is that Russian?

522
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,733
Did Igor teach you that?

523
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:48,320
I said I'd do it.
Why the hell do you have to insist?

524
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,363
Are you blind?

525
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:53,075
I liked it better
when she was pregnant and couldn't drink.

526
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,035
Yun-gyeong, how about a third child?

527
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,207
Are you seriously saying that when I'm
still recovering from having a damn baby?

528
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,461
Do you have a death wish,
you goddamn bastard?

529
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,047
Come here and die. Die, you piece of shit!

530
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,094
Oh, no. I broke another one.

531
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,471
Done.

532
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,430
Let me see.

533
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,516
You did it. Lucky you.

534
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,519
Could the heart-shaped one be easier?

535
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,938
That's what I should've bought.

536
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,107
Here.

537
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:26,901
It's for you.

538
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:27,943
What?

539
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,654
Choi Bo-ra,

540
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,451
you know what my giving you
a heart means, right?

541
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,995
Yes, of course. This heart right here?

542
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,540
It's just a shape.

543
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,125
It's tasty.

544
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,587
But I put a lot of effort into it.

545
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,797
And it meant a great deal.

546
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,468
Hey, let's go to your place
to look at Seumseum.

547
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,385
Sure.

548
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,485
Chief Hong!

549
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,154
Isn't Seoul too far away
to visit this often?

550
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,322
I came for lunch.

551
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,325
A little bird told me someone makes
a mean chicken porridge soup.

552
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,035
That place is closed today.

553
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,828
Why? I'd really like some!

554
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,167
Chief Hong, it doesn't actually
have to be chicken porridge soup.

555
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,878
The gambas was delicious enough.

556
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,004
Let's order some pizza.

557
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,258
What? Aren't you going to cook for me?

558
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,012
Leave now,

559
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,181
-and you can have dinner in Seoul.
-What…

560
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,518
I love pizza, you know.

561
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,311
It's the best.

562
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,897
All right.

563
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,359
-I'm a regular--
-Can you order two?

564
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,779
At least a large then.

565
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,201
There's an app I order often from.

566
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,120
It's quick.

567
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,205
What would you like? This one?

568
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,206
-This.
-This?

569
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,249
-Yes.
-This?

570
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,709
No, this one.

571
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,460
And the dough?

572
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,296
That.

573
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,505
All right.

574
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,634
It looks good.

575
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,719
Then let me…

576
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,187
-What?
-Are you kidding me?

577
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,648
-What do you mean?
-It's too delicious!

578
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:33,402
Unbelievable.
Do you always have to make such a fuss?

579
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,361
It's just pizza.

580
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,453
-You weren't wrong.
-Isn't it good?

581
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,997
-Gosh, it is.
-Goodness.

582
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:53,255
When we first met, I never imagined
we'd become good friends.

583
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,591
Life's pretty much the same for everyone.

584
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,593
But are we good friends?

585
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,762
Hey, are you saying we aren't?

586
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,514
I'm not sure.

587
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:07,519
Look. We're good friends.
You giving me garlic sauce proves it.

588
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,063
I more of a hot sauce guy.

589
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,703
That was delicious.

590
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,378
Now, tell me why you came here.

591
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,797
What do you mean? I just came for lunch.

592
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,258
I can see worries and anguish
written all over your face.

593
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,803
I drove to clear my head

594
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,472
-and ended up here.
-Then you didn't get lost.

595
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,352
I'm losing my way in life though.

596
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,438
Because of Ms. Wang?

597
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,569
We were always a team.

598
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,447
Even after fighting each other
over creative differences,

599
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,658
I always felt that we were a team.

600
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,826
But?

601
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:08,705
I hoped Ji-won would always be by my side.

602
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,834
So I'm scared

603
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,254
that if I make a hasty move,

604
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,132
I might lose her forever.

605
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,385
You're finally willing
to give it a try though.

606
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,975
Jeez. It's like staying indoors
because you're afraid it might rain

607
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,935
and starving, afraid of stomachaches.

608
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:34,481
Stop hesitating, or you'll lose out
on the chance once again.

609
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,032
Hello?

610
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,576
Right now?

611
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,411
Okay, I'll be right there.

612
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,623
I'm sorry about this, but duty calls.

613
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,041
Sure.

614
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,919
-I'll wash the dishes.
-Thanks!

615
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,847
WRITER WANG

616
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:27,576
WANG JI-WON CELEBRATING
END OF HER FIRST SHOW

617
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,671
Oh, my.

618
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,049
-Hye-jin.
-Hi.

619
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,009
-Hi.
-Shall we head inside?

620
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,887
-Isn't the weather great?
-It sure is.

621
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,642
I'm sorry your dad wasn't
able to spend time with you.

622
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,810
Did you hear he went to a funeral?

623
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,646
Yes, we talked on the phone.

624
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,817
I've been meaning to treat you
to a tasty meal anyway, Mother.

625
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:02,736
What?

626
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,741
I see. Well, it's good.
It's absolutely delicious.

627
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,369
-Please enjoy.
-Sure.

628
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,120
Is Chief Hong well?

629
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,540
Yes, he's doing great.

630
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,125
I'll bring him to Seoul sometime.

631
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,170
We should have a meal together
like we did in Gongjin.

632
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,256
Hye-jin,

633
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:27,553
do you remember when I invited you over
when you were in college?

634
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,887
The day we first met.

635
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,764
Yes.

636
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,643
To be honest,
I was extremely nervous at first.

637
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,313
Then you ate a piece of my braised potato

638
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,899
and said that it was delicious.

639
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,986
That was it.

640
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:47,447
Things were still awkward,
so we kept eating quietly,

641
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,410
but it warmed my heart to hear that.

642
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,913
That's when I thought

643
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,917
that joining your family
wouldn't be such a bad idea.

644
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,420
That having meals together every day,

645
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,047
praising the food,
and telling each other to eat up

646
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,633
would be quite nice.

647
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:11,013
The braised potatoes were divine.

648
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,057
I'll cook them for you again.

649
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,560
When you bring Chief Hong to Seoul,
come to the house.

650
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,353
Okay.

651
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,398
As you know, we have four seats
around our dining table.

652
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,736
We have room for him.

653
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:29,072
I'll make sure we visit soon.

654
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,157
Good.

655
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,338
Chief Hong, don't you read comic books?

656
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,090
My favorite is The Rose of Versailles.

657
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,262
Chief Hong, how about
we open the Chinese bush clover wine?

658
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,849
If you're up for it, I mean.

659
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,312
You should eat more braised beans.

660
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:03,774
They may not seem tasty at first,
but they get sweeter as you chew.

661
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,067
Eat more of them.

662
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,623
I miss her like crazy.

663
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,343
It sure is sweet.

664
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,722
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

665
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,275
Du-sik. What are you doing?

666
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,861
Can't you see? I'm brewing coffee.

667
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,406
No, you're not. What are you doing?

668
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,825
What on earth?

669
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,077
-Damn it.
-What were you thinking?

670
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,955
You didn't even notice it spilling.

671
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,707
It's nothing.

672
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,002
Jeez.

673
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,881
Chun-jae, I'm sorry,
but I need to step out for a bit.

674
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,551
-Can you make the rest?
-Sure. Are you all right?

675
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,262
Damn, it's hot! You bastard!

676
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,934
Wait. Were my fingerprints burned off?

677
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:30,861
Chief Hong!

678
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,372
-I missed you so much.
-I missed you too.

679
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,756
I'm going to marry Chief Hong.

680
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:56,136
Go ahead. I'm planning
to get married next spring,

681
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,512
so catch my bouquet first.

682
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,014
I'm going to propose tomorrow.

683
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,223
What?

684
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,477
Is tomorrow too soon?
How about the day after that?

685
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,897
Of course. I shouldn't have
expected any less from Yoon Hye-jin.

686
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,691
Why on earth are you rushing it?

687
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,029
Because I don't like seeing him all alone.

688
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,824
I want to be his family.

689
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,036
Hye-jin,

690
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,830
when did you grow up?

691
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,249
Will you catch my bouquet?

692
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,836
Hye-jin, don't get ahead of yourself.

693
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,588
Chief Hong might say no.

694
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,423
I doubt it.

695
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,510
That never crossed my mind.

696
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,971
Don't sweat it. He'll say yes
if your proposal is good enough.

697
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:41,723
What do you have in mind?

698
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,977
Well, I thought about it
while driving back to Gongjin,

699
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,730
but I came up with nothing.

700
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,649
Maybe I lack creativity.

701
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:54,945
No, Korea's education system is to blame.

702
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,573
You're only a victim
of the nation's rote learning method.

703
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:02,619
I want it to be a proposal
that he'll never forget.

704
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,831
What could be a good idea?

705
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:09,543
If you're drawing a blank,
then go back to the basics.

706
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,921
Don't try to come up with something grand,

707
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,799
and slowly think about
your memories with him.

708
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:20,011
That is where you will find your answer!

709
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,143
What is it?

710
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,938
You're amazing. You're a genius.

711
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,958
MS. DENTIST

712
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,335
Chief Hong, meet me at the beach.

713
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:11,855
Gosh.

714
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,190
What are you thinking about?

715
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:19,654
Well, I was reminded
of the day we first met.

716
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,824
We were both such a mess.

717
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,702
Absolutely. It was the worst.

718
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,540
It probably wasn't just me.

719
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,709
You must've

720
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,670
found me extremely peculiar too.

721
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,757
A woman you just met

722
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,093
asked you to find her shoe for her
and lend her money.

723
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,514
We butt heads all day.

724
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,148
But the crashing waves of that day…

725
00:53:56,441 --> 00:54:00,028
brought us to this moment right here,

726
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,948
just like these shoes came back to me.

727
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,164
I'd love it

728
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,249
if our shoes…

729
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,337
were always side by side
at the door together.

730
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,633
So that neither would be lonely.

731
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,303
Chief Hong.

732
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,724
Will you marry me?

733
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,434
No.

734
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,269
-What?
-No.

735
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,604
Don't you want to?

736
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,649
No, that's not what I mean. I…

737
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:41,152
Why… I mean, why are you…

738
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:44,990
What's wrong?

739
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,040
I was going to propose to you today too.

740
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,917
I wanted to ask you first.

741
00:54:56,918 --> 00:55:00,088
I've been preparing it for ages.
How could this…

742
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,423
You beat me to it.

743
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:05,010
Well, it doesn't really matter
who does it first.

744
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,554
What matters is
that we're on the same page.

745
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:12,100
All right, then.
You take the lead from here.

746
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,144
I'll hand over the baton.

747
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,563
Consider this a relay race.

748
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:20,817
You're the last runner,
so run towards that finish line.

749
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,818
Go ahead.

750
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,445
How can I do it after that?

751
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,280
No, you can do this.

752
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,489
You got this.

753
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:40,045
You said our first encounter
was on the worst terms.

754
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,132
Not for me though.

755
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,140
I saw a woman on the beach that day.

756
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,185
She sat there for a long time,

757
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,313
but all I could see
was sadness in her eyes.

758
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,943
And I couldn't get it out of my mind,

759
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,197
so my eyes kept being drawn to her.

760
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,328
But I never thought…

761
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,540
that I'd fall in love with her.

762
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,933
Chief Hong!

763
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:38,353
I worked 637 hours
to get you this necklace.

764
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,814
Don't you dare sell it online.

765
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,526
But this is expensive.

766
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,321
I won't sell it. Ever.

767
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,532
I will never sell it.

768
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,119
Two pairs of shoes by the door,

769
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,788
two toothbrushes in the bathroom,

770
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,082
and two aprons in the kitchen.

771
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,377
Everything will be in pairs.

772
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:06,798
In a house where we keep those,
will you enjoy today, tomorrow,

773
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,384
and all of your time…

774
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,011
with me?

775
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,519
I love you.

776
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,063
I love you too.

777
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,798
God, it's cold! What?

778
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:49,841
What?

779
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,429
Your shoe!

780
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,264
What? No, my shoe!

781
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,352
-What are you up to?
-Oh, this?

782
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:46,147
I'm drafting an agreement
for married life.

783
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:49,442
Jeez, Hye-jin, how far ahead are you?

784
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,862
I like planning my life ahead,
but to the extreme.

785
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,949
So tell me. What have you written so far?

786
00:58:56,491 --> 00:59:00,787
First of all, I'm terrible in the kitchen.

787
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,622
You know what happens.

788
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,332
I know it all too well.

789
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:06,626
Don't you ever get your hands wet.

790
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,670
Nice. Lucky me.

791
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:14,300
In return, I'll make sure
you always have healthy teeth.

792
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,761
I'm the luckier one. I love it.

793
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,555
Really? So that'll be my job.

794
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,932
However, I do like doing the laundry.

795
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:24,852
All the pricey clothes I have
require proper maintenance.

796
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,604
Okay. Then leave the cleaning to me.

797
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,983
All right. Cleaning goes to Chief Hong.

798
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,234
CHIEF HONG

799
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:33,945
By the way,

800
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,533
how much longer will you be an area chief?

801
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,119
I've never thought about that. Why?

802
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:45,832
If it's the community you wish to serve,

803
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,335
there are other titles to consider.

804
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,588
Broaden your horizons a little.

805
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,340
Above the area chief is the zone chief.

806
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,344
You know, Hwa-jeong's term is almost over.

807
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,847
-No, aim a little higher.
-What?

808
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,600
Well, for instance,

809
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:07,562
there's also a city councilor
or a congressman.

810
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:11,274
Again with that ambition of yours.

811
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:17,030
It's just that you're too good
to stay as a mere area chief.

812
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,573
You're adorable.

813
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:22,452
Speaking of which,
when will you stop calling me Chief Hong?

814
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,287
What should I call you then?

815
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,873
Say my name like I say yours.

816
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,250
Your name?

817
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,461
Your name…

818
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,755
Du-sik.

819
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,633
Du-sik.

820
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,638
Why does your name have to be so funny?

821
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,057
How can you say that one's name is funny?

822
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,559
It's not even funny in a cute way.

823
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,772
Then I guess you can call me oppa.

824
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:54,484
-You said you'd kill me if I did.
-That was then, and this is now.

825
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,402
Oppa.

826
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:58,613
Oppa.

827
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,616
Oppa…

828
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,286
That's weird.
It still gives me the chills.

829
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,371
My hair is standing.

830
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,498
So what should I call you?

831
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,543
If not that or your name,

832
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,961
how about jagi?

833
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,129
I quite like that.

834
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,297
You like it?

835
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,590
Yes, I do.

836
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,760
As you know, jagi also means oneself.

837
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:22,804
So it feels like

838
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,722
I'm you

839
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,600
and you've become me in a way.

840
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,810
Jagi.

841
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,855
I'm you, and you're me.

842
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,457
I'm not going home tonight.

843
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,252
I wasn't going to let you.

844
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:50,016
All right.

845
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,365
-Are you awake?
-Yes.

846
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,534
You must be hungry.

847
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,995
I made toast and eggs for you. Try some.

848
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:12,288
It's all right.

849
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,664
Don't you want to eat?

850
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:17,794
It's just that
I can't use my hands right now.

851
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,880
I'm not dressed yet.

852
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,757
Then…

853
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,926
stay as you are. I'll feed you.

854
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,887
-Just a second.
-Sure.

855
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,434
Open wide.

856
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,562
There you go. Is it good?

857
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,232
It's delicious. Can I have some milk?

858
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,652
Milk? Just a second.
Be careful not to spill.

859
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:53,371
This is nice.
I love the room service you provide.

860
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,581
I'll do this for you
every day from now on.

861
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,041
Okay.

862
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,627
-One more.
-One more?

863
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,128
Here.

864
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,592
Two would be nice.

865
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,886
-What?
-Kids.

866
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,013
An only child would be lonely,

867
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,432
and three would be too difficult,

868
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,310
so two will be nice regardless of gender.

869
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,312
Two?

870
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,858
I guess we should get busy then.

871
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,863
-What time is it?
-Nine o'clock.

872
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,407
The neighborhood cleaning!

873
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,950
Don't be ridiculous.

874
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:34,120
We should skip it today.
We're allowed to at times.

875
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:38,082
Other people may,
but not me and the one I love.

876
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,626
Get out of bed already.
And breakfast is over.

877
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,212
But I only got one bite.

878
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,423
-Chop-chop!
-Fine.

879
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:49,093
But you want two kids.
Shouldn't we get on it?

880
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,346
We're late. Come on.

881
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,056
Gosh.

882
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,558
Hye-jin, here.

883
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,018
-Is this in my size?
-Yes.

884
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:58,394
Are you sure it's mine?

885
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:01,230
-Over here.
-You call that sweeping?

886
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:04,150
It's clean enough, so stop it.

887
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,152
-Good morning.
-Are they just joining us?

888
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,613
-We already swept over here.
-Don't mind us.

889
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,406
-Keep sweeping.
-Aren't you hungry?

890
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,450
-Let's get going.
-We should have breakfast.

891
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,076
-Sure.
-Wait for me.

892
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,620
We're getting married.

893
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,414
-What?
-What?

894
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:19,957
We're getting married.

895
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,209
Say something.

896
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,420
We're…

897
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,422
really getting married.

898
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:28,215
-What?
-Really?

899
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,984
Why are you so late?
There's only ten minutes left!

900
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:31,070
Sorry. The clock
in the living room was broken.

901
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:33,823
Seriously, you're such a slacker
unless you're working.

902
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,074
Is it this way?

903
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,742
-Wait.
-What is it?

904
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,452
What? I see.

905
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,832
-Am I good?
-Good.

906
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,793
-Let's go.
-Director Ji, your shoes!

907
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:48,337
-Change your shoes.
-Right.

908
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,885
Hey.

909
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:58,639
What are you going to do without me?

910
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,141
I can't do without you.

911
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,395
Since you've brought it up,

912
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:07,356
let's discuss my idea for my next show.

913
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,193
And get a bite to eat after.
I know all the great spots.

914
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,404
-What are you doing?
-What else?

915
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:17,074
I'm asking you out to eat.
Just the two of us.

916
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:21,370
Not only that, we have so much to do.

917
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,582
We have so many places to go
in the country and overseas.

918
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:28,210
Next time, let's climb up
the Florence Cathedral without fail.

919
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,422
You couldn't go up last time
because of me.

920
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:34,842
Seong-hyeon…

921
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:40,973
No matter how hard I think about it,

922
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,560
eating, playing, and working…

923
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,563
I want to do it all with you.

924
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,108
I hope…

925
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,403
you continue to stay busy with me, Ji-won.

926
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:05,748
We're late, you know. Hurry up.

927
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,959
Let's go.

928
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,127
Run!

929
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,908
"With high hopes, Director Ji added that,

930
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:44,662
'The Seashore Grasshopper can help us
find joy in our slow-paced everyday life

931
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:49,875
and reset what we view as true happiness.'

932
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:54,672
The Seashore Grasshopper
premieres on the 23rd at 9:10 p.m."

933
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,051
-There you go.
-We'll definitely watch!

934
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,554
Must you embarrass me
by reading it out loud?

935
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,097
How can I not?

936
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:06,600
I didn't realize Seoul was so closeby,
he's here too often.

937
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,394
Don't be mean to him.

938
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:12,064
-Visit often, Seong-hyeon.
-Sure thing.

939
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:16,485
Did you really come all this way
to watch the premiere with us?

940
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,195
Yes, I really wanted to.

941
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,991
You're the hidden heroes
that made the show happen!

942
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,617
No, hold that thought!

943
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,453
-The true hero of the show is DOS.
-Oh gosh.

944
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,496
Don't say that.

945
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,416
I'm glad you came. The more, the merrier.

946
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,001
-Of course.
-Hold on a second.

947
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:34,753
Did I call my daughter
to tell her to watch the show?

948
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,214
-I call ten percent ratings.
-Director Ji, hold on.

949
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:40,801
The scene we're in
isn't in the first episode, right?

950
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,888
Was my outburst
edited out of the final cut?

951
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:46,432
Our Bo-ra will be watching, you see.

952
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,935
I wasn't aware of it that day,
but my armpits were like, you know.

953
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,605
Jeez, how embarrassing.

954
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:56,233
We'll be able to see Gam-ri again.

955
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,657
-Goodness.
-Granny Gam-ri.

956
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,910
-You're right.
-I miss her.

957
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,536
Hey! The show's starting!

958
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,998
-All right.
-Here we go. The show's airing.

959
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:12,708
Can you make the screen brighter?

960
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,544
-Dad, I think it's your age.
-Take off your shades at night.

961
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,255
-Right.
-You're unbelievable.

962
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,554
Double-digit ratings in this day and age?

963
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:30,809
No wonder Director Ji
didn't choose a career in music.

964
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,603
That's pure talent right there.

965
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:36,774
Of course. You'd expect nothing less
when the show features a celeb--

966
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,528
It's from Seoul. Who could it be?

967
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,199
Hello, who's calling?

968
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:46,784
Yes, hello.

969
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,995
-Is this singer Oh Yoon I'm speaking to?
-What?

970
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:54,416
Right! Yes, that's me. What is this about?

971
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,711
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of
the JKBC show, Sugar People.

972
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,088
What did you just say?

973
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:04,093
We were hoping to have you on the show
as a former legend in the industry.

974
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:05,844
Sure thing.

975
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,682
Dad, I'm hungry. Give me food.
My stomach's completely hollow.

976
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,225
-Ju-ri.
-What?

977
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:15,271
-Can you pinch my cheek?
-No way.

978
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:18,274
Your face is too greasy.
I don't want to touch it.

979
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:22,569
-Just this once.
-But it's slippery.

980
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:26,865
Let go!

981
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,911
I didn't mean for you
to do it so hard like that!

982
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,913
But you told me to pinch you.

983
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,623
Anyway, it hurts.

984
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:41,338
My cheek is throbbing.
I felt all of the pain.

985
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,132
Dad, what's with you?

986
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,010
-Ju-ri.
-Yes?

987
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,762
-I'll going to be on Sugar People.
-What?

988
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,640
-I'll be on Sugar People.
-What? Really?

989
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:55,644
-Hold on a second. Where is it?
-What's wrong?

990
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,691
Dad, do you know who the other guests are?

991
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:01,942
Could it be DOS?

992
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:06,447
-I said I'll be on Sugar People.
-So tell me about DOS.

993
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:09,575
-Why would you ask about Dos?
-They're called D-O-S.

994
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:12,036
Didn't you hear that
I'll be on Sugar People?

995
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:13,537
So? What about it?

996
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:18,375
The Seashore Grasshopper helped
Chun-jae become the singer Oh Yoon again.

997
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:22,880
And the other villagers
received their own gifts as well.

998
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:25,132
-Can we have more side dishes?
-Sure.

999
01:12:25,215 --> 01:12:28,093
-The food is delicious.
-Really? Gosh, thank you.

1000
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,555
-Ma'am, when will our dish be served?
-Your fish stew is nearly ready.

1001
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:33,098
-We've been--
-It won't be long.

1002
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:37,186
Coming! Aren't you a sweetheart
for ordering two dishes?

1003
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:38,937
-Ma'am.
-Yes, I'll be right over.

1004
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,565
-I see you're finished
-The food was great.

1005
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:44,151
-Thank you. Please come again.
-Thank you.

1006
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:47,279
You can sit right here.
I'll clear the table for you. Thank you.

1007
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,990
This right here is the autograph
of a DOS member.

1008
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,076
-You've heard of DOS, right?
-Of course.

1009
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:53,911
You may take a photo.

1010
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:57,164
The short but blindingly bright summer

1011
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:59,416
had Gongjin bustling.

1012
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:21,855
And the blissful days
continued to pour in.

1013
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,616
So what's the next show about?

1014
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:37,371
I always develop my ideas
based on my interests.

1015
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,834
First food, then traveling.
So what are you now interested in?

1016
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:45,129
How about a dating show
with non-celebrities?

1017
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:46,672
What?

1018
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,591
Viewers will get to see
if there can be something more

1019
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,428
between those who have been
in the friend zone for years.

1020
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,100
Like us?

1021
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,396
Yes, like us.

1022
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:08,068
Got it.

1023
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:11,363
Good. I like that idea.

1024
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,907
-Wasn't it Pinocchio who sang that song?
-That's right.

1025
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,868
Since his nose grows when he lies.

1026
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,245
Yes, exactly. Get that down, Ji-won.

1027
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,622
Pinocchio has a nose that…

1028
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,418
Something in the air seems off.

1029
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:29,465
It's too stuffy.

1030
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:34,761
Is an air purifier really too much to ask?

1031
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:37,473
I doubt that's something
to smile about though.

1032
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:38,724
Any good news, Do-ha?

1033
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:43,061
My dad walked for the first time
with his leg braces on.

1034
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,606
Really? That's great.

1035
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:47,900
Yes, it's a miracle.

1036
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,401
It sure is.

1037
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,820
How is his overall health doing?

1038
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,447
-He's good.
-Really?

1039
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:55,115
Don't you worry, Do-ha.

1040
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,034
I'm not worried at all.

1041
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:58,118
Have a seat.

1042
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:02,080
You should be worried
about this meeting though.

1043
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,373
Got any ideas?

1044
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:16,512
Jagi, how do I look?

1045
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:33,946
Absolutely stunning.

1046
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,073
-Really?
-Yes.

1047
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:38,617
The clothes, I mean.
Outfits can change one's image.

1048
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:41,912
-Are you kidding me?
-Where are they?

1049
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:43,080
Where are what?

1050
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:46,500
Your wings.
Shouldn't an angel have a pair?

1051
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:48,168
I set them aside today.

1052
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:50,254
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1053
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:51,380
Well, you're stunning.

1054
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:52,923
-Really?
-Yes.

1055
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:59,429
Who knew your birthday gift
would be your wedding photo suit?

1056
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:01,181
I should have bought a nicer one.

1057
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:04,393
Forget it. I'm fond of this one.
It's more than enough.

1058
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:08,605
Okay. Let's get you a better one
for the wedding though.

1059
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:13,151
You haven't forgotten about
the dress fitting next week, right?

1060
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:16,905
-Already?
-The wedding is right around the corner.

1061
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,574
We can't afford to lose focus.

1062
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,660
What about booking a tour bus for the day?

1063
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,371
We need to bring
everyone in Gongjin to Seoul.

1064
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:26,415
-I already booked one.
-Good job.

1065
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:28,458
I'm a bit surprised though.

1066
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:31,753
I thought you'd want
to shoot photos at a studio.

1067
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:35,048
Well, the concept of our wedding
is "harmony," you see.

1068
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:40,304
It's a collaboration
between glamour and simplicity.

1069
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:47,102
Besides, the wedding's in Seoul,

1070
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:49,980
so I wanted to take the photos in Gongjin.

1071
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,567
It's where our lives crossed paths

1072
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,445
and where we'll continue to live.

1073
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:01,575
Shall we?

1074
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:13,837
Let's go.

1075
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:16,757
Can you believe how good the weather is?

1076
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,634
-Let's take great photos.
-Sure.

1077
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:20,344
-What on earth?
-My gosh.

1078
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:21,928
Are you taking your own photos?

1079
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:24,222
Yes, we thought we'd keep it small.

1080
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,433
You two look amazing today.

1081
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:29,561
But don't you need a young assistant
to help you take your photos?

1082
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,313
Let me be of help. I can do that.

1083
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:33,607
-It's all right.
-There's no need for that.

1084
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:35,525
No need to decline. Don't be sorry.

1085
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,862
I'll hold your veil,
assist you with your dress,

1086
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:40,781
and retouch your makeup.

1087
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:42,366
I'm really fine with my makeup.

1088
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:45,035
You once said you liked this shade.
It's strawberry milk.

1089
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:47,537
-This will look much better on you.
-But we're fine.

1090
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:50,040
-It's really fine--
-Where are you headed? Over there?

1091
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:52,417
-The view over there is better.
-Can you at least breathe?

1092
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,961
-Nam-suk--
-You both look stunning today.

1093
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,422
I looked just like her
on my wedding day as well.

1094
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,633
-You sure did.
-Come on. Let's go.

1095
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:01,134
-I can't believe this.
-I'm good.

1096
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,427
-Are you all right?
-Yes. Hold on.

1097
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,679
Wait for us then.

1098
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:06,932
You guys look incredible.

1099
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:08,600
Guys, I came rushing over.

1100
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,310
-Chun-jae, that was fast.
-I came running.

1101
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:11,728
I called him over.

1102
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,605
-You look amazing.
-Doesn't she?

1103
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,608
It's just good old me, so be at ease.

1104
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:20,153
-A wedding must have music.
-What will you sing?

1105
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,784
-Du-sik! We have experience.
-Wait for us!

1106
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:28,286
You'll need help with the poses,

1107
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:31,039
-so let us coach you.
-Doesn't she look stunning?

1108
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:34,251
You can retouch the shape of your body,
but not your facial expression!

1109
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:36,670
-Now, smile for us.
-Goodness.

1110
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:38,880
-Smile!
-You look incredible!

1111
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:44,678
-Guys!
-You came! Doesn't she look nice?

1112
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:47,764
-Nice!
-Okay, we're here as well.

1113
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:50,809
How long has it been
since we had a wedding in this town?

1114
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,060
Goodness.

1115
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,856
Gam-ri, are you watching this?

1116
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:58,066
-Du-sik is getting married!
-Du-sik!

1117
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,943
-Let's go.
-Here we go.

1118
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:02,988
-All right.
-Can you make sure her dress doesn't drag?

1119
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,865
Off we go!

1120
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:08,368
You must be thrilled
to have us all congratulate you.

1121
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,912
Is Uncle Du-sik seriously in a suit?

1122
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,330
Hey, Ju-ri!

1123
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:13,874
Hye-jin, was that dress the best option?

1124
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:16,168
-Ju-ri.
-Ju-ri!

1125
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,169
Is it a Sunday?

1126
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:18,503
Stop that.

1127
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:22,007
Whatever. Let's just get going.

1128
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,972
Our very own Chief Hong is getting married

1129
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:31,725
Mi-seon, why don't we join them
and learn a few things?

1130
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:34,478
This is all because
you have a singer in the mix.

1131
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,188
Guys, hurry on over.

1132
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,445
I don't even know anymore.

1133
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:48,700
-Come on!
-Du-sik, watch this.

1134
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:51,203
Don't tense up. Relax!

1135
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,664
Let's go!

1136
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:03,048
One, two, three.

1137
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:07,427
-Congratulations
-How was that good

1138
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:10,472
when her veil was covering her face?
Let's take another one.

1139
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:11,723
-It's okay--
-Take it again.

1140
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,266
Honey, do something about the sun.

1141
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,143
Don't worry. It's fine.

1142
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:18,021
-We're fine. Really.
-You can't sweat.

1143
01:20:18,104 --> 01:20:19,314
No, like this.

1144
01:20:19,397 --> 01:20:22,484
Don't stay over there
and get back behind the camera.

1145
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:24,528
Are these really self-shot wedding photos?

1146
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,321
Beats me.

1147
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:29,282
It looks stunning from here too.
Why don't you move this way?

1148
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:32,077
-The sea will be in the photo as well.
-She's right.

1149
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,496
I totally feel a song coming to me.

1150
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:37,123
These are wedding photos,
so shouldn't there

1151
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,417
-at least be one of you kissing?
-No, we're good.

1152
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,419
What? No, a kiss isn't necessary.

1153
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:44,422
Exactly! A kiss in public
will be too embarrassing for everyone.

1154
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:48,510
One should have a kissing photo.
We have one too, right?

1155
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:50,554
I wouldn't mind recreating it.

1156
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:52,138
Jagi,

1157
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:53,682
can you do something?

1158
01:20:54,307 --> 01:20:55,517
Step a little closer to each other.

1159
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,602
-Kiss for the camera.
-But what's important is…

1160
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,354
Run on the count of three.

1161
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,314
-Got it.
-All right.

1162
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:02,732
One…

1163
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,193
Two…

1164
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:07,195
Three!

1165
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:08,238
Hye-jin!

1166
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:10,490
-Where are you going?
-Thanks, everyone!

1167
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:13,159
We'll take the rest ourselves!

1168
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:15,829
-But…
-We love you!

1169
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,623
Good luck!

1170
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,126
-Be happy, guys.
-Goodness.

1171
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:24,421
-It's too bad.
-Ju-ri, that can be you as well.

1172
01:21:24,504 --> 01:21:25,714
Gosh.

1173
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,718
-I'm going to marry JUNE.
-Is that so?

1174
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,481
-I doubt they'll follow us up here.
-Of course.

1175
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,358
They all hate hiking up hills.

1176
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:47,152
I hate it too.

1177
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:51,239
-And I had to run in heels.
-You did well.

1178
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,494
SUN-IM

1179
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,247
"The Sun-im" is the name of this boat?

1180
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,166
-Yes.
-It's adorable.

1181
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,709
The Sun-im.

1182
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:04,920
-It sounds like someone's name.
-It is.

1183
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:05,962
My grandma's.

1184
01:22:06,963 --> 01:22:08,924
Gosh. Was it named after your grandmother?

1185
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,259
I'm sorry about that.

1186
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:15,597
Your grandfather
must've been totally romantic.

1187
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,057
Couldn't you have learned from him?

1188
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:19,100
-What?
-This boat.

1189
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:21,645
If it was given to you
by your grandfather,

1190
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:25,607
could I write my name here
in small letters?

1191
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:26,733
No, you can't.

1192
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:30,904
I'll write it up front
in big bold letters.

1193
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,116
All right.

1194
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,788
I'll be at the front of the boat
making sure you have a clear path.

1195
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:43,917
The sea won't always
be this gentle though.

1196
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,421
We will be met with wind and waves.
And even typhoons will come our way.

1197
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,048
So what if we get soaked in rain?

1198
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,843
Who cares if the wind blows a bit…

1199
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:56,596
when we're in the same boat?

1200
01:22:58,974 --> 01:22:59,975
Let's take a photo.

1201
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,521
Let's take it together, ma'am.

1202
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:09,693
-All right. Here we go.
-Hurry.

1203
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:11,569
There. One…

1204
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:14,114
Let me wind it up.

1205
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,616
-How will they turn out?
-It'll be great.

1206
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:20,328
Okay, here we go again.

1207
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,207
-Next will be the André Kim pose.
-The André Kim pose?

1208
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:26,001
We'll be able to nail this one.

1209
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:28,086
One, two…

1210
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:33,425
-Hold on. Let me get this call.
-Me too.

1211
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:36,636
-Hello?
-Hello?

1212
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,971
-What?
-What?

1213
01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:39,931
-You tripped?
-You tore the inside of your mouth?

1214
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,057
-Where?
-Where?

1215
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:44,144
-Ms. Mat-i?
-Ms. Lee?

1216
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:47,313
Jeez.

1217
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,523
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE DO-YEOP

1218
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:35,899
