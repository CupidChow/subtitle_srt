1
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,344
I like you.

2
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,685
I have feelings for you.

3
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,986
I'm one of those people
who plan every second of their lives

4
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,114
according to a lifespan of 99 years.

5
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,410
I don't like people crossing the line
or crossing it myself.

6
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,662
And I'm fond of expensive shoes.

7
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,832
I guess I'm your complete opposite.

8
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,505
It's the same with
our blood types and personalities.

9
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,132
I bet we're not compatible in any aspect.

10
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,928
We're probably as different as
penguins that eat krill

11
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,723
and polar bears that feed on sea lions.

12
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,686
But to hell with all of that…

13
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,066
because I like you.

14
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,445
Ms. Dentist, I--

15
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,532
Don't say anything.

16
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,077
I'm not asking anything from you.

17
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,706
I… My feelings for you
keep inflating my heart,

18
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,335
and it could burst at any second.

19
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,551
I can't help it anymore.

20
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,804
I…

21
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,017
I can't…

22
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,811
deny it anymore either.

23
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,028
I should go now.

24
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,198
Wait. You can't just leave like this.

25
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,951
I said and heard everything

26
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,953
that I wanted.

27
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,537
But I said like one sentence.

28
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:12,168
I see. But that kiss
was more than enough--

29
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,169
I like you.

30
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,257
You told me
your feelings for me so honestly.

31
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,176
I should give you a proper reply.

32
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,844
I also have

33
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,514
feelings for you.

34
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,065
That's what happened.
No. I couldn't help it.

35
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,739
Now that we've shared a kiss

36
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,492
and confessed our love,

37
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,328
-what's next?
-What do you think?

38
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,332
It's this.

39
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,001
Let's go.

40
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,384
By the way, I'm the penguin,
and you're the polar bear, right?

41
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,302
What?

42
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,723
It's obvious,
judging by our personalities and builds.

43
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,892
Sea lions? I bet you could feed
on humans too.

44
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,061
Hey.

45
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,691
That's it. I'm talking about that glare.

46
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,234
You're so annoying.

47
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,652
You got me.

48
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,737
Come on.

49
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,305
Your ankles must hurt.

50
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,349
It's okay. The heels are pretty,
and that's all that matters.

51
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,618
We're already home.

52
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,120
You're right.

53
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,207
Does this mean
we're officially in a relationship?

54
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,294
Well… You can mark it
on your calendar if you want.

55
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,803
Actually, wait. Can we hold off
being a couple for a few days?

56
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,180
What? Why?

57
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:33,184
Well, Seong-hyeon
told me that he liked me.

58
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,898
Why do you have to tell me that now,

59
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,275
when we're just starting to date?

60
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,360
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,071
I saw it coming,
though it was sooner than expected.

62
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,073
-When did this happen?
-On Tuesday.

63
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,992
On the day
of my grandpa's death anniversary?

64
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,035
Hold on.

65
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,289
It happened on the day
you helped me hold the memorial service?

66
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,961
It's not like that.
He was waiting in front of my house--

67
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,256
I don't want to hear it. Does it mean
you haven't given him an answer?

68
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:09,137
Why not? Are you having second thoughts
now that you have to dump him?

69
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,639
It's not like that.

70
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,808
-Are you jealous?
-Jealous?

71
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,853
That's absurd.

72
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:21,441
I'm talking about
the basic etiquette you need to keep

73
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,901
when someone confesses
their feelings to you.

74
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,571
If someone serves the ball,
you have to hit it back, not dodge.

75
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,325
To call it in or out,
you need to give him a straight answer.

76
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,994
Then what about you?

77
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,497
Why didn't you do anything
if you had known it all along?

78
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,793
Perhaps, you didn't care
if he'd ask me out.

79
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,129
Back then, I didn't know
I liked you this much.

80
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,345
So, exactly how much do you like me?

81
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,226
Well… Quite a bit.

82
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,106
I'm sure you won't be disappointed
by the amount.

83
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,610
Gosh, I was expecting
a lovey-dovey answer.

84
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,404
-What kind of vague answer is that?
-Well, it's…

85
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,241
as big as Lake Baikal.

86
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,201
Lake what?

87
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,040
-Lake Baikal.
-Lake Baikal.

88
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,835
You may be smart,
but you seriously lack common knowledge.

89
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,462
Do you want to get dumped already?

90
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,798
Anyway, what will you do
about Seong-hyeon?

91
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,010
I'm going to meet him tomorrow
and tell him.

92
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,178
Just the two of you?

93
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,513
It'd be weird if you came.

94
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,265
Unbelievable.

95
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,184
I like things in black and white.

96
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,645
I want time to sort out

97
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:45,691
the past I've shared with Seong-hyeon
and the time I'll be spending with you.

98
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,238
So we're not in a relationship just yet.

99
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,282
You're really something, aren't you?

100
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,785
I won't call you
until it's all sorted out,

101
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,745
so I hope you'll do the same.

102
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,206
Don't. Don't you dare call me.

103
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,916
Just go home. Go.

104
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,921
Unbelievable.

105
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,350
This is so annoying.

106
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,117
What was it again?

107
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,579
Lake Baikal?

108
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,332
Lake Baikal.

109
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,627
THE SIBERIAN SNOW COVERS LAKE BAIKAL

110
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,386
This is how much he likes me?

111
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,187
Hello?

112
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,232
Didn't you tell me not to call you?

113
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,485
You're the one who said that first.

114
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,114
I suddenly had something to ask you.

115
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,116
What is it?

116
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,453
I looked up Lake Baikal.

117
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,496
Hold on.

118
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:28,419
"Lake Baikal is
the oldest lake in the world

119
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,505
at 25 million years old.

120
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,841
With a depth of 1,743m,

121
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,093
it's also the deepest lake in the world."

122
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,473
I didn't know you liked me this much.

123
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,058
Just hang up.

124
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,142
Seriously?

125
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,312
No.

126
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,737
Gosh.

127
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,365
By the way,

128
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,243
you should tidy up your room.
How could it be so messy?

129
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,997
Well… Normally, I keep it clean.

130
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,793
I just had to rush out today,
so I couldn't clean up.

131
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,421
Enough with the excuses. Go to your desk.

132
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,840
-My desk?
-Yes.

133
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,847
One minute. Okay, I'm here.

134
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,768
Do you remember
who took that family photo?

135
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,943
No. But I do remember bawling that day.

136
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,280
I expected too much from someone
who couldn't even remember

137
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,157
if she had pulled out the plug or not.

138
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,242
Why do you ask?

139
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,786
Do you seriously not remember?

140
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,457
There was this old man and a little boy.

141
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,461
I tried so hard
to make you smile that day.

142
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,926
Are you saying the boy who danced

143
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,053
was you?

144
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,097
Yes. It was me.

145
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,266
No way. I can't believe this. Seriously?

146
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,728
What a small world.

147
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,233
Why are you so surprised?
You couldn't even remember me.

148
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,528
I wonder if I'd be able
to find some boy as well.

149
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,321
Boy?

150
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,157
When I was in high school,

151
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,660
I ran away from home and
came to a convenience store in Gongjin.

152
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,623
And this boy paid for me.

153
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,877
Don't tell me he gave you 100 won.

154
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,423
Was that you again?

155
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,635
Was that girl you?

156
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,681
Was it really you?

157
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,934
I'm getting goose bumps.

158
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,564
Me too.

159
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,609
It's like fate.

160
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,904
No, just a coincidence.

161
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,864
Gongjin is a small region.

162
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,408
I'm hanging up.

163
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,955
Eventually, we found
each other once again.

164
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,975
EPISODE 11

165
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,313
Let's add an insert here.

166
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,981
I think we should emphasize it.

167
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,902
Let's show this shot later.

168
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,238
Probably better in reverse.

169
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,698
HYE-JIN

170
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,741
One second.

171
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,994
Hello?

172
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,831
I think a reverse shot will be better.

173
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,209
We'll reveal the reason later
to make it more fun.

174
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,878
It'll evoke the viewers' curiosity

175
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,880
and offer a twist at the end.

176
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,590
Let's cut it out.

177
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,843
I'm really sorry,
but I need to head out for a bit.

178
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,263
-Where are you going?
-I'll be back in the evening.

179
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,765
Take a break. I'll wrap it up tonight.

180
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,225
Really? Can we do that?

181
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,893
Sure. Rest up.

182
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,730
What? What has gotten
into that workaholic?

183
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,952
-Here's some iced water.
-Thank you.

184
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,704
You look hot. Isn't it hot today?

185
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:37,376
Yes. I did rush over here,
but it is also hot today.

186
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,295
Right. You rushed over.

187
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,423
But you're not shooting
anything today, are you?

188
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,718
No, I'm not. I just urgently needed
to come to meet someone.

189
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,387
I see.

190
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,180
All right.

191
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,475
-Right, I should order.
-Sure.

192
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,144
Two iced Americanos, please.

193
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:03,986
If there's anything else
you want, feel free to order.

194
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,323
Just say the word, and it's on the house.

195
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,285
Thank you. I owe a lot to you guys.

196
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:15,623
Gosh. Not at all.
But if you feel indebted to me,

197
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:19,668
please remember my name
and recommend me to Sugar People and--

198
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,379
Tell them singer Oh Yoon

199
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,299
-would like to appear on the show.
-Sure.

200
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,967
Hello.

201
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,135
He already ordered.

202
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,595
-Okay.
-Have a seat.

203
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,764
My name is Oh Yoon.

204
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,848
Oh Yoon.

205
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,600
Hey.

206
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,519
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue.

207
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,356
Don't say that.
I love spontaneous meet-ups.

208
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,732
It's exciting.

209
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:47,154
It feels like
I've just been handed my report card.

210
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,115
Looking at it later
won't change my grades,

211
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,953
but I'm still afraid to open it.

212
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:58,916
I'm ready.

213
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,544
I promise to accept whatever you tell me.

214
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,884
Seeing you again
brought back old memories.

215
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,682
To be frank,
I never really reminisced those days.

216
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,310
I was feeling run-down back then.

217
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,981
I had to make ends meet

218
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,942
and also win a scholarship.

219
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,319
You're right.

220
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,698
I had no time to eat,

221
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,535
so I always carried around
a few sausages in my pocket.

222
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,956
I never slept more than five hours a day.

223
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,376
I was barely keeping my head above water.

224
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:49,091
And you were
the first person to care for me.

225
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,141
You were concerned about my well-being
and whether I had eaten or not.

226
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,727
Let's eat.

227
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,603
Okay.

228
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,441
When you said, "Let's eat,"

229
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,651
sometimes you meant it literally.

230
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,322
LET'S EAT

231
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,951
Sometimes, it meant "Let's play,"

232
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,745
or "Well done."

233
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,456
Hello?

234
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,416
Let's eat.

235
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,793
Sometimes, it meant, "Let's be happy."

236
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,378
Hye-jin!

237
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,758
Those words were like a spell to me.

238
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,388
I had blamed myself

239
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,308
for that foolish breakup.

240
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,976
Do you want to go eat?

241
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,063
-Sure.
-Your words

242
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,067
comforted me greatly.

243
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,073
I had feelings for you too.

244
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,871
I knew you had feelings for me too,

245
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,333
but I feigned ignorance.

246
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,629
I wasn't confident it'd work

247
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:15,511
because I felt like
you had seen me at my lowest.

248
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,268
I've always regretted

249
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,355
not being true to my feelings back then.

250
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,816
So

251
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,653
I'd like to be honest this time around.

252
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,533
I'm sorry, Seong-hyeon.

253
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,327
There's someone I like.

254
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,418
I'm relieved.

255
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,967
You didn't hesitate

256
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,011
like we did in the past.

257
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,598
You mustered up
the courage to tell me honestly,

258
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,100
so I'm relieved.

259
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,981
But you see,

260
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,109
that wasn't your lowest.

261
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,905
You may have lived off sausages

262
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,741
and worn ragged shoes,

263
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,870
but you were still radiant.

264
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:31,128
You worked hard every day of your life

265
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:36,216
and tried not to lose yourself
no matter what.

266
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,052
And I loved you for that.

267
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,935
I'm truly honored that someone like you…

268
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,109
is my first love, Hye-jin.

269
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,655
Likewise.

270
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,796
Dad, the ice cubes are melting.
Shouldn't you serve them?

271
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,797
Hurry up.

272
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,928
No, it seems that I shouldn't.

273
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,721
Are you crying?

274
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,726
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

275
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,771
Hurry up and serve them.

276
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,992
Seong-hyeon.

277
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,287
Thank you for the charm.

278
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,582
Would it make you feel

279
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,961
uncomfortable if I told you
to just keep it?

280
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:03,053
Well, I'm just glad it comforted you,
even for a moment.

281
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,930
Thank you so much.

282
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,851
And I'll be forever grateful.

283
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,571
Why did he come here?

284
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,036
Chief Hong.

285
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,005
Chief Hong,
I need to have a word with you.

286
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,549
Sure.

287
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,638
What do I do?

288
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,349
Are they going to fight over me?

289
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,978
What if it gets serious?

290
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,440
Gosh.

291
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,739
I felt that the legs
weren't strong enough.

292
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,742
That's exactly right. Safety comes first.

293
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,708
Hye-jin turned me down.
She says she likes someone else.

294
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,463
I think there's a problem with the wood.

295
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,465
Maybe it's rotten.

296
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,176
We should replace them.

297
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,263
She didn't tell me who it was,

298
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,307
but I bet he doesn't deserve her.

299
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,605
Why do you think so?

300
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,024
Isn't it obvious?
And my hunch tells me so.

301
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,777
You shouldn't judge people
based on a hunch.

302
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,737
I didn't take you for that type.

303
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,572
That's very rash of you.

304
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,659
Be good to her.

305
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,622
Make her laugh a lot

306
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,750
and treat her to good food.

307
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:03,006
I'm a simple guy.
I don't like complicated things.

308
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,468
I don't like weighing things
when it comes to people.

309
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,761
It gives me a headache.

310
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,679
I like her.

311
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,183
But I think

312
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,936
I'm pretty fond of you too.

313
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,444
I hated studying
trigonometric functions back in school.

314
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,822
Love triangles just aren't for me.

315
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:34,454
I don't hate you either.
You just require a lot of care.

316
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,872
You're not too bad.

317
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,874
I hammered it wrong because of you.

318
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,877
See? You do require a great deal of care.

319
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,422
I told you to just watch,
but you insisted on helping.

320
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,882
What about the leg you broke?

321
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,845
Didn't you hear me earlier?
I told you the wood was rotten.

322
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,307
Forget it.

323
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,978
Just teach me how to surf again
when you're free.

324
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,234
Sure. Let me know when you'll be free,

325
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,652
so I can make other plans.

326
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,240
Gosh, you're such a pain
in the neck. Darn you.

327
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,910
I think we can still use this.
I thought the wood was rotten,

328
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,579
but I can fix it.

329
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,664
What? Stop smiling. You'll grow on me.

330
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,666
This is how I normally look.

331
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,127
I don't get why people say that.

332
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,336
Hurry up.

333
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,422
Are you going to help me or not?

334
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:41,271
Right. Could it be
because I never did the laundry?

335
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,814
That can't be.

336
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,318
I was in charge of cleaning the bathroom
and mowing the lawn.

337
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:50,405
Right. Could it be
because I snore too much?

338
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,992
That can't be.
She snores even more when she's tired.

339
00:24:55,952 --> 00:25:00,582
What could be the reason for our divorce?

340
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,878
-What are you doing?
-Gosh, you startled me.

341
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,714
Why are you here on a Sunday?

342
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,966
I'm here for the garbage bags.

343
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,094
Ms. Yeo was too busy
to pick them up herself,

344
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,763
so I came by instead.

345
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,057
How could a zone chief

346
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,809
be so irresponsible?

347
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:23,063
She could stop by on Monday,
but since I'll be eating there--

348
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,107
Hey! A civil servant
doesn't work on the weekends.

349
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,192
Don't you know that?

350
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,402
Just go home. I'll give them to her.

351
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,405
But I'm going to eat
at her restaurant anyway.

352
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,324
Eat somewhere else.

353
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,326
-Fine.
-Darn it.

354
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,872
What a pain. How dare she make me run
errands for her? I'm the village chief.

355
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,375
-Then let me--
-Damn it.

356
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,921
What's the matter with him?

357
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,925
I haven't seen you in ages.

358
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,428
Come by more often.

359
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,888
All right.

360
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,642
By the way, how old are you again?

361
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,394
-Me?
-Yes.

362
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,730
I'm past 40. Why do you ask?

363
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,816
My husband's close friend

364
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,192
is a widower.

365
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,278
He's 44 with no kids

366
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,446
and a judicial scrivener.

367
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,241
He has a huge office
in front of Chung-ho City Hall.

368
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:20,620
He sounds amazing,
but I doubt he'd date me.

369
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,455
You are exactly

370
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,874
his ideal type.

371
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,503
He likes petite, cute women
who are self-sufficient.

372
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,923
He loves children too,
so your son will be just fine.

373
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,676
Oh, my. That's exactly me.

374
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,429
What do you say?
Are you free this weekend?

375
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,471
What?

376
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,140
What was that?

377
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,351
Mr. Chang, what brings you here?

378
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,687
I have some business to do with her.

379
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,604
I see.

380
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:52,068
Ms. Yeo, you should fulfill
your role as the zone chief.

381
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:56,323
Must I come all the way here to hand you
these garbage bags on a Sunday?

382
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,116
I never asked you to.

383
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,118
I said I'd stop by on Monday.

384
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,162
You should've stopped by last Friday.

385
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,997
I heard you were busy,

386
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,124
but you're just having a casual chat.

387
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,043
You might as well just step down.

388
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,795
Sure. My term will be ending soon anyway.

389
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,552
Goodness.

390
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,179
Please distribute them tomorrow.

391
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,430
Don't you worry.

392
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,728
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

393
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,902
So…

394
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,114
What do you say?
Do you want me to set a date?

395
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,533
I'll keep it a secret from Mr. Chang.

396
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:44,079
You don't need to.
I was just kidding earlier.

397
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,082
I'm not interested
in getting married again.

398
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,667
I'm content living with I-jun like this.

399
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,587
What a shame. He's a great guy.

400
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,089
I appreciate it, though.

401
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,260
Was everything okay?

402
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,096
What did he say? Did he talk about me?

403
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,473
What did he say? Tell me.

404
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,601
You should apply for a rap contest.
You've got talent.

405
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,478
-What did you guys talk about?
-Go on.

406
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,979
Come on. Tell me.

407
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,109
He said he liked me.

408
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,151
What?

409
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,278
He favors me over you.

410
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,030
Don't lie.

411
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:24,077
I should've taken
a photo of your face just now.

412
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,664
You show a variety of expressions.
It's quite entertaining.

413
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,457
Stop joking around and tell me.

414
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,669
He wants me to treat you well.

415
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,796
He already knew everything.

416
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,756
You have a great friend.

417
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,634
Yes, I do.

418
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:42,554
How boring of you to agree off the bat.

419
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,888
It's all sorted now, right?

420
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,849
No. Not yet.

421
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,144
Why… What's left?

422
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,815
Let's keep our relationship
a secret for now.

423
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,942
Impossible. They'll find out right away.

424
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,527
That can't happen.

425
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,405
Think of all the drama
they started when we weren't dating.

426
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,823
Imagine they find out.

427
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,909
They'll start all kinds of rumors.

428
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,204
Like, "They'll get married soon.
She must be pregnant."

429
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,665
Gosh, I think you're the one

430
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,001
making a fuss here.
You and your imagination.

431
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,420
-That was just an example.
-Sure.

432
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,381
In any case,
keep it a secret at all costs.

433
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,718
I'm hungry. Should we have some jeon
since it'll rain today?

434
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,429
-I'm serious.
-Me too.

435
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:28,183
I know that they'll find out
no matter how hard we try.

436
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,976
I should become a rapper myself.

437
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,979
Just try. Stop joking around.

438
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,898
I will, but it won't work.

439
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:42,822
Fine. I'll do whatever you want.

440
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,616
Happy?

441
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,493
Yes.

442
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:53,458
Then today's our first day
as a couple, right?

443
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,463
Well, I guess so.

444
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:05,220
Anyway, does making it official
make a big difference?

445
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,473
Of course, it does.

446
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,309
How so?

447
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,646
We can do this…

448
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,066
and this.

449
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,362
And we can even do this.

450
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,197
-Ms. Dentist.
-Yes?

451
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,283
Were you always
so physically affectionate?

452
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,329
Let me recommend a book to you.

453
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:34,749
It's Georges Bataille's Erotism.

454
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,001
-Georges…
-Bataille.

455
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,128
-Bataille's…
-Erotism.

456
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,797
-Erotism?
-Yes.

457
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,507
What's it about?

458
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,552
Stuff like this.

459
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:48,972
This is nice.

460
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,682
It is.

461
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,019
My gosh.

462
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,022
This is very annoying.

463
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,525
Lock the front door from now on.

464
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,485
Mi-seon.

465
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,112
Embarrassed much?

466
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,446
Thanks for the advice.

467
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,907
We'll be more careful.

468
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,617
Mi-seon, I love you.

469
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,370
She's gone.

470
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,581
Did we lock the door?

471
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,208
-Let's be more careful.
-Okay.

472
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,002
Georges Bataille.

473
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,379
Erotism? Is it raunchy?

474
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,797
Sort of.

475
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,345
The call is unavailable right now--

476
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,932
You said you'd come back tonight.

477
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,758
What?

478
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,968
Gosh.

479
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,596
-Goodness. Hello, Director Ji.
-Hello, Mr. Chang.

480
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,972
What brings you here?

481
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,141
That's what I should ask you.

482
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,977
What are you doing here?
You're not filming today.

483
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,064
Well, it's a long story.

484
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,816
If you're alone,
would you like to join me?

485
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,527
Is that okay?

486
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,196
Of course.

487
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,447
To tell the truth,

488
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,617
I was frustrated today,
so I came for a drink alone.

489
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,494
-Join me then.
-Thanks.

490
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,163
Goodness, that looks delicious.

491
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,209
-One more glass, please.
-Sure.

492
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,293
Cheers.

493
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,596
This is what I really like about drinking.

494
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,142
I like how you can feel
the alcohol going down.

495
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,520
It goes down so smoothly.

496
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:04,899
I agree. It's refreshing
and stress-relieving.

497
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,734
It cleanses you.

498
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,779
You must be quite stressed.

499
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,490
I can empathize with you.

500
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,284
We're both leaders.

501
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:19,497
I think we share similar difficulties.
Don't you agree?

502
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,084
For example, work-related problems
and responsibilities.

503
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,504
You're right. Work is tough.

504
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,424
But what's even harder is people.

505
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,095
Relationships can be very difficult.

506
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,973
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

507
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:40,184
I don't know why
relationships are so complicated.

508
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,020
Things get so twisted

509
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,480
that in the end, it becomes impossible

510
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,774
to figure out where it all went wrong.

511
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,278
Even if you do something about it,
it just gets tangled back up again.

512
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,655
You're right. I totally agree.

513
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,075
I knew we'd click

514
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,995
the moment we first met.

515
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,082
We should've done this sooner.

516
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,834
Tell me about it.

517
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,171
-Let me pour you a drink.
-Thank you.

518
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,630
Here, Director Ji.

519
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,348
The moment she heard about him,

520
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,019
she giggled and said

521
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,354
she was the perfect match.

522
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:29,650
I didn't know she could laugh so easily.

523
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:37,116
She'd always look at me with discontent

524
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,746
and spew such hurtful words.

525
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,457
I thought

526
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,711
we were meant to be.

527
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,841
I thought I was destined

528
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,054
to come to Gongjin

529
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,724
so I could meet her again.

530
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,644
Why did Cho-hui…

531
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:10,733
have to disappear before I got married

532
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,778
and show up now?

533
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,737
No.

534
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:21,327
Why did Hwa-jeong
have to ask for a divorce then?

535
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,999
What horrible timing.

536
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,376
Yes, timing.

537
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,337
That's what it is.

538
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,465
Sadly,

539
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,971
time just never seems to be…

540
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,307
on my side.

541
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,733
Darn it.

542
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:54,777
Oh, no.

543
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,072
This won't come off easily.

544
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,324
Right?

545
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,451
Gosh.

546
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,163
By the way, Director Ji,

547
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:10,251
do you ever plan on having
female guests on your show?

548
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,253
If you shoot season two

549
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,423
with girl group members,
I bet it'll be a huge hit.

550
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,843
What? Director Ji.

551
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,811
Hey.

552
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,147
Is Mr. Oh not here yet?

553
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,900
He's not here yet, so relax.

554
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,614
Today I'll have a mocha
with a ton of whipped cream.

555
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,825
What? Are you running low
on sugar already?

556
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,621
No. My body's overflowing with sweetness.

557
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,997
It's overwhelming.

558
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:52,793
Want to come inside?

559
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,795
-Can I do that?
-Yes.

560
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,716
-Okay, let's see.
-Gosh.

561
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,136
I've never been in here before.
Look at all this.

562
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,139
Just stand back and watch.
I don't want you causing trouble.

563
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,224
Okay.

564
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,433
This is whipping cream.

565
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,602
I see.

566
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,312
You put it in here.

567
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,690
-This is so cool.
-Then you whip it with this.

568
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,817
-Goodness.
-Why is this…

569
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,320
Why won't this work?

570
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,451
Are you okay? Did it get on you?

571
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,371
No, I'm fine. It's all over your face.

572
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,081
-Really?
-I'll wipe it off.

573
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,334
-There's some here. Gosh, you're cute.
-Here?

574
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,419
Isn't there some here?

575
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,588
Here? You're adorable.

576
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,466
What about here?

577
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,596
Don't you think that was so harsh?
Forget the coffee.

578
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,556
You're so annoying.

579
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,770
Ms. Yoon, what did he…

580
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,064
Du-sik.

581
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,819
What did you say to her
to get yourself slapped in the face?

582
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,320
That must've hurt.

583
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,198
Why did you come so early?

584
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,992
Why is that a problem?

585
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,493
You wanted me to come learn.

586
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,828
I'm just asking.

587
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:14,375
That slap came out of nowhere.

588
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,793
MS. DENTIST

589
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:19,213
Chief Hong, what other part-time jobs
do you have today?

590
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:28,306
Let's see. First, I need to go
to Gongjin Korean-Chinese Restaurant.

591
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,685
Gosh, my stomach is killing me.

592
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:38,774
It feels like someone reached
inside my stomach and yanked on it.

593
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,693
You reek of alcohol.

594
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,486
I'm guessing you had

595
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,156
soju with makgeolli.

596
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,490
Don't talk about alcohol.

597
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,702
Have some of this. It's codfish soup.

598
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,996
It'll soothe your stomach.

599
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,207
Why did you drink so much?
You can't even hold your liquor.

600
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,711
Gosh.

601
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,382
God, I feel much better.

602
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,551
Where did you get this?

603
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,553
I bought it while I was outside.

604
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,930
-Why?
-Isn't it obvious?

605
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,184
Because you're an important person
here in Gongjin.

606
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,395
You're a fragile and quick-tempered man

607
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,689
who must be protected at all costs.
You're like…

608
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:20,900
a fuse!

609
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,651
That's not a compliment.

610
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,281
Gosh, the least you can do is thank me.

611
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,742
Here. Drink up before it gets cold.

612
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,661
-This is really good though.
-Drink up. Slowly.

613
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,914
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

614
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,207
Your jjajangmyeon is here.

615
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,583
Chief Hong!

616
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,126
Hey, you're here.

617
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,089
Will you be working there tomorrow too?

618
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,173
Why do you ask?

619
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,758
Do me a favor

620
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:50,429
and try to work at different restaurants,
such as Korean or Japanese ones,

621
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,099
so I can have various dishes for lunch.

622
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,018
Chinese food shouldn't be the only option,

623
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,813
but you're not giving me much of a choice.

624
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,064
Hey, Mi-seon.

625
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,275
You like Chinese food. It's good.

626
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,360
Noted.

627
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:08,614
I apologize for the trouble
I'm causing on your diet.

628
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:13,452
It's okay. It's not your fault.

629
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,997
It's my fault for having a friend
who can't control herself.

630
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,418
Will you guys stop teasing me?

631
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,710
Enjoy it while it's hot.

632
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,129
Leaving already?

633
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,135
Gosh, she's unbelievable.

634
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,553
My goodness.

635
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,637
Chief Hong.

636
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,764
Why aren't you eating?

637
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,308
I want to see you a bit longer.

638
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,644
But we saw each other this morning too.

639
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:42,314
I'm sorry about earlier. I just panicked.

640
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,442
It must've hurt.

641
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,110
It was this side.

642
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,487
This side? Did it hurt?
Let me blow the pain away.

643
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,406
-Chief Hong.
-It worked.

644
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,158
You forgot to take the fried dumplings--
Oh my!

645
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,661
Oh, gosh.

646
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,871
Goodness gracious.

647
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,291
-Oh, goodness.
-How could you forget the dumplings?

648
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,835
Don't you know how much I love
crispy dumplings?

649
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,964
I ordered tangsuyuk
so I could have the free dumplings.

650
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,090
Ms. Dentist.

651
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:11,385
Ms. Yoon, I didn't peg you
as the violent type.

652
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,387
I brought the fried dumplings.

653
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,514
Thank you. Do your job properly.

654
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,308
Gosh.

655
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,938
This is why I never give freebies.

656
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,483
Why did you bring it?
I could've picked it up myself.

657
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,526
Don't hang out with her. Let's go.

658
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,611
It's dented.

659
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,279
It's okay. That doesn't matter.

660
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,364
-Goodness, Du-sik.
-Thank you.

661
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,491
Gosh.

662
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,248
Jeez, it still hurts.

663
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,585
Gosh, Ms. Dentist… Speak of the devil.

664
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:47,796
Hello?

665
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,049
Chief Hong, are you mad?

666
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,300
No.

667
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,969
I'm not just mad.

668
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,597
I feel fury, frustration, rage, and anger.

669
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,140
It's more complex.

670
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,893
I'm so sorry. It hurt, didn't it?

671
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,562
Be honest with me.
Are you sure you want to date me?

672
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,855
Or do you want to kill me?

673
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,942
No, it was Ms. Cho of all people.

674
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,235
I hope you understand.

675
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,947
I have no other choice.
You don't want people to know.

676
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,365
I should respect that.

677
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,158
Where are you right now?

678
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,201
At Bora Supermarket.

679
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,954
Okay, stay there. I'll stop by later.

680
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,666
No, don't come. I don't want you to visit.
I got to go.

681
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,875
See you later.

682
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,127
He's so cute.

683
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,809
I'm sorry. I made a huge mistake.
I apologize.

684
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,185
Gosh, he startled me.

685
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,565
Apologize to her. She's the one
who pulled an all-nighter.

686
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,732
I just got here.

687
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,901
Ji-won, what do you want to do with me?

688
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,237
You can beat me all you want.

689
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,449
I'll gladly receive the punishment
you give me. Go on. Hit me.

690
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,035
Do-ha, why is he going overboard?

691
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,372
I'm hungry. Buy me food.

692
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,040
And use your own card.

693
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:08,002
All right. Tell me what you want,
and I'll buy it for you.

694
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,421
-Haecheong Noodles.
-Sure.

695
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,507
Go on. Order.

696
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,386
Okay. Where's my phone?

697
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,389
My phone…

698
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,558
Just wait.

699
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,899
Found it. I'll order raw fish naengmyeon,
mul-naengmyeon,

700
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,693
dumpling stew, and galbijjim.

701
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,486
-Okay.
-Okay.

702
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,620
-Chief Hong.
-No, don't come near me.

703
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,538
-Why not?
-Stay at least two meters away from me

704
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,707
when we're outside
for the sake of my safety.

705
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,586
Two meters? Is this enough?

706
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,088
That's not two meters.
That's not even one meter.

707
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:58,177
I think you and I
have different measurement standards.

708
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,929
I'd like you to follow
the international standard.

709
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,682
"I'd like you to follow
the international standard."

710
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,686
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

711
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,565
How about we go
on our first official date this weekend?

712
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,691
A date?

713
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,152
What do you have in mind?

714
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,570
On our date…

715
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,990
We could go for a walk,

716
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,367
have food,

717
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,746
and if you want, we can do

718
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,456
some other stuff too.

719
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:30,959
Like what?

720
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,379
-Just some other stuff.
-Like this?

721
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,880
Stop it!

722
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,965
-Why?
-You're ruining my hair.

723
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,009
You still look pretty.

724
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,052
Stop it!

725
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,805
-I thought I told you not to.
-I'm sorry.

726
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,308
I told you to stop.
Stop being so annoying.

727
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,643
Why is it so warm?

728
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,149
I'm bleeding.

729
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,237
Don't do that again.

730
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,655
Gosh.

731
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,697
I'm sorry.

732
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:08,747
Did you see that?
Ms. Yoon didn't even hesitate

733
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,833
to headbutt him.

734
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,544
I agree. It's safe to say

735
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,964
that she despises him.

736
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,099
I should get going.

737
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:30,352
Okay. Cheer up.

738
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,478
Bye.

739
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,776
I'M SORRY. HOW'S YOUR NOSE?

740
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,321
DID YOUR NOSE STOP BLEEDING? I'M SORRY…

741
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,700
-I'm truly sorry.
-Dr. Yoon, you have a patient.

742
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:45,951
Coming.

743
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,663
I'm sorry.

744
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:54,042
I feel so bad. I'm so sorry, Chief Hong.

745
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,712
YOUR CHEEK, SHIN, AND NOSE…
I'M SORRY, CHIEF HONG

746
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,968
Hey, aren't you getting off?

747
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:04,970
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

748
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:09,099
Why do you think Chief Hong hasn't checked
his texts for the past five hours?

749
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,310
Because he's busy?

750
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,479
Even so,

751
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,023
how could he not have time
to check his phone?

752
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,150
Is he mad at me?

753
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,444
Or did he block me?

754
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,696
He hasn't read any of my texts.

755
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,657
Did he block me?

756
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,242
I'm sorry, my friend.

757
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,578
For what?

758
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:33,499
I was just like you now
when I was in a relationship.

759
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,835
God, it must've been so annoying.

760
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:40,255
You learn the most by putting yourself
in other people's shoes.

761
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,466
-Am I so annoying right now?
-Yes.

762
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,967
Am I being cringy?

763
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,886
I'm going home.

764
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,475
Why won't he read my texts?
It's bothering me so much.

765
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,359
Is he not home?

766
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,113
Should I wait for him
and make him feel better?

767
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,042
He's tidier than he seems.

768
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,511
How did I not recognize him?

769
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,013
He looks exactly the same.

770
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,807
How adorable.

771
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,852
Gosh, he's so cute.

772
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,484
How adorable.

773
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,781
I love that he reads a lot.

774
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,871
What Is Love?

775
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,666
All right. Come on in.

776
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:58,834
-Okay.
-What?

777
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,421
-Try the candle that he made.
-Is he not alone?

778
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,047
-What do I do?
-It's really nice.

779
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,592
-Is it really that nice?
-You bet.

780
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,636
I always make the best quality goods.

781
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,723
Why are the lights on?

782
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,725
Come on in.

783
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,602
-The lights are on.
-Come on.

784
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,812
Goodness. It's late.

785
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,191
Hold on. There's a lot of dust.

786
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,776
It's dusty in here.

787
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,403
You guys are important guests.

788
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:29,114
Why don't you wait outside?
I'll bring them out.

789
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:32,034
Chief Hong, I need to use your bathroom.

790
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,368
No! Wait.

791
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,288
-Hold on.
-Gosh.

792
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,665
Goodness.

793
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,960
-It's over there, right?
-Yes. You know where it is.

794
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,464
Why don't you sit down?
I'll go bring them.

795
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,716
My room's messy, so don't go inside.

796
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:51,178
Messy? Don't be absurd.

797
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,263
I've never seen

798
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,308
a young man as tidy as you in my life.

799
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,143
No, it's really messy today.

800
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,896
You're starting to make me curious.

801
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,773
-Let's see.
-No!

802
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,864
Come on. It's neat and tidy.

803
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,492
I must've forgotten
that I had cleaned up already.

804
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,830
Gosh, silly me.
I'm so forgetful these days.

805
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,916
Come see my candles.

806
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,959
-Okay.
-Okay?

807
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:30,092
All right. Check them out.
I don't make them often.

808
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:33,512
I made these masterpieces
with bean oil, wooden wicks,

809
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:36,348
and natural ingredients.

810
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,351
They're filled with essential oils,
so they even smell nice.

811
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,646
-Here. Smell them.
-Okay.

812
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,858
You're right. They really do smell nice.

813
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,610
It smells like flowers.

814
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,903
-Right?
-Yes.

815
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,322
She's here.

816
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:56,243
I'm feeling generous today.
You don't need to pay.

817
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,953
I'll give them to you for free,

818
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,037
-What?
-so take them.

819
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,914
Two for each person. All right.

820
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,124
Goodness.

821
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,459
Never mind. Just take them all. Here.

822
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,503
-All of them?
-Yes, take them all.

823
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,922
Are we good now? Go home and light them.

824
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,466
See how nice they are for yourself.

825
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,676
-Okay.
-Now, go home.

826
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,553
-Let's go.
-What?

827
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,430
-Go on.
-Okay.

828
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,433
-Go home and light your candles.
-All right.

829
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,475
Go on.

830
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,103
I won't see you out today.

831
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,563
Get home safely.

832
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,314
-I need to clean my house.
-Okay.

833
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,483
-Goodness.
-Let's go.

834
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,069
They're nice.
Don't they smell good, Ms. Suk-ja?

835
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,404
-Yes.
-Right.

836
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,865
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

837
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:35,782
Bye.

838
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:44,291
Doesn't he seem suspicious today?
He didn't even offer us drinks.

839
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,128
You're right. Is he in a hurry
to do something?

840
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,547
Ladies, light these candles in your room,

841
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,425
and any foul smells will be gone.

842
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,052
My grandson came over last time

843
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,055
and said my house smelled musty.

844
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,767
Did that hurt your feelings?

845
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,851
A bit.

846
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:06,480
There's no need to feel hurt
or embarrassed.

847
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,815
It's the law of nature.

848
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,194
It's only natural for old people like us
to smell this way.

849
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,863
That's why you need to shower

850
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,240
and bathe in hot water often.

851
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:21,036
Use Chief Hong's handmade soap,
and it'll get rid of your bad odor.

852
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,539
Then how about we go
to the bathhouse tomorrow?

853
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,751
-Okay?
-Don't walk so close to me in this heat.

854
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:28,960
Stop clinging on to me.

855
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,171
Ms. Dentist, where…

856
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,255
Ms. Dentist.

857
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,900
Are the ladies gone?

858
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,027
Yes. Why are you here?
You should've called.

859
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:58,698
Well, I couldn't reach you.
You didn't even check your texts.

860
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,660
I was busy today.

861
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,704
Wait. Where's my cell phone?

862
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:06,748
You lost it?

863
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,376
I'm sure it's somewhere. Get out of there.

864
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,502
Okay.

865
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,342
I've been crouching so long
that my legs fell asleep.

866
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,677
Come here.

867
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,136
-What are you doing?
-There.

868
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,931
-What are you doing?
-Are you good now?

869
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,809
Aren't I heavy?

870
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,061
You're as heavy as a sack of rice.

871
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,522
Put me down.

872
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,440
No, let's stay like this for a bit.

873
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,192
Gosh.

874
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,278
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

875
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:40,615
You should check your texts
no matter how busy you are.

876
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,492
I don't like it when I can't reach you.

877
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,910
Okay, I will.

878
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,371
What else? Tell me more.

879
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,249
What else don't you like?
Tell me everything.

880
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,544
-What don't I like?
-Yes.

881
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:55,547
Here's one. I don't want you to lie.

882
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,888
I don't want there
to be any secrets between us.

883
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,059
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

884
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,186
Walk three steps forward.

885
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,104
Sure.

886
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,149
-That's so cute.
-Why?

887
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,401
Did you mark our first day as a couple?

888
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,154
Gosh, no. It's nothing.

889
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:22,157
What do you mean it's nothing?
That's so adorable.

890
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,201
No, it's not what you think.
It's for something else. I just…

891
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,898
It's Mi-seon.

892
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,233
Why is the ringtone so loud?

893
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,779
Do you also want an aroma candle?

894
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:03,198
-An aroma candle?
-Maybe a eucalyptus-scented one.

895
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,617
It's good for rhinitis.
It opens up your sinuses.

896
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,577
I see.

897
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,706
I don't have rhinitis, but thanks.

898
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,005
Gosh, why did Mi-seon have to call
at that moment?

899
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,383
I should mute it from now on.

900
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,139
Do you also certified for making candles?

901
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,599
Yes, of course.

902
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:35,146
Tell me honestly.
How many licenses do you own?

903
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,857
I'm not sure. I have so many
that I've lost count.

904
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,236
Then tell me the most eccentric one?

905
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,237
The most eccentric?

906
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:46,533
Let's see. I have a class-three license
to counsel youths,

907
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,702
-and licenses to teach etiquette,
-Okay.

908
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,954
to cook pufferfish,

909
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:55,000
to clean and tidy up,
and to teach origami.

910
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,962
To teach origami?
They even have a license for that?

911
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:03,675
Colored paper can hold
the whole universe, you dummy.

912
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,594
Dummy? That's so mean.

913
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:09,097
I can't believe you called me that.

914
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,767
That hurts! My hand!

915
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,020
-Let me go!
-Oh, my goodness!

916
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,646
-Have you lost it?
-What's wrong?

917
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,441
-Are you okay?
-Gosh, I'm terrified of her.

918
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,484
-My goodness.
-She's so strong.

919
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:25,238
I heard what you did.
Ms. Yoon, you've gone too far.

920
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,991
-Pardon?
-Come on. We saw what you did.

921
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,451
You're so harsh on him.

922
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:32,078
No one does that
even to their worst enemy.

923
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,331
She's right. You even made his nose bleed
at the supermarket.

924
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,459
-You even kicked him.
-And slapped him.

925
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,794
Gosh, she even slapped you?
You're unbelievable.

926
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,172
No, we were just talking and--

927
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,884
This won't do. At this rate,
Chief Hong could get badly injured.

928
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:49,095
I was just going to tell you
to be nice to him,

929
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,722
but you've crossed the line.

930
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,682
Don't meet each other for a while.

931
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,269
-Yes, that's a good idea.
-Don't even look him in the eye.

932
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,063
Just avoid and ignore each other.

933
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:01,441
Gosh, that's impossible.
Gongjin is a tiny neighborhood.

934
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,735
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.

935
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:04,944
We can make it work.

936
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,071
Ms. Yoon, come with us.

937
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,781
Let's go.

938
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,825
-Let's go. Come on.
-Stop letting her beat you up.

939
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,744
-It breaks my heart.
-Hey, Geum-cheol.

940
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,079
-Let them go.
-We're off.

941
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,955
-He deserves more beating.
-Gosh.

942
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,540
That hurts.

943
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,001
Why are you such a wuss?

944
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,212
-No, that's not it.
-Gosh!

945
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,922
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

946
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,680
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

947
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,390
Hello.

948
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,935
-Hey--
-Chief Hong, stay there.

949
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,562
Continue what you were doing.
I'll take her order.

950
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,649
One cup of iced drip coffee, please.

951
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,777
One cup of iced drip coffee.

952
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,238
And use her favorite beans,
Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.

953
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,365
-I heard.
-Okay.

954
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,367
Sit back there.

955
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,119
I don't want to wrinkle my skirt.

956
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,411
I see.

957
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,539
-Chief Hong--
-Stop!

958
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,916
Why would you try to talk to him?

959
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,085
You shouldn't talk to each other
from now on.

960
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,546
You always fight when you do.
Keep some distance.

961
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,007
Hey, Chun-jae.

962
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,592
-Me? What?
-Yes.

963
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,636
-I lost my phone.
-Your phone?

964
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:16,724
Yes. You won't be able
to reach me by phone until I find it.

965
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,894
-I see.
-I only just bought it,

966
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,439
so I think I should try looking for it
for a few days.

967
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,898
Yes, I think so too.

968
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,943
So don't worry even if you can't reach me.

969
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:30,071
Why would I worry about you?
I'm busy worrying about Ju-ri.

970
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,115
-Is it Sunday today?
-Hi, guys.

971
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,742
Why are you here at this hour?

972
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,202
You're late for school!

973
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,580
Just be relieved
that I'm going to school. See you.

974
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,790
She's such a handful.

975
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,293
Gosh, she gives me headaches.

976
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,336
What should I do with her, Du-sik?

977
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:49,090
-But she's cute--
-Stop looking elsewhere. Look at me.

978
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,509
I'm going to make coffee.
Which beans again?

979
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:52,552
What was it again?

980
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,387
-Ethiopian.
-Ethiopian.

981
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,763
-Ethiopian?
-Drip coffee.

982
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,432
-Drip coffee.
-Drip coffee.

983
00:57:57,515 --> 00:58:00,602
I can't believe we have to be apart
when we just started dating.

984
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:05,565
Why did Chief Hong lose his phone?
I can't even text him now.

985
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,650
I want to hear his voice.

986
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,694
Gosh, you're so annoying.

987
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,113
I have great respect for our ancestors.

988
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:17,243
They didn't have phones back then.
How did they date and make babies?

989
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,040
Mi-seon, for lunch--

990
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,917
Shark fin soup and spicy nurungji soup.

991
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,544
If I must have Chinese,
I want the most expensive dishes.

992
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,300
This is Yoon Dental Clinic.
Two bowls of jjajangmyeon, please.

993
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,886
-Thanks.
-Shark fin soup.

994
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,721
Chief Hong is coming.

995
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,014
You're so annoying.

996
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,144
Ms. Cho, you came yourself.

997
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:46,231
Yes, Chief Hong
won't be delivering food here for now.

998
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,441
We weren't joking yesterday.

999
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,528
But why didn't you order
tangsuyuk as well?

1000
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,071
You could've just come.

1001
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,657
I can't believe
I came all the way here for this.

1002
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,826
Why does she keep slapping me?

1003
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:04,082
We have two additional people to board
along with the staff we mentioned.

1004
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,250
Is that okay?

1005
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,085
Yes, that's no problem.

1006
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,504
Will there be turbulence?
I heard it'll be sunny.

1007
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,839
I think it'll be a bit wavy.

1008
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:15,260
You'll just have to take
anti-seasickness tablets and wear patches.

1009
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,223
What's the matter? Are you okay?

1010
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,349
What's wrong?

1011
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,976
-Are you sick?
-You're sweating.

1012
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,852
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong?

1013
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:34,237
The lunch was delicious,
so I must've stuffed it too quickly.

1014
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,364
I'm really fine.

1015
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,242
You don't have to stand here.
Go sit down somewhere.

1016
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:41,286
Or go home.

1017
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,413
Are you serious?

1018
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,206
I can't leave you alone here.

1019
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,834
I'm fine now.

1020
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,253
No. You're not fine.

1021
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,046
Upset stomach, my foot.

1022
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,674
I know it's your heart that's hurting.

1023
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,803
I already paid your hospital bills.

1024
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:02,015
Do you have insurance?
If you do, we need the receipt.

1025
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,309
Do-ha, you handle things very quickly.

1026
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,103
Why can't you be like that at work?

1027
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,689
Well, my father was hospitalized
for a long time.

1028
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,733
So I know how things are done here.

1029
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:14,402
I should've gone to med school,
but my grades didn't cut it.

1030
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,112
Gosh, come on.

1031
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,073
It's not too late.

1032
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,538
Chief Hong!

1033
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,751
Hey. Wait.

1034
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,920
Why is it so hard to see you?

1035
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,673
Tell me about it.
How have you been for the past six hours?

1036
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,258
Not so well.

1037
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,511
Did you find your phone?

1038
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,056
-No, not yet.
-Then get a new one.

1039
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,223
Don't you want to text?

1040
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,769
My contract still has 20 months on it.
Give me one more day to look for it.

1041
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:51,272
Are you saying
we'll continue to be out of touch?

1042
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,232
No, that's not what I mean. I'll--

1043
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,609
-Ms. Yoon!
-Du-sik!

1044
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,694
What's going on? Arguing again?

1045
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:57,987
-No, we're not.
-We're not. We're--

1046
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,822
Ms. Yoon, I heard everything.

1047
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,159
Please keep a distance
to maintain peace in Gongjin.

1048
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,411
This isn't the JSA. That's enough.

1049
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,996
-Honey, split them up.
-Split!

1050
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,748
-Ms. Yoon, follow me.
-Come with me.

1051
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,541
-I'll give you a popsicle.
-No, wait.

1052
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,794
-I don't like popsicles.
-Yun-gyeong.

1053
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,962
-Yun-gyeong.
-What do you like then?

1054
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,256
-Bye.
-Bye!

1055
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,549
But…

1056
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,641
What are you doing?

1057
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,267
Lie down.

1058
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,395
I'm not sleepy.

1059
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,440
Then what? Should I force you to lie down?

1060
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,819
No. I'll lie down myself.

1061
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,322
Gosh.

1062
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,912
I'm not doing this for you.

1063
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:51,457
If you're going to fall ill,
do it after our show is finished.

1064
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,418
Fine.

1065
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,004
Now, get some sleep.

1066
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,214
Thanks.

1067
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,301
I know you care for me

1068
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,429
and put up with me a lot.

1069
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,682
I'm truly grateful.

1070
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:14,897
I can't believe this happened.

1071
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,192
I can't believe someone as healthy as me

1072
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,445
was taken to the ER
because of an upset stomach.

1073
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,196
You should be embarrassed.

1074
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,035
I'm dumbfounded and speechless.

1075
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,831
But I guess I've been distressed.

1076
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,169
I'm trying to get over

1077
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,214
my first love for the second time.

1078
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,098
My heart's been broken once again,

1079
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,143
and it hurts so much.

1080
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,148
That's enough.

1081
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,150
It'd be cute if you were a teenager,

1082
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:02,111
but you're 35.
It could really take a toll on you.

1083
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:04,614
You're right.

1084
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,159
Now, close your eyes.

1085
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:13,748
I should do as you say.

1086
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,584
I'm going to sleep.

1087
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,054
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

1088
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,680
Let's see.

1089
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,149
Hello.

1090
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,153
What brings you here?

1091
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,279
Well…

1092
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,157
I…

1093
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:52,286
I'd like to get a teeth scaling.

1094
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,788
A scaling?

1095
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,917
Sure. Please wait over there for a minute.

1096
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,001
Okay.

1097
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:02,797
Sure.

1098
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,467
Hold onto this.
I brought it in case you get nervous.

1099
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,636
Okay. Thank you.

1100
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,016
Open your mouth.

1101
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,561
I'm going to be as gentle as possible.

1102
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:20,189
But raise your hand if it hurts too much.

1103
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,274
Okay.

1104
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,743
Is there something wrong?

1105
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,454
You see,

1106
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:40,710
it's not that I don't like you.

1107
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:46,591
I just want to get to know you slowly.

1108
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,135
I'm sure

1109
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,931
you can make out what I'm saying.

1110
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,895
I'm afraid I don't get what you're saying.

1111
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:03,441
If it's okay with you, I'll proceed.

1112
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,525
Okay.

1113
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,824
I thought she'd make it out.

1114
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,123
What did he say?

1115
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:20,458
-What?
-Why did he come?

1116
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,168
Don't ask.

1117
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,671
Look at you. Why do you look happy?

1118
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,299
You have a huge smile on your face.

1119
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:29,926
He said something, didn't he?

1120
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:31,761
It's a secret.

1121
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:37,016
Hey, I tell you everything.
You can't do this to me.

1122
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:41,604
Wait. Your next patient, Hyun Yeong-mok,
will be here in ten minutes.

1123
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,397
Come on. Tell me.

1124
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:47,693
Stretch your arms beforehand.
It's an impacted wisdom teeth removal.

1125
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:51,614
Come on. I'm dying of curiosity. Tell me.

1126
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,449
Are you really not going to tell me?

1127
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:55,451
I'm so curious.

1128
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:57,787
Gosh, you're smiling from ear to ear.

1129
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,038
I'm not.

1130
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,623
Tell me.

1131
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,376
Why are you smiling?

1132
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,752
It's a secret.

1133
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:09,590
This is so unfair.
I won't tell you anything ever again.

1134
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,300
Not a single thing.

1135
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,344
What's with her?

1136
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,223
I miss him.

1137
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:18,933
I want to see him.

1138
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,018
I miss him.

1139
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,770
I want to see him.

1140
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,276
Hello?

1141
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,361
Ms. Dentist.

1142
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,530
Chief Hong.

1143
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,492
Where are you? When can we meet?

1144
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:38,077
I don't think we can meet today.

1145
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,747
People will gather at the community center
for a neighborhood meeting tomorrow,

1146
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,000
so I'll see you then.
Come to my house, okay?

1147
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,627
Hello? Chief Hong. Chief…

1148
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:49,922
Tomorrow?

1149
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,383
That's too long.

1150
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,804
I can't wait that long.

1151
01:06:56,887 --> 01:07:00,516
This is so unfair.

1152
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:15,114
I'm seeing her today.

1153
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,622
Yes. Let's wear this.

1154
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,709
Let's see.

1155
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,970
Time is passing by so slowly.

1156
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,972
All right.

1157
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:45,686
Gosh.

1158
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,898
Two and a half hours left.

1159
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,319
My heart's fluttering.

1160
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,282
Hold on. Why…

1161
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,327
Why won't the sun go down?

1162
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,578
I hope it will soon.

1163
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:09,126
Oh, no. Darn it.

1164
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,714
Mi-seon, I'm going on a date.

1165
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,426
Bye.

1166
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:19,678
Unbelievable.

1167
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:24,934
She's been single for way too long.

1168
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:27,561
She's having a blast.

1169
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,023
It's not like it's her first date.

1170
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:36,737
Exercising in the moonlight
Because I can't sleep

1171
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,698
But this chaotic life

1172
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:43,244
Du-sik, let's go
To the neighborhood meeting

1173
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,413
-What's wrong?
-I'm sorry,

1174
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:48,707
but I'm not feeling well.

1175
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,793
You must've overworked yourself.

1176
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,754
Yes, I think so.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1177
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,133
Can you tell them that I can't make it?

1178
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,343
Okay, I'll do that.

1179
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:00,761
Go home. Don't worry.

1180
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:04,223
I feel bad for not attending.

1181
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:05,891
Just go home. It'll be fine.

1182
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:08,102
I'll be going then.

1183
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,105
-What's wrong with me?
-Bye.

1184
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,261
Why aren't they coming? Gosh.

1185
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:46,432
Hey, Yeong-guk.
I mean, Mr. Chang. Over here.

1186
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,977
What is it? Why did you make me come
all the way here?

1187
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,897
I have a very important matter to discuss,

1188
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:56,734
so you should be here
as the village chief. There's Hwa-jeong.

1189
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,278
Ms. Yu, you're here too.

1190
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,364
Of course. She's also a resident here.

1191
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,658
-Right.
-Hello, Nam-suk.

1192
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:08,996
"Nam-suk"? Goodness,
you're awfully friendly.

1193
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:11,582
I don't think we were ever that close.

1194
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:13,042
We just never got the chance.

1195
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:16,629
I can be quite friendly. I'm pretty funny
too once you get to know me.

1196
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,547
I hope we get along.

1197
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,674
Sure. You are funny. I got it.

1198
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,470
Yeong-guk, have you been doing well?

1199
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,597
Of course, I have been doing great.

1200
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,683
I eat, breathe, and sleep well.

1201
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,685
But you couldn't poop.

1202
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:32,895
What?

1203
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,189
Why would you say that?

1204
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:37,316
I can tell by the color of your face.

1205
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,692
You're constipated.

1206
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,694
No, I'm not!

1207
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:43,447
Do you want some dandelion pills?

1208
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:46,283
-Stop talking nonsense!
-Don't get all worked up.

1209
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,160
-Hello.
-Hello.

1210
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,954
I'm here on behalf

1211
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,705
-of Hye-jin.
-I'm glad you came.

1212
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,207
-Thank you.
-You look pretty.

1213
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,167
-Goodness. Hi, guys.
-Gosh.

1214
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,211
-Hello.
-Hello.

1215
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:59,046
Hi, Bo-ra.

1216
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:00,130
Okay.

1217
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:04,134
Where are your manners? Say hello!

1218
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:05,761
Hello!

1219
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:06,804
-Hi!
-Hey!

1220
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:08,597
Good job.

1221
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,599
-Where's I-jun?
-Right. Where is he?

1222
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,185
He's staying at the restaurant
with the kitchen ladies.

1223
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,020
He wanted to solve math problems.

1224
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,815
I brought some jelly to share with him.

1225
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:18,774
-She did.
-Really?

1226
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:21,402
-Hello.
-Hello.

1227
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,946
What are you all doing out here?

1228
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:27,283
Why are you outside?
The mosquitoes will eat you up.

1229
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,410
By the way, what's today's agenda?

1230
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:31,036
-Oh, it's--
-Am I late?

1231
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,454
-Hey.
-Have you been waiting?

1232
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,706
Yes.

1233
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,082
Gosh. What is it?

1234
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:37,960
You must be curious about today's agenda.

1235
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:40,045
-Yes.
-Let me tell you.

1236
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,171
What is it about?

1237
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:54,101
Chief Hong!

1238
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:08,198
I've missed you so much.

1239
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:09,992
Me too.

1240
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,955
I hate that I can't see you often.

1241
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:15,956
Me too.

1242
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,666
I want to see you every day.

1243
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,127
I want to hear your voice every day.

1244
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,671
I want to hug you every day.

1245
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:23,672
Me too.

1246
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:27,009
Is that all you can say?

1247
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,640
I lived for 34 years without you,

1248
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,518
but each day seems to last forever

1249
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:38,729
since I've met you.

1250
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,274
Hye-jin, what's your deal?

1251
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,526
What have you done to me?

1252
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,489
Say it again.

1253
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,158
-Say what?
-My name.

1254
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:54,328
Hye-jin.

1255
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:56,789
Yoon Hye-jin.

1256
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:01,210
I've heard people
call my name millions of times.

1257
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,420
But it sounds unfamiliar now.

1258
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,341
As if I've got a new name.

1259
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,475
Gosh. I can't take it anymore.

1260
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:19,853
-She has a weak stomach.
-I'm sorry. She vomited.

1261
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:22,815
-Chief Hong, what are you…
-What a coincidence.

1262
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,067
It's… It's a misunderstanding.

1263
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:28,070
You see, you got it all wrong.

1264
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:29,405
-I see.
-I see.

1265
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,198
-Right.
-It's a misunderstanding.

1266
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,325
So…

1267
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:37,830
In other countries,
people hug each other all the time--

1268
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:38,956
We're dating.

1269
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:40,582
-My gosh.
-Ms. Dentist.

1270
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,751
-No way.
-I don't want to hide it anymore.

1271
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:44,837
I don't want any secrets.

1272
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:48,674
I want to love you openly.

1273
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,470
We're officially in a relationship.

1274
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,556
-Goodness.
-We know.

1275
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:58,225
Pardon?

1276
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:00,853
-What?
-It's been four days, right?

1277
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,730
No. It's been three days.

1278
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:09,069
Let me wipe it off.

1279
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,405
-Okay.
-Here? You're adorable.

1280
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:12,698
It's all over your face.

1281
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,408
I should give freebies to Ms. Yoon.

1282
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:16,034
Why aren't you eating?

1283
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,829
I want to see you a bit longer.

1284
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:22,291
I'm sorry about earlier. It must've hurt.

1285
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,918
-It was this side.
-This side?

1286
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:26,962
Let me blow the pain away.

1287
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:29,256
-Cheer up.
-Bye.

1288
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:33,677
Gosh, Du-sik left his phone here.

1289
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:36,597
What?

1290
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:39,558
I'm sorry. Here's a heart.

1291
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:40,767
-A heart?
-A heart?

1292
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,228
See? I told you so.

1293
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,231
They tried so hard
to keep their relationship a secret.

1294
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,692
Should we just tell them
that we know everything?

1295
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:51,862
Of course not.
We should make them tell us first.

1296
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,655
How? Any ideas?

1297
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,449
Well…

1298
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:57,910
-What?
-What is it?

1299
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,329
Let's make them miss each other terribly.

1300
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,039
They're head over heels right now.

1301
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:04,082
They'll become desperate
if they can't meet.

1302
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,752
The desperation will make their love grow.

1303
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:09,087
-Goodness.
-You're a genius.

1304
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,798
Should we make them pine for each other?

1305
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:14,718
Shall we?

1306
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:15,928
Gosh.

1307
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:17,888
Hold on.

1308
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,641
Let's go.

1309
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,435
You left this.

1310
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,480
You should've taken better care
of your belongings.

1311
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:27,940
You little…

1312
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:31,485
You and I are going to have a talk later.

1313
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:35,322
No. I have a family to take care of.

1314
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:40,369
Mi-seon, why are you so quiet?
What are you doing there?

1315
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:43,247
I had no idea. I just tagged along.

1316
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,373
Did you see that?

1317
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:48,210
I kept it a secret
despite knowing everything.

1318
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:50,879
I'm a woman of her word.

1319
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,631
I'm glad you did.

1320
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,133
Things worked out for them
because you stayed quiet.

1321
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,802
Chief Hong, congratulations.

1322
01:15:56,885 --> 01:16:00,097
Anyway, how did you
end up falling for each other?

1323
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,849
Ms. Yoon, congratulations.

1324
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,602
I'm glad.

1325
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,896
I truly am.

1326
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,525
I have nothing more to wish for.

1327
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:12,568
Goodness!

1328
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:15,904
This is great.

1329
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,283
All right, then.
Thank you very much, you guys.

1330
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:23,787
Now that we have your support,

1331
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,832
we'll love each other openly.

1332
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,793
That's great, Du-sik!

1333
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:32,337
Are you guys holding hands?

1334
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,548
Aren't they embarrassed
to do that in public?

1335
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:37,384
What's wrong with that? It's sweet.

1336
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:38,468
I want to vomit again.

1337
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:39,720
-Goodness.
-Hey.

1338
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:43,974
How did you manage
to keep it a secret all this time?

1339
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,435
Now that you all know,

1340
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:48,645
please don't get in our way.

1341
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:52,482
-We won't.
-She's so daring.

1342
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:36,401
I can't believe this was him.

1343
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:07,974
Today, the star princess
met the sea prince.

1344
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:13,939
The princess was crying,
but the prince made her laugh.

1345
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:19,319
I hope she returns to the beach
and meets him once again.

1346
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:25,158
Gosh, Hye-jin. Your taste in men

1347
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:27,035
hasn't changed at all.

1348
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:29,204
A prince?

1349
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:44,261
Our first day as a couple.

1350
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,729
This looks too simple.

1351
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:56,481
Let's see.

1352
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:02,839
Ta-da.

1353
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:04,633
-What's this?
-A bucket list.

1354
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:06,343
-Isn't this romantic?
-How so?

1355
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:07,844
Yippy.

1356
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:09,262
Go wash up.

1357
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:10,972
Wash up?

1358
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:14,267
Look out for Seong-hyeon
when you see him today.

1359
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:15,602
Give him a drumstick.

1360
01:20:15,685 --> 01:20:16,520
Here's the drumstick
I've been looking for.

1361
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:18,855
Hye-jin was worried about you.

1362
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,899
She said that you looked gaunt.

1363
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,485
How can you give up
because I pretended not to notice?

1364
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:24,444
Mi-seon!

1365
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:27,197
At times I can be a bit slow.

1366
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,074
Hey. Do you know how worried I was?

1367
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:32,285
I had no way of contacting you.

1368
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,162
Chief Hong. Hey!

1369
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,248
Sorry.

1370
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:42,921
