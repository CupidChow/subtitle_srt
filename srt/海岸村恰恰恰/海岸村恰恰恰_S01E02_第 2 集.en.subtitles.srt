1
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,994
DIVORCE BY MUTUAL CONSENT
CHANG YEONG-GUK, YEO HWA-JEONG

2
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:24,125
We all have moments we regret in life.

3
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,201
DEMO OF THE END AND THE BEGINNING,
OH YOON'S 2ND ALBUM

4
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,085
Nevertheless,

5
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,673
we can never turn back the clock.

6
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,639
TWO WEEKS AGO

7
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,642
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

8
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,270
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

9
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,980
EPISODE 2

10
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,950
Look. Sweet, isn't it?

11
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,494
Open your clinic here

12
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,497
and your patients will heal
just by looking out the window.

13
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,832
The view sure is nice.

14
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,752
Nothing beats this
when it comes to good feng shui.

15
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,087
Mountain in the back
and water in the front.

16
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,507
I see the ocean, but where's the mountain?

17
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,053
Have you forgotten about the hill
that's behind the marketplace?

18
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,140
If you're done, let's go. I'm a busy man.

19
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,602
Hold your horses.
I have a long checklist to go through.

20
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,564
Good water pressure and sunlight
are essential.

21
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,860
Does this air conditioner work?

22
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,322
It doesn't.
I see you're the exhausting type.

23
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,032
No, I'm just thorough.

24
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,659
What's this?

25
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,286
The storage room.

26
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,125
Where will we check out next?
Is it far from here?

27
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,753
This is the only one.

28
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,756
You said we should get going.

29
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,759
Yes, to check out the house
for you to live in.

30
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,513
Then this is the only one
you have to show me?

31
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,597
Yes.

32
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,446
Two bedrooms and one…

33
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,490
One bathroom.

34
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,326
An air-conditioner, gas stove, washer,

35
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,912
and even a dryer are provided.

36
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,749
Who uses this kind of wallpaper
these days?

37
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,504
Sweet, isn't it?
A tropical vibe with contrasting colors.

38
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,925
An eco-friendly atmosphere. Don't you
think it'll put you on a flowery path?

39
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,679
The interior design isn't my style at all.

40
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,515
What exactly is your style then?

41
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,019
-As if that changes anything.
-Let's hear it.

42
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:15,982
Well… An overall vibe that incorporates
an antique, simple, and European style.

43
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:21,195
Wainscot paneling on the walls
and porcelain tiles on the floor.

44
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,326
Spanish tiles in the foyer
and light fixtures from Denmark would do.

45
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,829
I doubt you understood any of it.

46
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,998
How about some new wallpaper instead?

47
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,208
Off-white like teeth would be nice.

48
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,627
Let's sign the contract.

49
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,216
Hold on. What did you say
will be provided other than the washer?

50
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,384
A dryer!

51
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,553
Are you saying you own

52
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,681
both the office building and apartment?

53
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,849
That's right.

54
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,852
Am I the only one
who finds this suspicious?

55
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,729
-What do you mean?
-Just think about it.

56
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,274
When she found out
I'd open a dental clinic here,

57
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,859
she introduced me to you,

58
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,528
and the office space
you showed me is hers.

59
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,739
How is this a coincidence?

60
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,203
You're not scamming me
because I'm not from around here, right?

61
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:15,583
Doctor, I get how this
might seem suspicious to you,

62
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,544
but ask anyone in this town.

63
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,130
Everyone knows who we are.

64
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,048
Exactly.

65
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,758
We could never scam anyone.

66
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm on government payroll, you see.

67
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,015
How can you be when you
obviously own a restaurant?

68
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,810
I guess it's my turn this time.

69
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,607
YEO HWA-JEONG, ZONE CHIEF

70
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,858
Zone chief?

71
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,028
That's right. The government pays me
300,000 won a month.

72
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,696
And 20,000 won more for a meeting.

73
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,158
Chief Hong is a regular chief.
Only 50,000 a year.

74
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,620
Forget it. She still doesn't believe you,
so let's give her better proof.

75
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,331
See how much of a bargain you're getting.

76
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,709
GONGJIN, CHUNG-HO

77
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,504
The office space you just saw

78
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,465
is the unit she had saved
for her second restaurant.

79
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,802
But she offered it to you
because she thought

80
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,097
it'd benefit the whole town
if you opened a dental clinic.

81
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,641
Hey, stop that. That's not necessary.

82
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,602
She should know, though.
Forget it if you don't want it.

83
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,781
All right. Take a copy each.

84
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,659
Now that the contract has been signed,

85
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:35,163
you will fulfill your duties
as landlady and tenant.

86
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,789
Good job.

87
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,041
-How many hours did you work today?
-Four.

88
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,088
So, for four hours…

89
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,215
Here.

90
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,511
I got that number too. I'll wire
the money. Coins can be a nuisance.

91
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,888
Much appreciated.

92
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,476
It's fine. You don't have to see us out.

93
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,326
Why are you following me?

94
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:18,206
You sure are dense, aren't you?
Do I really have to tell you?

95
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,790
What do you mean?

96
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,710
You need to pay me.
17,440 won for my service.

97
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,962
Did you say 17,440 won?

98
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,175
Listen up. Whatever the task,
I go by minimum wage.

99
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:33,095
I'm sure you know. The minimum wage
in 2021 is 8,720 won per hour.

100
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,390
I worked 4 hours, which is 34,880 won.

101
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,019
And it should be evenly split
between you and Ms. Yeo.

102
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,566
I only have big notes.

103
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,443
I always have change ready.

104
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,654
All right.

105
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,031
Take 2,000 won first.

106
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,493
And here's 560 won.

107
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,788
Are we done now?

108
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,416
Don't you need renovating?
I do that for minimum wage too.

109
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,460
As if anyone could do it.

110
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,129
I mentioned my high standards earlier.

111
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,680
What are they?

112
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,019
Wallpaper and painting,
cement work, tiles, heating,

113
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,104
even plumbing?

114
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,188
CERTIFIED PLUMBER

115
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,107
I'll consider myself hired.

116
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,866
He's so weird.

117
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,370
Did you say Gongjin?

118
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,706
Where the heck is that?

119
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,959
Gongjin, Chung-ho City, Gangwon Province.

120
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,921
You're nuts. How are you going
to live in such hicksville?

121
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,632
I'm in the middle
of drawing a big picture.

122
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,928
Take a look. Awesome, right?

123
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,014
PRIVATE CLINIC DOCTORS
EARN MORE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE

124
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,601
So you're moving there just to earn money?

125
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,978
Well,

126
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,647
I can't find a job here,

127
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,108
and it's impossible
to open a clinic in Seoul.

128
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,154
This could fatten my bank account
in a short period of time.

129
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,366
You still shouldn't have signed the lease
without even telling me.

130
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,701
Sorry.

131
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,662
What can I do when it's already signed?

132
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,667
But why are you packing already?

133
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,838
You need to put this place on the market,
and I'm sure it'll take a while.

134
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,214
It's already sold.

135
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,343
Housing is in high demand these days.

136
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,094
When are you moving then?

137
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,931
-The day after tomorrow.
-Hey!

138
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,894
-My gosh.
-Is someone pointing a gun at you?

139
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,395
What's with the rush?

140
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,856
It just happened that way.

141
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,232
Unbelievable.

142
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,113
I'll be so bored here without you.

143
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,700
We've never been apart
since middle school.

144
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,993
I know.

145
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,667
Mi-seon.

146
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,670
Take this.

147
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,172
This…

148
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,175
It'll look good on you
since you're slender and all.

149
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:20,930
Forget it! Do you think
I care about this stupid dress right now?

150
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,431
Just don't go. Stay here!

151
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,310
Why are you being like that?
You're making it hard for me to leave.

152
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:30,189
Don't leave. Just don't go.

153
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,484
-Are you crying?
-I'm not.

154
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:44,161
Come on. You're making me feel so bad.

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,088
Just so you know,
I hate this dress so much.

156
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,259
Give me that one instead. The nice one.

157
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,344
That one's too expensive.

158
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,805
-Cheapskate.
-Just try it on.

159
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,350
-Forget it.
-Darn it.

160
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,104
Just go. Go away to Gongjin.

161
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,344
-I'm good.
-You're doing great today.

162
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,971
MR. YU EXPRESS

163
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,640
What's going on?

164
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,059
-What is it?
-Hey.

165
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,187
What's up? Is there a party somewhere?

166
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,730
Hey, Chun-jae.

167
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:56,317
It's not Chun-jae.
I told you to address me as Oh Yoon.

168
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,361
-Not according to your birth certificate.
-It's Oh Yoon, damn it.

169
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,322
Fine. Oh Yoon.

170
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,366
Someone's moving into Ms. Yeo's house.

171
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,535
It's a young lady who's a dentist.

172
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,582
Wait. Was she really a dentist?

173
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,584
That girl's actually a dentist?

174
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,543
Do you know her?

175
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,420
Not personally.

176
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,297
You can say there's a debt between us.

177
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,674
A debt? What's that about?

178
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,136
She didn't seem to be dexterous,
so I'm kind of worried.

179
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,847
Why are you all shyly watching from afar?

180
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:27,848
Hello, Ms. Yeo.

181
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,434
-I see you're here to play landlady.
-She's not looking.

182
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,270
-She always ignores me.
-That goes in the living room.

183
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,271
Doctor.

184
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,940
Hello.

185
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,817
You didn't have to come.

186
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,487
How can I not when you're moving in today?

187
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,864
I see you have a lot of stuff.

188
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,324
Yes.

189
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,037
They all live around here.

190
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,539
I see.

191
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,249
Remember me from the cafe?

192
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,502
They are your neighbors now,
so say hello as you come and go.

193
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,628
-Sure.
-Say hello.

194
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,004
Hello, everyone.

195
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,299
-Where does this go?
-Excuse me.

196
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,344
To the room… No, let me lead the way.

197
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,642
Is she actually moving here?

198
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,941
She's pretty.

199
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,026
She resembles me in some ways.

200
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,868
Hey, Dad.

201
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,287
Yes, the move went smoothly.

202
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,331
I'm still so busy unpacking.

203
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,167
You can visit once the clinic opens.

204
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,004
Sure, and take care of yourself.

205
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,047
Bye.

206
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,250
-Why are you here at this hour?
-To verify your registration.

207
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,008
Are you worried
that I might have falsified my move?

208
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,970
What do you think of the wallpaper?
I chose one of the best ones.

209
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,556
Well, I guess it's not bad.

210
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,643
-So, what is it?
-I have a few things to tell you.

211
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,812
Recyclables are collected
every Wednesday at 9:00 a.m.

212
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,689
-At the end of the alley--
-Hold on.

213
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,277
-Recyclables?
-Bring them to the end of the alley.

214
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,572
Boxes like these
should be taken out the day before.

215
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,740
Got it.

216
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,701
The combination
to the front door lock is 870724.

217
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,203
-So, 87…
-And 0724.

218
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,955
Okay, 0724.

219
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,207
You can change it to whatever you want.

220
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,375
What's this number?

221
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,793
My birthday.

222
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,046
Why is my lock combination your birthday?

223
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,257
Nothing came to mind,
so I used the combination to my door lock.

224
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,510
Why would you tell me that?

225
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,805
Whatever. I didn't hear it.
I already forgot.

226
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:13,973
I'll throw this away.

227
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,433
You need it if you want
to change the combination.

228
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,978
Really? You should've just said so.

229
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,109
-Are you 35, then?
-Yes.

230
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,362
You're a year older than me.

231
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,281
Was that a hint of affection I heard?

232
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,908
Don't you dare show me any.

233
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,329
Are you nuts? I just got goose bumps.

234
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,291
Same here. All right.
That's all I came to tell you.

235
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,376
Any questions?

236
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,295
Go ahead.

237
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,757
Where can I get
a decent cup of coffee around here?

238
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,178
Taking a coffee to go is
how I start my workday.

239
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,180
There are a few near the harbor,

240
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,017
but that place is closest to your clinic.

241
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,268
Where's it?

242
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,686
The 4,000-won place.

243
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,730
No way.

244
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,526
Let bygones be bygones.
They're your neighbors now.

245
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,903
That's not it.

246
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,240
It's just that the coffee there is awful.

247
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,617
Give it another try.

248
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,454
And the renovation will take a while.
I'll let you know.

249
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,540
Sure. How long will it take, though?

250
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,541
I'll call you.

251
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,334
It can't take too long.

252
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,172
He just left.

253
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,093
Recyclables, Wednesday.

254
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:37,181
Lock combination, 8707…

255
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,450
You heard a new dental clinic
will open up, right?

256
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,368
Who hasn't heard?

257
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,954
I saw the dentist move in the other day,

258
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,500
and it's someone we all know!

259
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,962
It's the young lady
Chief Hong brought to the gutting deck.

260
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,297
-What?
-Are you sure?

261
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,800
Of course, I am!

262
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,761
So? What's so great about doctors?

263
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,388
My son is an accountant in Seoul.

264
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,684
Not that again.
Everyone in Gongjin knows now.

265
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,605
This is great, though. You've been
having trouble with your teeth,

266
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,273
so visit there once it opens.

267
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,276
You think I'll spend my money
for my damn teeth

268
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,279
when I don't have many days to live?

269
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,324
Tell me about it. That implant thingy

270
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,160
costs as much as a car.

271
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:44,915
Come on. You know
eating well is most important.

272
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,920
Over there. There's that dentist.

273
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,463
-What?
-What?

274
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,549
Goodness.

275
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,343
Is she…

276
00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:01,265
Did I see that right?
She's only wearing her long johns, right?

277
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,351
Is that what you saw too?

278
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,771
For a second, I thought my mind
was playing tricks on me.

279
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,483
My goodness. What has the world come to?

280
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,653
All of her skin was showing over here.

281
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,196
How embarrassing.

282
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,833
MODERN PHOTO STUDIO

283
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,467
I know a mischievous face when I see one.

284
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,668
Are the renovations over or not?

285
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,285
He did a good job.

286
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:49,998
It sure is nice.

287
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,638
-Chief Hong!
-What?

288
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,974
There he is.

289
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,725
Hey.

290
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:23,240
The gamju is sweet and refreshing.
Who made it?

291
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,200
Isn't it obvious? Du-sik, of course.

292
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,202
You know how to make it?

293
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,705
As if there's anything he can't do.

294
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,624
Apart from finding a wife, I mean.

295
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,917
You're absolutely right.

296
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,837
How did the conversation
turn that way all of a sudden?

297
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,548
Chief Hong,

298
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,634
why is this suit out here?

299
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,428
I'm throwing it out.

300
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,264
Why throw away something perfectly fine?

301
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,640
It looks expensive.

302
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,019
Maybe I should give it to my son-in-law.

303
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:57,399
Unbelievable. How can you give
your son-in-law a hand-me-down?

304
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,737
Hurry with the soap, will you?
I'm a very busy woman.

305
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,071
Okay. How many do you need?

306
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,115
-I'll take two.
-Two it is.

307
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,658
-Four for me.
-Noted.

308
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,535
-I'll take ten.
-Ten?

309
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,246
Ms. Mat-i, you're a big spender!

310
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,415
Nothing beats it
when it comes to rubbing off

311
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,208
the stench of squid and fish.

312
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,878
-Right.
-It's the absolute best.

313
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,339
Is that so? I appreciate
you saying that, ma'am.

314
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,258
I'll continue to sell it
at 500 won a piece.

315
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,427
That reminds me.

316
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,180
The young lady
you brought to the gutting deck

317
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,265
-is a dentist, correct?
-Yes.

318
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,643
My gosh. You won't believe what we saw.

319
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,772
-How can she be that way?
-Why? Did something happen?

320
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:41,151
A while ago, we saw her running
along the walking trail.

321
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,904
Her outfit couldn't be more raunchy.

322
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,991
Her top barely covered her
while her pants clung to her body.

323
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,703
I could see her sheer bottom
which had me looking away!

324
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:56,041
How can one run around
wearing something like that?

325
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,584
-How embarrassing.
-Gosh.

326
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,587
I could even see her belly button.

327
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,216
That's just workout gear.
Many people wear that these days.

328
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,842
-What?
-What?

329
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,183
Grab your soap now.

330
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,311
It smells incredible
thanks to the tangerine peel.

331
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,688
Who will take this? Gosh, I dropped one.

332
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:22,400
This one got crushed.
I'll cut another piece for you.

333
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,278
Two for Ms. Gam-ri.

334
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,324
Ms. Suk-ja wanted four, right?

335
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,868
And ten for Ms. Mat-i. You're so generous.

336
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,495
Why isn't anyone answering me?

337
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,416
Let's see.

338
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,549
Ms. Yeo?

339
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,135
Doctor. Hi, how are you?

340
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,763
Well, my goodness.

341
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,973
I'm still unpacking…

342
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,601
I love what you've done with the place.

343
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,645
It looks totally different.

344
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,899
Can I get you something to drink?

345
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,861
No, it's fine. I have to get going anyway.

346
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,070
I just came by

347
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:12,159
to invite you to the party
for the elderly we're having tomorrow.

348
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,537
I see. A party for the elderly?

349
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,248
What do you say? Can you make it?

350
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,250
I'd have to check my schedule.

351
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,128
Please stop by even though you're busy.

352
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,963
Greet your neighbors properly

353
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,048
and promote the opening of your clinic.

354
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,717
A promotion?

355
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,436
Here you go.

356
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,939
-Eat lots.
-Sure.

357
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,249
Let's just consider it
fixed and sunk costs.

358
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,668
-What are you standing there?
-Gosh.

359
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,337
I was about to join.

360
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,342
-What's with the camera?
-I'm here to take photos of the party.

361
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,426
By the hour?

362
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:14,012
Unfortunately, this one's for free.

363
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,057
Don't take my photos.
I value my portrait rights.

364
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,935
Don't worry. I have high standards
when it comes to my models.

365
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,649
Doctor, over here!

366
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,108
Yes, coming.

367
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,452
Welcome.

368
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,537
-Please have a seat.
-Hello.

369
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,415
You remember us, don't you?

370
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,460
Yes, of course.
I was grateful for the other day.

371
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,629
-You're a dentist, right?
-Yes.

372
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,341
I opened a dental clinic
in the building up there.

373
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,010
Please come by if your teeth bother you.

374
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,304
The world has changed
for the better, hasn't it?

375
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,932
Back then, we could barely make do,

376
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,226
so women rarely received higher education.

377
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,394
I see.

378
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,438
Anyway, enjoy the food.

379
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,900
From what I saw the other day,
you could use some food.

380
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,237
Hold on a second. This piece of meat

381
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,241
wrapped in some of this kimchi…

382
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,661
Go ahead. It's really good, you know.

383
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,579
Open wide.

384
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,375
-Here you go.
-I…

385
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:26,918
There.

386
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,424
What… Why aren't you eating it?

387
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,591
Well, I…

388
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,803
I'll have it later.
I'm not hungry right now, so…

389
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:41,141
Is it because she used her hands?
They're clean, you know.

390
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,268
No, that's not it.

391
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,565
Doctor, when did you get here?

392
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,941
Ms. Yeo.

393
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,861
Things were so hectic
that I didn't see you arrive.

394
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,904
Hello.

395
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,741
I saw you move in the other day.

396
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,618
I'm the owner of
Gongjin Korean-Chinese Restaurant.

397
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,163
-Hello.
-Right.

398
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:06,583
Goodness me. How have things been for you?

399
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,210
It turns out

400
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,798
you rented out the house and office space
that are in her name.

401
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,719
A good landlady should be in your cards,
but you ended up with a fussy one.

402
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,638
What are you spewing?

403
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,057
But I'm right.

404
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,142
Everyone knows you're a fussy one.

405
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,145
That's not true.

406
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,857
Doctor, I'm a friendly one, you know.

407
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,902
I gave you a discount on your deposit
since you leased two.

408
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,030
Don't hesitate to let me know
if anything bothers you.

409
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,866
-Actually, there are a few things.
-Goodness.

410
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,702
Do tell. I'll get it sorted immediately.

411
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,121
Is that so? Then could you

412
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,290
change the utility room floor tiles?

413
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,084
Why? Are there any cracks?

414
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,045
Actually, there are some minor cracks

415
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,714
which don't seem pleasant to the eyes.

416
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,051
-There's also a hole in the screen window.
-My gosh.

417
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,137
It's only as big as
a quarter of my pinky fingernail,

418
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:05,141
but mosquitoes and fruit flies
can still make it in

419
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,519
-which is a nuisance.
-Goodness.

420
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,230
-Also, you sell fish at your restaurant.
-Right.

421
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,650
Maybe you should consider
another way of grilling it.

422
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:17,404
The smell is quite overpowering, you see.

423
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,657
I'm particularly not fond
of fishy smells, so…

424
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,741
She's not wrong.

425
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,913
Hi, I'm Bo-ra's mother,
the owner of the supermarket nearby.

426
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:27,997
Hello.

427
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,624
And this is my husband.

428
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,042
-Hello.
-Hi.

429
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,169
-I run the hardware store.
-I see.

430
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,923
-It's nice to have some youth in the town.
-Right.

431
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,342
You didn't buy anything
at the store the other day.

432
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,261
-Really?
-Just come by anytime.

433
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:46,266
Actually, it's because
I didn't find what I was looking for.

434
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,435
-What?
-What? What didn't we have?

435
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,729
We have more items
than any other place in town.

436
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,689
-She's right.
-It's a shampoo

437
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,441
from a high-end brand,

438
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,359
so I doubt the countryside has it.

439
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,361
Countryside?

440
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,572
I went by just in case, but I was right.

441
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,282
Don't worry about it.

442
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,034
-I bought some online.
-I see.

443
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,829
-Honey, can you…
-Right.

444
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,830
Slow and steady.

445
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:13,084
Did you manage to get an
internet connection all the way out here?

446
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,087
I should go change the way I grill fish.

447
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,007
I should get going too.

448
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,384
Does the store not have certain items?

449
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,552
We have the essentials.

450
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:26,347
If your teeth ever bother you…

451
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,986
So you're really a dentist.

452
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,989
Yes.

453
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,449
My gosh.

454
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,786
I shouldn't have gotten
the wrong idea about you.

455
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,371
I apologize.

456
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,334
Let's forget what happened, shall we?

457
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:58,046
Let me properly introduce myself then.

458
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,340
A sleepless moonlit night

459
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,966
Right, you don't know the song.

460
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,010
Anyway, I'm Oh Yoon.

461
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,679
A singer.

462
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,639
Hello.

463
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,687
This happens to be my first studio album.

464
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,065
Think of it as a welcoming gift.

465
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,650
-For me?
-Yes.

466
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,194
Thank you. It also has my autograph.

467
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,113
Thank you.

468
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,201
Did you enjoy enough food?

469
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,536
Yes, go ahead.

470
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,093
Ms. Yeo, I'll take a bowl
of yukgaejang too.

471
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,263
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

472
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,640
Does the smell of my grilled fish
disgust you?

473
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,225
-Of course not.
-Right?

474
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,562
I always use fresh fish caught daily.

475
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,857
-Did someone say something?
-Forget it.

476
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:06,114
Greetings. This is the village chief,
Chang Yeong-guk.

477
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:11,160
Today, a party for the elderly

478
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:15,164
is taking place at the town hall.

479
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,167
We're gathering to wish
our elders good health.

480
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,921
Meat and rice cakes
will be served as part of the feast,

481
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:26,009
so please attend the party
if you haven't already

482
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,220
and make sure to get there
as soon as you can.

483
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:34,559
Just so you know, I would've won
the number one song on Top Ten Songs

484
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:38,438
if I hadn't gone up against
Seo Taiji and Boys in 1993.

485
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:41,232
Do you know the song "Hayeoga"?

486
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,775
-To you, I'm--
-That song I know.

487
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,652
See? Everyone knows "Hayeoga."

488
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,446
Do you know what Korea's number two

489
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,989
-national treasure is?
-No.

490
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,366
The ten-story Stone Pagoda
at Wongaksa Temple Site.

491
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,036
We all know what
the number one treasure is,

492
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,203
but not number two.

493
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,623
It's the same with you.
You know "Hayeoga,"

494
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,750
but not "Exercising in the Moonlight."

495
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,169
No one ever remembers second place.

496
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,379
Why am I so worked up about this?

497
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,673
It's not you I'm blaming.

498
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:10,053
Anyway, my second album
was well on its way.

499
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,596
I poured my soul into it.

500
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,848
I even recorded the title song,

501
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,976
but my manager ran off
with all of the production funds.

502
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,147
And while I looked for him
everywhere throughout the country,

503
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,524
people forgot about me.

504
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,903
Since then, all I could do
was sing at nightclubs,

505
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,614
and I ended up settling here in Gongjin.

506
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,202
-I met a woman, you see.
-I need to use the restroom.

507
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,495
Yes, sure thing.

508
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,039
I see you go to the restroom often.

509
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,710
Ms. Dentist, why don't you come
have a bowl of yukgaejang too?

510
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,755
-I'm good.
-Why not? Still on a diet?

511
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,049
That's not it.
I just don't have an appetite.

512
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,634
But it smells incredible.

513
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,514
Are you aware of how much dust is here?

514
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,224
And there are so many people here.

515
00:32:56,307 --> 00:33:00,144
Food cooked out here in the open
is just unsanitary.

516
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,564
Hold on a second.
Are you calling this soup dirty?

517
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,816
I'm just saying.

518
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,360
Spoken like a fussy Seoulite.

519
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,404
Must you be so picky?

520
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,824
Why can't you look the other way
and only see the good things?

521
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,117
What for?

522
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,828
Because you just moved here and--

523
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,581
Hey, Mi-seon. Where are you?

524
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,794
I'm out grocery shopping.

525
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:28,840
My boyfriend's been busy at work,
so we haven't been able to get together.

526
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,258
I thought I'd cook for him.

527
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,135
Devoted, aren't you?

528
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,557
What's with the commotion?

529
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,227
This is Oh Yoon speaking. It's not
a true party without a song from me!

530
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,813
Geum-cheol, let's do this!

531
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,856
All right!

532
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,483
-Just a second.
-When spring comes

533
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,820
You said you'd come to me

534
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:55,575
Like a singing swallow

535
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,826
Geum-cheol!

536
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,581
A party for the elderly?
You really went there?

537
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,250
I was hoping I could
promote my new clinic,

538
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,710
but I shouldn't have come.

539
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,004
Why's that? It's not for you, is it?

540
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,589
You have no idea.

541
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,467
In a yard where dirt is kicked up,

542
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,635
they grill meat, boil soup, and sing.

543
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,889
On top of that, the old ladies
use their bare hands when eating.

544
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:21,434
Gosh, it's like they're doing
everything you hate.

545
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,603
Exactly.

546
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,689
Looking up at the blue sky

547
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,690
I'm reminded of you!

548
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,817
I'm reminded of you

549
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,444
Geum-cheol!

550
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,446
Just like a swallow

551
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,948
My heart flies to you

552
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,577
This is so annoying.
I shouldn't have come.

553
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,288
CANCEL

554
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,665
Hey, what the hell?

555
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,000
-What?
-Darn it.

556
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,628
-Hey, who did that?
-It was getting good.

557
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,837
What's going on?

558
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,509
I don't like anything here.
Maybe I should've just stayed in Seoul.

559
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,468
-What?
-What?

560
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:59,472
There's this cafe owner here
who's apparently

561
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,140
an obscure singer.

562
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,017
Do you know Oh Yoon?

563
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,480
You don't know, right?

564
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:11,776
He keeps on talking about himself
when I didn't even ask.

565
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:16,030
His second album was scrapped
after his manager took off with the money.

566
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,741
Isn't that an excuse though?

567
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:23,538
If he had the willpower or talent,
he would've made it one way or another.

568
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,542
-I…
-Don't. It's all right.

569
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,001
-Living in the past
-I'm good.

570
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,711
when one's present is in shambles?

571
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,547
That's only what cowards do.

572
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,883
-I feel bad though.
-About what?

573
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,428
I feel bad for those
whose hopes are left behind in the past.

574
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,850
One's unfulfilled dreams
tend to hold a place in the heart.

575
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:50,022
Anyway, I'm nearly at the cashier now.

576
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,774
Right, bye.

577
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,807
Unbelievable.
How could you have left the mike on?

578
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,725
Turn it off!

579
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,101
What?

580
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,186
Oh, gosh.

581
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,691
Chun-jae.

582
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,568
-Chun-jae!
-Chun-jae!

583
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,150
Here you are. I looked everywhere for you.

584
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,153
Why did you have to… Damn it.

585
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,782
You should take more photos.
Why are you here?

586
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,450
I took enough.

587
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,789
Chun-jae, are you all right?

588
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:36,212
Don't take what she said to heart.
Consider it as ignorant babbling.

589
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,299
All she said is right though.

590
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,552
My life is worthy of such an assessment.

591
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,763
What are you talking about?

592
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,765
Regulars come by to hear your song,

593
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,059
and you have a daughter you love so much.

594
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:58,317
You know what?
Let's go someplace nice for a drink

595
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,569
and lighten our mood.

596
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,655
I need to make lunch for Ju-ri.

597
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,242
She didn't want to eat at the party today,

598
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,910
which I scolded her for.

599
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,039
Good thing she didn't come.

600
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,626
I'm off.

601
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,097
DENTAL HYGIENIST WANTED

602
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,308
NEW DENTAL CLINIC IN GONGJIN
LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE

603
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,356
Me and my big mouth.

604
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,444
To hell with my business.
I should pack up.

605
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,791
Delivery. Are you Yoon Hye-jin?

606
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,959
I am.

607
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,794
Can you sign here?

608
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,089
I didn't expect it to get here so soon
since it's an overseas delivery.

609
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,967
That's how it usually is,

610
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,011
but this one's early.

611
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,804
You really do everything around here.

612
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,560
What? Why are you staring at me like that?

613
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,147
-You think you're better than everyone.
-What?

614
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,067
Being smart, you got good grades
and became a dentist.

615
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,194
Your life must've been smooth.

616
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:27,281
Not always, of course,
but all you hit were simple speed bumps.

617
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,408
Getting over those small bumps,

618
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,078
you thought that willpower
could get you anywhere.

619
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,288
If this is about earlier, stop.

620
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,874
I shouldn't have to hear this from you.

621
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,835
Why not? You freely judge
other people's lives,

622
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,921
but are offended
when you're being assessed?

623
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,425
Look here, doctor.
It seems like you're mistaken.

624
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,346
Life isn't so fair for all of us.

625
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,266
Some spend their whole lives
on unpaved roads,

626
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,687
while some run at full speed
only to reach the edge of a cliff.

627
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,564
Got that?

628
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,833
What now? Do you have more to say?

629
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,088
Mi-seon?

630
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,844
I took a cab here.

631
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,762
It cost me 200,000 won.

632
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,806
What's going on?

633
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,815
Let's head inside.

634
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,525
Damn bastard.

635
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,322
So you went to his place with groceries,

636
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,242
and a woman with a two to eight parting

637
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,703
was there in his dress shirt?

638
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,204
Yes.

639
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,791
Apparently, she came after landing.
She's a flight attendant.

640
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,709
And?

641
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,088
Both she and I had no idea.

642
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,757
-That's when the bastard crawled in.
-And?

643
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,385
We both took out items
from the grocery bag.

644
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,263
I wielded spring onions
while she swung the net of onions.

645
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,516
Wasn't there anything sharp?

646
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,644
The spring onions were the sharpest item.

647
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,191
You're a true friend
who'd let me ruin my life completely.

648
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,569
Come on. We're going back to Seoul.

649
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,904
Sit back down.

650
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,906
Why? We should go and kill that bastard.

651
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,826
Or did you already?

652
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,288
Enough with the crap
and take down that classified ad.

653
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,671
Board and lodging
and a ten percent raise. Okay?

654
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,134
Deal?

655
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,677
Deal.

656
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,680
Come here!

657
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,311
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

658
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,562
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

659
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,530
It's finally D-day.

660
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,365
Let's get off to a good start.

661
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,385
YOON DENTAL CLINIC OPENING EVENT

662
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,905
I guess word didn't spread properly.

663
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:59,410
What if I promote the clinic online?
I have 50,000 followers on social media.

664
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,704
BORA SUPERMARKET

665
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,872
-Hello.
-Hello.

666
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,756
-Hello.
-Hello.

667
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,925
Yun-gyeong, I'd like to buy some shampoo.

668
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,094
The one with the nice scent.

669
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:19,888
Unbelievable.

670
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,140
What's going on?

671
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,647
Hey, did you do something wrong?

672
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,082
What is it?

673
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,834
What?

674
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,424
What's wrong?

675
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,802
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

676
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,387
Why do you keep glancing at her?

677
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,932
It's nothing. The anchovies
are on the smaller side today.

678
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,436
Well, they're supposed to be small.

679
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,104
-Right.
-They look delicious.

680
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,982
Goodness.

681
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:13,942
Gosh!

682
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,404
Seriously? And you're telling me this now?

683
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,658
If I had told you sooner,
you wouldn't have moved here.

684
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,410
You're not a friend, but a scam artist.

685
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:29,500
What am I going to do?
The rumors must've spread.

686
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,421
Forget it.

687
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,549
Private clinics can't stay afloat
without the town's trust.

688
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,219
Let's pack it up and head back to Seoul.

689
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,887
How can I

690
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,264
when I spent a fortune here?

691
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,892
Don't think of it like that.
Cut your losses now,

692
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,979
or you'll spend months being in the red.

693
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,731
Like my dad.

694
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,403
Hey!

695
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,321
Where are you going?

696
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,198
Where is she going?

697
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,896
Out for some moonlight jogging?

698
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,112
You must be angry
about what I said that day.

699
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,073
By the way,

700
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,952
how about you run
in a different outfit next time?

701
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,415
-What?
-Rumor has it

702
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,667
that the dentist
runs around in her long johns.

703
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,753
These are leggings.

704
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,048
Whether I wear long johns or a bikini
is none of their business.

705
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:04,011
Yes, you're right. But I'd appreciate
you meeting them halfway.

706
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,347
I see you've yet
to catch up with the world.

707
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,308
Meddling can be dangerous, you know.

708
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:13,520
I know that it's for a better workout
and not for other people to see.

709
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,397
-But?
-This may sound old-fashioned,

710
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,734
but this isn't Seoul.
The town has an older population.

711
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,068
It sure is exhausting.

712
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,447
Yet, you're the one
who chose to open a dental clinic here.

713
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,283
Don't we all need some time to adjust?

714
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:31,538
I've thought about it,
and all people make mistakes.

715
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,501
Technically speaking, you didn't know
that the mic was turned on.

716
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,462
We all badmouth others
at least once in our lives.

717
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,922
It'll be fine, so don't worry.

718
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,676
Everyone in this town is probably busy
talking smack about you too.

719
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:49,723
Now that things are even,
you can move forward from here.

720
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,434
Did you hand out rice cakes?

721
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,813
Unbelievable.

722
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,369
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

723
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,453
Ms. Yeo.

724
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,333
Hello. This is to celebrate
the opening of my clinic.

725
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,545
Right. I see you bought rice cakes.

726
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,755
-Please have it while it's warm.
-Thank you.

727
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,344
Hello, I'm here from Yoon Dental Clinic.

728
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,762
Please have some rice cakes.

729
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,057
You can leave it here.

730
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,188
Have a good day.

731
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,607
Darn it. Why isn't this working?

732
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,067
BORA SUPERMARKET

733
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,235
Hello.

734
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,112
Have some rice cake.

735
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:48,073
I'm being tested for
gestational diabetes tomorrow.

736
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,533
I see you can't have any.

737
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,578
Sorry about that.

738
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,996
I'm sorry.

739
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,208
Hello.

740
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,712
Yoon Dental Clinic just opened.
I hope we get along.

741
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,600
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

742
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,826
Hey, it's the dentist!

743
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,746
-Hello.
-Hello.

744
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,289
Hi, kids.

745
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:38,749
What are you up to?

746
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,212
What's this?

747
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,840
Is it a hedgehog?

748
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,091
Yes.

749
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,134
No way.

750
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,059
You want me to take care of it?

751
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:01,229
Yes, we saved up our allowance to buy it,

752
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,107
but my mom won't let me keep it.

753
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,734
GONGJIN MARKET

754
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,694
You can take it instead then.

755
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,905
I was going to,

756
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,532
but I haven't been able
to tell my mom yet.

757
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:16,119
He'll ask her once he wins a prize
at the math competition.

758
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,329
Is that so?

759
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:20,916
That'll be really hard.
Are you sure you can do it?

760
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,043
He's super smart!

761
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,087
He gets a perfect score all the time.

762
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,838
Really?

763
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,845
Still, I'm afraid I can't take this.

764
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:39,226
Hey, why don't you ask
Chief Hong to look after it?

765
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,395
We already asked,

766
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,689
and he declined.

767
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,856
Why?

768
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,905
He acts all high and mighty
but declines a child's request?

769
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,244
I'm sorry to say this,
but I can't look after it either.

770
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:59,871
Pets aren't really my thing,

771
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,541
and providing for myself is tough enough.

772
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:06,336
Look for someone else to help, okay?
Again, I'm sorry.

773
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,630
Enjoy your rice cake.

774
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,636
See? I told you she wouldn't do it for us.

775
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:20,308
My mom said that
she's such a cold-hearted person.

776
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:33,363
Money sure is great.
You always get what you pay for.

777
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,407
How was the facial?

778
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,408
Gosh.

779
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,454
What's this? Is that a hedgehog?

780
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,247
Where did you get it?

781
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,333
Someone asked me
to take care of it for a few days.

782
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,086
Who in this town would ask you?

783
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:52,382
Well, my first patient in Gongjin did.

784
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,594
What do you mean?
We still have zero patients.

785
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,680
Hey.

786
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,974
What's with all this mail?

787
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,811
How many charity organizations
do you support?

788
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,105
Jeez. It's not that many.

789
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,774
Not that many, my foot.

790
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,276
Single mothers, low-income households,

791
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,236
and schools in Africa.

792
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,031
Shouldn't you be
tightening your belt instead?

793
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,533
Until we get patients,
cut back on monthly donations.

794
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,243
Look at it run.

795
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,370
Just look at it go.

796
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,540
-There you go.
-Unbelievable.

797
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,168
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

798
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,213
REGULAR PERFORMANCE CANCELED

799
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,466
Chun-jae, has today's performance
been canceled?

800
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,302
Yes, I'm not feeling all that good.

801
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,553
What, how bad is it?

802
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,389
What? My head is a bit…

803
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,978
Customers never seem
to finish their coffee. What a waste.

804
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,439
-That's because it's no good.
-What?

805
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,025
Your coffee tastes awful.
Uncle Du-sik's is good though.

806
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,944
-It's really bad.
-Ju-ri, stop.

807
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,362
-What? It's true.
-Right?

808
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,114
I don't do anything right.

809
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,623
Ju-ri, I know you've hit puberty
and want to rebel

810
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,333
-every three seconds.
-Puberty?

811
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,419
But don't be so mean to your father.
You'll regret it later.

812
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,213
-You smell like a geezer.
-What?

813
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,589
-You stink.
-I don't.

814
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,757
You do.

815
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,761
I only say this
because I'm the slightest bit wiser.

816
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:23,682
-And I sound like an adult, not a geezer.
-"Adult."

817
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:27,435
-Don't be crooked like your eyebrows.
-Wait. Do my eyebrows look weird?

818
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,645
That can't be.

819
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,648
Gosh. They look perfectly fine!

820
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,984
I sure did a good job on them.

821
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,366
Jeez.

822
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,507
THE END AND THE BEGINNING
OH YOON

823
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,718
DEMO OF THE END AND THE BEGINNING,
OH YOON'S 2ND ALBUM

824
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,730
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

825
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:15,066
WEEKDAYS 9:00 TO 18:00
SATURDAYS 9:00 TO 12:00

826
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,110
I hope we get patients today.

827
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:20,196
We will. You handed out
the rice cakes, remember?

828
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,197
The rice cakes?

829
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,456
Welcome.

830
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,874
Good day.

831
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,042
What the hell?

832
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,589
You still don't get it.

833
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,132
Why are you on my case again?

834
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,509
Because you're pathetic.
Do you really think

835
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,595
that giving out rice cakes was enough?

836
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,055
I followed your advice.

837
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,516
-It made no difference.
-Because it was insincere.

838
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,062
Didn't you reluctantly show your face
and ask them to come by some time?

839
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,438
I can almost see it.

840
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,564
So what?

841
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,483
-Come with me.
-Where?

842
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,652
Would you rather let your business tank?

843
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,198
Are you nuts? Why would you bring me here?

844
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:06,785
Aren't you a resident too?
You should be at the neighborhood meeting.

845
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,328
You know what I mean.

846
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,747
-I can't go in there.
-Jeez.

847
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,541
Will you just keep avoiding them then?

848
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,418
If you can't pick up spilt milk,

849
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,296
you should at least
apologize to them for spilling the milk,

850
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,923
rather than avoid them.

851
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,801
Go in already. I'm busy.

852
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,094
Aren't you going in?

853
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,054
No, I have other things to do.

854
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:26,972
Wait.

855
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,349
How can I possibly go in there alone?

856
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,267
They're all strangers to me.

857
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,769
Are you leaning on me?

858
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,272
-Of course not.
-Then get in there already.

859
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,359
Don't even think about running.
I'll hunt you down.

860
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,737
Are you leaning on me?

861
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,030
No.

862
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:59,421
Did she really think that
giving out the rice cakes would do?

863
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,089
I thought she was nice,

864
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,550
but she thinks my supermarket
is a corner shop

865
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,677
and calls Gongjin the countryside.

866
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,723
She couldn't be more wrong.
This is an old town with a long history.

867
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,058
It has history and is on the bigger side.

868
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,728
Gongjin used to be home
to the Dragon King.

869
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,063
But there she is running
while barely covered.

870
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,024
It must've angered the Dragon King.

871
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,108
Tell me about it.

872
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:23,194
And how dare she
look down on us like that?

873
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,946
It sure is upsetting.

874
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:28,825
That's enough. Please drop it already.

875
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,785
What do you mean we should drop it?

876
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,954
Aren't you just as pissed off?

877
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:36,082
When will you stop hitting people
while you talk?

878
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,333
When did I do that?

879
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,918
You did it just now.

880
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,628
Sitting next to you hurts.

881
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:44,382
Stop accusing me
of something I didn't do. My gosh.

882
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,634
Chun-jae, you tell me. Did I do that?

883
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,178
Goodness.

884
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:52,015
Must you two get into it again?

885
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,683
Gosh.

886
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,936
Hello, everyone.

887
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,979
-What?
-Huh?

888
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,689
-Dr. Yoon!
-What?

889
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:03,359
I never expected you
to attend the neighborhood meeting.

890
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,694
Tell me about it.

891
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,781
I'm sorry about the town hall
not meeting your high standards.

892
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,616
Jeez.

893
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,994
God, it's heavy. Move out of the way.

894
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,332
-Gosh, this almost killed my back.
-What is it?

895
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,793
-I'm a little late, aren't I?
-Yes.

896
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,587
I went to bring today's snacks.

897
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,047
-Snacks?
-Yes.

898
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,716
It's all Dr. Yoon's treat.

899
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,759
-What?
-What?

900
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:28,843
She asked for my help.

901
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,347
She was edgy because she just moved,
so she made a mistake.

902
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,058
She wanted to apologize
and asked me to prepare some food.

903
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:43,775
Yun-gyeong, I bought these
from your store earlier

904
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,485
-and left a receipt.
-Really?

905
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,736
Of course.

906
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,447
Please take your pick then!

907
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:53,701
We have yugwa and gangjeong,
as well as fruits and beverages.

908
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,662
For those with bad teeth,

909
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,290
there are white and yellow peaches.

910
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,084
-Goodness.
-Yellow peaches?

911
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,379
-Don't just sit there. Help me.
-Of course.

912
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,880
-Geum-cheol.
-Yes?

913
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,298
Me? Okay.

914
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,758
Take this.

915
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,844
-Take the box.
-Here you go.

916
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,263
-It's fine. You can take a seat.
-Goodness.

917
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,390
-Here.
-My gosh.

918
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,519
Here. Take the beverages.

919
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,229
And this.

920
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,398
-Also…
-She bought a lot.

921
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,777
So that'll be the end of today's meeting.

922
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,822
I hope you didn't forget about
the weekly cleaning this Saturday.

923
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:31,781
-No.
-Of course not.

924
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,616
Please bring your cleaning tools

925
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,620
and gather at the recycling site
at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

926
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,497
-Right.
-Got it.

927
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,999
Before we wrap up,

928
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:46,379
let's give it up for Dr. Yoon who
provided the snacks for today's meeting.

929
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,630
Right.

930
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,257
It was nice.

931
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,010
We enjoyed it.

932
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,386
Everything was good.

933
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:00,727
I enjoyed those snacks.

934
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,187
-Bye.
-Good night.

935
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,730
Good job for today.

936
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,773
You too, Ms. Gam-ri.

937
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,650
-Get some rest then.
-Good night.

938
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,693
-Bye!
-Good night!

939
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,321
-Thanks for today.
-Chun-jae, get home safely.

940
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,489
-Good night.
-You too.

941
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,455
Thank you for today.

942
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,000
I didn't expect you to care so much.

943
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,299
-Give me your hand.
-What?

944
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,051
Show me your hand.

945
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,052
My hand?

946
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,160
-What's this?
-Take a look.

947
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,959
A total of 125,000 won?

948
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,795
Before I knew it, I bought that much.

949
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,714
You know where to wire the money, right?

950
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,677
So does this mean

951
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:20,139
you bought the snacks to help me,

952
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,059
-but I have to pay?
-Of course.

953
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:25,937
You're obviously richer,
so why should I pay?

954
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,605
-You're telling me now?
-Why not?

955
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,191
I didn't ask you to do this.

956
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,485
You didn't even ask for my consent.

957
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,571
You should work on how to say thanks.

958
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:38,283
Neighborhood meeting or whatnot,
don't invite me to events like this again.

959
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,451
I won't let it slide.

960
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,412
Wire it by the end of the day. Bye.

961
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,830
I warned you.

962
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,081
Duly noted.

963
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,253
What the hell?

964
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,880
I'm not grateful anymore.

965
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,052
Hurry, guys.

966
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,388
-Hurry over!
-Morning!

967
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,266
-Morning.
-Hurry up. Just look at the time!

968
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,184
-There they come.
-Hello.

969
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,145
Honey, I told you to stay home.

970
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,230
-Let's get this over with.
-Hello.

971
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,691
Let's split into teams

972
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:15,612
and pick up the trash thoroughly.
We'll all contribute, okay?

973
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,531
Thank you, everyone.
Let's get started then.

974
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:30,501
Goodness. I see you just got up.

975
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,670
Right. What is this about?

976
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:35,882
At the neighborhood meeting,
I mentioned the weekly cleaning.

977
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:40,219
Everyone else showed up, but you didn't
until well over 9:00 a.m., so I came.

978
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,638
Right.

979
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,642
Could I perhaps skip it this once?

980
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,019
As you know, I just moved here.

981
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,812
I'll participate starting next week.

982
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,314
Sure thing.

983
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:52,732
All right, then.

984
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,740
That's understandable.

985
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:07,455
Ms. Dentist, get out here.

986
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:11,000
Get out here, Ms. Dentist!

987
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,251
He's so annoying.

988
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,047
I know you're in there.

989
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,840
I won't leave until you come out.

990
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:21,552
Get out here!

991
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,471
Ms. Dentist!

992
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,015
Jeez.

993
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,644
Out. Get out.

994
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:33,189
Go, see what he wants!

995
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:50,998
Chief Hong,

996
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,252
I feel a little under the weather.

997
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:57,130
Opening the clinic
must've taken a toll on me.

998
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,047
What?

999
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,470
I have a fever too.

1000
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,598
Is that so? That's too bad.

1001
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,059
Let me see. Hold on.

1002
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,019
Found it.

1003
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,980
Here it is.

1004
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,232
Here.

1005
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,237
That's 36.3°C.

1006
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,740
You're 0.2°C below average.

1007
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:24,991
Well…

1008
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,243
Maybe I run colder.

1009
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:28,661
Get out here now!

1010
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,914
Just leave me alone!

1011
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,542
I need my sleep.

1012
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,394
Chun-jae.

1013
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,021
Help the ladies over there.

1014
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:57,940
Won't you sweep?

1015
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,651
Can't you see that I am?
I'm not the only one out here.

1016
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,333
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

1017
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,480
The clinic is open, right?

1018
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,942
Right, of course. Ms. Pyo?

1019
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,652
-It's your first time, right?
-Yes.

1020
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,737
-Please fill out this form first.
-Sure.

1021
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,072
-Right here.
-Got it.

1022
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,667
-Here.
-Thank you.

1023
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,587
Mr. Choi Eun-cheol, shall we?

1024
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,713
Okay.

1025
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:08,636
Hello.

1026
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:10,721
Hello.

1027
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,974
Hello. It's your first time, right?

1028
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,812
I went there because you recommended it,
and it was nice.

1029
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:19,981
Really?

1030
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,942
The treatment didn't hurt
which shows her competence,

1031
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,652
and the cost was reasonable.

1032
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:26,946
I'm glad.

1033
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:28,906
Anyway, thanks.

1034
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,199
See you.

1035
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,244
-No customers?
-You're here.

1036
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,121
I'm sorry I had to step out.

1037
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,456
Don't be. I'm paid to watch the cafe.

1038
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,793
One might think I actually pay you a lot.

1039
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,879
Why you won't accept a raise is beyond me.

1040
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,422
I like things the way they are.

1041
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:46,048
Aren't you going fishing today?

1042
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,675
I'm here, so get going.

1043
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:48,968
After I'm done with this.

1044
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,637
By the way,
I uploaded a file on your computer.

1045
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:54,098
A file? What kind of file?

1046
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,727
Your second title song,
"The End and the Beginning."

1047
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:01,022
2ND ALBUM THE END AND THE BEGINNING

1048
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:03,190
I didn't think it belonged in the trash.

1049
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,403
Times have changed.

1050
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:10,948
It's been digitized, so you
don't need to listen to it on a tape.

1051
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,995
How nice of you to care so much about me.

1052
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,706
Thanks, Du-sik.

1053
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,210
I'm good though.

1054
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:24,921
What?

1055
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,507
I'm done reminiscing my past.

1056
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:32,053
I can't make it big
as a singer anymore at this age,

1057
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:34,180
so I should focus on the present.

1058
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,767
I'm going to put my head on straight
and improve the cafe instead.

1059
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:41,646
I need to put Ju-ri through fashion school
so that she can become a designer.

1060
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,655
-Chun-jae.
-So can you teach me how to make coffee?

1061
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:54,784
How can I run a cafe when I can't
even make a decent cup of it?

1062
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,243
I guess that was bad.

1063
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,203
I'm in.

1064
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,330
I won't go easy on you.

1065
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:00,539
-Got it.
-Right.

1066
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,458
-Get over here then.
-Right now?

1067
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:05,169
Of course. I said I wouldn't
go easy on you.

1068
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,213
-Gosh.
-Darn.

1069
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,131
Even I don't drink the coffee I make.

1070
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,427
Thank you. Please have a good day.

1071
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,429
Ms. Park In-sun?

1072
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:17,765
Hello, sir.

1073
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,600
Is this your first time here?

1074
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,859
You're almost done.

1075
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,530
Suction, please.

1076
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:33,531
Okay.

1077
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:45,001
WALDEN BY HENRY DAVID THOREAU

1078
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:51,674
WHAT I DESIRE ARE
THE FLOWERS AND FRUIT OF PEOPLE

1079
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:03,728
Hye-jin, my gosh. What a day.
It was exhausting, wasn't it?

1080
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:07,356
No, I was so happy
that I didn't feel tired at all.

1081
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,984
This could be the beginning
of great success!

1082
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,862
Tell me about it.

1083
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:17,241
It's odd though.
How did we get so many all of a sudden?

1084
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:18,617
What?

1085
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,871
Our situation changed literally overnight.

1086
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,332
Did my social media pay off?

1087
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:32,214
Or maybe the bad rumors about you
have finally subsided.

1088
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:40,222
Life isn't so fair for all of us.

1089
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:44,602
Some spend their whole lives
on unpaved roads,

1090
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:48,981
while some run at full speed
only to reach the edge of a cliff.

1091
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,944
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

1092
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:01,786
I…

1093
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,372
listened to the album you gave me.

1094
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:07,792
Right.

1095
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,293
To be honest though,

1096
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,088
"Exercising in the Moonlight"
wasn't all that good.

1097
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:14,757
I see.

1098
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,217
But,

1099
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,011
I did enjoy "Blue Scar on the Heart".

1100
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:25,059
The melody was nice
and I could relate to the lyrics.

1101
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:26,852
I really liked it.

1102
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,525
Oh, I see.

1103
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,652
So that's more your style.

1104
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,657
I'm truly sorry about
what I said that day.

1105
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:44,578
That day? And what day would that be?

1106
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,336
Have you perhaps seen Chief Hong today?

1107
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:54,839
You mean Du-sik? Well,

1108
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:57,550
he went out to the mudflats.

1109
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,385
Would you be able to find it though?

1110
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:03,055
-From Gongjin Harbor--
-Yes, I know where it is.

1111
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,723
I see. It's where Turtle Rock is.

1112
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,184
Right. Well, enjoy your smoke.

1113
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,103
Actually, I'm trying to quit.

1114
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,731
-Thank you.
-Thanks to you too.

1115
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,698
I really should quit.
A singer shouldn't smoke.

1116
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,629
2ND ALBUM THE END AND THE BEGINNING

1117
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,549
3. "THE END AND THE BEGINNING"

1118
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,693
Chief Hong.

1119
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,697
Chief Hong!

1120
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,702
Fancy seeing you here.

1121
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:53,040
Well, I had something to say.

1122
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:56,835
Go ahead.

1123
01:10:57,836 --> 01:11:01,006
The clinic had a surge of patients today,

1124
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,050
and I think I have you to thank.

1125
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,095
I thought about
what you said the other day too.

1126
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,431
I'm not saying you were right,

1127
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,685
-but you have a point--
-I can't hear a thing!

1128
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,019
Can you come up here?

1129
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,563
I don't think I can.

1130
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,068
Your shoes always cause trouble.

1131
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,536
Here.

1132
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:33,789
Come on.

1133
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:26,717
Did I keep you waiting long?

1134
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,055
Absolutely.
Did you catch a lot of fish today?

1135
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,849
Well, there was a ton caught on the net.

1136
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:36,727
Some of your favorite croaker too.

1137
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:40,606
Gosh, that's my favorite.

1138
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:44,485
Why don't we grill some for dinner today?

1139
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,820
Sounds delicious!

1140
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:52,242
Sir, if you don't mind,
could you take a photo of us?

1141
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:54,244
I'm not good at things like this though.

1142
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:58,040
It's quite easy.
Look into this lens and press the button.

1143
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,210
-Let me give it a try.
-Thank you.

1144
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:02,586
Go stand there.

1145
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:09,468
Hye-jin, smile for the camera.

1146
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,888
But Mom, you were sick just a while ago.

1147
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:15,891
I'm fine. I'm not sick at all anymore.

1148
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,483
All right. One…

1149
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,902
Two…

1150
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:29,988
Three!

1151
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:33,784
Here.

1152
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:35,077
Thank you, sir.

1153
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,454
Come on. Let's go.

1154
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:38,539
Thank you.

1155
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,346
Hye-jin.

1156
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,723
One, two, three.

1157
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:03,814
Why don't we go to the photo studio
and take a photo too?

1158
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,024
Yes, I'd love that!

1159
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,497
WALDEN

1160
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:38,056
MODERN PHOTO STUDIO

1161
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:21,558
It's perfect.

1162
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,727
Into the battlefield!

1163
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,605
I heard you're going to Seoul today.
Let's go together.

1164
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,857
What? When did this get taken?

1165
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,776
He's not a boyfriend.

1166
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:33,278
I'm not interested,
but he keeps chasing me.

1167
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,948
Do you want me to wait with you?

1168
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,742
-You must have been in a lot of pain.
-Is it bad?

1169
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:39,868
Can you please leave?

1170
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,871
You know I grew up this big
because you fed me.

1171
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,331
So, with this…

1172
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,416
Please come back to the clinic.

1173
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,336
But you have to keep it a secret.

1174
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:55,968
