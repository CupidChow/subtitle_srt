1
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,928
Chief Hong, is your name Hong Du-sik?

2
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,221
What? Yes, it is.

3
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,974
Did you perhaps work
at YK Asset Management?

4
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,356
Do you know Kim Gi-hun?

5
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,110
You know my dad, don't you?

6
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,655
Hong Du-sik, you bastard!

7
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,451
Chief Hong?

8
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,786
-What?
-What the hell?

9
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,704
You… Hey!

10
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,917
My dad used to be healthy
and hike every day!

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,919
But thanks to you, he's paralyzed!

12
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,588
He and I had promised
to climb Mt. Jiri together!

13
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,590
-Do-ha! Stop it!
-You!

14
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,258
-That's enough!
-You bastard!

15
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,052
-Hey, stop it.
-Let me go!

16
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,638
-What's going on?
-I'm going to kill him!

17
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,182
-Let me go!
-No. This isn't right!

18
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,101
He's nothing short of a murderer!

19
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,522
He destroyed my dad's legs
and my entire family!

20
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,663
-Let me go!
-Do-ha!

21
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,873
Hey! Running away again?

22
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,750
So this is where you've been hiding,

23
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,711
pretending to be
innocent and kind-hearted.

24
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,590
My dad's been in a vegetative state
for the past six months!

25
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,467
How do you live with yourself?

26
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,387
-Let me go.
-Do-ha.

27
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,223
-Come here!
-That's enough.

28
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,850
-Let's go inside.
-Let go.

29
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,685
Stop it. Do-ha.

30
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,436
-Come here!
-Stop it.

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,688
I said, come here!

32
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,323
Chief Hong.

33
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,412
Don't follow me.

34
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,789
No, I will.

35
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,500
I'm worried about you.

36
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,172
I'm sure there is a misunderstanding--

37
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,340
There isn't.

38
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,051
What?

39
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,220
It's the truth.

40
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,848
Everything you heard is true.

41
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,350
What?

42
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,146
I'm the one who did that
to Do-ha's father.

43
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,192
-I don't believe you.
-That's not all.

44
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,863
I also destroyed
that family in the photo you saw.

45
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,865
I…

46
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,367
killed him.

47
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,413
Hye-jin, are you okay?

48
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,254
No, I'm not.

49
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,925
I can't believe this is happening.

50
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,728
Mi-seon.

51
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,858
I don't know what's going on anymore.

52
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,696
I really don't know.

53
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,824
Mi-seon…

54
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,389
EPISODE 15

55
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,683
CALL CHUNG-HO HARDWARE IF YOU NEED HELP

56
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,269
Excuse me. Is anyone here?

57
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,855
This power strip can take up to 4,000W.

58
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,608
You can plug in many devices,
and it'll still stay on.

59
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,860
Du-sik told me so. One second.

60
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,904
Hello?

61
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,824
Bora Supermarket?
Okay. I'll be right there.

62
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,869
-That'll be 10,000 won. Leave it here.
-Sure.

63
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,954
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

64
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,497
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

65
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,499
-Goodness.
-Ma'am, can we have

66
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,084
-some pickled radish?
-Sure.

67
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,460
This is Gongjin Korean…

68
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,797
I'm sorry, but we're behind
on the deliveries right now.

69
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,174
I'm so sorry. Goodbye.

70
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,760
Why isn't that bastard Nam-gyu picking up?

71
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,428
-Damn it!
-I'd like to pay.

72
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,180
-Sure. How was it?
-I loved it.

73
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,766
Thank you so much.

74
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,769
Iced cafe mocha, iced vanilla latte,
espresso macchiato…

75
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,104
And what was the last one?

76
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,273
-Einspänner.
-Right. Must you have that?

77
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,732
-Of course.
-I see.

78
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,236
-You can't order the same drinks, right?
-No.

79
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,488
-We have different tastes.
-I was just kidding.

80
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,199
-Sir.
-We're actually closed…

81
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,285
-Forget it. Come in.
-Where are our drinks?

82
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,663
-What did you order? Right.
-Strawberry parfait and chocolate shake.

83
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:40,334
Gosh. Can you guys please
all have iced Americano instead today?

84
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,462
I'll give you a 500-won discount.

85
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,798
Why do you look so haggard?

86
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,427
I'm getting lots of customers today,
but I have no one to help me.

87
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,556
Don't tell me you're all exhausted
because Chief Hong isn't here to help.

88
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,099
We are,

89
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,102
but there's an even bigger concern.

90
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,188
We're worried about him.

91
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,356
I hope he's doing okay.

92
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,527
I haven't seen him since that day.
I can't reach him either.

93
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:11,199
Remember what I told you before?
That he might've killed someone--

94
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,201
-Hey.
-Shut up!

95
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,870
-You little--
-How dare you say such a thing!

96
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,455
Watch what you say!

97
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:21,125
I'm not saying I believe that rumor.
I'm just curious. That's all.

98
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,294
I'm worried too.
After all, he's my friend.

99
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,671
What kind of a friend says such a thing?

100
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,548
Don't you know Du-sik?

101
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,843
I have full trust in him.
He would never do such a thing.

102
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,930
-So do I.
-Exactly. I'm a great judge of character,

103
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,474
and he's never looked suspicious to me.

104
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:37,975
Don't be absurd.

105
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,478
Now that he's not around,
I miss him terribly.

106
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:45,024
Look at his face.
He has kind, sentimental eyes.

107
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,360
-And they're so clear.
-Exactly.

108
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,819
-You little bastard.
-What?

109
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,781
Someone's at the hardware store.
I should go.

110
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,990
Bye.

111
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,328
Hello? Yes, of course.

112
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,871
-I should go too.
-Bye.

113
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,123
-Yes, I'm nearby.
-I wish I only sold one drink.

114
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,542
Everyone's panicking.

115
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,336
Everything's chaotic
since Chief Hong isn't around.

116
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,005
I hope he's at least eating well.

117
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,673
Everything you heard is true.

118
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,343
I'm the one who did that
to Do-ha's father.

119
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,309
Dr. Yoon, Ms. Yu Cho-hui is here.

120
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,103
Right. We're going
to extract her wisdom tooth today?

121
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,913
Ji-won. What are you doing here?

122
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,248
Hey, Director Ji.

123
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,667
Hello. I've heard a lot about you.

124
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,127
I see.

125
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,548
You have no time
to be chit-chatting like this.

126
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,758
Why? What's the matter?

127
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,845
The rough cut all vanished.
It's chaotic in there.

128
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,765
What? Why didn't you tell me sooner?

129
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,934
Take care.

130
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,353
Sure.

131
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,738
Which part? What's been deleted?

132
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,948
How much of this did you edit?

133
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,742
Just that much.

134
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:01,994
What?

135
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,538
The file's safe and sound.

136
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,499
It's too big to vanish anywhere.

137
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,169
Do you have a death wish?

138
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,879
That wasn't funny!

139
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,589
Hey.

140
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,843
I'd appreciate it if you didn't talk
about work with other guys.

141
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,806
-What?
-Just don't do it.

142
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,767
Try not to if you can.

143
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,104
Then can I talk casually with them?
About something else?

144
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,615
Seong-hyeon, may I have a word with you?

145
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,618
Sure. Let's go outside.

146
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,956
You should go.

147
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,928
I'm sorry about that day.

148
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,099
I'm sorry I ruined the after-party.

149
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:10,271
Don't worry about it. I'm sure you had
your reasons for doing that.

150
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,441
I suddenly saw red. It was wrong of me.

151
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,192
May I ask…

152
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,988
about what happened?

153
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,032
My dad worked

154
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,287
as a security guard at YK Asset Management
until a few years ago.

155
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,746
Yes, hello. It's hot outside…

156
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,665
And Du-sik was a fund manager.

157
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,916
Gosh.

158
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,670
And that bastard convinced him
to invest in a fund he managed.

159
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:38,340
Call this number,
and they'll explain all about it.

160
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,218
Okay. Thank you.

161
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,678
Goodbye.

162
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,598
Being the naive man he was,

163
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,101
he retrieved his security deposit
and even took out a loan.

164
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,772
Then the Benjamin Holdings incident
occurred a few years back.

165
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,107
Mr. Hong.

166
00:12:55,191 --> 00:13:00,029
Stock prices plummeted worldwide,
and so did his fund.

167
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,033
-He didn't take it very well.
-Dad! What's wrong?

168
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,410
He attempted suicide.

169
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,873
It happened while I was job hunting.

170
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,001
He regained consciousness
soon after I started working here.

171
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,837
Why didn't you tell me about this?

172
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,340
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,802
Things must've been tough,
but I worked you like a dog.

174
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,514
Not at all. I loved it.

175
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,267
I mean, no one likes all-nighters.

176
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,521
But this thought kept me going.

177
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,941
"This company gave me a miracle.

178
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,609
I'm all that Dad has left."

179
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,239
It must've been rough.

180
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,410
Who would've thought
I'd meet Du-sik there?

181
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,579
We're ill-fated.

182
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,625
My dad wasn't the only one
that bastard had ruined.

183
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,337
I heard Du-sik's boss also died then.

184
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,630
In a car accident.

185
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,393
Hye-jin.

186
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,938
I was hesitant to tell you this

187
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,524
since I didn't want
to make you feel worse.

188
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,610
But I found something.

189
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,045
2016's BEST FUND MANAGER PARK JEONG-U
AND TALENTED FUND MANAGER HONG DU-SIK

190
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,922
I also destroyed that family

191
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,799
in the photo you saw.

192
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,843
I…

193
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,345
killed him.

194
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,506
Seon-a.

195
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,141
Seong-hyeon… My husband…

196
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,102
No…

197
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,600
I-jun, are you home?

198
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,492
Don't kill me!

199
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,786
Gosh.

200
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,329
You startled me.

201
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,791
Don't you think
I'd be more startled than you?

202
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,377
Right. You should've said hi first.

203
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,173
I was going to be sweet
and surprise you with a hug from behind.

204
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,638
Do it.

205
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,848
What?

206
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,767
Do it. The hug.

207
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,980
Do you expect me to do that
after scaring me like this?

208
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,232
Because I will.

209
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,985
Unbelievable.

210
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,989
What were you making?

211
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,741
A snack for I-jun.

212
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,660
I'm making a kimchi pancake with squid.

213
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,495
Do you want some?

214
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,834
Not squid! I prefer meat.

215
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,711
I love meat. I don't like squid.

216
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:30,174
Meat, yes! Oh, no! Not squid!

217
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,258
Mom.

218
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,511
Dad?

219
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,309
You're home.

220
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,783
I-jun.

221
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,828
Let me explain what you saw earlier.

222
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,541
Mom and Dad have decided
to get back together.

223
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,671
Why would you shock him
by cutting to the chase like that?

224
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,215
I-jun.

225
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,842
Let me explain instead.

226
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,261
A long time ago,

227
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,599
there was a misunderstanding
between me and your mom.

228
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:24,144
That's why we were living apart
for some time.

229
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,729
But recently,

230
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:30,776
we reconciled as you can see.

231
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,320
Well… You see…

232
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,490
So what I mean is…

233
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,534
Are you getting remarried?

234
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,580
Sure.

235
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,581
Yes.

236
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,919
How are you so smart?

237
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,504
Because he takes after me.

238
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,176
I understand what you mean
and I respect that.

239
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,473
Can I go play at Bo-ra's?

240
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,851
What about your kimchi pancake?

241
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,519
I'm good. I'm full.

242
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,855
I'll get going then.

243
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,690
Have fun. Watch out for the cars.

244
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,649
I will.

245
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,074
Our son is such a saint.

246
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,952
He also got that from me.
Peace of mind.

247
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,374
Kimchi pancake.

248
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,919
I'm going to have it all.

249
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,508
Gosh.

250
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,391
It's gotten cold.

251
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,459
Hello?

252
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,628
Hye-jin, have you thought about it?

253
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,795
Well…

254
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,174
I haven't made up my mind yet.

255
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,093
What's the matter?
I thought you'd say yes right away.

256
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:24,181
Most people would die
for this opportunity.

257
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,474
I'm sorry.

258
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,351
I can't give you too much time.

259
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,394
I'll give you a few more days.

260
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,231
Okay. I'll call you.

261
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,523
Bye.

262
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,950
Dr. Yoon, are you in there?

263
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,534
Ms. Kim.

264
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,706
What brings you here?

265
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,208
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

266
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:58,090
I steamed some corn for you.

267
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,218
Gosh, they look scrumptious.

268
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,511
Thank you.

269
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,264
Please. This is nothing.

270
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,016
How are your teeth?
Are they still bothering you?

271
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,726
Not at all.

272
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,562
After getting the implants,

273
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,857
I've been eating lots of squids.

274
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:20,070
All the squid in the area
must be in my stomach.

275
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,613
I told you to be careful.

276
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,368
Goodness, you nag
just as much as Du-sik does.

277
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,790
I stopped by his house

278
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,418
before coming here.

279
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,464
I've been bringing him food every day,

280
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,467
but he hasn't touched any of it.

281
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,555
He must be a complete mess.

282
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:52,561
I've left some corn for him,
but I doubt he'll have any.

283
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,362
-Let's go back.
-Where?

284
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:03,989
To Gongjin.

285
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,743
We need to take more inserts.
It's too boring.

286
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,412
It looks fine to me.
You're such a perfectionist.

287
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,707
It'll only take a day or two.

288
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,460
I'll go with her. You can stay in Seoul.

289
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,921
That's okay. I'll go instead of her.

290
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,716
I take my job seriously, you know?

291
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,135
Okay, then. Let's go.

292
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,972
It's getting late,
and I-jun is nowhere to be seen.

293
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,684
Let me call Bo-ra.

294
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,690
Hey, Bo-ra.

295
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,443
This is I-jun's dad.

296
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,279
I-jun's at your house, right?

297
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,783
No, he's not. We hung out
in the afternoon and said goodbye.

298
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,909
What?

299
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,204
I-jun didn't go to your house?

300
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,582
Then where did he go?

301
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,086
I-jun!

302
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,589
-I-jun!
-Do you hear me?

303
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,716
-I-jun!
-I-jun!

304
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,969
-I-jun!
-I-jun!

305
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,888
I-jun!

306
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,223
Mr. Chang!

307
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,434
-Hey!
-Where is I-jun?

308
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:18,146
Yun-gyeong, you should be home resting.
Why are you out here?

309
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,606
I've rested more than enough.

310
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,484
How could I not come here
when I-jun is missing?

311
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,694
I-jun…

312
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:29,282
Hey, what should we do?
What if something happened to him?

313
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,492
Are you crying?

314
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,370
I don't want to hear it.
We'll find him, so stop crying.

315
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,871
We'll go that way.

316
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,373
-Okay.
-Can you go that way?

317
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,792
-Got it.
-Okay. Let's go.

318
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,418
-I-jun!
-I-jun!

319
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,545
I-jun!

320
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,588
-I-jun!
-I-jun!

321
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,563
I-jun!

322
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,697
I-jun!

323
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,743
What are you doing here?
I've been looking for you!

324
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,704
Bo-ra…

325
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,707
Why are you crying? Did someone hit you?

326
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,084
No.

327
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,211
Then did your mom scold you
like my mom did?

328
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,005
No.

329
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,965
You were scolded?

330
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,550
Not today.

331
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:33,054
She used to say that a grandpa ghost
would kidnap me if I misbehaved.

332
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,140
But it's all a lie.

333
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,435
There's no such thing
as a grandpa ghost or even Santa.

334
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,478
I don't get why grown-ups lie so much.

335
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,023
But guess what?

336
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,736
Ghosts and zombies could exist.

337
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,656
So let's hurry home. Okay? Hurry up.

338
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,951
No. I don't want to go home.

339
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,287
Why? Why not?

340
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,955
Because…

341
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,459
-Because…
-I-jun!

342
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,753
-I-jun!
-I-jun!

343
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,421
-I-jun! Where is he?
-I-jun!

344
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,756
I-jun!

345
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,674
-Bo-ra!
-I-jun! What's going on?

346
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,384
I-jun.

347
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,595
Oh, dear.

348
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,097
What are you doing here, my son?

349
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,850
I looked everywhere for you.

350
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,687
You little brat! You scared me to death!

351
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,689
You almost gave me a heart attack!

352
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,653
What are you doing here?

353
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,322
Are you upset with me?

354
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,449
No.

355
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,995
Then is this because of
what we talked about today?

356
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:46,086
I-jun, is it
because you feel uncomfortable about us

357
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,546
living together again?

358
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,757
No.

359
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,885
I like it.

360
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:58,974
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying.

361
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,108
But I didn't want you

362
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,988
to see me cry
because you'd be heartbroken.

363
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,118
You brat.

364
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,288
Is that why you were crying alone here?

365
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,539
Yes.

366
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,878
I-jun, you're only nine years old.

367
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,049
You should think about yourself first

368
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,802
instead of worrying about our feelings.

369
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,345
She's right.

370
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:43,435
You're too young to think like an adult.

371
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,603
Don't grow up too fast.

372
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,897
Just act your age. You can do that.

373
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:57,032
To tell you the truth,

374
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,910
even if it wasn't my birthday

375
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,332
or I didn't win a school award,

376
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:11,004
I wanted to eat together as a family.

377
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:17,052
I've always wanted us to live
under the same roof.

378
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:22,932
I'm sorry.

379
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,603
I had no idea.

380
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:32,692
I'm sorry
I didn't understand how you felt, I-jun.

381
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,698
I'm sorry.

382
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,575
I-jun.

383
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,287
Let's go home.

384
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,331
And

385
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,793
let's have dinner together.

386
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,344
-Bo-ra.
-What?

387
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,012
Why are you crying?

388
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,555
-Why? Gosh.
-What's wrong?

389
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,224
-Mom. Dad.
-Yes?

390
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:08,144
I'm going to eat with I-jun
every single day!

391
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,689
I'm going to live with him!

392
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,776
I'm going to make sure
he doesn't feel lonely anymore!

393
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:19,572
But Bo-ra, we should ask him
how he feels about that first and--

394
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,283
I-jun…

395
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,788
I'm sorry I didn't know how you felt.

396
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,379
I'm sorry.

397
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,427
Let's go eat, I-jun.

398
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,591
Did you know Ms. Kim left
some corn for you?

399
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,970
I had some, and it was tasty.

400
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,599
Gangwon Province has the best corn.

401
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,730
Haven't you eaten?

402
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,649
Why do you look so gaunt?

403
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,408
I can still give you some time.

404
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,077
I can wait.

405
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:52,999
So for today,
I'll cook you something and leave.

406
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,086
No. At least let me see you
have your first bite.

407
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,633
I have something to tell you.

408
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,260
Remember

409
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,972
I told you I had something to tell you?

410
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,941
I had a friend.

411
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,361
His name was Park Jeong-u.

412
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,658
We became college roommates

413
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,743
when I was a freshman

414
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,788
and he was a returning student.

415
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,962
We automatically became close
since we lived together.

416
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,799
We'd drink together every day.

417
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,802
Get over our hangover and drink again.

418
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,098
We'd hold

419
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,101
my grandpa's memorial service together.

420
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,148
Thanks to him, I realized,

421
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,442
"Gosh.

422
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,988
So this must be how it feels…

423
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,787
to have an older brother."

424
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,043
He convinced me to work at that company.

425
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,005
He was a fund manager there.

426
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,676
At first, I was hesitant
about taking the job.

427
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,679
It had nothing to do with my major

428
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,432
and was too money-oriented.

429
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,726
I didn't like that.

430
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,397
But then he said,

431
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,066
"Fund managers

432
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,111
give ordinary people

433
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:50,158
hope that even they can become rich."

434
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,579
I think…

435
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,000
that made me change my mind.

436
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,592
At first, it was quite fun.

437
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,512
It suited me, and I made a lot of money.

438
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,184
-I got to meet many new people.
-Judging by the information,

439
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,436
I believe it's quite promising.

440
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,941
That's where I met Do-ha's father.

441
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,360
Hello.

442
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,362
I greeted him every day.

443
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,783
-Have a great day.
-I treated him like a Gongjin neighbor.

444
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,868
And we became close soon.

445
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,828
Then one day,

446
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,248
he told me he wanted
to subscribe to my fund.

447
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,750
Hello, sir.

448
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,627
The trust funds I was managing

449
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,755
had high returns.

450
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:50,301
But due to the high risk,
I dissuaded him at first.

451
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,513
-However,
-Call this number…

452
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,598
he was very adamant.

453
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,017
Okay. Thank you.

454
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,938
But sir, you should never be reckless.

455
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,147
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay?

456
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,858
-Okay.
-All right. See you.

457
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,695
Thank you, Mr. Hong. Thank you.

458
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,740
Then…

459
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,118
something happened.

460
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,252
This is YK Asset Management.

461
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,254
-Yes?
-Hello. No, let me explain.

462
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,599
Korea is suffering from the aftermath

463
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,144
of Benjamin Holdings' bankruptcy.

464
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,731
The stock markets have plummeted,
and the exchange rates are soaring.

465
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,858
When the stock markets opened,

466
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,318
-Mr. Hong.
-KOSPI went down by 8.4 percent,

467
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,405
and KOSDAQ went down by almost 12 percent,

468
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,533
-the lowest rate in the past 12 years.
-Sir.

469
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,787
What?

470
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:04,208
I didn't recommend ELF to you,
so why did you subscribe to that?

471
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:08,755
Since I didn't know much about it,
I trusted the employee.

472
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,215
I should've checked right away.

473
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,927
What should I do?
I heard that it's minus 70 percent.

474
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,930
Due to the knock-in,
you're likely to lose your principal.

475
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,185
But once the dust settles,

476
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,103
it'll all be recovered in time.

477
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,272
So don't be hasty and resale it.

478
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,025
But you see,

479
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,613
-I used my security deposit for my house.
-What?

480
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:37,909
And I even took out a loan.
My family doesn't know about it.

481
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,537
I told you not to be reckless.
Why did you do that?

482
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,456
I don't know.

483
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:47,710
I must've been crazy or greedy for money.

484
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,964
I just wanted my wife to live
in a house with warm running water.

485
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,593
I wanted to pay for my son's student loans

486
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,847
and buy him a nice suit
for his job interview.

487
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,974
Sir, just trust me…

488
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,062
Sir, just trust me and wait.

489
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,689
Let me take care of this
and get back to you, okay?

490
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,067
I'll give you a call, sir. Hey.

491
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,027
Okay.

492
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,279
What an idiot!

493
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,459
GI-HUN

494
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,968
GI-HUN

495
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:45,351
GI-HUN

496
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,654
Du-sik, drink this.

497
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,780
Thanks.

498
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,033
We've been at it for days.

499
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,203
Jeong-u, when do you think
things will start looking up?

500
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,372
More companies might go bankrupt.

501
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:10,042
We don't know what sort of factors
could surface again.

502
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,377
So let's wait it out.

503
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,964
Mr. Park. Mr. Hong. Have you heard?

504
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,007
About what?

505
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,926
Our company's security guard
attempted suicide.

506
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,469
What?

507
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,693
Damn it.

508
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,538
Get out.

509
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,125
-Get out.
-I need to go.

510
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,044
I… I need to go.

511
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,754
I said, get out!

512
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,091
I'll drive.

513
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,177
You shouldn't drive right now. Get out.

514
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,056
Come out.

515
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,981
It's okay.

516
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,482
It'll be okay.

517
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,734
I'm sure he'll be okay.

518
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,737
Had I explained better to him…

519
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,155
No.

520
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,034
I should've picked up his calls.

521
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,954
It's my fault.

522
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,998
I'm to blame.

523
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,084
No, it's not.

524
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,211
And even if that's the case,

525
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,714
I'll carry the blame with you. So Du-sik,

526
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,842
let's just pray that he's okay.

527
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,655
Jeong-u.

528
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,243
Jeong-u…

529
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,460
Jeong-u…

530
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,258
Jeong-u…

531
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,475
Jeong-u!

532
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,465
Jeong-u!

533
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,641
Jeong-u!

534
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,034
You can cry if you want.

535
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,288
It must've been so hard for you.

536
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,709
You must've hidden the pain deep down.

537
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,255
You've been holding onto such a burden.

538
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:11,510
You can be sad when you're with me.

539
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,519
You can show me your pain.

540
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,022
You can cry.

541
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,774
You can.

542
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:03,062
Do you remember that Gongjin
wasn't our original destination?

543
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,441
I do. Was it Sejin Harbor?

544
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,360
We were waiting for you there,

545
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,655
but you took the wrong way
and ended up in Gongjin.

546
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,532
That's when I'd just gotten this car.

547
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,826
I was just trying this baby
on the expressway, you know.

548
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,412
You're ridiculous. Jeez.

549
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,333
Had I not gone there,

550
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,670
you wouldn't have had to meet Du-sik.

551
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:36,720
But I can't help but think
that we were meant to end up in Gongjin.

552
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,014
I didn't know,

553
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,725
but I was also involved in it.

554
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,730
Du-sik's boss who died in the car accident

555
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,649
was my brother-in-law.

556
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,693
What?

557
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,322
So how can I possibly not believe in fate?

558
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,911
So…

559
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,748
I may not be able
to empathize with you completely

560
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,543
since I'm not directly related to this.

561
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:13,549
But I don't think
it's been easy for Chief Hong either.

562
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,012
When the car accident occurred,

563
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,890
he was on his way to see your father.

564
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:30,065
What a stroke of bad luck for everyone.

565
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,499
Hwa-jeong.

566
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,961
Cho-hui. What brings you here?

567
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,213
Are you here to see me?

568
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,091
That too. I'm also here
to buy some porridge.

569
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,010
Why? Are you sick?

570
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,888
No. I had my wisdom tooth
pulled out a few days ago.

571
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,891
Gosh, it must've been painful.
Are you okay?

572
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,269
I was scared to do it,
but now that it's gone, I feel relieved.

573
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,648
It's best you pull it out.
If not, the pain will just worsen.

574
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,080
Here you go.

575
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,791
Thank you.

576
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,876
I'll pay on my way out.

577
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,630
It's on me, in return
for the eye cream you gave me.

578
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,966
-Though it must've been pricier.
-Have you been using it?

579
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,386
You bet. I use it twice a day.

580
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,138
-It's nice and moisturizing.
-I'm glad.

581
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,140
I'll look young thanks to you.

582
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,518
You're still just as young and pretty.

583
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,145
You look exactly
like you did 15 years ago.

584
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,897
That can't be.

585
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,399
I'm serious.

586
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,236
You look the same as when I first met you.

587
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,406
Hwa-jeong.

588
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,700
Nothing was going on
between Yeong-guk and me.

589
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,830
Not then, not now.

590
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,000
He's not the person I had a crush on.

591
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,799
You…

592
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,262
were the one.

593
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,275
Did you know that?

594
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,823
How did you know?

595
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:48,078
I just did.
I don't know how, but I could feel it.

596
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:52,833
It's never easy to hide
your feelings for someone.

597
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,336
You were so gorgeous,

598
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,591
kind-hearted, friendly, and polite.

599
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:04,386
Being an elementary school teacher
was your calling since you loved kids.

600
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,973
But despite all of that,
you looked so lonely.

601
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,933
I wanted to take care of you.

602
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:14,980
Although I couldn't reciprocate
your feelings the same way,

603
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,400
I liked you back then as well.

604
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,570
And I still do.

605
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:29,703
Thank you.
For pretending not to know all this time.

606
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,998
And for accepting me for who I am.

607
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,668
But I've changed.

608
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,631
You see, I've given you up
a long time ago.

609
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,592
I don't have
those feelings for you anymore.

610
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:48,972
All that I want is for you and Yeong-guk
to be happy together.

611
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,935
I can't say I've found that happiness yet.

612
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:58,273
But I do think
I'm somewhere in the ballpark.

613
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,985
Good. That's all I want for you.

614
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,385
You should go. I got this.

615
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,595
What?

616
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,723
You have a hangnail that's bothering you.

617
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,768
It's painful and irritating.

618
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:43,735
You need to take care of it.
If not, it'll hurt even more.

619
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,934
I wondered millions of times

620
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,271
what kind of life you were living.

621
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,815
In my head,

622
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,234
you were still shameless

623
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,946
continuing to cause harm to others.

624
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,616
I'm sorry.

625
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:32,826
I mean it.

626
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,996
I always found it odd.

627
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,999
After what happened,

628
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,669
I expected my family to become dirt poor.

629
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,589
But we moved

630
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,633
to an apartment.

631
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,385
One day, my mom told me

632
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,430
that I should only focus on getting a job

633
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,766
since my student loan
was already taken care of.

634
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,603
And not to worry
about Dad's hospital bills.

635
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,899
She said it was thanks
to the insurance payout,

636
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,693
but it didn't make any sense.

637
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,321
I knew how poor we were to begin with.

638
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,990
Was it you?

639
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,922
What is this?

640
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:30,509
I sold everything I had.

641
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,721
I'm sorry.

642
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,393
But this is the only way
I can try to make up

643
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,771
for what happened to him.

644
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,314
Is this how

645
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,485
smart and wealthy people
take responsibility?

646
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,910
You can think however you like.

647
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,205
But please accept it.

648
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,835
I beg you.

649
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,175
I believe he'll wake up.

650
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,011
I have no other intentions.

651
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,681
I just want to help you hold out

652
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,642
until he regains consciousness.

653
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,193
You disgust me.

654
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,079
It's terrifying how much power money has.

655
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,626
I ought to rip it to shreds right now.

656
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,962
But I'll take this.

657
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,382
I'm going to pay off our debts…

658
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,970
and move him to a better hospital.

659
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,396
So don't you dare go back on your word!

660
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,025
I won't.

661
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,743
So it was you.

662
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,789
Did you think
money would solve everything?

663
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,666
Did you think we'd happily take it

664
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,212
since we were dirt poor?

665
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,172
No. That's not why.

666
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,174
Then what was it?

667
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,635
Did you pity us?

668
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:39,221
The last thing
your father and I talked about

669
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,515
was his family.

670
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,351
I couldn't forget

671
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,937
how he wanted to buy you a nice suit

672
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,231
for your job interview.

673
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,693
So I wanted to help him with it at least.

674
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,659
So it was all because of me.

675
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,161
My dad was never greedy,

676
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,747
so I couldn't understand
why he had done such a thing.

677
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,417
I used to have a hard time landing a job
and would come home drunk.

678
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,420
He blamed my old suit.

679
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,589
He said I looked poor.

680
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,759
He said

681
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:22,848
I couldn't get a job because I had
neither money nor connections.

682
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:28,019
That's not true.
He was always proud of you.

683
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,565
He'd brag about how his son was smart

684
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,775
and graduated
from a prestigious university.

685
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,238
And I just remembered that now.

686
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,536
I'm to blame.

687
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,915
I failed to grab his hand
when he reached out to me.

688
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:51,793
No.

689
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,881
It's not your fault. I know it's not.

690
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,844
I just needed someone to blame.

691
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,975
My dad didn't even go to high school.

692
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:12,731
If you guys were close, why didn't you pay
a bit more attention to him?

693
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:16,568
Why couldn't you have told him
once more that everything would be okay?

694
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,661
I'm sorry.

695
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,874
I'm really sorry.

696
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,502
I am. I'm sorry.

697
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,033
Jeong-u will be happy
to see you dressed up.

698
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,578
This is the suit he bought me
for my job interview.

699
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,081
What a precious suit.

700
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,916
He'll love it.

701
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,711
Yongin, was it?

702
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,630
Yes.

703
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,535
Ha-rang, do you remember that uncle?

704
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,496
What? He's not my uncle.

705
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,416
He's not Uncle Seong-hyeon.

706
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,043
He is your uncle.

707
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,213
He's Uncle Du-sik.

708
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,051
When you were a baby,

709
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,680
he'd always hold you and dote on you.

710
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:15,729
Run over to him. Be brave

711
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,148
and say hello to him.

712
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,860
Hello, Uncle.

713
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,704
Hi, Ha-rang.

714
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,081
It's been a long time.

715
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,377
Do you still like dinosaurs?

716
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:44,215
I do. I like Eustreptospondylus,

717
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:49,012
Pachycephalosaurus, and Stegosaurus.

718
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,104
Why are you crying?

719
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,856
I'm just proud

720
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,818
that you know
such difficult dinosaur names.

721
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,639
Auntie, don't I have so many?

722
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:36,392
Gosh. What is this?
Did you find this, Ha-rang?

723
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,270
-I did. I found it near the water.
-Near the water?

724
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,815
Let's pile them up. Let's see.

725
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,858
-Should we make a cake with these?
-Okay.

726
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:47,695
Did you find this one too? It's so pretty.

727
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,906
Doesn't he take after Jeong-u a lot?

728
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,158
-Yes.
-He even acts like him.

729
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,496
He also sleeps
with his arms above his head.

730
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,291
He hates carrots.

731
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,919
He also has many friends.

732
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,547
And he's surprisingly stubborn.

733
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,758
He really is the same as Jeong-u.

734
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,718
I'm telling you.

735
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,432
I heard from Seong-hyeon
that you were here.

736
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,767
"Seong-hyeon"?

737
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,228
Do you mean Director Ji?

738
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:25,108
Yes. We're cousins.
He said you guys are pretty close.

739
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,028
What a small world, right?

740
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:34,159
I had no idea you came here
after disappearing like that.

741
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,289
Du-sik.

742
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,002
I won't apologize

743
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,672
for what I did back then.

744
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:53,386
Back then, I'd lost the will to live.

745
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:58,475
I didn't even want to breathe
in a world without Jeong-u.

746
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:02,270
But you know what?

747
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,607
I could.

748
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:11,571
I was able to breathe, eat, and drink.

749
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:15,617
At times, I'd even smile
at Ha-rang's silly face.

750
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,870
And after some time,

751
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,332
I regained the will to live.

752
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,631
Du-sik.

753
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,344
I don't

754
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,848
resent you anymore.

755
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:43,561
So find it in your heart

756
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,106
to forgive yourself as well.

757
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:04,374
Mom! Auntie and I made a cake together!

758
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,295
Mom, come here! Hurry up!

759
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:13,174
Really? You must be so proud!

760
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:22,725
We just built it, but where did it go?

761
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,477
-Your mom's here.
-Who made this?

762
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,979
Did Auntie make it for you?

763
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,906
Are you crying?

764
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:44,080
Gosh, you've become a crybaby.

765
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,544
Jeong-u.

766
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,714
See? You become more emotional as you age.

767
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,259
I remember how you teased me
about bawling so much

768
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,719
when Ha-rang was born.

769
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,888
He sure has grown a lot.

770
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:13,860
Jeong-u.

771
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,531
I've missed you so much.

772
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,701
Me too.

773
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,037
I'm sorry.

774
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,750
Because of me--

775
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:29,667
Du-sik.

776
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,879
Remember what I said back then?

777
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,298
It's not your fault.

778
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:40,720
Still.

779
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,556
I'm sorry.

780
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,682
It's okay.

781
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,060
It's all right.

782
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,271
You survived.

783
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,275
So Du-sik,

784
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,987
carry on with your life.

785
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,324
Not for me, but for yourself.

786
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:06,245
See and do everything you want to
until you're fed up.

787
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,668
Once you've done everything
you've ever wanted to do,

788
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,921
then we can meet again.

789
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,258
Jeong-u.

790
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,179
And when we meet again,

791
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:27,725
let's go fishing.

792
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:31,938
Okay, brother?

793
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:31,998
Goodness.

794
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:51,601
Gam-ri, are you having a pity party?
Why are you cleaning all alone?

795
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,853
You should sweep before wiping.

796
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:58,274
You're so noisy.
Why are you here? You should go home.

797
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:01,694
The swarm of people has left you behind,

798
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,821
so we came to keep you company.

799
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,866
Let's clean then have dinner together.

800
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:11,120
Better yet, should we have a sleepover?

801
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:14,582
What? Don't be such a nuisance.

802
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:17,001
Good idea. Suk-ja, sweep that side.

803
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:17,919
Okay.

804
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:24,383
Arirang, arirang, arariyo

805
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:30,139
-Hey.
-Passing over the Arirang Pass

806
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,737
Ha-rang seems to really like you.

807
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:50,117
He wants us to visit him next time.

808
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,413
We were supposed to visit your friend,

809
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,749
but we couldn't make it there.

810
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:57,917
It's okay.

811
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:01,212
I'm sure he'll understand.

812
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,050
It's good to see you smile.

813
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:09,971
Keep smiling.

814
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,889
Don't think twice about whether or not

815
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,183
you should smile or be happy.

816
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,353
Don't think too much.

817
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:19,522
Just smile.

818
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,777
Hye-jin.

819
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:26,904
Yes?

820
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,119
To tell the truth,
I was going to kill myself.

821
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,458
When I heard

822
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,795
that Jeong-u had passed away,

823
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,048
I rushed out of the hospital.

824
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:05,359
I kept walking and found myself
on one of the Han River bridges.

825
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,571
That's when I thought,

826
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,533
"I should just end my life.

827
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:18,998
Wouldn't this river eventually take me

828
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:20,708
to the sea?

829
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,252
Then

830
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,714
would I be able to see my parents again?"

831
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,433
Darn.

832
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:41,729
MS. GAM-RI

833
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:53,407
Du-sik, I'm in Seoul right now.
Can I see you?

834
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,203
I brought your favorite side dishes.

835
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,413
I've practically forgotten
what you look like.

836
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,832
I miss you a lot.

837
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,090
What great timing.

838
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,844
My life was so busy
that I had no time for her.

839
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:16,514
Actually, I had forgotten about her.

840
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:22,436
But that text message
filled with countless typos

841
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,189
saved me.

842
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,986
I had decided to kill myself that day.

843
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:34,073
But Ms. Gam-ri and Gongjin

844
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,450
saved me.

845
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,558
That's why I came back.

846
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,269
I didn't kill myself,

847
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,564
but I didn't know how to carry on either.

848
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:17,283
I locked myself in that dark house.

849
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,330
But people kept knocking on my door.

850
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,084
They didn't ask any questions.

851
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:31,213
They just brought food and checked on me.

852
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:33,716
It was as if

853
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,927
they were taking care of a stray cat.

854
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,723
They were indifferent yet warm to me.

855
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:46,854
Then one day,
they started asking me for help.

856
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:52,401
"The light bulb in my bathroom burned out.
My washing machine broke.

857
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:56,197
Can you fill in for me while I'm gone?"

858
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,409
I bet it was intentional.

859
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,541
So that's how you became Chief Hong.

860
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:15,758
You're right.

861
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,637
Gongjin saved you.

862
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,517
I finally get it.

863
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:28,979
I understand why you love Gongjin so much.

864
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,982
Why you feel so attached

865
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:37,154
to this small seaside town that seems

866
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,991
nothing out of the ordinary.

867
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,830
So that's the end of my story.

868
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,791
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

869
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,377
Thank you.

870
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,840
I was worried you'd never open up.

871
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:58,968
So thank you for mustering up the courage.

872
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:01,804
It's all thanks to you.
I would've never opened up otherwise.

873
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:08,018
Right. Didn't you say
you had something to tell me that day too?

874
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,855
Right. You see…

875
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,524
Don't tell me now if you're not ready.

876
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:16,569
This time, I'll wait for you.

877
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,654
Like you did for me.

878
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,074
Actually,

879
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:27,413
I was offered a clinical professor job.

880
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,501
In Seoul, I suppose.

881
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:55,065
Guys, are you already asleep?

882
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:59,778
My eyelids feel so heavy right now.

883
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,574
I get too sleepy
to even catch up on my soap operas lately.

884
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:05,743
That's because we're old

885
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:08,746
and get sleepy early in the evening.

886
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:09,955
That's true.

887
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:14,919
I can't believe I'm over 70.

888
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:19,673
I still feel like a young girl who used
to sneak around with her boyfriend.

889
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:24,762
Gosh, get your mind out of the gutter.
You better watch what you say.

890
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:28,098
What is it? Did you never sneak around
with your boyfriend?

891
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,099
What did you say?

892
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:33,020
There's no place
we didn't sneak into back in the day.

893
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:35,773
Gosh, enough with that nonsense.

894
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,067
Just go to sleep, will you?

895
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:39,860
Gosh.

896
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:49,411
By the way, do you guys feel this way too?

897
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,789
I feel sad

898
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:55,292
that my body is aging
while my heart is still young.

899
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,877
I feel that way all the time.

900
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:02,216
Both my tongue and mind became dull.

901
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,177
I became clumsy.

902
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,096
Time indeed flies.

903
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,975
Gam-ri, how about you?

904
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:14,353
Of course, I've felt that way.

905
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:20,401
But you see, I like that I'm old.

906
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,612
How could you possibly like being old?

907
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:28,575
Looking back, I've had many tasty dishes,

908
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:32,246
seen great scenery,

909
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,666
and met wonderful people.

910
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,962
What more could I ask for?

911
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:42,798
Are you happy?

912
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:45,467
Of course. I'm happy.

913
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:50,347
I appeared on a TV show

914
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:54,518
and even sang on stage.

915
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:58,605
And right now, I'm chatting with you guys.

916
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,191
My life is so fun.

917
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,655
That's not all.

918
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:09,825
Today,

919
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:14,371
the evening glow looked so beautiful.

920
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:19,877
The squid I had for dinner
was scrumptious too.

921
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:25,382
Look around yourself closely,

922
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:29,303
and you'll realize that you're surrounded
by many precious things.

923
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:35,559
Every day…

924
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,064
is full of so much excitement

925
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:45,319
as if I'm going on a picnic the next day.

926
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,031
Picnics sound lovely.

927
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:52,451
Gam-ri, what should we do tomorrow?

928
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:57,873
As the youngest among us,
you should come up with something.

929
01:12:57,956 --> 01:12:59,875
You always say that when you're lazy.

930
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:24,858
Gosh. Darn it.

931
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:28,862
Why do you move around so much
in your sleep?

932
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,197
Unbelievable.

933
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,076
Gam-ri, I can't sleep next to Suk-ja.

934
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,078
She pulls the blanket all night

935
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:38,163
and rests her limbs on my body.

936
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:41,834
It's so infuriating. Gosh.

937
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,627
Gam-ri, are you listening?

938
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:46,130
You're sleeping awfully well
for a light sleeper.

939
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:47,464
Gam-ri.

940
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:49,842
Gam-ri. Gam…

941
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,139
You said you wanted to go on a picnic.

942
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,103
Did you have to be so impatient?

943
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,582
Sleep well.

944
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,128
Go on that picnic first.

945
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,467
And…

946
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,513
wait for me.

947
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:57,636
What is that?

948
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,055
What's wrong with him?

949
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:02,724
He looks like a patient.

950
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:16,238
Hello, sir.

951
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:19,908
I'm calling from the Seogang Bridge.

952
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:24,913
A man wearing a hospital gown
is crouching next to the guardrail.

953
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,707
It looks dangerous.

954
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:29,167
Can you quickly check on him?

955
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,045
Thank you.

956
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:47,686
AMBULANCE

957
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:17,984
When you lose a loved one,
you should mourn plenty.

958
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:22,364
Or else, the grief travels
all through your body,

959
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:24,408
and it bursts later.

960
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:28,036
I don't want to leave him alone.

961
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,455
I want to be his family.

962
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,375
I'm you, and you're me.

963
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,168
Open wide.

964
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,962
I'll do this for you
every day from now on.

965
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,298
I'd love it if our shoes…

966
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:43,343
were always side by side
at the door together.

967
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,137
Chief Hong.

968
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,889
Will you marry me?

969
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:53,854
