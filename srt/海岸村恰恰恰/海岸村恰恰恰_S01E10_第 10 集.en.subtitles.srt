1
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,177
Hye-jin.

2
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,261
Yes?

3
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,973
When I go back down to Gongjin,
can you meet up with me?

4
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,099
Meet up?

5
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,727
Of course, I can.

6
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,229
I really hope you can.

7
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,148
I have something to tell you.

8
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,232
What?

9
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,159
They fixed the streetlamp.

10
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,916
Hye-jin, are you there?

11
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,167
Yes, I am.

12
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,754
Let me know when you're back.

13
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,298
I'll treat you to a meal.

14
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,425
Okay. I'll see you soon.

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,011
Okay. Drive safely.

16
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,763
-I will.
-Bye.

17
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,714
Who are you?

18
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,136
Who said you could enter my home?

19
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,391
We have a home security system.
The police will be here in no time.

20
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,351
I know there's no security system here.

21
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,312
I had it installed yesterday.

22
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,982
-What are you doing with your phone?
-What?

23
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,358
Are you calling the police?

24
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,370
There's no one to help you now.

25
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,000
What the hell?

26
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,960
Don't make a sound.

27
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,558
It's a great night
to catch a sick pervert.

28
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,481
Ms. Dentist. Are you all right?

29
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,233
-Did he hurt you?
-No.

30
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,819
-Are you really okay?
-I'm so terrified.

31
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,409
Yes, this is 14 Abnaru-gil, Gongjin-dong.

32
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,493
Hye-jin!

33
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,082
Chief Hong!

34
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,441
Chief Hong!

35
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,719
My gosh.

36
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,514
-What on earth happened?
-It was the damn pervert.

37
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,308
He deserves to rot in prison.

38
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,649
That was a close one.

39
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,485
-He should rot in jail.
-Watch your head.

40
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,654
-Can you believe it?
-What the hell?

41
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,586
EPISODE 10

42
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,966
There wasn't any nerve damage,
so stitches will be enough.

43
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,634
I'll get back to you soon.

44
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,261
Thank you, doctor.

45
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,766
What a relief.

46
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,685
Doesn't it hurt?

47
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,521
Of course it does.
Even paper cuts hurt like hell,

48
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,899
but the knife was this big.
At least 30cm, right?

49
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,776
Don't exaggerate.

50
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,530
It was a paring knife
with a blade length of around 15cm.

51
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,241
I thought you'd still be in shock,

52
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,661
but the doctor in you
calmed you down already.

53
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,207
That bruise. Did he hurt you?

54
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,959
Oh, it's nothing.

55
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,587
What are you talking about?
You're hurt. Let me see.

56
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,881
How bad is it? Does it hurt?

57
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,967
Why didn't you tell the doctor
when he was here?

58
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,470
Your injury is much worse.

59
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,520
Ms. Dentist.

60
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,485
Why are you crying?

61
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,614
Gosh, I was so scared.

62
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,576
Who jumps at a guy

63
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,787
with a knife in his hand?

64
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,705
I was just…

65
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,124
I was afraid he might hurt you.

66
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,464
Seriously.

67
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,261
Seong-hyeon?

68
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,387
Director Ji.

69
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,350
Hye-jin, are you all right?

70
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,435
How did you know I was here?

71
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,062
Oh, well…

72
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,523
I came back to pick something up

73
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,359
then saw police cars
and your neighbors near your place.

74
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,237
I rushed over here
as soon as I heard about you two.

75
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,404
-I see.
-Right.

76
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,491
Chief Hong, is the injury serious?

77
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,368
No, it's only a graze.

78
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,497
You seem more shocked than we are though.
Are you okay?

79
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,292
Me? No, I'm okay.

80
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,672
I was really worried.

81
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,383
I'm so relieved that you two are okay.

82
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,055
Well, I…

83
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,641
I came back…

84
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,270
because I forgot my tablet.

85
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,983
I need to head back up with my hard drive.

86
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,403
Now that I know you're okay,
I'll get going.

87
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,613
At this hour?

88
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,325
Yes. You must be really shocked,
so take good care of yourself.

89
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:36,497
Chief Hong, thank you
for saving Hye-jin. I mean it.

90
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,666
Don't mention it.

91
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,502
I'll get going then.

92
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,797
Right. Seong-hyeon--

93
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,718
We're ready for you. I'm afraid
only one guardian's allowed to stay.

94
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,055
Go receive your treatment.

95
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,307
Sure.

96
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,988
You jumped in front of a knife,
but you're afraid of needles?

97
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,742
Anyone who has been burned by hot soup
flinches at the sight of it.

98
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,038
Thank you.

99
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,458
That was out of the blue.

100
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,419
I don't think

101
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,130
I thanked you officially yet.

102
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,049
You did unofficially though.

103
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,302
Look at me.
The way you've been looking at me.

104
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,972
It's been shooting out words of gratitude.

105
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,808
That's ridiculous.

106
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,520
So what now?

107
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,772
What do you mean?

108
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,608
About tonight.
Your place is now a crime scene.

109
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,902
Oh, right.

110
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,789
Welcome, it's your…
No, it's not your first time.

111
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,374
It's my third.

112
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,086
As you know, three is a lucky number.

113
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,379
Like samseon jjajangmyeon

114
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,548
and best-of-three set matches.

115
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,384
And they say the third daughter is
always the prettiest.

116
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,469
That's so silly.

117
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,639
Anyway, it's better
than staying home alone tonight.

118
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,182
Ms. Pyo went to Seoul, right?

119
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,600
Yes.

120
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,563
Make yourself at home
and let me know if you need anything.

121
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,817
I need clothes to change into.

122
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,652
Right.

123
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,239
Should I go fetch some from your place?

124
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,909
Or would you like to wear
something of mine?

125
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,496
Would they fit?

126
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,165
-Would they be too small?
-Probably too big.

127
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,181
I see you're done.

128
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,726
The clothes are too big for me.

129
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,812
They are not. They fit you like a glove.

130
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,940
You know, you have such broad shoulders.

131
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,651
What do you mean?
It's clearly too big on me.

132
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,987
It's just that you have narrow shoulders.
They fit just right.

133
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,031
You just have to have the last word.

134
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,157
Anyway, drink this.

135
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,617
What is it?

136
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,203
Chamomile tea. Nothing's better
for relaxation and good sleep.

137
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,748
Drink while it's hot.

138
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,542
It'd better be good.

139
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,217
-What is this?
-Keep it on you.

140
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,511
It's easy to get aches
on a night like this.

141
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,305
Your muscles must be in shock.

142
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,558
Why do I need a blanket
on such a hot summer night?

143
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,560
I'm good.

144
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,524
You've got cramp.
See? This is what I was talking about?

145
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,986
Let me see. Does it hurt a lot?

146
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,406
What are you doing?

147
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,824
Didn't you wash your feet?

148
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,743
Of course I did.

149
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,620
Then stay still.

150
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,915
The spasm will get worse
if you don't treat it right away.

151
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,961
Meow if you don't have
anything better to do.

152
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,466
Meow…

153
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:17,968
Lick your nose too.

154
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,515
Forget it. You can stop now.
I think I'm good.

155
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,351
Really? Are you sure?

156
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,310
Yes.

157
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,355
All right.

158
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,318
What's with the special plates?
Is it someone's memorial service?

159
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,236
My grandfather.

160
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,363
When is it?

161
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,281
Tomorrow. Hold on.

162
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,118
It's past midnight, so today.

163
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,205
Do you remember a lot about him?

164
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,000
No, I don't.

165
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,045
I want to remember everything about him,

166
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,589
but it keeps fading away.

167
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,511
His voice, his gaze, and his hands…

168
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,766
He had rough palms, you see.

169
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,811
He was a sailor who then ran an oil shop

170
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,730
after my parents passed away,
so it's what you'd expect.

171
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,819
But his hands were so big
and exceptionally warm.

172
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,196
He raised me with them.

173
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,415
I bet you were a troublemaker
when you were little.

174
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,751
The boy in the photo
has "mischief" written on his face.

175
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,005
I was absolutely
all over the neighborhood.

176
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:40,301
I stole the squid
the old ladies had hung out to dry

177
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:44,096
and played soccer all day
until my neck was badly burned.

178
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,849
-Soccer?
-Yes, I loved the sport.

179
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,603
Just like you,
I had a pair of shoes I loved so much.

180
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,605
My blue soccer cleats.

181
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,981
I see.

182
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,026
Do you still enjoy soccer?

183
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,322
No, I don't anymore.
I don't even watch it.

184
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,616
Why not?

185
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,084
Because of soccer…

186
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,338
No, because of me,

187
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,799
my grandfather passed away.

188
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,470
He had a heart attack.

189
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,140
But he wasn't found in time.

190
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,771
If only I hadn't gone out…

191
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,441
to watch the World Cup matches.

192
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,741
Don't tell me you believe
that he wouldn't have passed away

193
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,118
had you been at home.

194
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,751
Those what-ifs are pointless.

195
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,088
There are too many variables in this world

196
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,882
and they're beyond our control.

197
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,844
So it's not your fault.

198
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,062
You've been thinking that way
all this time?

199
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,399
Your grandpa must've been fuming
in his grave.

200
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,489
Would he be that angry?

201
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,033
Of course.

202
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,120
Isn't this

203
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,789
the first time you talked about yourself?

204
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,374
You're right.

205
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,253
You're the second person

206
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,590
that I've told my personal stories.

207
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,302
Second?

208
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,598
How dense of me.

209
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,850
Tea won't cut it, right?

210
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,560
Are you done?

211
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,065
Second?

212
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,713
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

213
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,090
Seong-hyeon, I enjoyed your show today.

214
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,009
Me too. You have a great voice.

215
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,636
Thank you so much.

216
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,679
-My gosh.
-Gosh, he's handsome.

217
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,514
He actually talked to us!

218
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,689
Babe, you look stunning today.

219
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,070
You should've dressed like this sooner.

220
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:50,282
Hold on. Did you perhaps
dress up like this since it's my birthday?

221
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,159
-Of course not.
-What?

222
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,911
Don't be mistaken.

223
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,163
It was for me, not you.

224
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,874
-What?
-You heard me.

225
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,460
You can wear
all the expensive clothes in the world

226
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,254
but you look like the cheapest person,

227
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,881
and I deserve better.

228
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,299
Cheap?

229
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,719
So you must've overheard me.

230
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,014
Let me explain.
Let's talk somewhere private.

231
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,601
No. I don't have any more time
to spare you in my life.

232
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,812
The three months I wasted
is more than enough.

233
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,526
Hye-jin!

234
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,106
Seong-hyeon.

235
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,446
Just a second.

236
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,628
Thanks, Seong-hyeon.

237
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,507
Those heels are pretty.

238
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,469
You know,

239
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,138
I spent two months' salary on these.

240
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,184
My hands shook at first,
but I just went for it.

241
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,728
Come to think of it,

242
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,397
I had never bought anything for myself.

243
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,401
You did good. You need to give
yourself a gift now and then.

244
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,698
But I guess all pretty things have thorns.

245
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,577
I didn't expect to see blood
on my first day wearing them.

246
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,121
-Just a second.
-What?

247
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,625
-These…
-But--

248
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,169
It'll be better
if you soften the back of them.

249
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,338
Nothing's easy at first you know.

250
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,633
Whether it's wearing shoes
or being in a relationship.

251
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,346
Here.

252
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,435
Much better now.

253
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,481
-Why don't we go eat something?
-Sounds good.

254
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,358
-Come on.
-Sure.

255
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,680
That was good.

256
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,889
I could tell.

257
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,727
I was only being polite
since you cooked it for me.

258
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,648
Why did you insist on cooking
with a bad arm though?

259
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:13,735
Well, I'm never going to let you
do anything in my kitchen again.

260
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,362
Why not?

261
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,614
Someone's calling you.

262
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,740
MI-SEON

263
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,665
Hey, Mi-seon. Did you get there safely?

264
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,917
-Yes.
-And your mom's surgery?

265
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,128
She was just taken to the operation room.

266
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,256
The doctor told me not to worry
since the procedure

267
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,549
isn't all that invasive.

268
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,343
I'm sure it'll go well, so don't worry.

269
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,305
What about you? Is everything all right?

270
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,557
Here? Of course, everything's good.

271
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,142
I'm fine.

272
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,896
Don't hurry back,
and be with your mom as long as you want.

273
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,814
You're on indefinite leave.

274
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,443
We'll see.

275
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,196
I've got to go.

276
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,072
Good night.

277
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,533
Sure.

278
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,456
Here, drink this.

279
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,209
-Thank you.
-Sure.

280
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,507
You should head back.
You have work in the morning, right?

281
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,260
It's my day off tomorrow. What about you?

282
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,680
Well, after my mom's surgery is over,

283
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,515
I'll stay until she wakes up

284
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,976
and leave early in the morning
when my sister comes.

285
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,687
Hye-jin told me to stay here,

286
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,856
but I should still go to work.

287
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,066
We can go together then.

288
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,234
Gosh, no.

289
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,196
Pulling an all-nighter
will only exhaust you.

290
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,243
Besides, I feel bad
you had to run into my father.

291
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,746
It's all right.
I'm more worried about you than myself.

292
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:55,003
You must be exhausted,
so get some shuteye.

293
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,756
I'll wake you up
as soon as your mother comes out.

294
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,595
But you must be more tired than I am.

295
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,224
I'm used to working the late shift.

296
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,146
So I'm not tired at all.

297
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,133
Don't just stand there. Come lie down.

298
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,847
I feel bad about chasing an injured man
out of his own bed.

299
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,182
Think of it
being reserved for the spooked.

300
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,100
All right, then.

301
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,609
You don't think
someone might break in again, do you?

302
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,819
With me here?

303
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,404
I meant, into my place.

304
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,408
If you want, I'll install
a front gate tomorrow.

305
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,035
What if someone climbs over it?

306
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,287
Then I'll put up a wire fence. No, wait.

307
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,289
Let's plant mines instead.

308
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,625
I'm just saying you can be at ease.

309
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,420
-My gosh!
-What the hell?

310
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,214
What was that?

311
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,133
It was only the wind.

312
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,510
-Wind?
-Darn it, it's unusually strong tonight.

313
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,346
-The wind?
-Yes.

314
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,722
It came out of nowhere.

315
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,310
-What now?
-Hey, Bugyeong!

316
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,396
-Bugyeong, you…
-Who's Bugyeong?

317
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,231
Gosh, that startled me.

318
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,193
It's the fishing village chief's dog.

319
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,029
-I see.
-He must've eaten something funny.

320
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,531
He's been howling like a wolf for days.

321
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,078
I see. Well, sweet dreams, Bugyeong.

322
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,871
-Good night.
-Bugyeong--

323
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,373
Go to sleep now.

324
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,042
-Sure.
-I'll be outside.

325
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,460
Okay.

326
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,890
So you'd rather stay up all night here?

327
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,977
What else can I do when I can't sleep?

328
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,146
You can go to bed.

329
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,023
I'll put you to sleep in five seconds.

330
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,277
-How?
-Just lie down. You'll find out.

331
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,492
All right.

332
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,341
Wait. Is that poetry?

333
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,719
Yes. To those who don't read
a lot of books like you,

334
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,388
this works like a charm.

335
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,931
I read a lot of books, you know.

336
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,559
Name one that inspired you
in five seconds.

337
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,727
-Five, four--
-Get reading.

338
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,105
Here I go then.

339
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,773
Well…

340
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,819
You can keep listening

341
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,279
or go to sleep.

342
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,698
"Doorkeeper.

343
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,325
'You can't be here.'

344
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,578
Saying that is my job.

345
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,457
It is my job to deny your purpose.

346
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,546
It is also my job
to deny you the next day again.

347
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,968
And waiting for you the next day
in order to deny you

348
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,303
is also my job.

349
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,515
It is my job to fall in love with you

350
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,435
while waiting for you

351
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,103
the next day.

352
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,980
Thus, denying my love…"

353
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,880
Chief Hong.

354
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,175
Who is

355
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,887
the first person you told

356
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,264
about your grandfather?

357
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,226
There was this person.

358
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,313
Someone very warm-hearted.

359
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,690
Damn it.

360
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,772
What? The pervert
that broke into Dr. Yoon's place

361
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,234
is the one who tried to abduct Ms. Yu?

362
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,735
-Exactly.
-My gosh.

363
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,363
I just got back
from testifying at the police station.

364
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,906
-No way.
-Lieutenant Kim said

365
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,533
he has 11 priors.

366
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,742
-What?
-Eleven priors?

367
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,787
They found a truckload of
women's clothes that he'd stolen.

368
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,998
Remember that red bra of mine I mentioned?

369
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,416
He's the one who took it.

370
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,376
It was among the items he stole.

371
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,794
That son of a bitch.

372
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,005
-He must've stolen my dress then!
-Right.

373
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:34,718
My gosh. When did that foul man
come to live here in Gongjin?

374
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,386
About two months ago,

375
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,431
after wandering around
after getting out of prison.

376
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,308
But he couldn't shake the habit.

377
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,310
That damn pervert!

378
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,730
He deserves to have
his limbs ripped piece by piece.

379
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,190
That son of a bitch deserves hell.

380
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,360
-That pervert--
-Can I see him if I go to the station?

381
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,653
You foolish…

382
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,905
By the way, is it Sunday?
Why are you here?

383
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,574
You should be in school!

384
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,868
-Yes, you should be in school.
-Stop nagging me!

385
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,328
-Go on.
-You'll be late again.

386
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,495
-Hye-jin!
-You--

387
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,705
My gosh.

388
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,624
I'll text you later,
so tell me all the details. Bye!

389
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,044
-Dr. Yoon!
-Dr. Yoon, are you all right?

390
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,462
Hello, all.

391
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,464
I was so shocked to hear what happened.

392
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,841
I heard he cut your arm with a knife.

393
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,676
It must hurt. Oh, dear.

394
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,720
Goodness. Dr. Yoon,

395
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,389
you look haggard now.

396
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,517
-Are you all right?
-Once again, rumors travel fast.

397
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,187
I'll tell you.
I'm fine, so don't worry about me.

398
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,981
And as you can see,
Ms. Dentist seems fine too.

399
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,524
Who are you to speak for me?

400
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,026
She's right. Be quiet.

401
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,819
Anyway, I'm fine.

402
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,113
I'm sorry for concerning you.

403
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,367
Please don't say that.
As your landlady, I'm completely ashamed.

404
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,036
I'll get you a security system right away.

405
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,496
-Yes, you should.
-Thank you.

406
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,457
In the meantime, have this calming pill.

407
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,001
Taking this when you've been startled

408
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:54,089
will calm your heart right back down.
Have it now.

409
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,132
There. Go ahead.

410
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,759
-Thank you.
-Sure thing.

411
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,220
There you go.

412
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,680
Chew and swallow even though it's bitter.

413
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,933
Ms. Gam-ri, what about me? Where's mine?

414
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,770
Well, I only had one at home.

415
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,730
I'll get you one later on.

416
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,191
Dr. Yoon, I brought this from my store.

417
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,818
Have some honey water.

418
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,486
What? Again, where's mine?

419
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,446
-Seriously?
-Because I only had one.

420
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,534
Are you actually on your way to work?

421
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,702
Shouldn't you be taking the day off?

422
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,080
I can't let the clinic close for the day.

423
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,666
Then stay right here.
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

424
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,585
-Your favorite, iced Americano.
-No, it's fine.

425
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,130
I just want to get you some, so wait here.

426
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,047
What about me?

427
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,590
-Where's mine?
-Stop it.

428
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,051
By the way,

429
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,804
how did Chief Hong
come to your aid last night?

430
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,681
I'm glad he did,

431
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:49,519
but were you two there together
that late at night?

432
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,104
This I should hear.

433
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:55,191
Right? You guys
showed up here together as well.

434
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,694
My gosh.

435
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,196
I have to say,
the curiosity is killing me.

436
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,032
Why on earth are you all giggling?

437
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,994
Because we're curious.

438
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,495
Gosh.

439
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:14,461
Is it just me, or is everyone
more worried about you than me?

440
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,631
Why do you keep following me?

441
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,759
You'll end up at the clinic at this rate.

442
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,010
That's where I'm headed.

443
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,137
Why?

444
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,014
To get a free cup of coffee.

445
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,725
Today, I'm craving instant coffee.

446
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,311
We do serve a great instant coffee.

447
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,521
-Hye-jin!
-Du-sik!

448
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,398
Hey, Eun-cheol.

449
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,608
Mi-seon.

450
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,109
How come you're here together?

451
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,236
We heard about what happened last night.

452
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,738
Are you all right?

453
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,491
Why didn't you say anything
when I called last night?

454
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,034
I didn't want you to worry.

455
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,744
I'm fine, so don't worry.

456
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,038
How's your mom?

457
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,499
Yes, her surgery went well.

458
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,459
It's all thanks to you.

459
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,211
That's a relief.

460
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,129
I told you to stay by her side.

461
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,089
Why did you hurry back here?

462
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,050
Well, I'm glad I did.

463
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,344
Look what happened overnight!

464
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,221
My gosh.

465
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,598
I won't leave you ever again.

466
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,601
I'll be right next to you
as if we were joined at the hip.

467
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,066
Talk about déjà vu.

468
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,150
Tell me about it.

469
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,570
Are you all right though?
I heard you hurt your arm.

470
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,072
Where does it hurt?

471
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,573
-Which--
-Let go.

472
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,495
-Were you terrified?
-Yes.

473
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,038
-Are you crying?
-It was scary.

474
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,582
-Of course.
-But…

475
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,758
What's the deal with Officer Choi?

476
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,426
Oh, that?

477
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,473
Well, he drove me
to the hospital in Seoul.

478
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:55,353
He even stayed with me
until my mom was out of surgery,

479
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,604
and drove me back here.

480
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,189
What?

481
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,859
That's what I call
being taken out of the friend zone.

482
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,570
While he sat with me outside the OR,

483
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,822
I was reminded of old memories.

484
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,825
When my dad was hospitalized,

485
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,370
Pil-seung never came to visit him
at the hospital.

486
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,040
He was afraid
my parents might bring up marriage

487
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,710
if he met them.

488
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,964
I knew we should've killed
that rat bastard.

489
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:27,176
At first, it was Eun-cheol's looks
that I was drawn to.

490
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:32,432
My heart beats faster for those
who look like Hong Kong movie stars.

491
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,475
-Right.
-But now I'm in trouble.

492
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,148
I think I'm in love with him.

493
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,860
Wait. Isn't that a good thing though?

494
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:57,457
Yeong-guk,
I've never had any romantic feelings

495
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,918
for you.

496
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:03,546
I hope we can continue being good friends.

497
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:11,137
You'll never know why I wanted a divorce.

498
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,973
Fine. Let's keep it that way forever.

499
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,725
Just live your life.

500
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,530
My goodness. You startled me.

501
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,991
Why are you acting like you saw a ghost?

502
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:36,454
Damn it.
The stress could actually kill me.

503
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,165
Always the scaredy-cat.

504
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,541
So what brings you by?

505
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,585
I'm here on official business, sir.

506
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,546
Is that so? Then have a seat, ma'am.

507
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:58,601
I'm sure you're aware of the unfortunate
incident that took place last night.

508
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:02,146
Yes. I mean, yes, ma'am.

509
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,316
So the zone chiefs
and area chiefs discussed

510
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,903
and decided to form
a civilian patrol unit.

511
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,947
And that's final.

512
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,074
So you discuss it with City Hall

513
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,410
to get us extra security measures

514
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,079
such as security cameras and alarm bells.

515
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,457
-Answer me.
-Sure.

516
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,252
Don't just say yes, and do it.

517
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,796
I'll be counting the days starting today.

518
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,758
Hold on a second.

519
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,052
Are you leaving already?

520
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,096
I said my piece, so why should I stay?

521
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,472
Well, I'm not done yet.

522
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,392
We need to talk about a private matter.

523
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,105
-What you said yesterday--
-I have nothing more to say.

524
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,982
-Hwa-jeong, please. I--
-Hello?

525
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,525
Hey, Yun-gyeong.

526
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,153
Yes, sure thing.

527
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,904
I should be there today.

528
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,449
Yes, of course. Got it.

529
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,908
What is it?

530
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,244
What the hell is it?

531
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,914
Tell me what it is. It's driving me nuts!

532
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,417
Just tell me already!

533
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,754
Fix it for me!

534
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,256
Dad, please!

535
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,341
Bo-ra, come on.

536
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,635
How can you act this way

537
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,513
when your parents work
their fingers to the bone

538
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,932
to provide for you?

539
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,727
I-jun, I'm fine.

540
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,189
I'm a merciful saint.

541
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:30,151
My game console!

542
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,737
What's with this quiet yet familiar scene?

543
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,655
-Hey.
-Hi, Uncle Hong.

544
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,491
Hey, I-jun.

545
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:40,828
Bo-ra, who on earth upset you?

546
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,874
Uncle Du-sik,
Dad won't fix my game console.

547
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:48,461
Is that so? Is that what upset you?

548
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,923
Oh, my. Look at these big drops of tears.

549
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,760
But you should know
it's not that he won't fix it.

550
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,761
He just can't.

551
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,721
He's a fool, you see.

552
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,182
No matter what happens,

553
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,768
-I will not lose my cool.
-I'll fix it for you.

554
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,394
I'm a genius.

555
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,648
Where is it? I-jun, can you get it for me?

556
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,857
Thanks.

557
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,027
Let me see. So this is it.

558
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,195
Screwdriver.

559
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,366
You seem fine for someone
who got nicked by a knife.

560
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,076
-Are you disappointed?
-No.

561
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,995
I'm relieved, that's all.

562
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,706
I guess I was worried.

563
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,251
-I have an order to place.
-Don't.

564
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,336
-It's--
-Hey, Yun-gyeong.

565
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,506
I called to say that I'm closing up
my hardware store for good.

566
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,843
-It's--
-You're busy, so I should shut up?

567
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,553
-It's--
-I love you too.

568
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,804
-It's--
-Don't say it.

569
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,763
-Hey--
-Quiet.

570
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,890
-I'm merciful.
-Your dad is what?

571
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,892
-A fool. And I'm what?
-I'm a saint.

572
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,855
PLACEMENT OF ORDER
WINDOW LOCK

573
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,028
Wait.

574
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,697
Isn't that Director Ji's car?

575
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,802
WRITER WANG

576
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,223
Hello?

577
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,975
Are you insane?

578
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,769
How can the main director
not show up for editing?

579
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,273
You're right to call me insane.

580
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,026
What is it? Where are you right now?

581
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,737
In Gongjin.

582
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,989
What? Why are you still there?

583
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,116
No way.

584
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,203
Does this concern your good luck charm?

585
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,288
Dr. Yoon?

586
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,210
I've known you for seven years,

587
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,794
but I've never seen you this way.

588
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,962
Seong-hyeon.

589
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,217
A ship can't be navigated properly
without its captain.

590
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,135
Sorry.

591
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,599
Ji-won, can you cut me some slack
just for one day?

592
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,977
Just today.

593
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,857
Starting tomorrow,
I'll pull myself together again.

594
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,526
It's just for today then.

595
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,196
Don't let your personal life
affect work again.

596
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,923
Until when will you see me
only as a co-worker?

597
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,759
CHIEF HONG

598
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,929
But he doesn't have any relatives.

599
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,890
Is he hosting the memorial service
all by himself?

600
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,727
Aren't you getting off?

601
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,314
I have a few things to sort out.
You should head home first.

602
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,774
Should I wait?

603
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,318
No, don't.
You must be tired from the long night,

604
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,444
so go home and rest.

605
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,030
Then come home before it gets too dark

606
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,199
and call me if anything happens.

607
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,743
Got it. See you later.

608
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,869
Sure.

609
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,590
Ms. Pyo.

610
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,514
If you're free,

611
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,517
can we have some coffee?

612
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,484
Didn't you say coffee?

613
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,529
Well, that's just something
people commonly say.

614
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,906
I prefer beverages
that taste like herbal tonics.

615
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,121
Anyway, I asked you to have coffee with me

616
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:53,831
to say something.

617
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,459
I have something to say too.

618
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,587
Sorry? Then you should go first.

619
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,755
Okay.

620
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,215
Well…

621
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,304
I wanted to thank you once again
for what you did yesterday.

622
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,599
There's no need.
I just did what I needed to do.

623
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:16,020
Right. Your occupation
requires you to serve the people,

624
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,524
and you offered me your services
for two days.

625
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,442
Right?

626
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,319
Sorry?

627
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,989
I've dated my fair share of guys.

628
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:33,287
I was offended when you talked
about how easily I start dating,

629
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,372
but you were right.

630
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,586
And that time,
my feelings for you weren't serious.

631
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,256
However,

632
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,219
those feelings ended up
growing into something more.

633
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:53,641
I'm scared that they might grow

634
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,602
as big and tall as Jack's beanstalk.

635
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,188
But that's not me, you see.

636
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,357
-Ms. Pyo--
-So I…

637
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:02,900
So I…

638
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,613
have decided to put a lid on my feelings.

639
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,032
Sorry?

640
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,495
I'll put some distance between us
so that you won't feel uncomfortable.

641
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:20,084
So you can keep being comfortable with me

642
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,505
and only consider me
as one of the citizens.

643
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,113
ASSORTED JEON FOR SALE

644
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,256
Is he inside?

645
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,425
-No, I'm out here.
-My gosh!

646
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:13,262
You startled me.
Don't sneak up on people like that.

647
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,514
Is spying and being shameless
your specialty?

648
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,183
You're in my yard.

649
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,810
What brings you by?

650
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,189
You said it's your grandfather's
memorial service today.

651
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,525
You can't cook since you hurt your arm,
so I picked up some jeon--

652
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,943
Chief Hong!

653
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,987
-Hey, Dr. Yoon.
-Hello, Ms. Yeo.

654
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,113
What brings you by?

655
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:35,117
I cooked these as a snack
but made too much.

656
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,077
Serve them for today's service.

657
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,206
A snack? This is too much.

658
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,290
It's really nothing.

659
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,710
Starting from the bottom,
there's beef jeon,

660
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,961
-croaker jeon,
-Croaker.

661
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:50,508
pollack jeon, tofu jeok,
and flat meatballs.

662
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,053
Nothing, did you say?
It doesn't get more luxurious than this.

663
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,055
This is the least I could do.

664
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,723
My family got out of the hole

665
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,684
after we took over
his oil shop 20 years ago.

666
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,770
We'll return the favor for generations.

667
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,396
Is I-jun on board with that?

668
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,983
I-jun's motto is to carry
one's gratitude beyond the grave.

669
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,903
-I'll get going then.
-Thanks, Hwa-jeong.

670
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,530
-Have a good day.
-Thanks!

671
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,864
-Bye.
-Bye.

672
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:14,990
Thanks!

673
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,450
What were you saying again?

674
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,828
Well, I bought some jeon--

675
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,040
-Goodness.
-Hello, ladies.

676
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,626
My gosh. Ms. Gam-ri, what is all this?

677
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,419
-Give it here.
-Chief Hong.

678
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,796
It's red snow crab.

679
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,631
-Gosh.
-Let me take that.

680
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,593
You're supposed to serve octopus,
but it's currently a closed season.

681
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,679
So I steamed some crabs instead.

682
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,557
-Gosh--
-I seasoned some vegetables for you.

683
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,100
-Ms. Mat-i.
-Chief Hong,

684
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,894
I made beef radish soup. It's still hot.

685
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,771
Ms. Suk-ja, this must've been heavy.

686
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,942
-I got you some pollack and halibut.
-I see.

687
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,236
-Thanks, Nam-suk.
-Sure.

688
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,990
I brought some jujube and chestnuts.

689
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,492
Geum-cheol peeled the latter for you.

690
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,537
You brought this over
when you're close to popping?

691
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,705
-Du-sik.
-Hey, Chun-jae.

692
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,707
These are apples and pears.

693
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,667
-Gosh.
-I just found them on the street.

694
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,794
-Watch it.
-Goodness.

695
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,838
Since I can't cook,

696
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,257
I bought some hangwa and yakgwa.

697
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,261
-Dr. Yoon.
-Yes, hello.

698
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:22,433
Everyone knows everything
in this neighborhood.

699
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,018
As if it's anything new.

700
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,480
Shouldn't you get on it?

701
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,440
Yes, I should.

702
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,608
Do you need any help?

703
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,443
No, I can handle it on my own.

704
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,569
Thank you, everyone.

705
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,363
It's nothing new.

706
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,325
We just have a lot of free time.

707
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,170
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

708
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,797
Are you really the dentist I know?

709
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,133
Did someone assume your identity?

710
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,093
That sure is a lame joke.

711
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,596
Stop that and just take this.

712
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,265
Just a second.

713
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,731
-What are you doing?
-Didn't you buy this for my grandpa?

714
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,733
I did, but--

715
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,401
You got it from the market, right?

716
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,905
My grandpa especially loved
their perilla leaf jeon.

717
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,240
You sure have an eye for good food.

718
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,958
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

719
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,008
I should get going.

720
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,010
Enjoy your time with your grandfather.

721
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,720
You can stay if you want.

722
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,222
What?

723
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,392
If you want.

724
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:22,886
Grandpa.

725
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,474
It sure is a feast today, isn't it?

726
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:32,688
Everyone in the neighborhood pitched in.

727
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:35,816
Please enjoy whatever you want.

728
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,236
There's a lot that you like.

729
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,614
Would you like to say hello?

730
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,584
Hello.

731
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,502
I'm Yoon Hye-jin.

732
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:59,131
A 34-year-old dentist.

733
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,717
I hope we get along.

734
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,262
What's with the introduction?

735
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,432
You told me to say hello.

736
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,102
We'll eat in ten minutes.

737
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,272
He was always a fast eater, you see.

738
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,948
Chief Hong, you spoke in a dialect.

739
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,952
This is my hometown after all.
I spoke in one when I was a boy.

740
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,245
Right, of course.

741
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:37,211
Snow crab at a memorial service
is a rare sight for me.

742
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,381
It's my first time serving it.
He used to love it though.

743
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,510
I see. You and him must have
liked different taste in food.

744
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,804
You don't like snow crab.

745
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,058
Me? Not at all.

746
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,269
What? But that's what you said.

747
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,939
What should we have? Snow crab?

748
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,565
No. Something else.

749
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,444
That's because
I couldn't be bothered at the time.

750
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,863
I enjoy crabs,
but peeling them is a hassle.

751
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,782
Besides, there are so many other dishes.

752
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,700
I see.

753
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,045
What are you doing?

754
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,256
Did you just…

755
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,175
peel it for me?

756
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,679
Well, it must be even more bothersome

757
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,264
with that injured arm.

758
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,059
Thanks.

759
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,727
Sure thing.

760
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,400
Gosh.

761
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,612
This was your plan all along.

762
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:50,242
Of course not.
It landed near your right dimple though.

763
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,452
-Where? Here?
-Here. Eat it.

764
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,537
There you go.

765
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,831
Unbelievable.

766
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,128
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

767
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,256
-Of course not. It really was a mistake.
-Aren't you?

768
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,091
It won't happen again, so enjoy.

769
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,176
Really?

770
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:13,807
Shrimps and crabs are
too bothersome to eat.

771
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,143
Compared to the effort you put in,

772
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,145
the outcome is too small.

773
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,314
It's still delicious though.

774
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,984
I know. Come to think of it,
my grandpa is the only one

775
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,528
who's ever peeled them for me.

776
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:32,034
Right. Peeling these are a true hassle.

777
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:35,370
It takes a lot of love
to do this for someone else.

778
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,840
Well…

779
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,053
However, right now,

780
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,222
this is a special occasion.

781
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,725
It's my fault you got injured.

782
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,978
You're right.
This will take four weeks to recover.

783
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,439
It hurts.

784
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,691
-Just eat.
-Okay.

785
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,818
It's good.

786
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,324
It's really good.

787
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,707
Wait. Let me walk you home.

788
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,627
You don't have to.
You have a lot to tidy up.

789
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,506
Forget about that. It's dark outside.
Think about what happened last night.

790
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,133
I live right around the corner

791
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,843
and Mi-seon's home today.

792
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,054
-I can call her on my way home.
-But still--

793
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,264
No, don't walk me out.

794
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,475
Bye. Don't walk me out.

795
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,476
But…

796
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,239
Did I really say "love"?

797
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,659
What the hell was I babbling on about?

798
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,537
I should sew my lips together for good.

799
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,621
Hey, Hye-jin.

800
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:00,789
Seong-hyeon?

801
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,291
Were you waiting for me?

802
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,292
Yes.

803
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,586
You should've called.

804
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,214
How was your trip to Seoul?

805
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:12,342
What? Oh, it was good.

806
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:16,596
I asked you to spare me some time
once I got back from Seoul.

807
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,725
Can you spare me some now?
Or is this a bad time?

808
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,727
-Right now?
-Yes.

809
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,396
We should eat. I'm hungry.

810
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,191
Sure thing.

811
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,611
I'm sorry about this.
I already had dinner.

812
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,946
Are you okay eating alone?

813
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:34,448
Yes, of course.

814
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,907
Go ahead before the ice melts.

815
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:36,992
Okay.

816
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,500
-Hye-jin.
-Yes?

817
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:50,964
Hye-jin.

818
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:52,674
Yes?

819
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,634
I…

820
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,388
Hye-jin.

821
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,099
Yes, that's me.

822
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:02,601
Right.

823
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,562
Jeez.

824
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:11,610
I'm sorry to ask,
but could you say "Action" for me?

825
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,278
"Action"?

826
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:17,199
Yes, I practiced a whole speech for today,

827
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,702
but I'm finding it
hard to actually say it.

828
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,454
Can you do it for me?

829
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,499
I don't know what this is about,

830
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,000
but here goes. "Action."

831
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,507
Hye-jin, there's one thing
I regret in life, and that's…

832
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,427
And that's…

833
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,179
What is it?

834
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,141
Well, it's…

835
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,186
You see…

836
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,813
Seong-hyeon, could it be…

837
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,439
Yes?

838
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:52,484
Are you in financial trouble?

839
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:55,821
What? No, that's not it.

840
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,739
If that's the case,

841
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,742
I could lend you some
although it wouldn't be much.

842
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,494
Not telling you how I felt.

843
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:12,003
I've been regretting
not telling you how I felt 14 years ago.

844
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:18,593
Then I ran into you again in Gongjin,

845
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:22,556
and I thought long and hard about it.

846
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:31,064
I didn't know if the butterflies
in my stomach were due to my past feelings

847
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:36,194
or if they're the feelings
I have for you currently.

848
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,948
The conclusion I came to is this.

849
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,789
I like you.

850
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:54,212
Just like I did all those years ago.

851
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,591
No, even more than that.

852
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:02,512
I like you a lot.

853
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,983
Gosh, please don't.

854
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,402
I don't want to burden you.

855
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,946
And I'm not asking
for an immediate answer.

856
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,158
I just wanted to tell you
before it was too late.

857
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:27,037
I didn't want to regret it again.

858
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,805
My gosh.

859
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,308
I think I can finally eat.

860
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,685
I'll really have this all myself.

861
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:54,147
Sure. Go ahead.

862
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,692
This looks delicious.

863
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,865
It's so good.

864
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,091
Grandpa.

865
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,010
My friend was a bit loud, wasn't she?

866
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,929
That's just how she is.

867
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,640
She talks and giggles a lot.

868
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,686
You easily get distracted in her presence.

869
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,693
Still…

870
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,155
it feels empty now that she's not around.

871
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,000
What took you so long?

872
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,670
Oh, I met up with Seong-hyeon.

873
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,338
He was waiting for me outside.

874
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,590
For what reason at this hour?

875
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,885
What? Did he confess
his feelings for you or something?

876
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,222
Mi-seon.

877
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,058
Get ready for a career change.

878
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,562
You're firing me over a joke?

879
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,274
No, I'm saying you should
set up shop as a fortune teller.

880
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,151
Really?

881
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,987
Right? What did I tell you?

882
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,448
I told you
Seong-hyeon had feelings for you.

883
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,827
Wait. Why don't you seem happy?

884
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,167
It's just complicated, that's all.

885
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,002
What could possibly be complicated?

886
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:42,088
He's from a nice family and has
a good job and a great personality.

887
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:45,050
He's the man of your dreams.

888
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,719
Besides, you used to have a crush on him.

889
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,306
Fate brought you together again,

890
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,641
and he finally confessed his feelings,

891
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,310
so what's holding you back?

892
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,604
It's just that…

893
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:00,982
Because of Chief Hong?

894
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,528
Are you serious?

895
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:09,157
No, it's not.
Anyway, that's enough about me.

896
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,241
What about you?

897
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,119
How are things between
you and Officer Choi?

898
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,997
I told him I'd back off.

899
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,000
-What?
-He's right, you know.

900
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:23,630
I don't take relationships seriously
and I'm scared of commitment.

901
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:28,051
But you finally met
someone you truly like.

902
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,887
And I think
there's a chance for something real,

903
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,263
but you're backing down?

904
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,100
What's with us both?

905
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,897
No wonder we're friends.

906
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,740
How about we go to Seoul this weekend?

907
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:52,826
Seoul?

908
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,037
I mean, we'll never be able
to take our mind off these things here.

909
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,748
And I could really use some diversion.

910
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:02,418
We could go shopping
and eat something delicious.

911
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,338
Yes, and have fun at a hotel!

912
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,840
-Yes!
-Yes!

913
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,261
Let's do this
We're off to Seoul

914
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,515
Off we go.

915
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,977
I'm stoked right now.
What should we do first?

916
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,230
Isn't it obvious?
First, we visit your mom.

917
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:25,442
No need for that. She already
got better and is now at my aunt's.

918
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,903
Besides, she grew sick of me
after seeing me for two days in a row.

919
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,321
Really?

920
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,657
Then what should we do? Any ideas?

921
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,535
Shopping? No, wait.

922
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,203
How about a hotel pool?

923
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:41,082
No, let's get a massage at the spa.

924
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,001
Why choose when we can do them all?

925
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:47,380
Seriously. Could you be any smarter?

926
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,424
-Hey.
-Yes?

927
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,927
I see you did your hair
for our trip to Seoul.

928
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,555
Those are some sweet curls you put in.

929
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,349
I know. The curling iron
worked well today…

930
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,520
What is it?

931
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,814
-Oh, no.
-What is it?

932
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,817
Damn it. I think I left it plugged in.

933
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,194
What?

934
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:12,363
What do I do? Should we head back?

935
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,032
Unbelievable.

936
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,993
What are you doing? Who are you calling?

937
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,870
-What?
-The emergency service?

938
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,497
No, Chief Hong.

939
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,041
Right, there's always Chief Hong.

940
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,881
No. No way!

941
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,966
Don't call Chief Hong. Hang up!

942
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,927
-No, don't!
-Chief Hong?

943
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,304
No! I'm serious. You can't!

944
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,640
Don't!

945
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,934
Is that Ms. Dentist?
Please tell her to be quiet.

946
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:44,229
Chief Hong, could I offer you an easy job?

947
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,188
What is it?

948
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:48,691
Could you go to my place right now,

949
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:52,403
enter Hye-jin's room,
locate the dressing table,

950
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,031
and unplug the curling iron on it?

951
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:59,160
What? You've got to be kidding me.
You can do that yourself.

952
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,455
We're currently far away from the house.

953
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,042
-Where?
-In Seoul.

954
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,338
You went to Seoul? When will you be back?

955
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,506
Tomorrow.

956
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:14,676
So please help us out this once.

957
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:18,054
You can't let us burn down
Ms. Yeo's house.

958
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,349
Right, I'll get it done.
That's all you need, right?

959
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,768
-Yes! He'll do it.
-No, wait.

960
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,813
Chief Hong, all you need to do
is enter the house,

961
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,315
take a left, and unplug the curling iron.

962
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,400
Don't look at--

963
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,026
He hung up.

964
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,903
Damn it.

965
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,822
Whatever.

966
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,740
Yes, whatever.

967
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:38,908
Let's just go.

968
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,506
Who knew I'd be doing a job like this?

969
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:04,851
Stay calm. You expected this.

970
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:09,731
You didn't expect her
to keep the house pristine.

971
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,357
That's right.

972
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,445
Damn it.

973
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,657
What the hell?

974
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,370
Are you kidding me?

975
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,832
I can't believe
they made me waste my time.

976
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,585
Damn it.

977
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:36,966
All right.

978
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:43,097
Here too.

979
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,018
Good.

980
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,811
And now…

981
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,734
All done.

982
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:08,164
Hye-jin, look. Do you think it'll suit me?

983
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:11,167
Yes, it's adorable
and will look good on you.

984
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,212
Right? I guess I have my figure to thank.

985
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,255
I should still try it on though.

986
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,299
Sure. There's a fitting room over there.

987
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,843
Really? Just a second. This is adorable.

988
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,566
It'll look good on him.

989
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,529
-Hye-jin!
-Yes?

990
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:43,408
No way! Twirl for me.

991
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,701
Wait. Like this?

992
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,620
It's pretty. It's perfect for you.

993
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,832
No, this isn't the one.
Let's go over there instead.

994
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,834
-Sure.
-I bet they have prettier ones.

995
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,128
Hey. What do you think of this?

996
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,758
It's a nice shade of purple.
You should check it out.

997
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,197
How is it? Is it good?

998
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,074
It's so good

999
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,453
that I wouldn't notice
even if the others stopped breathing.

1000
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,455
Must you always be that annoying?

1001
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,832
Is seeing me die something you want?

1002
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,168
I only meant it in a figurative sense.

1003
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,711
Ms. Gam-ri.

1004
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:38,254
How is it?

1005
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:41,549
Why do people even
have something like this?

1006
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,677
It's sickly sweet
and too cold for my teeth.

1007
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,679
But you enjoyed it the most.

1008
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:51,142
That's only because it's so hot.

1009
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,565
By the way, where's the restroom?

1010
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,233
It's right over there.

1011
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,735
Mat-i, I'm coming with you.

1012
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:03,696
Why on earth would you
follow me to the restroom?

1013
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,239
Because I want to go too.

1014
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,033
I should get them new dishes.

1015
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,163
-That hurts.
-Of course it does.

1016
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:16,542
Weren't you aware of that
when you took the knife for her?

1017
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,588
The situation called for the action.

1018
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:25,510
Du-sik, you have feelings
for the dentist, don't you?

1019
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,015
Not this again.

1020
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,226
We're just friends.

1021
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:37,605
I turned 80 this year.

1022
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:43,986
All my life, I've been diving under water
fishing out abalones and sea urchins.

1023
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:48,825
I can now see through people
like I see through water.

1024
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:53,371
She has taken up
all the space in your heart,

1025
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:57,542
so why on earth are you fighting it?

1026
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:03,297
Du-sik, life may seem long,

1027
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,049
but it really isn't.

1028
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:09,011
Throw away unnecessary thoughts

1029
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,849
and be honest with yourself.

1030
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:14,684
Okay?

1031
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,994
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

1032
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,078
Cho-hui!

1033
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,798
It's a little early for dinner,

1034
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:48,259
but it's better than having it late.

1035
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,637
I was hungry anyway. Thank you.

1036
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:54,056
I hope it's not too salty.

1037
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,563
It's perfect.

1038
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:08,738
I heard from the police
that you gave them a statement.

1039
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,240
Thank you.

1040
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,284
I'm so relieved he was caught.

1041
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:15,620
It could've been terrible
for you and Dr. Yoon.

1042
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:17,079
Right.

1043
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,334
So how have you been?

1044
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:26,047
How's your mother?
Didn't she suddenly collapse back then?

1045
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,675
She passed away last year.

1046
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,179
She needed help after collapsing,

1047
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,097
so I took care of her.

1048
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:39,810
Your mother must've tried very hard
to stay by her daughter's side longer.

1049
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,605
It must've been hard on you too.

1050
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:47,234
What about your brother?
Don't you have one?

1051
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,613
He emigrated to the US
about ten years ago.

1052
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,199
So it's just you.

1053
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,410
Loneliness must've drawn you back here.

1054
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:11,008
You used to love seokbakji.

1055
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:15,680
I still remember you devouring it
when you first rented our room.

1056
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:17,473
You remember that?

1057
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:20,309
It must be because
I value eating the most.

1058
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,728
I tend to remember
things related food well.

1059
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:26,774
Meanwhile, Yeong-guk
gets the blues every season,

1060
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:28,901
so no wonder he and I don't get along.

1061
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,112
Hwa-jeong,

1062
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,239
Yeong-guk and I--

1063
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,657
I heard.

1064
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,451
But what happened isn't your fault.

1065
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,038
Mom!

1066
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,125
Why keep the floor this slippery?

1067
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,626
Ms. Yu!

1068
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:46,711
Hi, I-jun.

1069
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:48,587
Hello.

1070
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,257
I-jun, did you have fun today?

1071
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,218
-Hey.
-Hey.

1072
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:55,720
Would you like some dinner too?

1073
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:59,890
No, I have urgent business
and should get going.

1074
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,058
Have fun.

1075
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:06,939
Gosh.

1076
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:09,984
It's fine.

1077
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,070
He won't die, so eat up.

1078
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,455
It sure is nice to be here.

1079
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:26,375
Now I know why everyone
wants an apartment by Han River.

1080
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,086
Is that so?

1081
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,756
What's with that dry response?

1082
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,591
Maybe I've been away for too long,

1083
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,011
but Han River is narrower than I remember.

1084
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,138
What?

1085
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:45,019
I mean, compared to the sea
I always look at in Gongjin.

1086
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:46,979
I see.

1087
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:52,777
We haven't had a course meal in ages.

1088
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:55,488
Gosh, this smell of butter.

1089
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,075
Hye-jin, we're having lobster.

1090
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,869
I love my life. I really do.

1091
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,251
Why are you giggling?

1092
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:13,422
Oh, it's just that the lobster
reminded me of something.

1093
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:18,094
Recently, I had red snow crabs
with Chief Hong

1094
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:22,556
and the crab meat got on his face
as I snapped the shell open.

1095
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:25,392
That was so funny.

1096
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,977
You haven't tried them, have you?

1097
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,981
They're much better
than imported lobsters.

1098
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:33,609
Maybe it's because
it was directly from Gongjin Harbor,

1099
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,529
but the crab meat was so sweet and soft.

1100
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:40,407
There wasn't any sauce,
but it was still delicious.

1101
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,541
-Hye-jin.
-Yes?

1102
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:49,792
You've been weird today.

1103
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,294
How so?

1104
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,754
You're not yourself.

1105
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:56,132
At the department store,

1106
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:58,884
though you acted like
you'd max out your credit card,

1107
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,387
you didn't buy any shoes or clothes.

1108
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,598
All you did was look at men's clothes.

1109
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,517
When did I ever--

1110
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,685
And even now,

1111
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:10,271
you keep talking about Gongjin

1112
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:12,064
as if all roads lead to it.

1113
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:15,734
Right.

1114
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:18,779
Why am I being a party pooper?

1115
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:20,489
You know what?

1116
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:23,325
In order to get
the Gongjin vibe out of me,

1117
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,911
we should go to a spa after this.

1118
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,664
Sure. Sounds good.

1119
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,545
It's so good. I absolutely love it.

1120
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,801
It's raining.

1121
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,887
The forecast never mentioned one.

1122
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,722
Maybe it's a shower.

1123
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,766
But we need to head to the parking lot.

1124
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,268
You have an umbrella, right?

1125
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,978
It's not far away, so let's run.

1126
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:51,896
What?

1127
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,982
Why do you keep acting weird?

1128
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,026
What do you mean?

1129
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,486
You hate getting wet in the rain.

1130
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:02,573
Feeling uncomfortable and damp
is your worst nightmare.

1131
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:07,244
Are you nuts? I'm all drenched!

1132
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,496
So? Don't you feel refreshed?

1133
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,958
No, I don't.
It feels uncomfortable and damp.

1134
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,711
So what?
Let your hair down and just feel it.

1135
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,923
You're bound to meet
unexpected situations in life.

1136
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:22,259
Even if you use an umbrella,
you'll end up getting drenched.

1137
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:25,387
Just put your hands up
and welcome the rain.

1138
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,892
Hye-jin, what's with you?

1139
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,084
Where'd you get this?

1140
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,127
On the street.

1141
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:03,008
-Are you okay?
-Chief Hong?

1142
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,093
So you're okay.

1143
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:15,813
It's so hot.

1144
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,805
I guess someone got the romance going.

1145
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:51,765
It's unnecessarily pretty.

1146
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,019
Don't go.

1147
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,147
Don't…

1148
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,317
leave me behind.

1149
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:05,696
Ms. Dentist?

1150
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:20,919
Ms. Dentist. Are you all right?

1151
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,422
Are you really okay? Did he hurt you?

1152
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:24,548
Hye-jin!

1153
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:34,767
What's the matter with you?

1154
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:39,355
You just ran out like some crazy woman,
and it's scaring me.

1155
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:42,441
And you happen to be in a floral dress.
It makes you look crazier!

1156
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,650
Mi-seon.

1157
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,904
I think I should go.

1158
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:48,322
Go where?

1159
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,324
To Gongjin.

1160
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:51,325
What?

1161
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:53,619
I'll call you later, okay?

1162
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,834
Yoon Hye-jin, that crazy wench!

1163
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:09,093
She finally came to a realization.

1164
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:11,929
Congratulations on the level-up.

1165
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,098
Way to go, my friend!

1166
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:20,062
What am I supposed to do now?

1167
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:57,141
Chief Hong.

1168
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:01,103
Chief Hong, are you home?

1169
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,985
MS. DENTIST

1170
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:48,567
Chief Hong!

1171
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:51,904
Chief Hong.

1172
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:52,988
Ms. Dentist?

1173
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,826
I thought you wouldn't be back
until tomorrow.

1174
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,456
I couldn't wait until tomorrow
to say this.

1175
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:07,461
I like you.

1176
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,718
I have feelings for you.

1177
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:23,977
I'm one of those people
who plan every second of their lives

1178
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:27,731
according to a lifespan of 99 years.

1179
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:31,443
I don't like people crossing the line
or crossing it myself.

1180
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,695
And I'm fond of expensive shoes.

1181
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,907
I guess I'm your complete opposite.

1182
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,538
It's the same with
our blood types and personalities.

1183
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:45,165
I bet we're not compatible in any aspect.

1184
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:48,877
We're probably as different as
penguins that eat krill

1185
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:52,798
and polar bears that feed on sea lions.

1186
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:57,761
But to hell with all of that…

1187
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,099
because I like you.

1188
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:06,395
Ms. Dentist, I--

1189
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,481
Don't say anything.

1190
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:13,193
I'm not asking anything from you.

1191
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:14,695
I…

1192
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,823
My feelings for you
keep inflating my heart,

1193
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:21,451
and it could burst at any second.

1194
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:28,584
I can't help it anymore.

1195
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:13,837
I…

1196
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,008
I can't…

1197
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,802
deny it anymore either.

1198
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:55,003
Do you like them?

1199
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:59,508
I love them! I'm going to
play soccer in these every day.

1200
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:03,553
Stop gawking at the shoes

1201
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:07,057
and blow out the candles on your cake.

1202
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:09,351
No, I have to make a wish first.

1203
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:14,314
Please let me and Grandpa
live a long and happy life together.

1204
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:17,943
Blow them out already
before the cake gets covered in wax.

1205
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:23,573
I won't ask for much,

1206
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:27,494
so please grant this old man's wish.

1207
01:18:28,745 --> 01:18:32,457
When Du-sik ends up all alone,

1208
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:36,795
please send him someone

1209
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,756
so that he won't be lonely.

1210
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:45,303
Please send him someone
who will be good for him.

1211
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:53,895
All right. One,

1212
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,231
two…

1213
01:18:58,275 --> 01:18:59,317
three!

1214
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:04,030
That little girl…

1215
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:06,450
was Ms. Dentist?

1216
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:50,911
Can we hold off being a couple
for a few days?

1217
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:53,663
Are you having second thoughts
now that you have to dump him?

1218
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:58,168
"I want time to sort out
the past I've shared with Seong-hyeon"

1219
01:19:58,251 --> 01:19:59,377
and the time I'll be spending with you.

1220
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,255
Hye-jin dumped me.
She says that she already likes someone.

1221
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,966
Today's our first day as a couple, right?

1222
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,802
Were you always
so physically affectionate?

1223
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,720
Lock the front door from now on.

1224
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,430
Chief Hong!

1225
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,141
I've lived for 34 years without you,

1226
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:17,270
but each day seems
to last forever since I've met you.

1227
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:22,484
