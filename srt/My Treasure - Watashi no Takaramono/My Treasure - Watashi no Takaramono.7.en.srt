Good day. I'm from Angel-Sitter.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,220
I look forward to looking after your baby today.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,350
Thank you.

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,640
- I'm still not quite done yet. Sorry about that.
- No problem.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,290
<i>All this time, I would spend my entire day</i>

I'm very sorry for my sudden absence the other day.

24
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,720
No worries. Thank you for coming all the way here.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,120
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,400
Thank you.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,920
Please have some coffee.

28
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,240
Thank you.

29
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,540
- Thank you for the coffee.
- No problem.

30
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,390
It's delicious indeed.

31
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,270
Is it brewed from the fair trade coffee beans?

32
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,830
Yes.

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,880
I'll now go into the final adjustments regarding the financing.

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,060
Sure, thank you.

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,500
The weather was good the other day,

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,230
so we went on a picnic for the first time.

37
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,230
You did? Sounds nice.

38
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,540
We also brought out our tent and went to the park...

39
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,720
Where do you normally go when you're outside?

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,710
Mostly at the nearby park.

41
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,510
Excuse me, you dropped this.

42
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,380
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

43
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,910
You dropped it, didn't you?

44
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,420
Goodbye.

45
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,010
Hello?

46
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,240
Sorry for the sudden call.

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,660
Likewise, sorry for not calling you.

48
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,300
<i>It's fine.</i>

49
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,220
Listen.

50
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,980
I hope to speak with you, Miwa-san...

51
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,130
Regarding that...

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,980
- Sorry about that.
- No worries, go ahead and answer it.

53
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,930
If you'll excuse me.

54
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,100
Hello, this is Fuyutsuki from Tri Ambition.

55
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,450
That's right.

56
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,320
We will deliver the products to you soon.

57
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,200
Goodbye.

58
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,270
- So sorry about that.
- It's okay.

59
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,670
Mizuki normally handles the admin part of the business,

60
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,730
so things are a little chaotic when she isn't around.

61
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,760
It's tough when someone who's normally around isn't there, right?

62
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,130
Also, regarding the difference between local and overseas sales revenue...

63
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,310
- Please answer it.
- So sorry.

64
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,020
Hello, Kanzaki speaking.

65
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,990
No, she wasn't feverish this morning.

66
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,200
Is that so?

67
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,220
I'll call back later. Thanks.

68
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,970
Is everything okay?

69
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,210
Looks like my daughter is having a fever.

70
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,140
She's with the babysitter now.

71
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,900
Actually, let's continue with our discussion another day.

72
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,350
No, the other day, we also didn't...

73
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,250
Mizuki is also away today.

74
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,620
I see.

75
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,150
- I shall take you up on your suggestion then.
- No problem.

76
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,980
Sorry.

77
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,390
Did something happen to your wife?

78
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,400
No, she's fine.

79
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,240
You haven't gone home in three days?

80
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,900
What about Shiori-chan?

81
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,450
She's with Hiroki.

82
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,680
<i>Get out of this house right now.</i>

83
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,870
So, Hiroki will be the one raising her?

84
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,040
But Shiori-chan isn't Hiroki-san's-

85
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,560
Hiroki loves Shiori... from the bottom of his heart.

86
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,150
But...

87
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,090
are you really okay with that, Miwa-san?

88
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,650
<i>[The weather is getting colder. The thicker clothes are at the bottom-most drawer]</i>

89
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,040
Sorry, Shinozaki.

90
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,390
My daughter has a fever, so I have to rush home right now.

91
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,350
Sorry about that.

92
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,920
Kanzaki-san?

93
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,360
Please get on.

94
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,710
So sorry.

95
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,430
No problem.

96
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,660
It's on the way, since I'm headed to Toyosu.

97
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,970
It's hard to get a taxi around here without an advanced booking.

98
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,310
Thank you so much for your help.

99
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,830
You're a really nice person, Fuyutsuki-san.

100
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,960
No, I'm not.

101
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,200
Such kindness hits me right in the heart now.

102
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,990
What happened?

103
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,140
Currently,

104
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,860
I'm looking after my daughter on my own.

105
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,280
And it's overwhelming, to be honest.

106
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,240
I recalled something when I was drinking your coffee just now.

107
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,160
It was the time when my wife was working at the flea market you organized.

108
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:31,700
<i>Actually, I secretly went there to look for my wife.</i>

109
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,660
<i>I didn't even speak to her.</i>

110
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,620
I saw that she was smiling and enjoying herself.

111
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,060
That caught me by surprise, and I left.

112
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,940
She had never smiled like that before, not in front of me.

113
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,500
I should have

114
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,330
treated my wife better

115
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,560
back then.

116
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,940
If only I had been as kind as you, Fuyutsuki-san.

117
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm sorry for boring you with all this.

118
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,470
Maybe I take advantage of your kindness.

119
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,070
It's fine.

120
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,560
<i>[The weather is getting colder. The thicker clothes are at the bottom-most drawer]</i>

121
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,620
Is everything okay?

122
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,480
Your daughter, I mean.

123
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,330
It's normal for children to have fevers once in a while.

124
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,970
So, I don't think it'll be serious.

125
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,790
Must be tough for you.

126
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,900
Sir, please turn left in front.

127
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,970

- No worries.

- No problem.
- If you'll excuse me.

131
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,430
Wait, sir.

132

133
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,920

134
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,890
Sorry.

135
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,910

We look forward to supporting you moving forward.

143
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,740
By the way,

144
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,480
I'm sorry for my harsh words to you regarding my brother.

145
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,120
No, that was because I...

146
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,850
I shouldn't have said those things to the two of you.

147
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,550
Well...

148
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,920
Please don't worry.

149
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,430
I'm fine now.

150
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,250
Will you be going to Africa again to set up a school?

151
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,910
Yeah, we are.

152
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,440
It's a dream of ours and Shimohara's, so we want to achieve that.

153
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,650
Are you sure you aren't forcing yourself to do that?

154
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,030
"Forget about that dream of mine."

155
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,600
That's what my brother would probably have said.

156
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:39,140
As long as the two of you keep my brother in your memories,

157
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,660
it's more than enough.

158
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,750
I'm happy that you see him as a dear friend,

159
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,460
but I think my brother

160
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,390
wouldn't want to wish that burden upon you, Mizuki-san.

161
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,860
So...

162
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,150
Mizuki-san...

163
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,820
please cherish the life ahead of you.

164
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,970
Somehow...

165
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,980
it feels like Shimohara has given me a push forward from behind.

166
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,850
Sorry.

167
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,520
You look tired.

168
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,400
The doctor has granted your mother temporary leave from the hospital.

169
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,130
There's a place I haven't been to in a while. I want you to go with me.

170
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,720
The two of us?

171
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,440
Please.

172
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,750
Thank you.

173
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,940
I guess I'll stay over for the night.

174
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,210
But Shiori-chan will be lonely without her mommy.

175
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,120
You're right.

176
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,150
I have to go home.

177
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,860
Your fever has subsided. You're fine now.

178
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,250
It's okay, it's okay.

179
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,600
All right, all right.

180
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,690
Now, now... it's okay.

181
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,030
Would you like to stay in the same room as yesterday?

182
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,470
Yes, sure.

183
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,300
Kanzaki-sama.

184
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,480
If you plan to stay for consecutive nights, I'd recommend this package here.

185
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,880
Then let's do that.

186
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,300
Sorry, Shinozaki.

187
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,970
My daughter's fever has gone down, but I still can't hand her over to the babysitter.

188
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,800
My wife also happens to be away.

189
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,700
I understand.

190
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,380
Please take care.

191
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,600
But we need Kanzaki for today's meeting.

192
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,980
We'll have to handle it somehow.

193
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,060
Sorry for being away for so long.

194
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,950
No worries.

195
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,500
I can't handle all this on my own.

196
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,660
I see.

197
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,780
Fuyutsuki.

198
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,080
I...

199
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,680
I wish to resign.

200
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,060
What do you mean?

201
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,810
I'll continue to help out until we secure Mitsukura's financing,

202
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,400
and until the fair trade business gets on track.

203
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,260
I'm doing this

204
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,940
to bring proper closure for myself.

205
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,330
The one who snatched away the person important to you

206
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,010
was me.

207
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,320
Back then in Africa,

208
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,940
I told them that you were dead.

209
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,820
The situation was chaotic, so it's understandable.

210
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,630
You're wrong.

211
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,930
When you said there was someone important waiting for you in Japan,

212
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,740
I hated the thought of you going back to that person.

213
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,270
I wanted to stop you, even if only for a while,

214
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,020
so I did that on purpose.

215
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,570
I didn't want you to leave me.

216
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,310
At that time,

217
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,180
if you had managed to inform that person waiting for you

218
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,560
that you were alive,

219
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,780
you'd probably be together with her right now.

220
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,090
I'm so sorry.

221
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,240
I've done something unforgivable.

222
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,690
You're wrong.

223
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,990
It's not your fault that she and I can't be together, Risa.

224
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,560
I was the one

225
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,040
who did something unforgivable.

226
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,010
She's someone I shouldn't have fallen in love with.

227
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,950
Risa, you've done nothing wrong at all.

228
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,090
This is so nostalgic.

229
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,410
Why did you want to come here?

230
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,050
The happiest times I spent were in this town.

231
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,790
Back then,

232
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,460
you had a lot of fun every day.

233
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
I did.

234
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,460
I can finally see you smile.

235
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,680
I'm glad we came to this place, after all.

236
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,320
I've been wanting to see that smile for the last time.

237
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,690
Mom...

238
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,740
Thank you for always coming to my rescue.

239
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,460
Remember, I'll always be on your side.

240
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,860
Don't shoulder everything alone.

241
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:25,390
Or do you think I can't be of help at all?

242
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:45,080
I don't think I can see Shiori anymore.

243
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,740
Did something happen to Shiori?

244
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,890
Shiori is fine.

245
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,670
But you said you can't see her anymore, right?

246
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,610
Tell me.

247
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,060
I'm a bad mother.

248
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,820
What?

249
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,010
I did something unforgivable.

250
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,210
Shiori...

251
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,820
She...

252
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,230
She isn't Hiroki's child.

253
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,480
Oh, Miwa...

254
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,840
And Hiroki-san... he found out?

255
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,720
Why did you do something like that?

256
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,840
Miwa, you...

257
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,640
I've brought misery upon Hiroki and Shiori.

258
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,820
I'm so sorry.

259
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,620
Likewise,

260
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,020
I'm a bad mother.

261
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:07,480
I have no right to berate you.

262
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,260
Is it okay if I come in?

263
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,220
I'm sorry for overstepping the line.

264
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,350
Don't be.

265
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,250
I met up with Miwa-san and heard what happened.

266
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,220
I can't bring myself to see Miwa anymore.

267
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,680
What are you going to do with Shiori-chan?

268
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,160
I won't leave Shiori.

269
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,200
- But-
- I know we aren't related by blood.

270
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,520
The mere thought

271
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,680
of her never coming back once she leaves

272
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,820
terrifies me.

273
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,860
Do you plan to continue living with her like this, the two of you?

274
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,270
My life up until Shiori was born

275
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,850
had been bleak.

276
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,460
I was saved

277
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,820
the moment Shiori was born.

278
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,620
At that moment,

279
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,970
I promised myself that I would protect Shiori forever.

280
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,970
That feeling

281
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,430
has never faded ever since.

282
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,910
Have you told that to Miwa-san?

283
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,810
Right now, Miwa-san is with her mother at the hospital.

284
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,780
Her mother doesn't have much longer to live.

285
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,370
Hiroki...

286
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,620
Sorry I'm late.

287
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,090
I've brought Shiori to see you.

288
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,920
Thank you,

289
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,090
Hiroki-san.

290
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,290
Let Grandma carry you, yeah?

291
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,310
Thank you, Hiroki.

292
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,070
Hey there, Shiori-chan.

293
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,590
Isn't it great, Mom?

294
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:59,820
Really, thank you so much.

295
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,320
Make sure you keep smiling

296
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,130
and be happy, you hear?

297
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,270
Thank you, Hiroki.

298
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,850
Once I've settled things on my mom's side-

299
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,080
We won't know when the hospital will call,

300
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,810
so sleep whenever you can.

301
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,060
When you need to rest, just rest.

302
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,030
Okay.

303
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,010
<i>[Here's the spirit of a woman as gentle as a flower.]</i>

304
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,100
Risa.

305
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,560
I've put a lot of thought about you and me.

306
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,920
But you see,

307
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,170
I couldn't forget that person who's important to me.

308
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,330
I know that she is suffering,

309
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,950
but I don't know what I should do.

310
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,820
I'm really sorry.

311
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:23,510
What kind of person is she? This person who's important to you.

312
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,260
She's my childhood friend.

313
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,520
We met each other again by chance.

314
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,180
She's the one who gave you that lucky charm, right?

315
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,500
Yeah.

316
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,990
She made that bookmark for me before I left for Africa.

317
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,020
I should forget about her already.

318
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,200
She also wants me to forget her.

319
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,630
It's okay not to forget, don't you think?

320
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,200
In fact, you shouldn't forget.

321
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,890
For the sake of the future you,

322
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,690
it's something precious

323
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,800
that will help you properly move on.

324
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:32,430
As for me, I'll never forget the times I spent with you, Fuyutsuki.

325
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,690
And of course, with Shimohara, too.

326
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,220
Welcome!

327
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,200
Sorry for suddenly dropping by.

328
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,990
What are you here for?

329
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,340
There's something that I need you to pass to Kanzaki-san.

330
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,720
No, I don't think...

331
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,320
It's okay if she doesn't read it.

332
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,110
I just wanted to sort my feelings out one last time.

333
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,080
Sorry for imposing on you with this selfish request.

334
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,130
Thanks for coming, Makoto.

335
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,250
No problem.

336
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:12,020
What do you plan to do about Shiori-chan?

337
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,970
I'll just follow Hiroki's wishes.

338
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,690
Are you really okay with that?

339
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,710
Will doing this help Shiori-chan at all?

340
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,040
To be honest,

341
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,220
I still haven't forgiven you for what you've done, Miwa-san.

342
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,760
But why didn't you choose to go to Fuyutsuki-san?

343
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,270
You two could have just raised her together.

344
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,660
I could tell Fuyutsuki-san also loves you, Miwa-san.

345
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,770
I know very well what you are prepared to do.

346
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,380
You plan to shoulder the blame all on your own.

347
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,840
So...

348
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,500
I won't tell anyone.

349
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,890
But I just want to know.

350
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,160
I hope...

351
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,010
you can tell me.

352
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,220
All right then.

353
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,850
Thanks for listening.

354
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,120
Fuyutsuki-san passed this to me.

355
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,120
Fuyutsuki-kun did?

356
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,230
There's something he wants to tell you for the last time.

357
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:34,910
You can choose whether to read it or not.

358
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,010
<i>Dear Natsuno,</i>

<i>I know you are suffering all alone.</i>

360
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:43,010
<i>I've been thinking about what I can do to help you.</i>

361
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,560

363

364
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,740
<i>That's why I wrote you this letter.</i>

365
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,660
<i>Back then,</i>

366
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,140
<i>regardless of whatever reason,</i>

367
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,220
<i>I shouldn't have fallen in love with you, Natsuno.</i>

368
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,740
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

369
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:16,640
<i>But I don't want to forget</i>

370
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,760
<i>the time I first met you at the library</i>

371
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,190
<i>back in junior high school, Natsuno.</i>

372
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,200
<i>The time when you and I were chatting secretly in the library,</i>

373
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,210
<i>the time when you gave me a hint to my dream,</i>

374
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,800
<i>the time when we ate sour kelp at the bench on the way home...</i>

375
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,030
<i>These memories will always be alive in my heart.</i>

376
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,560
<i>Natsuno, like how you taught me in the past,</i>

377
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,350
<i>even if the going gets tough,</i>

378
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,400
<i>even if we have to give up a lot of what we have,</i>

379
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,000
<i>there are plenty of wonderful things in this world.</i>

380
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,600
<i>The wonderful things in life will never disappear.</i>

381
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:08,790
<i>Likewise, the wonderful memories in life will never disappear.</i>

382
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:16,030
<i>And I think you, too, have many wonderful memories in your heart, Natsuno.</i>

383
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,370
<i>I'll be happy if I'm a part of those memories.</i>

384
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,190
<i>You will always</i>

385
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,870
<i>be a dear friend whom I cherish in my heart.</i>

386
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,350
<i>And what also awaits us</i>

387
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,520
<i>is a future filled with plenty of wonderful possibilities.</i>

388
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,240
<i>We just don't know what they are yet.</i>

389
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,040
<i>I wish you eternal happiness.</i>

390
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,280
<i>Go for it, Natsuno.</i>

391
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,830
<i>I'll always cheer you on.</i>

392
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,940
<i>Yours sincerely, Fuyutsuki.</i>

393
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,760
Thank you very much for your help with my mom.

394
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:41,220
I'll look for somewhere else to stay.

395
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,180
I'll leave once I've found a place.

396
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,000
You don't have to leave, Miwa.

397
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,030
I'll be the one leaving this place.

398
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,740
Back then,

399
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,260
if you had told me everything,

400
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,610
the outcome may have been different.

401
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,160
<i>Who is Shiori's father?</i>

402
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,180
But then, you covered up for him

403
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,640
till the very end, Miwa.

404
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,990
That was why,

405
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,120
at that point, I didn't want to see you ever again.

406
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,130
You see,

407
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:55,020
I really didn't want to leave Shiori.

408
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,000
But somewhere deep in my heart,

409
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,100
I wanted to punish you, Miwa.

410
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,840
I'm still the same as before.

411
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,340
In the end, all I did was put my feelings above everything else

412
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,080
and hurt you and Shiori.

413
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,390
I thought Shiori's birth had changed me,

414
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:22,010
but I haven't changed at all.

415
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,210
Yes, you have.

416
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,610
Hiroki, you have become Shiori's father.

417
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,250
You know what?

418
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,640
I felt happiest not when I was carrying Shiori.

419
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:47,690
It was when I saw you carrying Shiori.

420
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,290
But...

421
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:56,400
I can no longer feel the same way as before.

422
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,200
Let's discuss how to move forward.

423
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,840
After that's done, I'll leave this place.

424
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,360
Hiroki...

425
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,040
Miwa,

426
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:16,640
