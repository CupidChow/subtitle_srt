Shinozaki, your project has been stuck in the late stage for too long.

75
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,910
Sir, Shinozaki's priority was to provide support instead of meeting the quota-

76
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,590
You're supposed to support everyone and help them achieve their goals.

77
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,140
Achieving goals is part and parcel of the job.

78
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,490
Sorry, sir.

79
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,900
Is this the time to celebrate?

80
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,720
You can't even manage your subordinates.

81
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,370
Sorry, sir.

Kanzaki-san is clumsy.

86
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,760
The chief is watching him now because he said such things.

87
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,980
But he was trying to speak up for you, Senpai.

88
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,690
He's treating us nicely to avoid accusations of abusing his authority.

89
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,430
He won't let us cover for his overtime, either.

90
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,990

until someone points it out.

133
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,060
And the moment someone tells you, that's when you feel the pain.

That kind of alcohol must not have tasted good.

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,010
I couldn't get drunk at all, so I gave up and went home.

It felt like she was laughing at me,

172
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,880
Drinking one cup of coffee takes only 15 minutes.

173
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,890
Just that amount is enough to ease one bruise.

174
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,780
I tried visiting the fair trade company where Fuyutsuki-san worked,

175
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,710
but no one was there.

176
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,200
He did mention he'd hand the company over to someone else.

177
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,770
Do you know anyone else who might contact him?

178
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,920
His company's number is all I know.

Please excuse me.

359
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,240
I'll stay to keep her company. You go home first.

360
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,170
- Okay.
- Be careful on the road. Thanks for coming.

361
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,270

362
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,160
It's nothing.

363
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,060
I have to go now.

364
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,120
Sorry, Miwa.

365
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,620
Don't be.

366
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,230
I keep causing you trouble.

367
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,120
What are you talking about, Mom?

368
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,560
Feeling lonely, perhaps?

369
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:22,360
The other day, you mentioned I was amazing for raising you on my own, didn't you?

370
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,330
Actually, you're wrong.

371
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,680
I'm not amazing at all.

372
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,870
I had no money, and you had to endure so many hardships.

373
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,930
I was always working and left you all alone.

374
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,940
All I did was make you feel lonely.

375
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,560
But you still kept smiling, even though you were suffering.

376
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,920
You were smiling for me, right?

377
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,160
I really wanted to bring more fun and joy into your life

378
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,380
to make you smile genuinely,

379
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:01,550
not just mask your pain.

380
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,150
Oh, Mom...

381
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:10,630
I couldn't do anything for you.

382
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,270
Don't say that.

383
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,030
You see, I was afraid

384
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,380
that if I weren't around,

385
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,290
you'd be all alone.

386
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,900
I was terrified by that thought.

387
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,910
I'm fine with dying alone,

388
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:39,110
but I was really afraid of leaving you and my child behind.

389
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,190
At times, I was filled with regret

390
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:52,000
wondering if it was right to raise you all by myself.

391
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,080
Of course you were right.

392
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,570
Don't regret it, not even a little.

393
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,230
I said I'd always be by your side.

394
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,410
I know you're hurting,

395
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,470
but there's nothing I can do for you.

396
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,420
In the end, all I'm doing

397
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,210
is constantly causing trouble for you and Hiroki-san, Miwa.

398
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,600
Mom...

399
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,810
I'm sorry.

400
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,800
No amount of apologies will ever be enough.

401

What?

418
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,160
You were about to say something when the hospital called.

I've been wanting to ask you...

00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:19,520
Do you really want to give birth to the baby?

423
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,180
What?

424
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,700
Or do you want to abort it?

425
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,350
Why would you ask me that?

426
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,580
Because I forced myself on you that day...

427
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,170
That's how the baby came about, right?

428
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,210
So, what do you want to do?

429
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,330
I can't imagine aborting the baby.

430
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,040
I want to give birth.

431
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,730
Is that so?

432
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,260
I'll be involved in a project from next month.

433
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,020
Things will get busier.

434
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,320
I won’t be able to do anything for you and the baby.

435
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,580
To be precise, I won't do anything.

436
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,120
Don't expect anything from me.

437
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,950
