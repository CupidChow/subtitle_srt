1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,060
Don't tell me…

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,940
Hiroki asked you to come here?

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,590
He told me to come here.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,800
I didn't expect you to be here instead, Natsuno.

5
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,060
It's from Hiroki.

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,570
Answer it.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:40,110
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
the Hidden Desires 🤫💖 Team@viki.com</i>

8
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,960
Hiroki.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,930
Sorry for not telling you.

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,400
Why did you ask Fuyutsuki-kun to meet me?

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,740
<i>Miwa.</i>

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,020
All this time, you've kept the lid shut on a future with him and Shiori, right?

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,620
<i>No, I haven't.</i>

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,380
You have. It's because of my existence that you've kept a distance from him.

15
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,920
<i>I've heard everything you told me,</i>

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,400
<i>and that's how I was able to make this decision.</i>

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,300
He is Shiori's biological father.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,870
I'll part with Shiori.

19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,620
I can no longer give her happiness.

20
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,720
But you see,

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,780
there's also a chance for Shiori to live with her real father.

22
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,710
<i>I figured there's still this option.</i>

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,020
Hiroki...

24
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,040
Besides, are you really okay with leaving things like this, Miwa?

25
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,970
<i>Leave what like this?</i>

26
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,400
Are you really okay with not letting him carry his own child?

27
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,140
<i>I hope you can think about this.</i>

28
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,210
<i>Fuyutsuki-kun and Shiori together...</i>

29
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,270
<i>That thought</i>

30
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,450
<i>had never crossed my mind.</i>

31
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,950
Fuyutsuki-kun...

32
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,760
can we spend the day together, just for today?

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,620
Sure.

34
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,960
<i>[Welcome to the forest zoo where you can enjoy four seasons!]</i>

35
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,730
Sorry.

36
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,520
It fell off? Let's attach it back.

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,810
Hang on.

38
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,790
Okay, all done.

39
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,980
Look at that, Shiori.

40
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,310
It's so big, isn't it?

41
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,880
Look at the giraffe. It's so tall!

42
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,040
Why is its neck so long?

43
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,180
There's a kind of tall tree called the acacia tree.

44
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,780
Its neck is long so that it can eat the leaves of that tree.

45
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,680
I see.

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,950
Yeah.

47
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,150
- A friend from Africa taught me that.
- Oh, really?

48
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,440
<i>I'm sure he can get back his lost time with Shiori.</i>

49
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,440
She's only six months old, after all.

50
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,580
Are you okay with that?

51
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,280
I'm fine with it.

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,890
Shiori will eventually forget me.

53
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,020
I'll also forget her in no time.

54
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,040
Though it's only been six months,

55
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,020
to Shiori-chan it's practically her entire life.

56
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,310
Shiori's life has only just begun.

57
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,470
I believe she'll live a happy life with her real father by her side.

58
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,890
And likewise for Miwa.

59
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,750
It's amazing.

60
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,930
It's your first time seeing it, right?

61
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,330
This is her first time at the zoo?

62
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,150
Yeah.

63
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,730
I see.

64
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,340
Let's take a picture then.

65
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,150
All right, smile.

66
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,920
Get ready.

67
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,340
Shiori-chan, look here.

68
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,600
Ready, say cheese.

69
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,650
One more time.

70
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,290
Say cheese!

71
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,240
Looks good.

72
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,900
Thanks.

73
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,990
- What is it?
- What's wrong, Shiori-chan?

74
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,970
She's probably hungry.

75
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,180
I'll make milk for Shiori. Could you look after her for me?

76
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,210
- Sure.
- Thanks.

77
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,830
Shiori-chan, look.

78
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,360
So... only you will be walking away from them?

79
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,750
I was the one who hurt Miwa in the first place.

80
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,190
That may be true,

81
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,830
but who doesn't make mistakes in their lives?

82
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:30,110
You became a great father to Shiori-chan later on, didn't you?

83
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,720
I didn't have the right to be a father in the first place.

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,490
But for six months, I...

85
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,370
He is Shiori's father.

86
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,030
Shiori-chan, don't worry.

87
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,840
Mommy is making milk for you right now.

88
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,430
Look at this. It's a bear.

89
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,050
See?

90
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,850
<i>A future that I've always kept shut and locked away.</i>

91
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,540
See? Mommy is back. That's great!

92
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,210
Look, Shiori-chan.

93
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,880
Thanks.

94
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,810
Shiori, you must be hungry, aren't you?

95
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,180
Sorry, sweetie. All right, all right...

96
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,830
There's a bird sanctuary here.

97
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,080
Natsuno, you love birds, right?

98
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,750
- Shall we go there later?
- Sure.

99
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,230
By the way, why have you liked birds since way back?

100
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,550
Maybe because my name* includes the "wing" character in it.
<i>(T/N: "Miwa" has the characters "beauty" and "wing")</i>

101
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,490
Since I was little, I always wished I could be a bird soaring freely in the sky.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,550
"Miwa."

103
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,930
"Beautiful wings."

104
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,820
You have a beautiful name.

105
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,940
Shiori-chan also has a beautiful name.

106
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,230
Her name means "guiding post."

107
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,440
Hiroki gave her that name.

108
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,980
It's a beautiful name.

109
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,020
Truly beautiful.

110
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,920
Because this child is my guiding post.

111
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,420
She's your precious treasure, Natsuno.

112
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,690
Right.

113
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,710
- So pretty.
- Amazing!

114
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,920
Look, an orchestra.

115
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,710
- Thank you for coming. Good bye.
- Good bye.

116
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,040
Thanks for spending time with us today.

117
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,070
I had fun, too.

118
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,740
Shiori-chan, thanks for spending time with me today.

119
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,540
Well...

120
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,200
May I carry Shiori-chan?

121
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,430
What?

122
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,530
Sure.

123
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,310
Wow, she's heavier than I expected.

124
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,950
She used to be much lighter.

125
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,880
Is that so?

126
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,120
She was even smaller before, right?

127
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,860
She feels so warm.

128
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,400
Natsuno.

129
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,700

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,880

No.

Shiori...

133
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,620

00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,600
That was what Miwa-san told me.

182
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,150
Miwa told you that?

183
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,300
That's right.

184
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,020
I just came to tell you this.

185
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,930
If you'll excuse me.

186
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,970
I see you're two of a kind.

187
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,390

00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,460
Is that all he's thinking about?

192
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,360
To me, you and Hiroki-san are alike, Miwa-san.

193
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,320
Alike?

194
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,960
You chose to live alone not only for Shiori's sake, right?

195
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,640
It's also not for your own sake.

196
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,740
Even if you choose to live alone,

197
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,590
one day Shiori-chan will ask you who her daddy is.

198
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,870
When that time comes, how will you answer her?

I hope the children here can smile like Shimohara.

You were able to respond to the client's needs and come through with our suggestions.

I knew I could count on you.

273

We can do our best at work because we have something we want to protect.

These two must go hand in hand.

I know, right?

282
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,590
You should learn from me.

283
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,750
No, I'll learn from Kanzaki-san.

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,370
Thanks to you, our plan to set up a school in Africa can proceed accordingly.

293
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,430
I didn't do anything.

00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,040
This is my dream.

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,100
No matter how long it takes, I will protect the smiles of these children.

296
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,670
When I carried Shiori-chan,

297
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,620
I was surprised to find that she was heavier than I expected.

298
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,670
She has grown so much from the time she was born.

299
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,820
I don't know how she looked

300
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,500
when she cried or laughed

301
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,830
during the time she was growing.

302
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,930
I also didn't hear her cry when she was born.

303
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,750
I didn't carry her when she was a newborn.

304
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,870
The reason she was raised

305
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,660
to be so adorable and healthy

306
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,600
was because you and Miwa-san had been pouring

307
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,160
your love into her all this time.

308
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,150

398

I know you've settled into your job here,

00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,120
so it may be selfish of me to say this.

426
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:20,150
Will you consider setting up a school in Africa again with me?

427

If you still have that desire, even if a little of it,

428

can we start from scratch once more, Risa?

Of course, it doesn't have to be right away.

not only because I wanted to protect these children's smiles,
