Actually, I happened to see you on your way to work and you seemed to be in pain.

179
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,470
I couldn't bring myself to call out to you.

180
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,760
Oh, you saw that?

181
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,350
Could you be suffering from mental anxiety?

182
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,590
- Yeah, kind of. I work for a major company, after all.
- Right.

183
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,440
It must be tough for you.

184
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,960
Sorry for being so nosy.

185
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,140
I didn't tell Miwa, so please keep it a secret.

186
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,080
Sure. I know you don't want her to worry.

187
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,490
Yeah.

188
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,440
But I'm absolutely fine now, thanks to Shiori and Miwa.

189
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,300
Glad to hear that.

190
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,200
In that case, is it okay if I invite Miwa out for a meal?

191
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,990
Yes, thank you. I'll take care of Shiori.

192
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,730
Thank you so much.

193
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,090
I'll call her later then.

194
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,660
- Lend an ear to her story, please.
- No worries.

195
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,740
You're drinking so much milk. Is it yummy?

196
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,780
Is it yummy?

197
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,090
<i>[This is Fuyutsuki. Sorry for the sudden text. Natsuno, as long as you...]</i>

198
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,540
Sorry, Miwa. Can you bring over a towel?

199
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,160
Sure.

200
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,540
I'm back.

201
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,300
Welcome back.

202
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,020
Risa, do you have a moment?

203
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,280
Can I take the day off tomorrow?

204
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,350
I promise this will be the last time.

205
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,290
Got it.

206
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,080
You won't listen even if I try to stop you.

207
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,340
Get your butt out there.

208
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,920
Thanks.

209
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,750
<i>This is Fuyutsuki.</i>

210
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,120
<i>Sorry for the sudden text.</i>

211
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:29,880
<i>Natsuno, as long as you are living happily, I am happy.</i>

212
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,560
<i>So, I hope to meet you</i>

213
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,260
<i>and talk to you one last time.</i>

214
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,370
<i>I'll be waiting for you under that water tower.</i>

215
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,430
I'll also finish work at 6 P.M. today.

216
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,780
- Sure.
- Or should I come home earlier?

217
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,810
N-No, it's fine.

218
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,580
Really?

219
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,780
- I'm off then.
- See you.

220
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,440
<i>[This is Fuyutsuki. Sorry for the sudden text. Natsuno, as long as you...]</i>

221
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,840
What's wrong?

222
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,520
Things look peaceful on your side. How nice.

223
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,150
It's hell at my end.

224
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,650
I thought it had been going smoothly.

225
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,320
Shinozaki, I heard you're managing it well.

226
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,230
That doesn't make me happy at all.

227
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,000
The pressure on me only gets worse because of you, Kanzaki-san.

228
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,360
How scary.

229
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,000
Kanzaki, the folks from the startup company are here for your appointment.

230
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,190
I'll be there right away.

231
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,030
Thank you.

232
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Do your best, Shinozaki. You can do it.

233
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,790
What the hell?

234
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,200
<i>[Tri Ambition Corporation]</i>

235
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,150
- Fair trade, you say?
- That's right.

236
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,570
We are working to improve the harsh labor conditions

237
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,040
and the lives of the locals for the better.

238
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,420
My business partner, Fuyutsuki, is also working on this with me.

239
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,030
He has lived with the locals for a long time

240
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,410
and is working with each and every one of them

241
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,590
to change the environment.

242
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,360
Each and every one of them?

243
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,730
By working and sweating it out with them.

244
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,730
At one point, he even stayed over at one of the workers' homes

245
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,880
and didn't come back for months on end.

246
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,320
Wow...

247
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,830
To cherish the connections between people.

248
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,250
That's the motto Fuyutsuki lives by.

249
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,630
He's someone who can stand on equal ground with anyone, right?

250
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,130
Exactly.

251
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,740
Though there are times when things get out of hand if he gets too carefree.

252
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,720
But he has more creativity and initiative than anyone else.

253
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,190
He has a knack for capturing people's hearts.

254
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,220
Sounds like he's a wonderful person.

255
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,580
Yes, he is.

256
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,200
I hope to meet him someday.

257
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,520
Is it okay if I bring him here to visit you next time?

258
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,870
Please do.

259
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,900
Thank you very much.

260
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,970
<i>I'm now a mother with a child.</i>

261
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,990
You're hungry, aren't you?

262
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,680
<i>There's no way I can hear your voice</i>

263
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,330
<i>or see your face anymore.</i>

264
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,830
What's up, Makoto?

265
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,400
<i>Miwa-san, wanna go out for lunch with me this Saturday?</i>

266
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,890
What?

267
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,790
<i>Mummies need to go out for some fresh air once in a while.</i>

268
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,420
But I have to take care of Shiori,

269
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,290
so I can't afford to go out for meals yet.

270
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,460
<i>I've found a babysitter for you.</i>

271
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,260
Babysitter?

272
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,590
Fuyutsuki?

273
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,640
It's over.

274
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,470
What?

275
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,250
Everything is over.

276
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,830
Life goes on. You know that, right?

277
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:28,990
"We'll just start from scratch again if we fail." I wonder who always says that.

278
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,510
Who said that?

279
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,820
Someone who's honest to a tee

280
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,630
and a little troublesome.

281
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,820
Let's move on.

282
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,660
Hiroki?

283
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,500
Sorry, did I wake you up?

284
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,660
What are you doing?

285
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,400
I figured we can eat it tomorrow if I prepare in advance.

286
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,430
But I haven't done this for so long,

287
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,420
so it's proving to be quite challenging.

288
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,340
<i>Welcome back.</i>

289
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,890
<i>- What?
- Miwa, I'm making your favorite cream stew right now.</i>

290
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,880
<i>You've been rather tired lately, haven't you?</i>

291
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,730
<i>At times like this, you must eat well and sleep well.</i>

292
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,090
<i>- But Hiroki, you're busy with work too, no?
- It's fine.</i>

293
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,150
<i>Wait, it's not what you think.</i>

294
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,020
<i>I haven't cleaned up yet, so it just looks a little dirty.</i>

295
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,650
<i>- It looks messy.
- I did cut them, though.</i>

296
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,440
<i>It's okay. I like it the way it is.</i>

297
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,250
<i>Eating the stew you cook will perk up my day, Hiroki.</i>

298
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,400
<i>- Is this okay?
- I think you should cut it down further.</i>

299
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,330
It's still messy as always.

300
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,620
Sorry.

301
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,980
Thank you.

302
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,020
Miwa, listen.

303
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,840
You see...

304
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,990
I treasure the moments we have together right now.

305
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,220
I should have listened to what you said

306
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,430
and considered having children earlier.

307
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,360
I'm really sorry for everything.

308
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,840
It's a wonderful thing to start a family, isn't it?

309
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,260
Yeah.

310
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,650
Thanks to Shiori,

311
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,330
I'm able to smile the way I do now.

312
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:57,300
I'm grateful, both to Shiori and to you.

313
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,660
I...

314
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,350
I love you, Miwa.

315
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,790
Miwa?

316
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,790
Sorry.

317
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,380
Don't be.

318
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,380
I said that all of a sudden, you must be...

319
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,160
Thank you.

320
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,690
I'm feeling kind of hungry.

321
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,780
Shall we eat a little?

322
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,880
I wonder if I have prepared everything.

323
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,040
You've been helping me a lot lately...

324
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,190
Even mothers need to have a break sometimes.

325
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,090
Shiori won't like it if Mommy feels down, right?

326
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,840
Oh, right! What about the milk feeds?

327
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,450
It's fine. Leave it to me.

328
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,550
Makoto-chan is also looking forward to meeting you. Hurry up and go.

329
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,370
- Okay...
- Take your time.

330
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,410
Thank you.

331
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,110
I'll be back.

332
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,840
- Say bye-bye.
- See you.

333
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,580
See you back home.

334
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,450
- Hello.
- Miwa-san!

335
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,480
- Hello.
- I have a last-minute meeting later.

336
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,600
Can you wait for me?

337
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,450
- Sure, no problem.
- So sorry.

338
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,970
I have a herbal tea to recommend.

339
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,160
- Shin-chan!
- Yes?

340
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,880
- One chamomile herb tea for Miwa-san.
- Sure, right away.

341
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,030
Miwa-san, just tell me about anything under the sun.

342
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,920
Though you and I have an age gap, I consider you a dear friend.

343
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,240
So, just tell me whatever's on your mind.

344
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,810
- Say, Makoto.
- Yes?

345
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:50,670
What will you do if something you thought you lost suddenly appeared?

346
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,980
What? Simple.

347
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,240
I'll make sure I won't lose it ever again.

348
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,180
What if I already have something important to me

349
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,900
and that thing can no longer be within my reach?

350
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,700
You came across a present from your ex-boyfriend?

351
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,630
No, it's not that.

352
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,640
You've found something new that's important to you,

353
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,130
but I'm sure there's also value in the thing that you once lost.

354
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,010
So, I'll be thankful for that while saying goodbye to it.

355
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,710
Say goodbye?

356
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,610
If that present is bothering you, I can take it from you.

357
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,350
I don't mean that.

358
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,560
Good afternoon.

359
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,680
- Hello.
- Sorry I'm late.

360
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,790
No worries. Please have a seat.

361
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,780
Over here, please.

362
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,240
Sure.

363
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,980
- Let me get you a drink.
- Thank you.

364
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,780
Fair trade, you said?

365
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,380
That's right.

366
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:39,000
We are wondering whether you could carry our products in your store.

367
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,140
These are the coffee beans handled by our company.

368
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,240
- Sorry for disturbing you the other day.
- They're from Africa...

369
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,140
Oh, it's fine.

370
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,020
Your baby was really adorable.

371
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,760
It feels comforting to see your baby's face.

372
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,430
What's the matter?

373
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,810
Sorry.

374
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,600
The coffee's flavor changes depending on how you brew it...

375
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,900
Is your husband taking care of the baby today?

376
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,460
- Y-Yes.
- I see.

377
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,120
What a great daddy indeed.

378
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,960
Perhaps we can discuss further after you bring the samples over for me to take a look.

379
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,190
Fuyutsuki-san?

380
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,040
Oh, that would be great.

381
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,290
So sorry that I was late for our appointment.

382
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,840
Don't worry. We will contact you again.

383
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,780
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

384
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,860
- I shall take my leave then.
- Sure.

385
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,310
Thank you. See you again.

386
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:19,100
I'll be ready in a minute, so just a little while longer, okay?

387
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,890
Miwa-san, are you worried about Shiori?

388
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,540
We can have a meal next time then.

389
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,070
Sorry.

390
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:41,600
Don't be. I'm sure Shiori-chan misses her mommy, too.

391
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,030
- I'm really sorry.
- No problem.

392
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,620
What's wrong?

393
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,820
I guess she can't help it.

394
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,290
Moms tend to feel anxious when they're away from their babies.

395
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,550
I see.

396
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,850
Oh no! I forgot to pass this to her!

397
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,130
Do you think I can catch her?

398
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,640
Maybe if you run?

399
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,700
Fuyutsuki-kun, sorry. Where are you now?

400
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,440
Thank you.

401
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,730
I didn't think we would ever meet again.

402
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,890
That store belongs to my friend.

403
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,230
I see.

404
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,690
I'm sorry for how I reacted that day.

405
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,360
You suddenly appeared at the library...

406
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,330
and I didn't know what to do.

407
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,850
Don't be.

408
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,220
I'm sorry for doing that to you.

409
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,150
I didn't answer your call

410
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,330
or meet you.

411
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,040
I couldn't clarify things with you,

412
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,580
but I felt that I should give you a proper explanation.

413
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,490
You see...

414
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,940
I've given birth to a baby.

415
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,070
I've patched things up with my husband.

416
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,900
I want to

417
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,450
cherish this child and the family I have now.

418
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,790
So...

419
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,460
I'm sorry.

420
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,100
It's fine, as long as you're happy, Natsuno.

421
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,440
When I was on the brink of death,

422
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,440
a thought flashed through my mind.

423
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,190
Meeting you again was the best gift that God has given me.

424
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,440
So, thank you.

425
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,230
Be it back then or right now,

426
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,720
you've come to my rescue time and again, Fuyutsuki-kun.

427
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,030
Whenever the going gets tough,

428
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,230
you've always cheered me up.

429
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:01,440
You don't know how thankful I am to you for saving me.

430
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,590
You...

431
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,900
