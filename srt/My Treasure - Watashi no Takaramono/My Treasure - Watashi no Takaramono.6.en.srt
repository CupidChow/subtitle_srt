You did it, right? As expected.

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,720
Everyone at the farm was really nice.

18
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,250
I was the one who kept getting help from them.

19
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,690
­Okay.

20
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,330
So, our supply has been settled.

21
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,800
Yeah.

22

I bought you breakfast.

- Wow, it's been a month since I had Japanese food!

25
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,830

26
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,960

27

35
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,000
Risa, about what you said at the pedestrian bridge that day...

36
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,290
Oh, I told you I like you as a coworker.

37
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,580
Seriously, don't be too bothered by it.

38
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,910
I want to give a proper answer to your feelings, Risa.

39
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:10,200
So, please give me some time to think about it.

40
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,610
Will things change if you have time to think?

41
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,720
I don't think there's only one absolute way to fall in love with someone.

42

What's so funny?

43
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,690
Fuyutsuki, you really can't lie at all, can you? Not to others, nor to yourself.

44
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,770
I understand.

45
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,970
Take your time to think.

46
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,720
I'll wait.

47
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,140
Okay.

48
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,170
Let's go once you're done eating.

49
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,740

50
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,410
S-Sure.

<i>The number you have called is currently unavailable...</i>

52
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,350

53
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,820
Hello? I'm the wife of Kanzaki Hiroki.

54
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,880
Excuse me, we are looking for Kanzaki-san from the Investment Division.

55
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,320
- One moment, please.
- Sure.

56
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,500
Shino-san, Kanzaki-san's wife just called.

57
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,190
- What's up?
- She also couldn't get through to him.

58
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,780
She sounded rather flustered.

59
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,670
Is that so?

60
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,780
- I hope he isn't involved in an accident or something.
- Yeah.

61
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,300
What?

62
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,090
Hello?

63
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,110
Miwa-san, you're on the first shift today, remember?

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,920
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,560
Hiroki and Shiori are nowhere to be found, so...

66
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,140
What?

67
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,410
You're hungry?

68
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,540
Sorry, sweetie.

69
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,490
Sorry, sorry.

70
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,660
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

71
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,750
Can I have a coffee and warm milk, please?

72
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,430
Sure, no problem.

73
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,680
Thank you.

74
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,390
My, she's adorable.

75
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,100
How old is she?

76
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,130
She's six months old.

77
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,550
On an outing with your daddy? How nice.

78
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,510
Reminds me of how adorable our daughter was when she was this age.

79
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,740
People used to tell me she was looking more and more like me.

80
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,800
Alas, she's getting married next month.

81
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,730
Fathers will always have a soft spot for their daughters.

82
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,520
Right, my dear?

83
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,620
You must be hungry. Sorry, sweetie.

84
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,060
Daddy totally forgot about that.

85
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,000
There, there.

86
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,130

90
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,120

91
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,560

92

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

93
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,290
Sorry, it feels like I'm making a big deal out of it.

94
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,500
Miwa-san, what are you planning to do?

95
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,300
I don't know where I should start looking.

96
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,800
I really don't understand Hiroki at all.

97
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,180
I believe you have an idea

98
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,940
of why Hiroki disappeared, Miwa-san.

99
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,190
Whose child...

100
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,720
is Shiori-chan?

101
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,490
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

102
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,050
I saw you and Fuyutsuki-san together

103
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,710
at the residential park that day.

104
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,170
- Wait a minute, Makoto-
- You're having an affair,

105
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,640
and I told Hiroki-san

106
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,580
that it's hard to tell whose child Shiori-chan is.

107
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,950
Why did you do such a thing?

108
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,690
Hiroki-san told me that this is the happiest time of his life.

109
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,160
He told me not to tell you

110
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,160
how tough it was for him at work.

111
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,520
Miwa-san, you're the one

112
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,460
whom he cares about the most.

113
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,290
But instead, you cheated on him with Fuyutsuki-san.

114
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,530
How dare the two of you do this behind his back!

115
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,100
You're terrible...

116
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,530
Fuyutsuki-kun doesn't know anything about this.

117
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,970
I was the one who lied to Hiroki.

118
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,890
I decided to do this on my own.

119
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,430
You're still covering up for your lover?

120
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,950
- Like I said-
- You're unbelievable.

121
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,760
I feel so sorry for Hiroki-san.

122
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,310
If anything happens to Hiroki-san and Shiori-chan,

123
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,460
it will be all your fault.

124
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,710

125
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,570
Yeah.

126
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,560
Wanna have a meal together?

127
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,270
Let's celebrate.

128
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,710
Celebrate?

129
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,740
It's been six months since we started Tri Ambition. A half‑birthday of sorts.

130
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,250
How about the restaurant near the university? It's been a while since we went there.

131
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,810
Sure, let's do that.

132
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,380
Or maybe you're tired since you just flew back and all.

133
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,260

134
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,160

138
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,090
Oh, what's up?

139
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,430
I couldn't get him on the phone.

140
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,310
Well, isn't it because you've been dumped by him?

141
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,570
Hiroki-san has disappeared with his child.

142
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,060

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,700

to meddle in another couple's business.

150
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,450

- I'm just-
- There's a limit to trying to be righteous.

152

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,330

<i>Well... I-</i>

188
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,450
What the hell are you doing? Feeling lonely, right?

189
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,450
Get your butt over for some coffee.

190
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,750
I...

191
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,040
I was about to do something stupid.

192
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,320
I was planning...

193
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,520
to drown myself and Shiori in the sea.

194
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,960
I figured that if we were ever reborn,

195
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,190
we'd be father and child for real.

196
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,790
I see.

197
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,380
Have you calmed down a little now?

198
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,870
Yes.

199
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,750
<i>Then quickly go home.</i>

200
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,840
<i>Nothing will change by hanging around over there.</i>

201
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,820
It's okay to make a detour,

202
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,370
but if you go too far out, you'll never be able to come back.

203
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,890
<i>You won't find an answer no matter where you go.</i>

204
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,040
Hiroki-

205
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,620
I fed her milk an hour ago.

206
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,430
I'm going to work.

207
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Try to get them to consider by expanding their options

208
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,840
to see if they are open to using M&A as an exit strategy.

209
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,880
Got it. Thank you.

210
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,920
- Next.
- Okay.

211
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,500
Regarding Team 2's Nine Pharmaceuticals...

212
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,590
- I wonder what happened to him yesterday.
- That's true.

213
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,120
While the business details are conveyed clearly, the returns are not concrete enough.

214
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,400
I believe the investment committee will be more convinced if the synergies are clear.

215
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,990
Okay, you can keep it.

216
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,050
Hello, this is the Kanzaki's residence.

217
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,990
Okay, sure.

218
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,200
<i>[Nekoyanagi - We Are Open!]</i>

219
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,570
The hospital called me regarding my mom.

220
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,160
I hope you can help look after Shiori while I'm away.

221
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,060
I tried looking around, but couldn't find anywhere suitable.

222
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,210
You're the only one I can entrust her with, Makoto.

223
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
All right.

224
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,800
The baby is innocent, after all.

225
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,730
Thank you.

226
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,360
Makoto...

227
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,980
I will give you a proper explanation

228
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,030
after I've spoken with Hiroki.

229
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,420
For now,

230
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,980
thank you for your help.

231
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,970
We're back.

232
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,580
- Welcome back.
- You're taking care of Shiori-chan?

233
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,730
- Yeah.
- Look, Shiori-chan is here.

234
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,900
Shiori-chan is really tiny.

235
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,100
Yeah, she is.

236
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,390
Kota, you were like her once,

237
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,630
so small and tiny.

238
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,800
Does Shiori-chan have a daddy?

239
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,520
Come on, Kota-kun. Shall we play?

240
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,200
What shall we play? Come here.

241
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,610
Let's transform, let's transform!

242
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,860
Transform?

243
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,190
Okay.

244
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,810
Transform!

245
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,660
How about that? Try it.

246
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,950
He's been curious about his daddy lately.

247
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,850
You aren't letting Kota-kun meet his dad?

248
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,450
He hasn't done a single thing for Kota as a father,

249
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,950
and he doesn't want to meet his son.

250
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,370
I see.

251
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,400
A father who doesn't know anything about his child...

252
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,210
That's just too...

253
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,220
Hello, this is Fuyutsuki.

254
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,390
I'm famished.

255
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,720
Let's go in.

256
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,520
What's wrong?

257
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,090
I'm sorry, Risa.

258
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,890
What?

259
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,430
There's somewhere I have to go to.

260
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,270
I'm really sorry.

261
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,040
I wanted to see Shiori-chan...

262
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,480
I'll bring her here next time.

263
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,820
Is there anything you need?

264
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,120
I'll get it for you downstairs.

265
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,780
Miwa.

266
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,530
The test results are out, aren't they?

267
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,120
Thank you.

268
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:58,680
You've spoken with the doctor, right?

269
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,400
Mom, you see...

270
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,820
I don't have much longer to live, do I?

271
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,830
I know that very well.

272
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,350
This is more than enough for me.

273
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:21,060
I also managed to meet Shiori-chan.

274
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,500
Mom, please don't say such things.

275
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,220
No.

276
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,030
Let me say it.

277
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,470
I've lived a happy life.

278
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,840
It's all thanks to you, Miwa.

279
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,070
So, thank you.

280
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,900
Shinozaki, can I leave today's dinner meeting to you?

281
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,930
Yeah, sure, no problem.

282
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,530
Are you still feeling unwell, Kanzaki-san?

283
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:13,790
No, but I have something on. Thanks for covering.

The one whom you should have a proper conversation with...

288
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,440
is not me, but Fuyutsuki-san, right?

289
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,250
Don't you also have a responsibility toward him?

290
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,560
I invited Fuyutsuki-san over because he also has something to ask you.

291
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,180
Please ask Miwa-san directly.

292
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,610
I'm heading out for a bit.

293
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,030
Wait, Makoto...

294
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,680
Sorry for the sudden visit.

295
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,190
I heard from Komori-san.

296
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,410
She said you're having a hard time, Natsuno.

297
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,560
What happened?

298
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,040
It has nothing to do with you, Fuyutsuki-kun.

299
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,210
Did it happen because of me?

300
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,800
If there's anything I can do...

301
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,960
This is a problem between me and my husband.

302
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,400
It has nothing to do with you, Fuyutsuki-kun.

303
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,780
But...

304
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,790
There's nothing you can do for me.

305
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,490
Please leave.

306
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,110
Don't ever come here again.

307
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,210
Thank you for inviting me.

308
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,060
Why didn't you tell Fuyutsuki-san the truth?

309
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,940
Please stop trying to drag him into this.

310
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,800
Are you going to hide the truth from him forever?

311
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,900
What will you do if Shiori-chan happens to find out the truth?

312
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,360
I'll keep hiding it.

313
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,110
But still...

314
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,440
Even if they find out,

315
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,470
I'll bear full responsibility when the time comes.

316
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,870
This is solely my sin to bear.

317
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,780
I'll carry that burden for the rest of my life.

318
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,050
I'm the one who's at fault.

319
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,140
Risa.

320
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,300
I'm sorry about today.

321
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,500
It's fine.

322
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,340
Where did you go?

323
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,350
Say, Fuyutsuki...

324
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,400
you used to tell me about everything, right?

325
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,570
But you've been keeping everything from me lately.

326
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,290
You already have an answer for me, no?

327
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,140
I mean...

328
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,950
Risa, I will give you a proper...

329
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,040
You're a really bad liar.

330
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,420
There's only one way to fall in love with someone, after all.

331
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,290
Our feelings for each other will never be mutual.

332
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,260
I can't do this anymore.

333
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,550
It's too hard to bear.

334
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,830
Welcome back.

335
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,540
Sorry for leaving home without a word yesterday.

336
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,110
You must have been worried sick.

337
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,260
Things were happening too fast, it was hard to believe.

338
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,380
I'm sorry.

339
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:44,270
So, it's true, right? About Shiori.

340
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,010
I'm going to say something selfish.

341
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,660
I'm going to tell you how I truly feel.

342
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,650
Shiori...

343
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,220
I truly feel that Shiori is your child, Hiroki.

344
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:17,050
Those words are the most painful to hear.

345
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,440
But that's how I feel.

346
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,030
You're really cruel, Miwa.

347
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:35,540
Why did you... do such a thing?

348
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,960
I'm not sure when it started,

349
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,060
but I grew afraid of you, Hiroki.

350
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,900
It felt suffocating when we were together.

351
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,530
Then I betrayed you.

352
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,020
I later found out I was pregnant,

353
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,360
and wondered if I should... No, I shouldn't be giving birth to this baby.

354
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,050
But then...

355
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,700
I wanted to give birth to her, no matter what.

356
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,030
I couldn't bring myself to abort her.

357
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,090
I even thought about divorce.

358
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,000
But...

359
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,010
I won't survive on my own.

360
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,530
<i>I won't interfere in how you raise the child.</i>

361
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,870
<i>But I'll pay for everything.</i>

362
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,410
<i>I'm not able to be a father to the baby.</i>

363
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,040
<i>Sorry.</i>

364
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,280
That's why I went ahead with your suggestion, Hiroki.

365
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,830
After Shiori was born,

366
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,530
you changed the way you treated me

367
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:06,170
and went back to being the kind Hiroki that you were before.

368
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,610
I was at a loss,

369
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,820
but I was happy.

370
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,800
I know an apology alone won't make you forgive me.

371
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,690
This isn't something for me to decide.

372
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,200
But you see,

373
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,690
I...

374
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,340
I want to spend the rest of my life together with you and Shiori, Hiroki.

375
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,910
I have one question for you.

376
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,410
What is it?

377
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,370
Who is Shiori's father?

378
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,420
You can't answer me?

379
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,550
Miwa.

380
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,630
Get out of this house right now.

381
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,970
Hiroki...

382
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,670
- There's somewhere you want to be, right?
- What?

383
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,370
The fact that you're hiding his identity

384
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,000
means that he's someone important to you, no?

385
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,710
- You're wrong.
- Why...

386
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:11,120
Why did you lie that she's my child?

387
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,020
You could have just raised her together with him.

388
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,920
Why...

389
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,980
Miwa.

390
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,430
Please.

391
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,590
I can't be with you, Miwa.

392
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,840
What about Shiori?

393
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,540
I'm Shiori's father.

394
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,140
I'd rather die with Shiori

395
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,430
than leave her.

396
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,630
Please.

397
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,320
Get out of this house.

398
