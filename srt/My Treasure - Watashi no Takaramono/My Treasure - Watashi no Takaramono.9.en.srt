00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,180
<i>You're married</i>

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,680
<i>and have a husband and a child.</i>

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,530
<i>Despite that, you had an affair with Fuyutsuki.</i>

4
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,610
<i>I...</i>

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,170
<i>cannot forgive you.</i>

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,340
You don't know how much Fuyutsuki suffered.

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,900
Did he always save you?

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,060
So many things in the world you didn't know about.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,070
Don't be ridiculous.

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,690
What nonsense are you talking about?

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,060
It's disgusting.

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,950
It's nothing but a filthy affair, right?

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,300
Don't you have any shame at all?

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,710
You have a child, for goodness' sake!

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,450
How disgraceful.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,530
I pity your child.

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
the Hidden Desires 🤫💖 Team@viki.com</i>

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,830
What on earth are you talking about?

19
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,540
Did you even listen to what I said?

20
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,070
Fuyutsuki-san is a friend from my days in junior high.

21
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,230
I'm an ordinary housewife who only commutes between the supermarket and my home.

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,660
He showed me the enjoyment of working at the flea market

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,040
and saved me from boredom.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,720
Nothing more, nothing less.

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,140
- Don't try to divert-
- How does that become an affair?

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,190
A promise to be together? What are you talking about?

27
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,880
- Are you going to play dumb?
- I was supposed to meet a client of my husband's,

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,640
so I figured I'd try to be as polite as possible.

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,350
To be honest, this is becoming a nuisance to me.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,530
Fuyutsuki cares about you so much,

31
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,010
but you...

32
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,960
You love Fuyutsuki-san very much, don't you?

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,300
Are you jealous?

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,380
I don't know what kind of misunderstanding you might have,

35
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,220
but if you feel that way, shouldn't you speak to Fuyutsuki-san directly

36
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,720
before coming to me to complain?

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,280
He's someone precious to you, isn't he?

38
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,100
Just because you can't do that,

39
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,470
don't drag me into your lame jealousy!

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,370
Don't you think it's disgraceful?

41
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,180
You're the worst.

42
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,320
I wish you and Fuyutsuki-san happiness.

43
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,220
You're downright terrible.

44
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,080
<i>That's right.</i>

45
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,960
<i>I'm the worst kind of woman.</i>

46
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:37,470
<i>[My Precious]
[Episode 9]</i>

47
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,570
I suspect you're the man my wife had an affair with, Fuyutsuki-san.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,780
I heard that you invited my wife to the flea market

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,120
and hid that fact.

50
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,670
You two have been good friends since junior high, right?

51
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,220
Didn't you notice her family name, Kanzaki?

52
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,680
My wife's maiden name is Natsuno.

53
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,590
Natsuno Miwa.

54
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,840
The one she had an affair with...

55
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,540
was you, right?

56
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,960
Did it bring back memories of your first love in junior high?

57
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,360
We often hear such stories, don't we?

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,620
Two people reunite at a class gathering and get caught up in the moment.

59
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,710
Did you have a great time reminiscing with each other?

60
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,240
What's with that look?

61
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,270
You're wrong.

62
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,210
About what?

63
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,400
Tell me.

64
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,110
Natsuno...

65
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,650
The Natsuno from junior high

66
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,120
was always smiling without holding back.

67
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,190
Her smile was beautiful then.

68
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,580
However,

69
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,570
the Natsuno I met again

70
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,070
couldn't smile properly.

71
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,540
She looked as if she were cornered, unable to feel pain.

72
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,590
Her heart was crying,

73
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,620
and she looked battered.

74
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,400
That's why...

75
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,570
I know I have done something wrong.

76
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,440
But I wanted to save her, no matter what.

77
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,700
But now...

78
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,090
things between us have ended.

79
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,990
Don't end it on your own!

80
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,840
That child...

81
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,170
What will happen to Shiori, then?

82
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,630
Shiori?

83
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,100
You don't know?

84
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,230
What's going on?

85
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,630
Leave.

86
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,800
Oh, what happened, sweetie?

87
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,070
All right, all right...

88
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,760
What's wrong?

89
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,420
There, there.

90
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,710
There, now.

91
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,740
It's okay, it's okay.

92
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,540
<i>Come on, try carrying her.</i>

93
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,440
<i>- No, it's fine.
- Come, carry her.</i>

94
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,080
<i>Stop!</i>

95
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,110
<i>Sorry.</i>

96
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,520
<i>You really don't know what's going on with Miwa-san?</i>

97
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,510
<i>You are...</i>

98
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,980
It's okay, sweetie.

99
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,070
<i>I've finally come to a realization.</i>

100
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,640
<i>What I did was engage in a filthy affair.</i>

101
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,350
<i>I'm such an idiot for trying to turn it into a beautiful memory.</i>

102
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,110
<i>I have no right to consider Hiroki's feelings.</i>

103
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
<i>I'm only hurting Hiroki</i>

104
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,740
<i>by glossing everything over.</i>

105
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,950
<i>[Abe-san from Angel Sitter: Since your wife has returned home, I have handed over your child.]</i>

106
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,970
<i>[Your wife has signed the report and received a copy.]</i>

107
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,440
<i>I mustn't be greedy.</i>

108
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,610
<i>There's only one thing that can truly be mine.</i>

109
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,260
Thank you so much.

110
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,140
- We'll visit again.
- Sure, thank you.

111
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,790
Welcome.

112
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,400
Sorry.

113
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,930
There's something I need to ask you.

114
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,290
Is it about Miwa-san?

115
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,990
Yes.

116
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,020
I've passed your letter to Miwa-san.

117
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,330
There's nothing else I can help you with.

118
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,920
I want to ask you about Natsuno's baby.

119
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,360
- Well...
- You were about to tell me something that day.

120
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,520
Well...

121
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,840
I'm sure Natsuno won't tell me anything, even if I ask her.

122
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,670
There's no way she would tell me.

123
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,690
But I can't just let this slide.

124
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,120
I don't know what misunderstanding you might have,

125
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,120
but I don't know anything.

126
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,390
Fuyutsuki-san!

127
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,390
Fuyutsuki-san, I'm sorry.

128
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,700
You see,

129
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,540
I've overstepped the line and done many unnecessary things.

130
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,370
But right now,

131
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,580
I've decided not to meddle in anything.

132
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:20,060
If you really want to protect Miwa-san,

133
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,020
please don't get yourself involved any further.

134
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,900
I beg of you.

135
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,430
Hiroki,

136
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,490
I want to speak to you about the divorce.

137
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,180
If you don't want to talk to me,

138
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,200
you can have a lawyer speak with me.

139
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,610
I cannot live without Shiori.

140
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,760
I know it'll take some time, but I will also pay you compensation.

141
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,460
I'll let you meet Shiori whenever you wish.

142
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Makoto.

143
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,010
Yes?

144
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,530
I wish to resign from my job here.

145
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,270
I need to think about the future,

146
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,320
so I plan to get a full-time job.

147
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,910
I understand.

148
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,410
I've been relying on you all this time.

149
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,740
Though I said I'd wait for Hiroki's answer,

150
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,980
I'm only making him suffer.

151
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,970
If this goes on,

152
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,810
I'll only hurt Hiroki further.

153
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,820
What about Shiori-chan?

154
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,860
If Hiroki wants to see Shiori,

155
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,310
I'll let them meet, of course.

156
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,070
In any case,

157
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,490
I have to leave Hiroki.

158
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,630
<i>[You have one new message.]­</i>

159
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,230
<i>[This is Kanzaki from Mitsukura Corporation]</i>

<i>[...will be withheld]</i>

Here is a list of the top 30 corporate growth rates.

164
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,690
Thanks.

165
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,170
The lower lineup has undergone major changes...

166
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,160
Excuse me.

167
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,910
Hello?

168
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,430
<i>This is Fuyutsuki from Tri Ambition.</i>

169
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,500
I'm calling regarding the loan.

170
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,250
<i>Sure.</i>

171
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,530
Why did you withhold the loan?

172
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,710
The company decided based on a comprehensive assessment.

173
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,300
<i>The conditions should have been met.</i>

174
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,120
This decision came after several reviews.

175
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,260
<i>What's the reason for the rejection?</i>

176
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,200
Is it personal?

177
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,250
It's a matter of trust.

178
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,050
<i>Trust?</i>

179
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,890
People who lie cannot be trusted.

180
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,350
<i>If you'll excuse me.</i>

- That's not like you.
- What?

182
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,480
I've been learning the ropes from you, so I was looking through the documents, Kanzaki-san.

183
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,330
Why did you withdraw the loan to Tri Ambition?

184
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,000
This decision came after various thorough reviews.

185
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,770
But if we scrap everything at this point, this company will be in deep trouble, right?

186
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,730
It seems they're already midway through various projects.

187
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,870
Shino-san, your client is here to meet you.

188
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,170
Okay.

189
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,410
- Are the documents ready?
- Yes, they're ready.

<i>[Tri Ambition]</i>

191
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,800
But it's strange that they'd pull out at this point.

192
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,050
I thought the deal was almost finalized.

193
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,520
Forget it.

194
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,020
Why?

195
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,640
Wait...

196
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,090
Could it be that...

197
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,940
Kanzaki-san told you something?

198
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,000
I...

199
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,660
I went to look for Kanzaki Miwa-san.

200
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,620
That's why the loan was...

201
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,290
I might be the one who caused this.

202
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,610
Why on earth did you meet her?

203
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,120
What did you do that for?

204
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,720
I wanted to know what kind of person she is, Fuyutsuki.

205
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,940
Stop all this nonsense!

206
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,420
This is none of your business, Risa.

207
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,070
Don't cause any more trouble for Natsuno.

208
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,030
She's the one causing trouble. She had an affair!

209
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,270
What is it about her that attracted you?

210
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,040
You fancy her saying sweet talk like "turning them into memories."

211
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,450
You don't understand, Risa!

212
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,000
Stop intruding into my precious things.

213
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,700
<i>Wow, it's rare to see you in a suit.</i>

214
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,440
I haven't worn one in a while.

215
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,700
You look good in it.

216
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,070
Good luck with your job hunt.

- Good morning, Shiori-chan.
- Good morning.

218
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,330
I'll look for a nursery to take care of her next time.

What are you talking about?

220
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,300
Raising a child on your own isn't that simple.

00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,990
This is not the time to hold back.

222
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,800
For me, I have my parents, Shin-chan,

To put it bluntly,

225
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,010
I use whatever help I can find.

226
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,040
Isn't that what it means

227
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,650

228
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,730

- Yes, sir.

What?

252

At that moment,

I didn't want anyone to take Fuyutsuki away.

But what I did was absolutely wrong.

I'm really very sorry.

00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,290
Maybe it was my brother who made you say that.

You know my brother is the world's biggest busybody, right?

290

<i>I think they're perfect for each other.</i>

296
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,170
<i>It's kind of frustrating to watch them.</i>

297
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,110
<i>Stop it. That's the most annoying thing to do.</i>

298
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,360
<i>What? But then...</i>

299
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,450
<i>Do you know what they call people like you?</i>

300
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,130
<i>- Love's cupid?
- Busybody.</i>

301
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,930
<i>Hey, but I'm the cupid.</i>

302
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,170
<i>No, you're just a busybody.</i>

303
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:49,360
He's really a busybody, right?

304
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,450
He was always rooting for both of you.

305
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,830
A love that needs people to root for it is lame, right?

306
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,740
Really?

307
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,770
Really? My brother knows you two best, and he was rooting for both of you.

308
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,030
That is not lame.

309
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:15,540
I think he wanted you two to be happy.

310
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,300
That's why

311
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,960
my brother in heaven probably did something unnecessary.

312
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,490

I don't think we'll ever meet again,

so I just wanted to tell you this.

316
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,990
I may have said some things that day,

317
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,330
but Natsuno doesn't have me

318
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,980
in her heart.

319
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,480
Her heart only has you and the baby.

320
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,950
She told me that she wanted to make her current family a happy one.

321
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:32,430
You and the baby are precious to her.

322
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,840
I...

323
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,880
I wasn't able to save Natsuno.

324
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,360
The one who saved her

325
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,480
was you.

326
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,980
The one who truly got her heart back

327
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,870
is you.

I...

329
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,180
have done something unnecessary.

330
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,530
I'm really very sorry.

331
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,680

332
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,130

Miwa, you're supposed to go for procedures for your mom's grave tomorrow, right?

334
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,100
I'll get Makoto to help look after Shiori.

335
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,780
I'll take the day off.

336
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,680
I'll drive you there.

337

338
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,680

339
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,760
Sure.

340
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,140
I wanted to talk to you.

341
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,350
Okay.

342
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,610
That day when I left home with Shiori,

343
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,110
I was planning to drown both of us in the sea.

344
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,980
What?

345
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,400
If I can't be Shiori's father,

346
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,950
I thought I might as well die with her.

347
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,240
You see,

348
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,410
I hadn't been able to move on since then.

349
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,920
Miwa,

350
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,410
I want you to tell me everything.

351
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,820
Just so you know,

352
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,430
I met up with Fuyutsuki-san.

353
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,830
What do you mean by that?

354
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,420
I also know that you two have been friends since junior high,

355
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,940
and that...

356
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,490
he saved you when you were suffering.

357
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,570
I want to hear it from you, Miwa.

358
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,530
Why did you hide his identity?

359
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,960
You wanted to protect him?

360
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,560
That was part of it.

361
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,470
When I found out I was pregnant,

362
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,220
I saw the news of his death.

363
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,260
I only found out he was alive

364
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,900
after I gave birth to the baby.

365
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,650
But by then, I had already decided

366
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:02,290
that I wanted to be with you and Shiori, Hiroki.

367
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,410
I decided not to say anything,

368
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,990
as I figured it would cause him trouble.

369
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,410
So, all this while...

370
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,900
But...

371
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,190
that wasn't the only thing I feared.

372
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,160
If I told you about him,

373
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,170
I was afraid

374
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,490
your love for Shiori would change, Hiroki.

375
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,260
Besides,

376
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,350
the name you gave the baby...

377
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,650
Shiori?

378
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:08,220
The embroidered bookmark in the mother-child health booklet...

379
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,190
That...

380
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,540
That embroidered bookmark*...
<i>(T/N: "Shiori" also means "bookmark" in Japanese)</i>

381
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,400
was a memory I had of him.

382
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,990
When you thought of that name for the baby,

383
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,170
I should have rejected it,

384
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,520
but I couldn't.

385
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,820
I genuinely felt it was a beautiful name

386
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,250
because that child

387
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,250
had also become my guiding post.

388
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,720
So, I couldn't bring myself to reject that name.

389
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,300
I'm really sorry.

390
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,520
Because of the sin I committed,

391
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,370
I hurt everyone.

392
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,330
Even so, I was still being nice to myself.

393
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,150
I had done something wrong,

394
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,250
but I didn't regret it,

395
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,120
because if all this hadn't happened,

396
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,630
I wouldn't have met Shiori.

397
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,260
Thank you for telling me.

398
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,920
I'll have my lawyer speak with you about how we should move forward.

399
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,470
Okay.

400
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,500
Make sure Shiori is happy.

401
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,170
I will.

402
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,090
Regarding the division of assets, let's do it this way.
<i>[SYK General Law Office]</i>

403
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,640
Okay.

404
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,900
The next one will be this.

405
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:02,460
Regarding future meetings with your child, what is your preference?
<i>[Arrangements regarding custody of children]</i>

406
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,160
For future meetings...

407
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,940
Do you want a fixed number of days every month to meet your child,

408
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,240
or do you prefer to meet your child whenever you wish?

409
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,990
<i>[Cafe TOCA - Open]</i>

410
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,570
<i>I'm staying at a place for now.</i>

411
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,540
Things have finally settled a little, right?

412
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,480
After leaving the house and living on my own,

413
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,940
I felt more at ease.

414
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,650
Well, you can't just up and move on so easily.

415
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,930
Yeah.

416
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:39,950
Probably what's left will be only good memories.

417
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:47,020
It's hard to find a place for such memories, right?

418
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,890
What do you think we should do with the things that are precious to us?

419
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,320
Keeping them here will cause you damage, too.

420
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,460
It's hard, right?

421
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:20,610
This place feels kind of empty now, don't you think?

422
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,730
Once I'm done with the arrangements, I'll also move out of here.

423
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,490
There are too many memories here.

424
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,800
You're right.

425
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,160
Thank you.

426
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,370
Sorry, excuse me for a bit.
