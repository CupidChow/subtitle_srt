00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,700
<i>What were those tears for?</i>

3
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,850
<i>Did Hiroki</i>

4
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,500
<i>actually want to meet this child?</i>

5
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,600
Oh, she's so tiny!

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,060
My boy was like that once.

7
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,010
But this will only last for a brief moment, okay?

8
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,240
She'll grow up before we know it.

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,350
Why isn't Hiroki-san here?

10
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,690
He's gonna miss such angelic moments.

11
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,130
He's busy with work.

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,040
Is he feeling unwell or something?

13
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,300
You mean Hiroki?

14
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,110
Not that I know of.

15
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,030
Then that's good.

16
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,400
He really has his hands full with work, right?

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,000
Your house might be messy when you go back home.

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,880
Sorry to make you take time out of your busy schedule, Makoto.

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,500
No worries.

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,450
Oh, right.

21
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,240
Have you come up with her name?

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,120
Not yet.

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,010
You can't make up your mind?

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,370
It's hard to settle on a nice name.

25
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,200
True, especially since it's her first present after she's born.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,140
You're right.

27
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,740
A once-in-a-lifetime present.

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,190
That's why Daddy should devote his energy to thinking about your name!

29
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,990
Hang on a sec.

30
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,070
I'm going downstairs to replenish some stuff.

31
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,630
- Sorry to trouble you.
- Did I forget anything?

32
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,050
- Thank you.
- I'll be right back!

33
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,780
See you.

34
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,800
Daddy...

35
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,740
You're such a crybaby.

36
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,610
I'm surprised, I didn't know I'd cry like that in public.

37
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,880
Like I said, you won't know until the baby is born.

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,630
Right?

39
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,490
A woman's tears are riddled with lies.

40
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,520
But a man's tears will never lie.

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,330
What do you mean by that?

42
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,420
What I mean is, don't forget that moment you cried.

43
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,640
I doubt you ever will.

44
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,050
But I can't be a father to the baby.

45
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,860
What do you mean by "can't"? That's your child.

46
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,700
You heard her cry when she was born, right?

47
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,790
Being a father might have already started at that moment.

48
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,830
- Kanzaki-san.
- Yes?

49
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,700
What a fine mommy you are, packing up so efficiently like this.

50
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,090
I'm far from that.

51
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,520
- This is for you.
- Thank you very much.

52
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,820
Mommy is gonna work hard from now on.

53
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,930
Miwa.

54
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,920
What?

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,170
What about your work?

56
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,100
I left the office early today.

57
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,900
Is everything all packed?

58
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,450
Yeah.

59
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,610
Thank you.

60
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,870
Thanks for your help when you're so busy.

61
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,430
Don't worry about it.

62
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,070
This is your home.

63
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,060
Chii-chan, this is our baby.

64
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,640
The baby.

65
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,560
Chii-chan, look.

66
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,920
Sorry, you still have work to do, right?

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,430
I'll make sure to keep the noise down as much as possible.

68
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,400
- I'll get back to work then.
- Okay.

69
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,570
What is it?

70
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,690
Are you free now?

71
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,240
Yeah.

72
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,930
Sorry to interrupt you at work.

73
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,670
What's up?

74
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,800
I have a favor to ask of you.

75
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,390
What favor?

76
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,330
I want you to come up with the baby's name, Hiroki.

77
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,930
Me?

78
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,350
Yeah.

79
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,520
My dad was the one who gave me my name.

80
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,320
Perhaps that's why

81
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,570
I could always feel my dad's presence close by.

82
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,880
I didn't see him much after my mom divorced him when I was little,

83
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,500
but knowing that my name was his only present

84
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,540
made me happy.

85
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,720
I don't want the baby to feel lonely.

86
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,100
So, I want you to come up with the baby's name, Hiroki.

87
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,400
As promised, I will raise the child on my own.

You're Fuyutsuki-san?

98
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,750
Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Shimohara's younger brother.

99
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,380
Sorry that we took so long to come pay our respects.

100
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,610
Shimohara was always worried about you, Hayato-kun.

101
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,630
My parents also passed away long ago,

102
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,980
and I don't have any other relatives.

103
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,760
So, my brother was always like a parent to me since I was young.

104
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,350
I hated how he tried to parent me, so I didn't speak to him for three years.

105
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,700
I was told he was alive,

106
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,200
only to learn a month later that he's dead.

107
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,060
- I'm sorry, that was because-
- When I heard that he had died,

108
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,570
the things I wanted to say to him,

109
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,940
the regrets I had...

110
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,080
they all came flooding out.

111
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,510
I know that my brother is gone,

112
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,600
but I still wait for him.

113
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,170
Fuyutsuki-san, it was only after seeing your face

114
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,330
that I realized that it was really my brother who had died.

115
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,710
You made me realize that.

116
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,940
Sorry, but please leave.

117
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,580
I know you're already hurt.

118
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,530
But...

119
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,700
you aren't the one I want to meet.

120
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,790
I'm sorry for the harsh words.

121
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,070
Don't be sorry.

122
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,850
We'll take our leave today.

123
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,120
<i>Is this right? Is the patient Shimohara?</i>

124
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,160
<i>Yes.</i>

125
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,080
I...

126
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,980
It was chaotic back then.

127
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,360
Anyone would have been confused.

128
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,640
Stop looking so depressed.

129
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,760
- Please enjoy.
- What? Three bowls?

130
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,350
Shimohara and I promised to eat this when we came back.

131
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,570
So, I have to eat his share on his behalf, too.

132
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,430
Bon appétit!

133
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,900

134
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,140
Delicious!

135
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,230
You see,

136
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,270
I'm gonna drop by to see Hayato-kun again.

137
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,900
I'll go see him, no matter how many times it takes.

138
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,520
I want to do whatever I can on Shimohara's behalf,

139
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,930
because I have a responsibility toward all the bereaved families.

140
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,670
Don't try to take it all upon yourself.

141
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,590
Let me share some of that responsibility with you.

142
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,290
In that case, let's share it.

143
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,100
Come on, come on...

144
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,390
- No, wait. That's not what I meant...
- Here you go.

145
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,380
Risa.

146
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,260
Thank you.

147
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,530
I'm glad you are here.

<i>- You were the one who saved me, Natsuno.

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,240
<i>Wait, you don't remember?</i>

158
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,280
<i>No, not at all.</i>

159
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,420
<i>I had neither a dream nor anything to aim for.</i>

160
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,340
<i>And this was what you told me:</i>

161
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,410
<i>"Even if you give up your dreams and all the things you want,</i>

162

<i>the wonderful things in life will never disappear.</i>

163
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,120
<i>There are many wonderful things in this world.</i>

164
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,880
<i>We just haven't discovered them yet," you said.</i>

165
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,390
<i>Indeed, I thought that back then.</i>

166
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,890
<i>That was because I had to give up on many things due to my family situation.</i>

167
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,530
<i>You said if we read all the books in the library,</i>

168
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,670
<i>we would at least find one thing we wanted to do.</i>

169
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,330
<i>The me back then was asking for the impossible, right?</i>

170
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,340
<i>That was the time</i>

171
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,760
<i>I started to fall in love with you, Natsuno.</i>

172
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,570
Good! Wait a second.

173
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,980
It's all done. Okay.

174
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,970

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,720
Sorry. Everything's okay now.

180
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,530
It's okay now.

181
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,410
Hang on, hang on.

182
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,330
Jeez, who is it?

183
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,740
- Yes?
- Miwa-san.

184
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,760
My savior is here!

185
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,290
And my angel!

186
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,550
I've brought some of Kota's old baby stuff for you!

187
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,140
Really? That'll be helpful.

188
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,220
Shin-chan, put the stuff over there.

189
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,030
- Okay.
- Come in. Just put them here.

190
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,570
Thank you so much.

191
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,310
Thanks for carrying the stuff over. You can leave now.

192
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,450
What? I wanna play with the baby, too.

193
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,190
You have the store to look after, no?

194
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,580
- What?
- Bye-bye!

195
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,990
Seriously?

196
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,470
You're so cute.

197
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,250
You look more like your mommy, I guess.

198
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,770
You don't look like your daddy.

199
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,320
In you go. Kota, don't you think she looks like Miwa-san?

200
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,540
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

201
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,970
- Tea is ready.
- Thank you.

202
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,300
Play with her, all right?

203
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,820
Is Hiroki-san that busy?

204
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,850
Miwa-san, isn't it hard for you to handle all this alone?

205
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,150
That's how we've divided our roles at home.

206
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,890
I didn't tell you this earlier for fear of worrying you,

207
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,960
but I happened to spot him looking unwell once.

208
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,930
You saw Hiroki?

209
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,920
Yeah. It felt awkward to say hi to him.

210
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,280
I see.

211
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,100
I didn't know that happened.

212
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,630
It's hard to figure out what's going on in a man's head.

213
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,680
They keep everything to themselves.

214
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,090
They're expressionless 80 percent of the time.

215
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,680
They don't cry, and they're harder to figure out than babies.

216
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,790
Kota.

217
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,800
Kota, you must express your feelings, all right?

218
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,350
I'm hungry.

219
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,260
Hungry? You've been hungry all the time lately.

220
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,100
- These are the documents for tomorrow's meeting.
- Thanks.

221
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
- Yoshida.
- Yes?

222
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,610
- Help me check these.
- Look at his face.

223
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,330
He hasn't changed one bit even after his baby was born.

224
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,250
I think he's planning to work overtime alone again today.

225
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,160
We want him to stop it, right? He makes us look like we're slacking off.

226
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, why don't we also work overtime?

227
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,760
No way.

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,390
Thanks for the milk bottles and baby items.

232

No problem.

Hiroki.

Have you been feeling under the weather lately?

237
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,910
This new project of yours sounds demanding.

238
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,040
Yeah, kind of.

239
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,100
I'll try not to disturb you.

240
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,090
To be honest, there are plenty of firsts for me,

241
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,810
so it'll be hard to handle everything smoothly right away.

242
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,670
But I'll try my best so you can focus on your work.

243
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,960
That's all I wanted to tell you.

244
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,360
Sorry for interrupting your work.

245
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,220
What a surprise!

246
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,540
- You're alive and well.
- Yes, I am.

247
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,350
I think the correct information was only released a month later.

248
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:30,990
A matter as important as this doesn't become big news, right?

249
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,500
But I'm so glad you're fine.

250
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,760
Oh, right. The lady with us at the flea market... Kanzaki-san, was it?

251
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,460
She was very worried about you.

252
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,400
Do you happen to have her contact number?

253
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,980
Sorry, but I don't.

254
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,070
<i>What is it?</i>

255
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,440

<i>I'll bear with it.</i>

263
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,170
But the doctor allowed you to come with me to the shrine to bless the baby.

264
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,860
You sure you don't want to come?

265
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,170
<i>Hiroki-san's parents will be there, too.</i>

266
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,510
I don't want to cause everyone trouble.

267
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,830
<i>And I can't pick you up on my own either.</i>

268
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,490
<i>Sorry, Mom.</i>

269
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,090
<i>I'll send you lots of photos, I promise.</i>

270
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,970
<i>Hello, Hiroki-san. Welcome back.</i>

271
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,300
- Good evening.
- Sorry, I didn't hear you come in.

272
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,810

<i>Gosh, look at the time. Sorry, my dear.</i>

274
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,350
I'll call you again.

00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,950
Bye.

276
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,200
You saw Grandma, right?

277
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,410
Well done. Good job with the burp.

278
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,130
You're home early today.

279
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,030
By the way, I'm bringing the baby to the shrine for blessings.

280
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,160
You'll be busy with work, right?

281
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,900
I'm thinking of inviting your parents

282
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,940

283
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,090
I'll inform them.

284
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,920
Thanks.

285
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,490
Hey, listen.

286
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,230
I've thought of some names.

287
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,500
You’ve thought of so many names.

288
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,890
I figured the name "Shiori" would be nice.
<i>(T/N: "Shiori" means going forward without getting lost.)</i>

289
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,690
I saw the bookmark that was inserted in the mother-child booklet.
<i>(T/N: "Shiori" also means bookmarks in Japanese.)</i>

290
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,540
Miwa, you made that, right?

291
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,400
It's pretty.

292
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,330
I came up with that name when I saw it.

293
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,860
The name "Shiori" also means "guiding post."

294
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,270
I can't do anything for the baby,

295
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,620
but I hope she will move forward and not feel lost.

296
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,580
What do you think?

297
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,480
You don't like it?

298
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,980
It's not that.

299
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:07,880
Then, "Shiori" it is.

300
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,650

This is where we'll start over.

304
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,580
I'll come up with a list of companies that are likely to invest.

00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,180
Though, I don't know if I can do it as well as Shimohara.

00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,840
Got it.

307
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,890

308
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,440

309
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,890

She hasn't contacted you, has she?

314
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,730

353
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,180
Sorry, she'll probably stop crying soon.

354
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,930
Why not let me take over?

355
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,930
- But you have to wake up early tomorrow-
- Don't worry, it's fine.

356
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,610
Come, Shiori.

357
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:29,560
Oh, sorry, sorry. Okay, okay...

358
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,230
It's okay, it's okay.

359
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:37,460
I'll prepare the milk.

360
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,450
Okay, now, now...

361
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,220
Sorry, sorry...

362
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,160
Okay, don't cry.

363
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,630
She's finally asleep.

364
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,730
But she'll start crying again soon.

365
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,440
You've changed somewhat, Hiroki.

366
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,390
I'm sorry. I mean it.

367
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,150
What?

368
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:19,020
I've been mean to you all this time, Miwa.

369
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,960
I've been facing a lot of pressure at work.

370
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,300
I know that isn't a good excuse,

371
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,020
but I've been venting my stress on you.

372
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,010
I'm the worst.

373
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,670
Likewise, I'm sorry, Hiroki.

374
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,680
I haven't paid attention to your feelings.

375
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,460
When you gave birth to Shiori,

376
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,220
and I held her in my arms for the first time,

377
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,250
she was just a tiny, adorable bundle

378
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,860
yet so terrifyingly fragile

379
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,880
and delicate.

380
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,770
But she felt so warm,

381
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,290
and my tears couldn't stop flowing.

382
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,900
I didn't want to ever forget that moment.

383
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,840
That's why I named her "Shiori."

384
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,020
Because that child

385
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,220
became my guiding post.

386
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,800
Miwa.

387
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,980
Thank you... for giving birth to Shiori.

388
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,060
Is it okay if we cancel that agreement?

389
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,430
What?

390
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,880
I said that I wouldn't be a father to the baby.

391
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:12,510
But can you let me be Shiori's father?

392
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,950
Miwa, if that's fine with you, of course.

393
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,530
Hiroki...

394
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,840
but you are Shiori's father.

395
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,220
Thank you.

396
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,480
I'll watch over her tonight.

397
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
You can get some sleep.

398
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,710
But... it's already dawn.

399
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,070

400
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,260

- Here it is.
