Wait, where did you learn that word from?

34
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,630
Shin-chan taught me that.

I hope to visit your store at least once.

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,650
- Yes, please do.
- It's a really nice store.

Is that so?

44
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,360

Not at all.

46
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,240
I also caused Miwa-san much trouble when I just gave birth to Kota.

I have you all to thank.

Yes, she does.

I'm fine if she doesn't.

Is she feeling hungry?

53
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,010
But she just had milk.

54
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,000
Or did she soil her diapers?

55
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,010
Her diapers. Let's change her diapers.

56
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,990
- Okay.
- It's a lot of work.

57
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,860
I'm kind of envious.

58
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,050

What?

61
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,210
Like you, I divorced my husband

62
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,150
not long after Miwa was born.

63
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,100
My ex-husband never helped change a single diaper.

Sorry, you must find him heavy.

67
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,300
Not at all. He's five, right?

68
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,050
No, he's turning six.

69
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,250
I see.

70
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,960
He has grown this big.

71
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,450

00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,790

You two haven't had a marital crisis so far, have you?

77
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,280
Any couple would've encountered it once or twice.

78
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,120
So, you two had a crisis?

79
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,760
I had been feeling lost all this time.

80
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,230
Thanks to Miwa, I realized what was truly important to me.

81
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,390
I guess right now is the happiest time of my life.

82
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,240
Happiness?

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,140
What?

84
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,100
I mean, please share some of that happiness with me.

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,900
Why? Aren't you plenty happy to have such an adorable kid like Kota?

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,080
Why not get some rest?

89

So much that I want to eat her up.

But I'm happy that I could see you today, Miwa.

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,140
What? Me?

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,290
That's right.

That's unfair! I wanted to go, too!

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,410
I told you that I'll lend a listening ear to whatever you want to tell me, didn't I?

182
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,600
I'll make good on that promise.

183
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,090
Because we're dear friends.

184
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,580
You don't seem happy lately.

185
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,990
You think so?

186
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,340
Hiroki-san was worried about you, too.

187
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,560
- Hiroki?
- That's right.

188
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,020
I won't let you off if you make my idol unhappy, all right?

189
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,760
Sorry for making you worry, Makoto.

190
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,220
I believe in you, Miwa-san.

191
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,830
That you'll confide in me.

192
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,680
Well...

193
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,560
There was one point when I felt lost,

194
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,560
- but everything is fine now.
- What did you feel lost about?

195
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,840
I've been cooped up at home ever since I got married and quit my job.

196
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,220
I wish I could go back to work one day, like what you did, Makoto.

197
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,900
I had a blast working at the flea market.

198
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,390
I see. Just because of that?

199
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,550
Yeah, though it may seem trivial to you...

200
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,040
You can do it, too, Miwa-san.

201
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,350
Can I, really?

202
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,710
I'm a little nervous...

203
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,240
Sorry to keep you waiting.

204
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,980
Thank you for taking time off your busy schedule to meet us.

205
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,740
- The name's Fuyutsuki. Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

206
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,550
I'm Kanzaki. Nice to meet you, too.

207
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,450
Thank you.

208
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,500
So, he's the one?

209
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,120
- That's right.
- What?

210
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,650
She told me a lot about you the other day.

211
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,340
Hey, did you tell him something embarrassing?

212
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,090
No idea.

213
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,790
I've brought him here as promised.

214
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,440
- I'm glad to meet you.
- Likewise.

215
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,040
Have a seat.

216
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,260
- Please take a look at this.
- Thank you.

217
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,960
I was surprised when I read the documents you gave me the other day.

218
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,260
You held a flea market at the Joto Community Center library a year ago, right?

219
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,640
- Yes, we did.
- It was something we planned at our previous company.

220
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,450
I was there and drank your coffee.

221
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,380
The coffee that was brewed with fair trade coffee beans.

222
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,950
You were there?

223
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,560
My wife was involved in that event.

224
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,550
What was your wife selling?

225
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,930
I think it was some embroidery products.

226
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,680
She's good at embroidery, so she's pretty skilled at making them.

227
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,410
Sounds wonderful.

228
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,660
What kind of products did she make?
<i>[Kanzaki Hiroki - Mitsukura Corporation]</i>

229
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,810
Bookmarks and stuff.

230
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,890
She used to visit that library, too.

231
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,370
Sorry to interrupt. One moment, please, Kanzaki-san?

232
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,780
Please excuse me for a moment.

233
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,320
I'm very sorry, but I have to attend to another urgent matter.

234
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,630
- I see.
- Could we arrange to meet another day?

235
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,610
Of course. It's all right with us.

236
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,330
I'm very sorry about this.

237
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,840
Since fate has brought us together, I look forward to our future cooperation.

238
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,740
Likewise, we look forward to working with you.

239
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,810
Thank you.

240
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,170
- Chief Manabe is having trouble with getting the bank loan...
- Yes, I heard.

241
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,550
- The team lead, Otomo-san, is away on a business trip.
- Is that so?

242
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,650
Kanzaki-san, only you can...

243
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,590
Kinoshita, inform the project headquarters about the situation and have them share their views.

244
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,580
Shinozaki, inform the relevant parties. I'll meet them to explain.

245
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,300
- Thank you.
- Got it.

246
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,070
The status of the project is in this document-

247
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,790
It's fine. I've skimmed through the documents I've just received.

248
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,640
Is the demand risk report out? If so, show me that, too.

249
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,380
Sure, got it.

250
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,360
Shinozaki, I'm counting on you to do the explanations.

251
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,510
Me?

252
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,730
You know the market better than Chief Manabe.

253
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,350
Okay...

254
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,850
Come on, you can do it.

255
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,640
Yes, sir!

256
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,950
- It's a game-changer for us if we can close this deal.
- Yeah.

257
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,910
Kanzaki-san really listens with care.

258
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,050
Yeah.

259
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,190
And he seems capable in his work, right?

260
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,960
It's your turn to impress him next time, Fuyutsuki.

261
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,140
Go capture Kanzaki-san's heart like you always do.

262
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,880
I'm not sure about that.

263
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,320
It's a big corporation, you know?

264
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,970
Why are you being so timid?

265
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,360
Get a grip.

266
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,030
Let's go.

267
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,050
- Makoto-chan said that?
- Yeah.

268
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,210
She said I can work at my own pace while watching over Shiori.

269
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,330
Sounds good. Give it a try.

270
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,940
Wait, you're fine with me going to work?

271
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,640
Yeah, I'll also be happy if you can find something that you like to do.

272
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,070
Will it be okay to have Shiori with me?

273
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,080
I'm sure it's fine. She can hold her head up now.

274
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,200
And it's Makoto-chan's store you're working at, so I feel at ease.

275
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,580
Then I guess I'll give it a try.

276
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,600
Sure. Go for it.

277
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,880
Good morning.

278
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,350
Let me carry it.

279
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,020
- One, two...
- Hup.

280
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,150
Be careful.

281
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,850
From today onward, I look forward to your care.

282
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,710
Likewise, we look forward to your support.

283
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,560
And our little adorable employee is here, too.

284
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,670
Having you here is reassuring.

285
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,710
Thank you for taking care of me and my daughter.

286
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,120
Sure, we look forward to having you both.

287
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,730
<i>- May I carry her?
- Of course.
[Nekoyanagi - Open]</i>

288
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,080
Here you go.

289
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,240
Come here, sweetie. It's okay.

290
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,460
- Wow! She's heavy.
- Thank you very much.

291
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,610
- Please come again.
- Thank you.

292
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,780
What are you scheming by suddenly hiring Miwa-san?

293
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,320
Excuse me?

294
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,140
I get it.

295
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,120
You don't need me here anymore and want to fire me, right?

296
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,310
Don't be silly. Other mommies feel reassured when they see our employee

297
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,320
working with her baby in tow. It works in our favor.

298
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,950
To our customers, you are a feast for the eyes.

299
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,480
Miwa-san is a feast for the heart.

300
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,130
Understand?

301
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,830
I see.

302
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,420
Also,

303
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,100
I need to confirm something as well.

304
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,840
Fuyutsuki, you have a mail from the general store that you visited.

305
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,940
Do you know a Komori Makoto-san from Nekoyanagi?

306
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,930
It says, "I wish to discuss with you regarding your products."

307
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,600
Oh... I'll drop by her store.

308
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,080
Okay.

309
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,390
Please excuse me.

310
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,810
Have you heard?

311
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,680
No.

312
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,730
I've been demoted.

313
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,930
You've been promoted.

314
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,050
I lost.

315
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,950
You won.

316
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,520
I heard that you were the one who resolved the issue I was facing.

317
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,770
Besides, the entire company

318
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,040
is praising you for your work ethic.

319
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,980
I was just informed about my transfer.

320
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,120
It seems you'll be the one taking over my position.

321
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,990
I guess this is karma.

322
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,000
Sir.

323
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,050
I've learned a lot under your guidance.

324
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,160
And I'm thankful for that.

325
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,640
Are you trying to be sarcastic?

326
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,240
No, sir.

327
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,760
You were the one who trained me to survive in this company.

328
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,940
Thanks to you, I can have plenty of time for my family.

329
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,640
Maybe I'll follow your example

330
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,170
and spend quality time with my family.

331
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,750
Thanks.

332
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,080
Are you tired, Miwa?

333
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,540
Yeah, but I had fun working today.

334
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,870
Glad to hear that.

335
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,960
I also have something to tell you.

336
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,860
What is it?

337
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,660
To tell you the truth...

338
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,560
I've been promoted.

339
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,290
What?

340
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,860
Wow, congratulations!

341
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,170
But that doesn't mean my work hours will change, so don't worry.

342
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,410
This is great news! We should celebrate!

343
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,890
It's fine.

344
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,130
Then let's also celebrate you getting hired, Miwa.

345
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,440
You're right.

346
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,070
I'll whip up something nice this weekend.

347
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,060
Great! I'm looking forward to it!

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,170
- No, I'm not.
- So, you're single?

356
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,990
Perhaps you have a girlfriend?

357
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,100
No, I don't.

358
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,410
But you're good-looking, how could you not have one?

359
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,420
Sorry, sounds like I'm sexually harassing you with all these questions.

360
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,900
No, don't be.

361
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,900
I'm divorced, you see.

362
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,580
And I have a kid, so I wonder if I can still find love.

363
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,460
- Well, about that-
- But I got divorced because my ex cheated on me.

364
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,210
That's why I hate adulterous people to the core.

365
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,760
You look like the honest type, so I'm sure you don't do such things, right?

366
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,090
Or don't tell me you had an affair before?

367
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,970
Good morning.

368
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,620
Morning, sweetie. Come here.

369
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:03,270
Miwa-san, this is Fuyutsuki-san. We'll be working with him moving forward.

370
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:08,440
This is Kanzaki Miwa-san. She's working for me part-time.

371
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,200
Nice to meet you.

372
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,330
You have met before.

373
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,190
Do you remember?

374
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:26,000
And this baby here is our little employee.

375
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,590
She's really adorable, isn't she?

376
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,790
She's obedient and friendly to people.

377
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,600
I wonder who she resembles.

378
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,080
Our customers adore her too, right, Miwa-san?

379
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,260
Yeah.

380
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,780
Fuyutsuki-san, since you're here, would you like to carry her?

381
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,120
Well...

382
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,930
Many of our customers carry her, too.

383
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,920
- Come on, try carrying her.
- No, it's fine.

384
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,420
- It's okay.
- Open your arms. Don't be shy.

385
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,610
She's really adorable. Come, carry her.

386
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,040
Here you go.

387
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,410
Stop!

388
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,680
Sorry.

389
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,140
Sorry, but I have to leave soon. If you'll excuse me.

390
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,860
I'll contact you again.

391
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,590
Sure.

392
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,950
Makoto.

393
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,170
Why did you do that?

394
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,260
Likewise for you. Why are you so mad?

395
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,520
Many of our customers carry her, too.

396
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,030
Male strangers carrying her might still be something unfamiliar.

397
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,720
Is that so?

398
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,420
I'm sorry.

399
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,000
It's fine.

00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,450
Hey, you're slacking off again.

403
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,200
I'm heading back to the office now.

404
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,160
What happened, Fuyutsuki?

405
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,850
What?

406
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,100
You look really sad.

407
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,150
Is this regarding the one you love?

408
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,140
I was determined to forget her,

409
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,330
but things keep happening one after another.

410
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,460
My heart...

411
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,950
just doesn't want to do what my mind tells it to.

412
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,980
I'm here for you.

413
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,530

414
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,800
I like you, Fuyutsuki.

416

Sorry. Did you wait long?

417
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,580
- Sorry to ask you out so suddenly.
- No worries.

418
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,860
Guess I'll leave the cafe to you for a bit.

419
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,570
- I'm stepping out for a puff.
- Sure, thanks.

You even wanted to meet somewhere where no one could see us.

423

You told me you're happy now, didn't you?

428

Yeah.

433
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,100
I've promised myself not to tell anyone about this.

434
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:49,320
I didn't want to get hurt, and saying it wouldn't change anything anyway.

435
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,960
Miwa-san is also a dear friend to me.

436
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,650
But most of all,

437
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,280
I don't want to cause trouble to the person I'm telling this to.

439

I've always loved you, Hiroki-san.

440
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,310
- H-Hang on, what-
- That's why I can't bring myself to forgive Miwa-san.

441
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,760
What did Miwa do?

442
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:31,640
I really like Miwa-san dearly,

443
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,820
and I've trusted her all this time.

444

Miwa-san...

450

What?

452

She's cheating on you.

It's absolutely wrong to love someone else when you're already married!

454
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,510
- Miwa wouldn't do that-
- Haven't you noticed at all?

455
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,290
No way!

456
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,060
Her cheating on you is already unforgivable, yet...
