Fuyutsuki, you're bad at such stuff, aren't you?

12
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,730
Sorry.

33

The lucky charm that you got from the person important to you.

34
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,840
I guess it must be hard for you to throw it away, right?

35

About the embroidered bookmark in the mother-child health booklet...

36
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,120
I might have lost it. Sorry.

I was rushing to and from the hospital.

I might have dropped it somewhere.

40

I know that it's important to you, and I'm sorry.

41

I don't have it with me anymore.

Yeah, sure.

What are your plans from now on, Risa?

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,430
I still haven't decided yet.

66
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,130

- Sure.

<i>Both of us avoid the most important topic.</i>

71
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,980
I feel you. Divorce is the slowest-moving topic in the world to start talking about.

72
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,500
In my mind, I know very well that we need to talk about it.

73
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,460
That's easier said than done.

74
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,340
I can't live with my wife anymore.

75
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,980
But I don't want to leave Shiori either.

76
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,590
And I don't want to tear my wife and Shiori apart.

77
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,150
This is really tangled up.

78
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,170
So, all I can do is cut off the ties.

79
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,300
My ties to them, that is.

80
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,060
So, you're the only one leaving?

81
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,400
The only solution I can think of is for me to pull back.

82
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,120
The choice is up to you.

83
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:10,550
But even if you're divorced, you'll still be your daughter's father.

84
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,430
Just make sure that you can still get to see her, share custody, and...

85
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,450
It still boils down to having a discussion, right?

86
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,440
Regardless of how it turns out, it's the end for me once we're divorced.

87
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,240
Why is it the end for you?

88
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,120
Why?

89
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,560
We're not related by blood, that's why.

90
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,690
You know that.

91
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,390
Come on, dude.

92
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,950
You're leaving because you and your daughter aren't biologically related?

93
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,520
She isn't my child.

94
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,850
Can you bring yourself to say that to Shiori-chan?

95
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,290
You can probably say that to your wife, or to yourself,

96
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,770
but can you say that to Shiori-chan?

97
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,330
Can you look Shiori-chan in the eye and say,

98
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,760
"You are not my child"?

99
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,570
Are you really sure you can say that to her?

100
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,140
How does Shiori-chan behave when she sees you?

101
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,740
She smiles, doesn't she?

102
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,270
When you carry her,

103
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:30,940
will she recognize your smell and calm down before falling asleep?

104
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,230
Isn't it the same for you?

105
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,850
Won't smelling Shiori-chan calm you down as well?

106
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,140
You said before that you're the best at giving her baths, right?

107
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,300
That, my friend...

108
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,160
is what it means to be a father and daughter to each other.

No matter what, you mustn't let go of Shiori-chan.

If I were in your shoes,

124
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,580
I probably would have done the same thing.

128

I understand why you want to protect her.

129
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,820
Back then,

130
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,190

From now on,

136
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,620

Well, men are jealous creatures, after all.

178
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,970
But it won't do any good, even if you know that man's identity.

179
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,040
What would you do if you were in my shoes, Asaoka-san?

180
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,280
You're fine with not knowing who he is?

181
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,510
If I knew his identity, I'd probably wanna beat him up.

182
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,840
That's why I won't want to meet him.

183
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,220
I don't think you'll do something like that, though.

184
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,660
But it'll just keep bugging me.

185
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,580
You can't move on, right?

186
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:22,610
Yes, I won't be able to find closure if things remain like this.

187
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:30,020
It's not that you want to know who that man is.

188
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,800
You want to know what your wife is thinking, don't you?

189
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,600
What is your wife trying to protect?

190
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,520
Why is she trying to protect him?

191
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,260
These questions have been bogging you down.

192
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,060
That's the reason you can't move on.

193
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,860
Am I right?

194
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,750
Hiroki?

195
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,250
- Hiroki.
- Sorry.

196
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,780
Are you okay?

197
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,070
Fuyutsuki, I see that you've properly moved on, right?

198
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,740
I should find something I want to do, too.

199
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,020
Want coffee?

200
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,480
Sure.

201
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,430
- Wait, I'll do it.
- Let me do it.

202
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,300
Thanks.

203
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,960
As expected.

204
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,220
You'll just start from scratch again if you fail, right?

205
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,750
Wise words indeed.

206
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,090
That's so like you, Fuyutsuki.

207
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:52,240
There were some words that inspired me to start this business.

208
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,730
I just rephrased it a little.

209
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,200
What?

210
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,110
Even if we have to give up our dreams and goals,

211
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,510
there are still plenty of wonderful things in this world.

212
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,040
It's just that we haven't discovered them yet.

213
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,460
That's how I got the phrase, "We'll start from scratch again if we fail."

214
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:18,540
Because there are still many things in this world that we haven't discovered yet.

215
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,850
Were those words from that person who's important to you?

216
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,990
Yeah.

217
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,940
So, I'm sure you'll find something that you want to do, Risa.

218
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,190
What kind of person is she?

219
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,020
Okay...

220
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,150
What are you doing?

221
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,320
What's that? A letter?

222
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,960
Yes, it is.

223
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,900
Inside this letter is a string of precious words.

224
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,060
Read it.

225
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,480
What? No, we can't.

226
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,660
Kota, we aren't supposed to read other people's letters without permission, you hear?

227
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,070
Why not?

228
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,390
Because the precious feelings of the writer are enclosed inside.

229
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,350
Only the letter's recipient is allowed to read it.

230
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,030
Is it a love letter?

231
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,270
Every letter is a love letter.

232
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:52,930
Besides, it has been properly received by that person.

233
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,050
There's no need for it anymore.

234
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,870
<i>Good day. This is Kanzaki from Mitsukura Corporation.</i>

235
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,980
<i>I'm dropping you an email to reschedule our appointment.</i>

236
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,010
<i>I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused,</i>

237
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,190
<i>and thank you for your consideration.</i>

238
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,160
<i>Postscript.</i>

239
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,730
<i>Thanks to Fuyutsuki-sama's help, I was able to swiftly bring my child to the hospital.</i>

240
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,160
<i>I greatly appreciate your thoughtfulness.</i>

241
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,780
Hello?

242
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,440
Hello, I apologize for the sudden call.

243
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,790
This is Mizuki from Tri Ambition.

244
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,620
Oh, I sent you an email not long ago.

245
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,790
<i>The reason for my call is not regarding the financing.</i>

246
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,450
Kanzaki-san, I wish to ask you for a favor.

247
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,210
<i>What is it?</i>

248
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,730
Our company is planning to organize another flea market.

249
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,620
Flea market? The one you did at the library?

250
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,870
<i>That's right.</i>

251
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,020
We would like to gather feedback from those who participated in the previous event.

252
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,100
If it is okay with you,

253
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,660
could you arrange a time for me to meet up with your wife?

254
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,650
You wish to meet my wife?

255
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,220
I wish to speak with your wife directly.

256
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,990
<i>Is that so?</i>

257
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,230
<i>I see.</i>

258
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:54,280
We're hoping to gather candid opinions from the participants, you see.

259
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,820
But my wife was involved in the event only once.

260
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,160
<i>Is there any way I can still meet her?</i>

261
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,290
Sure.

262
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,290
Goodbye.

263
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,620
Shino-san, what are you doing? Hurry and come over.

264
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,250
What's wrong?

265
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,480
I'm getting married.

266
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,700
I felt you should be the first to know, Kanzaki-san.

267
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,850
Wow, congratulations!

268
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,550
Please advise me on your secret to a happy marriage.

269
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,310
The secret is to look each other in the eye and talk, right?

270
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,840
That's right.

271
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,070
See? That's common sense.

272
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,540
Common sense?

273
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,750
Where did you learn that from?

274
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,910
<i>Are you awake?</i>

275
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,410
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

276
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,650
<i>My client seems interested in speaking with you.</i>

277
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,360
<i>Me?</i>

278
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,300
<i>It's regarding the flea market at the Joto Community Center.</i>

279
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,440
What?

280
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,240
The one at the library...

281
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,360
<i>Who is the one who wishes to speak with me?</i>

282
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,050
Who?

283
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,890
<i>Mizuki-san from Tri Ambition. Why ask?</i>

284
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,230
<i>I thought it'd be an acquaintance.</i>

285
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,420
<i>[I thought it'd be an acquaintance.]</i>

286
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,790
<i>Sure. I'll meet her.</i>

287
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,950
<i>I'll give the client your number.</i>

288
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:29,480
<i>You knew that I was involved in the flea market?</i>

289
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,750
<i>It was recorded in my client's documents.</i>

290
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,000
<i>I secretly took part in that event. Sorry.</i>

291
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,030
<i>A friend asked me to help out.</i>

292
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,780
<i>Is that so?</i>

293
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,710
A friend?

<i>[Good day. This is Kanzaki from Mitsukura Corporation...]</i>

295

Hello, Tri Ambition.

That's right.

297
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,090
Kawai-sama from Bonte Dispatch Services?

298
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,450
- Well...
- Sorry, it's mine.

299
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,410
Sorry, please hold on for a moment.

300
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,420
Sorry.

301
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,330
Hello, this is Fuyutsuki.

302
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,820
Yes, we are planning a workshop event,

303
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,970
and I wish to discuss the staff deployment.

304
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,980
Yes.

305
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:18,750
Yes, I'm looking for staff to manage the event in addition to our current volunteer staff.

306
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,350
That's right.

307
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,870
I'll send over the information to you right away.

308
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,250
Yes.

309
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,670
Sure, got it.

310
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,880
Regarding the time...
<i>[Dear Kanzaki Miwa-sama...]</i>

311
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,320
Okay.

312
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,420
I hope that children will develop an interest in world affairs and their living environments when they're young.

313
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,890
I also hope that the children will know more about fair trade.

314
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:45,100
I also want to create opportunities for them to think about what's happening in the world.

315
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,500
That's why I want to organize a fair trade workshop for children.

316
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,280
Sounds like a great idea.

317
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,800
Yes, it is.

318
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,420
I'm thinking of doing picture storytelling.

319
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,950
Will it be easy to understand?

320
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,850
- The picture is adorable.
- Thank you.

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,370
Oh, Kanzaki-san! She's very good at embroidery.

353
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,060
Having her with us was a great help.

354
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,280
We didn't have enough manpower back then.

355
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,080
I heard that my wife took part in the event because a friend had invited her.

356
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,560
I wish to know who that friend is.

357
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,220
I believe it's Fuyutsuki-san who organized the flea market.

358
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,340
Fuyutsuki-san?

359
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,230
I heard they studied in the same junior high school and were childhood friends.

360
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,530
They seemed to be good friends since way back.

361
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,200
He should be back by now...

362
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,850
Found them. The kids will love these-

363
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,390
Just to introduce myself again, I'm Mizuki from Tri Ambition.

364
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,490
Thank you for meeting me.

365
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,780
I'm Kanzaki.

366
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,780
I'm not sure if I can be of much help, but please ask away.

367
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,740
Thank you.

368
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:34,540
I saw your embroidery works that you were selling at the Forest Flea Market.

369
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,310
They are really pretty.

370
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,280
Thank you for the compliment.

371
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,520
Are you good at embroidery?

372
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,950
I've liked doing embroidery since I was young.

373
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,500
- You have a wonderful hobby.
- Not really.

374
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,720
How did you come to participate in the flea market?

375
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,090
I was invited.

376
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,960
By an old friend.

377
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,880
And old friend?

378
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,520
We met each other again after so long.

379
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,320
He's a friend from my days in junior high.

380
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,640
Hey...

381
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,420
Where should we go?

382
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,240
Shall we go for some coffee?

383
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,390
How was your experience working at the flea market?

384
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,400
I enjoyed myself very much.

385
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,050
It was my first time creating something to sell.

386
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,500
It was your first time?

387
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,820
Back then, I didn't have many chances to get out of the house.

388
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,960
And that's why your friend...

389
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,410
Yes, he invited me to join the flea market.

390
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,340
I was thrilled to know that there were still plenty of things in the world I didn't know about.

391
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,620
A world you didn't know about?

392
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,340
That's right.

393
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,150
I guess it's all thanks to this friend of yours.

394
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,180
Yes.

395
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,460
I'm really grateful to him.

396
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,180
How do I put it?

397
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,680
At that time, and in the past,

398
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,060
he has always saved me.

399
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,810
He saved you...

400
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,020
That's probably a little too exaggerated.

401
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,880
Was Fuyutsuki...

402
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,970
saved then?

403
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,250
I'm Fuyutsuki's coworker.

404
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,060
Fuyutsuki Ryo

405
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,750
is someone precious to me.

406
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,430
<i>[Cafe TOCA - Closed]</i>

407
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,950
Well...

408
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,400
The coffee here is really delicious.

409
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,660
Please enjoy.

410
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,390
Thank you.

411
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,510
How is it?

412
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,060
It's delicious.

413
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:33,830
My wife is very good at embroidery.

414
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,120
Right.

415
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,340
I've mentioned that before, haven't I?

416
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,290
Yes, you did.

417
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:45,060
She often works on embroidering handkerchiefs and stuff,

418
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,150
and she's very good at it.

419
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:56,580
Her embroidery work of a bird on a bookmark

420
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,760
is really beautiful.

421
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,700
My wife took part in the flea market at the library, Fuyutsuki-san.

422
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,390
The one that you organized, right?

423
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:19,360
I'll never forget the smile my wife had back then.

424
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,890
I thought she must have really enjoyed herself.

425
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,930
My wife's name

426
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,280
is Kanzaki Miwa.

427
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,630
I've been wanting to meet you.

428
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,920
I wanted to know who was the person Fuyutsuki held so dear.

429
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,580
I saw how Fuyutsuki turned his feelings for you into memories and moved on.

430
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,090
That made me want to meet you.

431
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,220
I thought I'd be satisfied after just one look at you.

432
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,320
But after talking to you, I'm not.

433
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,900
People are foolish beings.

434
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,840
When I see your face,

435
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,640
I'm reminded of how Fuyutsuki was suffering.

436
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,530
Fuyutsuki...

437
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,180
never once gave up on his promise to be together with you...

438
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,700
not when he was undergoing treatment in Africa, or when he kept looking for you,

439
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,710
even though he lost contact with you.

440
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,780
He never gave up.

441
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,970
Yet, you...

442
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,100
Sorry, I-

443
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,980
Fuyutsuki...

444
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,400
He survived and came back with the sole desire to see you.

445
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:08,240
You have hurt Fuyutsuki.

446
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,650
- I...
- You remember, right?

447
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,570
You've heard that name before, haven't you?

448
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,400
Kanzaki Miwa.

449
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,500
I...

450
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,260
Back then...

451
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,000
When my daughter had a fever.

452
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,410
Yes.

453
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,000
Fuyutsuki-san, that day when you helped me,

454
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,050
I told you that my wife was away, right?

455
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:10,430
To be specific,

456
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,190
I had driven her out of the house.

457
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,370
You are married,

458
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:25,030
and have a husband and child.

459
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:32,740
Despite that, you had an affair with Fuyutsuki.

460
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,200
I...

461
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,990
cannot forgive you.

462
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,570
<i>My wife...</i>

463
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,510
had cheated on me.

464
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,320
As for the lover she had an affair with,

465
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:05,050
he has always been on her mind, even now.

466
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,860
That person...

467
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,000
is you, isn't it, Fuyutsuki-san?
