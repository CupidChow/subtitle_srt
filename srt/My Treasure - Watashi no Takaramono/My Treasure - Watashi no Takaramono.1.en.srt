Natsuno, can you help search this area?

528
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,260
Over here.

530
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,200
Not this one.

531
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,800

534
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,500
Found it.

535
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,880
This is the one.

536
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,250
No way. This is my bookmark.

537
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,100
Why is it here?

538
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,980
I stole it.

539
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,460
You what?

540
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,370
You're terrible!

541
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:51,370
I hid it and planned to play Treasure Hunt with you.

542
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,580
But then, I never saw you again,

543
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,350
so it stayed where it was.

544
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:04,280
I figured it'd still be here.

545
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,340

546
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,700

548
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,830
Natsuno?

549
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,570
- Natsuno.
- Stop.

550
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,890
I don't want to hear your voice.

551
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:47,420
Fuyutsuki-kun, when you call me,

552
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,100

553
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,140
Something's wrong.

554
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,890
When I met you, Fuyutsuki-kun,

555
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,730
my heart started feeling alive again.

556
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,380
You made me realize

557
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,350
how much I had been hurting,

558
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,230
and that my heart had been in pain all along.

559
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,470
Natsuno, that's probably because

560
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,280
you've lost something precious.

561
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,720

562
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,300
it feels alive,

563
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,520
and you can feel both pain and happiness.

564
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,930
Fuyutsuki-kun, ever since I met you again,

565
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,590
my heart has been hurting.

566
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,700
