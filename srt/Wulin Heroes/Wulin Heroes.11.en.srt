[Episode 11]

16
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,419
Congratulations on your recovery and return, Sect Lord.

17
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:48,939
Seventh Uncle, thank you for your hard work.

18
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,980
Miss, thank you for saving him.

19
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,240
Aren't you dead?

20
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,140
I remember that when I first met Tang Huan, you were fleeing with him.

21
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,119
I almost lost my life, but I was saved in the nick of time.

22
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,800
During the battle at Tang Sect,

23
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,460
were you also the one who stuck by Tang Huan's side to the bitter end?

24
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,639
Why did you change your face?

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,419
If I didn't do so, I wouldn't have been able to infiltrate Tang Sect.

26
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:36,859
Xiao Xi, I only found out much later about Seventh Uncle's survival and espionage.

27
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:38,759
This man called Seventh Uncle is shady.

28
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,360
Is Tang Huan keeping secrets from me?

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,919
- I see.
- It's a pity that I'm incompetent.

30
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,380
You're far more marvelous, Miss.

31
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,220
You have my heartfelt gratitude.

32
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,539
Thank you for helping our sect lord.

33
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,520
You don't have to be so courteous to me.

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,019
Seventh Uncle, Xiao Xi is one of us now.

35
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,419
How about we head in first?

36
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,239
Do you have any tasty food?

37
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,879
The food at Fenghua Valley is so unpalatable.

38
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,180
I really want to feast on good food.

39
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,620
Sure, please come in.

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,239
Seventh Uncle, let sit and talk.

41
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,419
Don't bother with formalities when we're alone just like before.

42
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,039
Sure.

43
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,920
When Tang Sect's disciples scattered and fled,

44
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,139
those martial artists attempted to barge in to snatch treasures.

45
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:40,780
Thank goodness I hid those secret martial art techniques and foiled their plans to rob us.

46
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,460
That happened when you were headed to Fenghua Valley.

47
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,220
I've been tidying up the old quarters.

48
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,500
When everyone heard about your recovery and return,

49
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,780
there have been many disciples returning lately.

50
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,199
So, you're the sect lord now?

51
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,340
Don't you have to make an official declaration?

52
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,100
Of course, I do.

53
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,599
However, I need to finish an important task first.

54
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,919
Seventh Uncle, what has Thunder Sect been up to?

55
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,440
After Yu Luo's sudden betrayal, he handed over the formula for Thunder Bombs to save his own life.

56
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,580
The Martial Arts World already held him in contempt for this.

57
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,220
In Thunder Sect, he has lost all respect.

58
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,019
Yu Luo is a despicable fool.

59
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:27,260
I have to take revenge at all costs.

60
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,700
However, Yu Luo is terrified of death.

61
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,439
He hired the Black and White Double Phantoms as bodyguards.

62
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,530
Moreover, he always keeps Thunder Bombs with him.

63
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,120
Doesn't he sleep?

64
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,519
Once he closes his eyes, it'll be the perfect chance to strike.

65
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,693
You're absolutely right, Miss.

66
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:51,220
Xiao Xi, Tang Sect has weakened drastically.

67
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,379
If I want to step up as a respectable sect lord, I have to increase my power and influence rapidly.

68
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,820
What do you think about assimilating Thunder Sect into Tang Sect?

69
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,680
Are you asking me?

70
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,079
Of course.

71
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,720
You'll be the sect lord's wife.

72
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,680
Everything about Tang Sect is tied to you.

73
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Of course, I'd like to seek your opinion.

74
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,059
I think Thunder Bombs are similar to the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

75
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:13,759
Both are terrifyingly lethal.

76
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,500
They have to be used with caution.

77
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,380
Xiao Xi, I know that you're kind.

78
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,219
Don't worry.

79
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,060
Weapons depend on their wielders.

80
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,880
The attack back then was forwarded by Yu Luo's orders.

81
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,299
The bombs exploded before it was time.

82
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:29,387
Even I almost died from the explosions.

83
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:32,140
Thunder Sect is only a threat to the Martial Arts World because it has such a member.

84
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:37,200
Exactly. So, we need you to personally deal with Yu Luo.

85
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,279
I'll send men to gather information right away.

86

At the same time, to personally deal with Yu Luo.

87

Xiao Xi, get some rest.

88
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:58,240
I'll discuss strategies to attack Thunder Sect with Seventh Uncle.

Why didn't you take it back?

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,300
I will get it back, but we can't be hasty.

As long as she's with me, it doesn't matter.

94

By the way, tail her secretly.

95
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,180
If she can't kill Yu Luo, find a chance to do so.

96
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,260
We have to eliminate this threat.

Were you traumatized somehow?

109
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,360
Indeed, we were paid by Sect Lord Yu, but he only told us to keep him alive.

110
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,259
You only stripped him of his martial arts skills, but you aren't keen on killing him.

There's no reason for us to intervene.

Fine.

No. This is my own decision.

You may be benevolent to him, but he won't thank you for that.

He'll seek you for revenge.

129

He's incapable of martial arts now. Revenge sounds ridiculous.

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,820
I missed you so much.

161
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,880
Seventh Uncle! Seventh Uncle!

162
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,319
Sect Lord!

163
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,520
- Sect Lord.
- Deal with her.

164
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,159
Come with me, Miss. This way.

165
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,500
Come here.

166
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,880
- Xiao Xi.
- Why are you in my way?

167
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,519
Don't jump to conclusions. Let me explain.

168
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,699
Her name is Xue Ting. She is the most favored concubine of the fifth elder.

169
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:28,720
She's been mentally unstable ever since the fifth elder was killed by Tang Yang.

170
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,380
She's pregnant with the fifth elder's child, and I'm indebted to him.

171
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,100
If I ignore her, Tang Yang would've killed them.

172
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,379
All this time, I've been taking care of her in secret and keeping her close by.

173
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:46,240
When I was hunted by Tang Yang, I could barely keep myself alive.

174
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,600
So, I had to send her away.

175
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,119
I planned to tell her the truth after dealing with Thunder Sect and invite her back.

176
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,919
I didn't expect her to come knocking first.

177
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,019
Trust me.

178
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,600
I see. Thank goodness she's safe.

179
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,760
Old Master! How could you abandon me and my child?

180
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,819
Who am I supposed to depend on now?

181
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:13,719
You... Miss?

182
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:17,479
She's muddled and probably mistook me for the deceased fifth elder.

183
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,799
Muddled?

184
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,000
I've already witnessed her ability to cry at will.

185
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,479
My stomach hurts.

186
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,639
Will my child be all right?

187
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,719
If my child is harmed, I'll die with it.

188
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:37,059
Since she's here,

189
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,779
let her stay.

190
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,819
I'm sure you aren't heartless enough to leave a pregnant woman on the streets.

191
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,640
All right, I'll take her to one of the annexes.

192
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:53,320
Get a doctor to assess her health.

193
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,319
Sure. Come on, Miss.

194
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,380
Xiao Xi, you truly are a kind and sensible person.

195
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,712
That isn't your child anyway.

196
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:06,420
Why would I be unreasonable?

197
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,100
You're the head of Tang Sect now.

198
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,719
Taking in a deceased comrade's widow isn't the same as seizing her.

199
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:15,340
Others won't criticize you. Instead, they'll praise your kindness.

200
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,000
I was negligent and failed to keep an eye on her.

201
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,700
If she didn't have a trick or two up her sleeves, she wouldn't have survived in Tang Sect for so long.

202
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,539
How should I handle this?

203
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:53,330
I can't meet with her alone. Pass this to her.

204
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,260
This is... arsenic?

205
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,340
Ye Xi isn't so gullible lately.

206
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,620
Xue Ting came at the perfect time.

207
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,560
She's pregnant, giving her a wonderful reason to approach Ye Xi.

208
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,279
Doesn't she suspect my relationship with Ye Xi? She'll be reassured now.

209
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,240
By the way, make sure she acts with caution and doesn't slip up.

210
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:16,340
Ensure that the amount is well portioned as well.

211
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,699
I almost forgot.

212
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:21,059
She's experienced with poisons.

213
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,159
Wasn't she the one who surreptitiously poisoned my father?

214
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,160
No one even noticed.

215
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,059
But... why are you poisoning Miss Ye?

216
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,040
Is Yu Luo dead?

217
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,040
That has been dealt with.

218
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,399
Don't worry. I'm not trying to poison her to death.

219
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,220
This is just a precaution. I hope she'll be more obedient when we're married.

220
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,420
Seventh Uncle, you never doubted my decisions.

221
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,820
Yes, Sect Lord. I was running my mouth.

222
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,559
I can't meet you alone. Speak to Seventh Uncle.

223
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,799
Weren't you the one who asked me to poison her?

224
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:15,819
I think this is a grave matter, so I should discuss it with you in person.

225
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,559
Speak.

226
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:21,940
Whenever I bring her food, she makes me eat with her.

227
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,720
I'm pregnant.

228
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,079
Even if I'm only eating a small amount, I don't want to take any risks.

229
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,100
Did she notice?

230
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,399
She didn't, but...

231
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:37,440
I really can't figure her out. Is she even more deceiving than I am?

232
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,319
Leave from the side door.

233
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,099
Miss Ye, you're here.

234
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:52,679
Seventh Uncle, where is the sect lord?

235
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,680
- He's inside.
- Okay.

236
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,780
Xiao Xi, did you cook these dishes?

237
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,359
The cooks made them, of course.

238
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:08,939
Sect Lord, Miss Ye. Please enjoy your meal. I'll take my leave.

239
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:14,700
Recently, Xue Ting has been offering me tons of tasty food for no reason.

240
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,000
She's the pregnant one.

241
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,559
But that reminded me of something.

242
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,280
You're so busy, but I don't do much.

243
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,699
I should show you some concern.

244
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,519
In the future, I'll bring your meals to you every day and eat with you, all right?

245
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,960
Xiao Xi, you're starting to act like a dutiful wife.

246
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,279
By the way, I want our marriage ceremony to be held on the second of the next month,

247
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,720
together with my stepping up as the sect lord.

248
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,980
Let's invite some prestigious sects in the martial arts world to witness our marriage.

249
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,860
What do you think?

250
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,760
I...

251
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,540
Do you really want to marry me?

252
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,740
Of course. You're the most perfect wife for me.

253
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:05,039
It's a little scary to be described as a perfect wife.

254
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,019
Xiao Xi, what are you saying?

255
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:17,120
Xiao Xi, are you worried that there isn't enough preparation time or is that a bad date?

256
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,040
No, not at all. It doesn't matter if it's an auspicious date or not.

257
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,580
It just can't be a day of calamity.

258
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm looking forward to it.

259
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:28,359
Come on, let's sit down.

260
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:40,160
Eat up.

261
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,560
Let's eat.

262
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:52,919
Xiao Xi, since we'll be married, we shouldn't be keeping any secrets from each other.

263
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:56,359
Do you have secrets to share with me?

264
00:19:57,699 --> 00:20:01,160
The truth about my birth has spread throughout the Martial Arts World.

265
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,879
I'm sure... there are many people who think I'm a laughingstock.

266
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:07,300
Well...

267
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,459
One can't choose one's birth.

268
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,680
The winner ultimately writes history.

269
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,659
You're the sect lord anyway.

270
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:13,920
What about you?

271
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,280
Do you have any secrets to share with me?

272
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,140
Ask me whatever you wish to know.

273
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,579
Is the valley master of Fenghua Valley, the Miracle Physician Bai Yue, an old acquaintance of yours?

274
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,659
I lost my memory. I can't remember.

275
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:30,820
What about the prince regent?

276
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,200
Some say he's your patron.

277
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,320
He does everything for you.

278
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:38,679
Why do you believe such rumors?

279
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,499
If that were true, why would I marry you?

280
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,520
Eat something else for now.

281
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,320
I'll peel these for you.

282
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:02,120
Xiao Xi, there's something I'm not sure whether I should ask about.

283
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,400
Ask away.

284
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,040
I'll tell you as long as I remember.

285
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,180
There's a secret book called Scripture of Materia Medica.

286
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,720
It supposed to state the secret technique to immortality.

287
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:19,999
I don't believe in that, but there may be secret methods to boost one's skills and vitality.

288
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:22,379
Xiao Xi, you should know this.

289
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:25,780
I've been trying to defeat Thunder Sect and make a name for myself in the Martial Arts Qorld.

290
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,960
In order to accomplish all these, I need formidable martial arts skills.

291
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,459
You're already the sect lord.

292
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:38,039
You can't be greedy and hope to be the strongest martial artist.

293
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,439
I'm just afraid.

294
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:43,680
I'm afraid that my father thinks I'm a letdown.

295
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,339
More importantly, I don't want Tang Yang to think Tang Sect is doing worse in my hands.

296
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:51,659
They won't think so.

297
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:55,100
You're worrying too much.

298
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,319
Xiao Xi, you'll help me, won't you?

299
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,319
How do you want me to help you?

300
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,719
Don't you have the Scripture of Materia Medica?

301
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,900
I knew it. He just wants the Scripture of Materia Medica.

302
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,939
I understand.

303
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:14,319
Gifted individuals are few and far between.

304
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:16,480
Most people have to work hard.

305
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,240
I'm training hard to acquire martial arts skills,

306
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,219
but such secret methods to hasten matters would be wonderful.

307
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,660
The Scripture of Materia Medica is just a storybook.

308
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,000
Well, how did you master such formidable skills?

309
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,119
Xiao Xi, I'm done peeling these. I'll feed you.

310
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,639
Xiao Xi, what's wrong?

311
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:47,000
Are you starting to doubt me now?

312
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,759
That's not it.

313
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,300
I don't have any scriptures.

314
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,459
I only have storybooks that you won't be interested in.

315
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:54,720
One more thing.

316
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,479
I don't want to eat these beans.

317
00:22:57,479 --> 00:23:00,460
Don't waste your effort. I'm leaving.

318
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,220
Xiao Xi.

319
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,660
She's evidently hiding the Scripture of Materia Medica.

320
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,399
How dare she lie about it!

321
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:15,300
Since you're defiant, don't blame me for my brutality.

322
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:27,119
We can't meet.

323
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,759
You're being too brazen.

324
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,440
You're about to marry her.

325
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,139
I'm clearly anxious.

326
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:34,900
What's wrong?

327
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,019
What's going on?

328
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,640
- It's just a little arsenic.
- Do you have a death wish?

329
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,519
I have to eat since I'm sharing meals with her daily.

330
00:23:53,519 --> 00:24:00,100
You came up with such an elaborate ploy to deal with her, but word of your marriage with her has spread.

331
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,920
Don't ask about things you can't understand.

332
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,059
Well, will you really marry her?

333
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:09,479
I'm not concerned about the matters of men, but you just can't marry her.

334
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,960
You're marry me, won't you?

335
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,799
I want to be the sect lord's wife.

336
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,779
You're my father's maid and the fifth elder's concubine.

337
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:19,659
If I marry you, I will lose all dignity in the Martial Arts World.

338
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,659
I won't make public appearances.

339
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:24,400
I'm not known in the Martial Arts World either.

340
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,319
You said this before.

341
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:28,699
I'm the first woman you fell in love with.

342
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:32,340
When you asked me to poison your father, you also said that

343
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,039
once you obtained Tang Sect, you'll share it with me.

344
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,440
You have been a great help.

345
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,720
We're childhood sweethearts. It's natural that I'm helping you.

346
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,039
I've always dreamed of marrying you,

347
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:48,119
but your father refused to let you be the sect lord even after he was poisoned.

348
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,780
I swallowed my pride and became the fifth elder's concubine to realize your ambitions.

349
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,560
If not for me, the fifth elder wouldn't have supported you.

350
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,899
We had the perfect plan, but Tang Yang killed his own father.

351
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:04,019
He even slaughtered all the elders.

352
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,159
I was running for my life and couldn't take you with me.

353
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,440
How did you survive Tang Yang's tyranny?

354
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,240
Didn't I tell you before?

355
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,299
The fifth elder noticed things were amiss and sent me away.

356
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,219
I've been waiting for you.

357
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:25,160
My heart has always been devoted.

358
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:31,019
When you returned from the capital city penniless, I gave you all my savings.

359
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:33,659
You've finally become the sect lord.

360
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,979
My efforts should be rewarded, right?

361
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:40,939
After such a lengthy speech, what exactly do you desire?

362
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,819
Not much.

363
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:45,080
I just want to be the sect lord's wife.

364
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,799
Are you threatening me?

365
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,100
Yes, I want to stay by your—

366
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,459
I'm pregnant with your child.

367
00:25:58,459 --> 00:25:59,739
Why?

368
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,739
You're right.

369
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:03,940
Tang Yang taught me one thing.

370
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,159
To be the sect lord, one has to be vicious.

371
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:09,440
He even murdered his own father.

372
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,159
An unborn child doesn't count for much.

373
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,160
Besides, you've slept with so many men.

374
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,759
Don't you feel ashamed claiming this child is mine?

375
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:20,520
Dreaming about being the sect lord's wife?

376
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,419
You should reflect on whether you're even worthy of that.

377
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:25,780
You shouldn't have come here.

378
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,019
So, I'll have to send you off to where you belong.

379
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,780
Men are all deceiving scumbags.

380
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,260
You...

381
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,219
Seventh Uncle, clean this up.

382
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,660
Sect Lord!

383
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,619
I shouldn't nag,

384
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,199
but...

385
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:07,639
Seventh Uncle, she knew too much and even dared to threaten me.

386
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:10,359
You are different from her.

387
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,500
I trust you the most.

388
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,159
If you want to say something, just say it.

389
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,159
Sect Lord, since you've already dealt with her,

390
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:24,380
do you want to reconsider what to do with Miss Ye?

391
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,080
Her martial skills are formidable.

392
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,459
It's more useful to keep her in Tang Sect.

393
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:30,019
Why on the wedding day...

394
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:31,619
Seventh Uncle,

395
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,680
what you are saying,

396
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,199
I do understand.

397
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:40,919
Let me think it over.

398
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,340
Let's do this.

399
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,540
Dispose of her first.

400
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,580
Don't let her get discovered.

401
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,180
All right.

402
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,840
Se-Sect Lord...

403
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,820
Se-Sect Lord...

404
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,480
Don't ask me why.

405
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,640
You betrayed me first.

406
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,160
That Demoness Ye Xi is really good at bewitching people.

407
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,700
You've actually helped her to deceive me.

408
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,480
You dared to release someone that I told you to kill.

409
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,379
That's why I obviously have to reconsider whether you would betray me and tell her about my plan.

410
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:28,980
After thinking it back and forth, I have no other choice.

411
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,060
After all, only the dead don't talk.

412
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,640
You...

413
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,340
You repay kidness with enmity.

414
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,279
She saved your life.

415
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,179
What do you know? She is the one who is heartless and ungrateful.

416
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,720
She is about to marry me, but she still wouldn't tell me anything.

417
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,039
She was lying to my face, and she also has a shady relationship with another man.

418
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,900
What's the use of keeping such a demoness?

419
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,679
You...

420
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,499
You are the one who has been deceiving her.

421
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,160
Sect Lord Yu, you've seen it with your own eyes. You can rest assured now.

422
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:16,220
The demoness' martial arts skills are indeed more formidable than what they say.

423
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,860
No wonder she could survive from the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

424
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,780
Also, your trick in using the self-injury ruse is quite effective.

425
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,480
She is totally convinced

426
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,699
and will help us attack Tang Fortress with full strength.

427
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,340
Your injury is recovering well, isn't it?

428
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,640
Thanks for Sect Lord Yu's concern, I'm fine.

429
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,840
If you weren't so ruthless, I might still be worried.

430
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,419
But she can't treat me this way.

431
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,140
Otherwise, I'll make her feel worse than death.

432
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,200
All of you are villains.

433
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,840
All of you owe me!

434
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,540
What's this medicine that you've been using in recent days?

435
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,999
I've been sleepless at night.

436
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,259
Once you've read the letter from Young Master Chu, you probably will be even more sleepless.

437
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:57,860
Tang Sect has swallowed Thunder Sect.

438
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,299
Tang Huan is inviting all the major sects in the Martial Arts World to attend his wedding.

439
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:06,399
After Prince Regent heard the news, he has already set off with his Black Armord Guards.

440
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,119
Judging from his imposing posture, he plans to trample Tang Sect.

441
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,680
You aren't heading out overnight, are you?

442
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,960
I've already fed hay to Xiao Bai.

443
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:36,820
If Tang Huan is only coveting the Scripture of Materia Medica,

444
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,399
why does he insist on marrying me?

445
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,400
And he even makes such a grand showing.

446
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:49,180
Could it be true that he is deeply in love with me and is greatful for my saving his life?

447
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,419
I'll use the wedding to see what you really plan to do.

448
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,890
♫ In the haziness, the moonlight fills both of your eyes ♫

449
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:48,790
♫ A smile tugs at my feelings ♫

450
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,830
♫ Always unyielding and never speak rashly, ♫

451
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,160
♫ yet I’m willing to risk my life for you ♫

452
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:03,070
♫ The loneliness is now stained with dust and smoke ♫

453
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:09,460
♫ Be determined with one thought, a will to forge a sword ♫
♫ Step by step, a pair of shadows are entwined ♫

454
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:17,150
♫ The only song becomes a knot with a flute as it’s reflection ♫
♫ One day, one night, a pair that is inseparable ♫

455
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:23,630
♫ Day and night, I’ll protect you unconditionally ♫
♫ How many times have we been through life and death? ♫

456
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,390
♫ Because you are by my side ♫

457
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:33,100
Bai Yue, I don't know why you deceive yourself in pushing me away.

458
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,790
But I already understand my heart's true intent.

459
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,719
The only one who I want to marry is you.

460
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,719
Once I figure out Tang Huan's purpose tomorrow,

461
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:47,300
I will return to Fenghua Valley and ask you for a full answer.

462
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,970
[Double Happiness]

463
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:28,260
Xiao Xi, what are you doing here so late at night?

464
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,379
I... am taking a stroll.

465
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:35,720
That... Xue Ting, where is she?

466
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,960
Her belly was aching.

467
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,080
I asked Seventh Uncle to escort her to the town to find a good doctor.

468
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,220
Then, will they be able to return in time for the wedding?

469
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,540
The wedding is for us and does not involve other people.

470
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,380
Aren't you going to hold a banquet for the guests?

471
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,120
I heard a lot of people are already here from the Martial Arts World.

472
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,979
Isn't Seventh Uncle the most capable person by your side?

473
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:57,499
Don't you need him to make arrangements?

474
00:34:57,499 --> 00:35:00,600
Xiao Xi, don't worry. Everything has been arranged.

475
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,239
All the disciples in Tang Sect have been assigned their respective duty.

476
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,439
Then, where are those martial artists arranged to stay?

477
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:11,100
They are all in the side courtyard.

478
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,639
No wonder it's so quiet here. I thought there would be many people here to scold me.

479
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,159
Are you sure they're only here to attend the wedding instead of making trouble?

480
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:26,699
Xiao Xi, you don't need to worry about outsiders' gossips.

481
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:29,680
You also don't need to worry about these miscellaneous chores.

482
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,419
By the way, have you tried the wedding gown that I gave you?

483
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:35,139
Do you like it?

484
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:38,139
As long as you like it, everything is good.

485
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:41,380
I was afraid that we're in too big a rush to have the most beautiful wedding gown for you.

486
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:44,159
It's enough that I'm beautiful.

487
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:48,599
Xiao Xi, I promised you.

488
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,579
I must marry you in a grand style. We only get married once in our lifetime.

489
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:58,190
I must give my beloved lady the most memorable wedding so that there is no regret.

490
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,900
You are so eloquet in speaking, I'm getting goosebumps.

491
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,380
I should go back now.

492
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,419
Wait, Xiao Xi.

493
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:14,979
Xiao Xi, you still haven't told me that you love me.

494
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:17,339
Do you truly want to marry me?

495
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:24,919
You can rest assured. I've promised to marry you, so I definitely won't run away.

496
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,440
I really should go back to rest.

497
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,679
Otherwise, my skin will be dehydrated, and I won't look pretty.

498
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,719
Why is there such a strong smell of realgar?

499
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:47,099
There are many snakes in Shu land. So realgar is sprinkled around everywhere.

500
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,460
What's the matter? Are you not used to the smell?

501
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:53,079
It's fine. I'm going back now.

502
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,430
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

503
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,980
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

504
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:39,400
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I’ve become forgotten in the horizon ♫

505
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,980
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

506
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:50,420
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

507
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:56,330
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

508
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:02,150
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

509
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:07,990
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

510
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:13,760
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

511
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,710
♫ A gentle dream become reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

512
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:25,570
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested it again? ♫

513
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:31,470
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

514
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:37,220
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

515
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:46,120
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

516
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:56,480
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
