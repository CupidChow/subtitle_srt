[Episode 8]

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,000
Xiao Xi, I'll have to sever ties with you.

16
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,039
My father forced me to do this.

17
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,540
I'm not even crying. Why are you crying?

18
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,080
Wipe away your tears.

19
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,179
At least tell me how I'll die.

20
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:09,360
It's too brutal.

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
I can't bear to speak about it.

22
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,040
The valley master provided an elixir refinement method.

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,119
The imperial physicians approved it, but His Majesty insisted it was erroneous.

24
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,900
Perhaps he's astute from ingesting too many faux elixirs.

25
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,580
An imperial physician even said the ingredients and the method are not the most important to refine a miracle elixir.

26
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,480
The catalyst is the crux.

27
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,419
The catalyst has to be the invigorating blood of someone who has consumed ginseng and snow lotus.

28
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,099
Only then can a miracle elixir be created.

29
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,339
- What does that mean?
- Do I really need to elaborate further?

30
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:39,680
His Majesty wants to toss you into the elixir cauldron as the catalyst.

31
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,119
It was hard for me to become human.

32
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:51,419
Yet, I can't escape being devoured by others.

33
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,639
Even storybooks aren't so ridiculous.

34
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,099
If you have a shred of kindness left, let all of them leave.

35
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,760
Bring your wine here. Let me die in a different way.

36
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,439
Sure.

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,360
All of you can leave.

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,520
Your Highness...

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,479
I will be accountable to my imperial father for this.

40
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,079
Yes.

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,560
Xiao Xi,

42
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,600
I've done you wrong.

43
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,439
Save your breath.

44
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,719
Let me die in peace.

45
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,519
Don't let them damage my body.

46
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,419
Xiao Xi.

47
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:08,339
Xiao Xi. I promise you.

48
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,300
Stop looking.

49
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,920
You can't tell whether the wine is poisoned.

50
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,179
Yes.

51
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:54,960
It's impossible to tell the wickedness in one's heart.

52
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,739
When I'm buried and rotting in the ground,

53
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:03,440
I hope you'll live to an old age.

54
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,280
Beware of lightning.

55
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,180
Xiao Xi, don't hate me.

56
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,279
You aren't even worthy of my hate.

57
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,099
Rather, I pity you.

58
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:24,259
When you reach your end, I wonder if your imperial father will shed a tear for you.

59
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,539
Spare it.

60
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,060
Red Crane Top is lethal.

61
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,520
What do we tell His Majesty?

62
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,680
She's dead fromm the poison anyway.

63
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,080
She can't be the catalyst.

64
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,239
Even if imperial father is infuriated, he has no other option.

65
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,319
Toss the imperial physician who made this suggestion into the cauldron.

66
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,759
Since he's so afraid of death, I bet his body is stacked with medical supplements.

67
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,639
Personally deliver Xiao Xi to the unmarked burial mounds.

68
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,960
Just make sure those officials see that she's dead.

69
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,539
Don't damage her body.

70
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:28,219
That was her dying wish.

71
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:33,920
I have to fulfill it. Otherwise, I won't feel at peace for life.

72
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,460
Your Highness, this is Miss Ye's hairpin. Bury it with her belongings.

73
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,839
I'll keep it as a memory.

74
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:53,419
When she first put this on, I even asked her if she did so for me.

75
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,280
Your Highness.

76
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:23,999
In the end,

77
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,339
I still failed to save her.

78
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,360
I visited the burial mounds countless times in the past three years.

79
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,680
I only ever believed in myself.

80
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,740
This was the only time I prayed for a miracle.

81
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,759
I wasn't sure whether she'd be resurrected.

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,900
If I had a second chance,

83
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:48,739
would everything change?

84
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:53,100
How dare you say you don't harbor other intentions toward her!

85
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:07,219
I've been cursed since young, and I can't fall in love.

86
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,819
Otherwise, my heart will weaken until it stops.

87
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,500
How can I trust that you're not uttering lies?

88
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,670
You'll find out soon enough.

89
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,840
Don't forget that I'm your savior.

90
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,400
Are you going to fight me?

91
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,800
S-Save me.

92
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,800
I-I can't die.

93
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,900
I have to avenge her.

94
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,519
You know you can't beat me.

95
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,800
Yes, I'm indebted to you.

96
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,600
However, I hate your tone right now.

97
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,659
I also hate your gaze toward her.

98
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,679
That's only because she hides too many secrets.

99
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,179
In that case, I seek a single request of you.

100
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:40,659
As a physician, swear that you won't fall in love with her and keep your distance from her.

101
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,900
What if... she decides to come to me?

102
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,440
That will never happen!

103
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,820
Once she recalls who I am, she'll remember our past.

104
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,059
She won't spare a glance for other men.

105
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,640
I'm her fated partner.

106
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,720
If anyone stands in our path of being together,

107
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,639
I'll kill them.

108
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,440
In this world, only feelings can't be forced.

109
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,859
I must have my way!

110
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,499
All those nights

111
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,299
I dreamed about her sending me away.

112
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,479
Regret overwhelmed me countless times.

113
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:38,839
Why didn't I force her to leave with me?

114
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,679
Even if I had to drug her and abduct her,

115
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,439
at the very least, she wouldn't have ended up in the burial mounds alone.

116
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:47,640
That was the path she chose.

117
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,840
Even if she bled to death, she would've insisted on this path.

118
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,540
Why can't you give up?

119
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,240
No one in this world can decide another person's life.

120
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,879
It's the same even if she recalls who you are.

121
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,259
You're lying to me.

122
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:07,800
How dare you claim that you aren't in love!

123
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,959
This Heartless Curse

124
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,180
has persisted throughout each generation in Fenghua Valley.

125
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,300
It's the fate of the valley master.

126
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,180
Since we were acquaintances, I'll be frank with you.

127
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,899
If you insist on pestering her, you'll only bring more misfortune to others and yourself.

128
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,880
How would I know you wouldn't defy that destiny?

129
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,659
What if you're already in love but trapped by your circumstances?

130
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,459
I understand.

131
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,559
You're the prince regent right now.

132
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,939
Even a shake of your leg will cause the world to tremble.

133
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,339
However, your power doesn't threaten me.

134
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
My feelings for her doesn't matter.

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,559
If she refuses to be with you, it's pointless even if you rid this world of all men.

136
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,519
Right now, she's desperately rushing over here to save Tang Huan.

137
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,680
Yet, you're wasting time doubting me.

138
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,580
How ludicrous.

139
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,580
Who are you insulting?

140
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,520
I simply hit the nail on the head, didn't I?

141
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,599
She saved you because she pitied you!

142
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,780
Too bad, her pity is turned toward another now.

143
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,439
If you have the time to be interrogating me, why not eliminate Tang Huan first?

144
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:30,080
That's your true thoughts.

145
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,400
You want Tang Huan dead as well!

146
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,079
Of course, I will kill him.

147
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,959
As long as she doesn't meet any other men,

148
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,259
she will belong to me one day.

149
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,800
Goodness, Cang Qi.

150
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,740
When will you wake up from your fantasies?

151
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,280
I will turn them into reality.

152
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,240
That's much better than you, denying your fantasies.

153
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,559
Seems like our friendship has reached its end today.

154
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,319
So be it.

155
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,560
She was the reason we were acquainted.

156
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,359
I merely wanted your honesty, but you refused.

157
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,279
You forced my hand.

158
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,899
Let's make this a clean cut.

159
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:31,920
To become stronger, I trained hard with the martial arts skills she imparted to me.

160
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,679
Let's put them to the test today.

161
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,240
Mr. Tree, we meet again.

162
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,359
Why did I say "again"?

163
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,500
That's strange.

164
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,360
The journey shouldn't be this exhausting.

165
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,840
Move it!

166
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,120
Are you all right?

167
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,820
I'm fine.

168
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,359
Where are we?

169
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,420
These are probably craftsmen.

170
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,359
They were killed after their work was done.

171
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:14,120
Well, they were all humans once.

172
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,340
What's there to be scared of?

173
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,940
Shut up.

174
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,699
Didn't you want to get stronger? A few more glances will do the trick.

175
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,080
Don't take advantage of me while I'm weak.

176
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,800
I wonder who struck first.

177
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,919
Now, even I'm in this place.

178
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,719
Keep your mouth shut.

179
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,579
Let's get out of here.

180
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,620
I can't breathe.

181
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:48,359
You've just lost your wits from shock.

182
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,120
Don't you know your own condition?

183
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,640
Why did you even try to pick a fight in such a state?

184
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:08,259
Cang Qi, give me the pearl.

185
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,280
Let's go.

186
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
Miss Ye?

187
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,299
Miss Ye.

188
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,359
Miss Ye!

189
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,720
Inform everyone outside to relay this to the valley master.

190
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

191
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,499
You'll have to wait for him to cure your illness.

192
00:18:15,499 --> 00:18:18,360
Miss, please persevere.

193
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,419
Considering your condition earlier, you'll have to consume medication based on my prescription.

194
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,879
Otherwise, your health will only deteriorate.

195
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,800
Don't glare at me with such indignation.

196
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,539
I'm just honoring my medical ethics.

197
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:55,479
I overlooked your hostility to save you again.

198
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,560
Though, why does that hairpin contain such phenomenal power?

199
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,739
Why does she possess the Scripture of Materia Medica?

200
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:06,119
Everyone has their secrets.

201
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,159
Don't you?

202
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,799
Bai Yue, you made it out! I was sick with worry!

203
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,540
You...

204
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,400
Stand still and then talk.

205
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,540
What are you doing here?

206
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,960
I was worried about you.

207
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,779
You scared me to death! Feel my heartbeat!

208
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,699
My heart is still racing.

209
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:28,339
Your heart will only stop beating when you're dead.

210
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,820
Did you see my guards?

211
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,259
They're up ahead.

212
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,440
They're planning to blow this place up with explosives.

213
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,819
Your Highness, are they plotting to kill you here?

214
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:44,640
I didn't mean that.

215
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,960
I mean...

216
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,040
I came to Nanke Temple before.

217
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,960
I thought there'd be another exit, so I came searching.

218
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,079
Are all prince regents this snobbish?

219
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:03,940
Young Master Bai, why did he force you to come here?

220
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,880
Did he do something to you?

221
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,819
I'm not match for him, but if he coerces, bullies, or humiliates you,

222
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,399
I'll...

223
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,419
I won't cower before the rich and powerful.

224
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:16,860
I'll expend my wealth and assets to support your retaliation.

225
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,559
Forget it.

226
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,640
Fenghua Valley is also wealthy.

227
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,999
I don't need your help.

228
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,359
Where are you going?

229
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:27,219
Are you all right? Put on your robes!

230
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:29,060
Cang Qi has unusual mood swings.

231
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,979
I rushed over the moment I heard he captured you.

232
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,979
I even exhausted a few horses to get here.

233
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:36,019
I'm too pampered to be galloping with horses so desperately.

234
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:37,580
My back is breaking.

235
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,840
Do you have any medicine to relieve the pain?

236
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,059
What's wrong? Did I ask for too much?

237
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,999
Cang Qi is afraid that I'll save Tang Huan. I need an excuse to leave as soon as possible.

238
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:03,060
Isn't your back aching?

239
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,459
I'll do my best to help.

240
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:07,599
Let's discuss in the room.

241
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,799
In the room? Let's go!

242
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,739
That hurts. Hurts!

243
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:18,299
It'll take some time to heal your back.

244
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,840
Young Master Bai, can you treat me at my manor?

245
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,919
I'll require some medicinal herbs.

246
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,280
All right, you can leave.

247
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,359
Will he let you leave just so you can treat my back?

248
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,100
Probably. He's kindhearted.

249
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,359
What about me?

250
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:47,480
For our friendship, I risked my life and my reputation.

251
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Did you?

252
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,300
For goodness sake.

253
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,920
I've been on the road for the past few days.

254
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,599
I didn't even eat a decent meal.

255
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,219
Have a meal with me first.

256
00:21:57,219 --> 00:22:00,459
A meal won't take up much time.

257
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,720
I have something to tell you after the meal.

258
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,059
It concerns Miss Ye.

259
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,759
Tell me right now.

260
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,279
You'll skip the meal if I tell you.

261
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,040
If you don't talk, I'll make sure you never get to eat.

262
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,519
I-I'll tell you.

263
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:18,240
You're always so frantic about her.

264
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,379
You're desperate to escape Cang Qi's claws so that you can rush back to save Tang Huan, right?

265
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:26,780
As your confidante...

266
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,719
As your good friend, I've really contemplated this for you.

267
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,919
You're pretty frantic, aren't you?

268
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,279
Are you going to talk?

269
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:40,580
I-I'll talk.

270
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,380
I'll tell you.

271
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,599
I know that Miss Ye lost her memory, so she's easily tricked.

272
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:53,319
That's why I investigated Tang Huan out of the goodness of my heart.

273
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,820
The information I bought

274
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,119
relates the endless conflict between Tang Huan and Tang Yang.

275
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,579
Who knows which of these two sons really killed the Sect Leader?

276
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:06,160
After Tang Huan lost, he fled to the capital city from Shuzhong.

277
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,119
He even mingled into the Imperial Army.

278
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,060
Here's my guess.

279
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,559
He's probably trying to curry the crown prince's favor to get a title.

280
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,919
Before he could make a name for himself, the crown prince was killed by Cang Qi.

281
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,600
The Imperial Army was reevaluated, and Tang Huan went missing.

282
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,980
Tang Huan... has resided in Shuzhong and the capital city.

283
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,259
Perhaps he was already acquainted with Miss Ye.

284
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:31,280
Does he harbor other intentions for approaching Miss Ye this time?

285
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,859
I had an inkling Tang Huan was suspicious.

286
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,179
During the attack of Tang Sect, if I hadn't used a secret weapon and forced him to shield Ye Xi,

287
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,200
the one suffering from the Storm Pear Flower Needle would be her.

288
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,880
It's fine, Xiao Xi. I can wait.

289
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,580
I owe my life to you.

290
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,079
I just wanted to express my feelings for you.

291
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:00,319
Can I repay you with the rest of my life?

292
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,219
Repay me?

293
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:13,319
Two of you, get up.

294
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,380
Get up! They're gone!

295
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,799
Thanks for the hard work!

296
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:31,880
Can I ask... who stabbed me earlier? If I were killed, who would pay you guys?

297
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:36,499
I should've told her sooner that Seventh Uncle was feigning death.

298
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:38,599
That, too, was Tang Huan's ploy.

299
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,819
Are you done?

300
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,340
If you are, get out.

301
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,839
You're not going to eat?

302
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,539
Leave.

303
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:49,399
Get moving.

304
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,760
But...

305
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,259
What a nuisance.

306
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,939
Without the valley master's approval,

307
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:09,960
I dare not take you into the valley.

308
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,420
Xiao Xi.

309
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,399
Xiao Xi...

310
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,200
Xiao Xi.

311
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,619
Have we arrived?

312
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,799
This is the entrance of Fenghua Valley.

313
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:12,100
Is this Fenghua Valley?

314
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,720
Xiao Xi, ever since I met you, you've saved me time and again.

315
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
I don't know how I can repay you.

316
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,980
If I survive this ordeal, I'll repay you with the rest of my life.

317
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,300
You don't have to offer your life to me.

318
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,680
Don't always... give up your life.

319
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,899
Xiao Xi, how did you find this place?

320
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:37,279
It must've been arduous.

321
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,519
Your loyal servant gave me a sketch of a map.

322
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,000
When we reached Changliu Mountain, the map couldn't do much.

323
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,499
I guess intuition led me here.

324
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:51,900
It'll probably be even more dangerous in there.

325
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,960
Rumor has it that Fenghua Valley is filled with traps and highly skilled guards.

326
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,060
We'll only meet the valley master after overcoming many tests.

327
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,419
However, as long as we fulfill the valley master's request, he'll definitely offer his help.

328
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:09,459
He's even capable of saving a man at his dying breath.

329
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,019
Please rest. Don't talk.

330
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:19,620
I know the valley master is so impressive that he can raise the dead.

331
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:23,600
Xiao Xi, don't push yourself.

332
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,100
If I'm really incurable,

333
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,559
that's fine.

334
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,300
Even if I die, I'll be filled with gratitude for you.

335
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,159
Be optimistic.

336
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,499
Even the hardest of the valley master's request won't daunt me.

337
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:40,580
I'll get him to save you.

338
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,340
Xiao Xi.

339
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,480
Sleep for a little while.

340
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,319
When you're awake, you'll meet the valley master.

341
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,919
Come on.

342
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,539
If you refuse to sleep, you'll just be adding on to my troubles.

343
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,879
He caused her such misery.

344
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:53,360
Why did he illustrate so much of their past?

345
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,839
Didn't he mention his constant nightmares?

346
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:00,660
He wasn't feeling uneasy from his wicked deeds.

347
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,299
That was just an excuse.

348
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:10,180
I really wish I could turn him to dust!

349
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,840
She refused to leave with me back then.

350
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,519
She still chose to return.

351
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,400
I lost what I desperately tried to obtain. He obtained it but didn't treasure it.

352
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,380
Do you understand this feeling?

353
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,520
I don't feel anything.

354
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:38,900
Still uttering denials?

355
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,800
Are you just happy to subject yourself to the curse?

356
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,320
This is my destiny. Pry no further.

357
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,920
Leave if you're busy.

358
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,100
The Black Armored Guards reported about ruffians in the capital city.

359
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,660
I'll head back to deal with them and then look for Xiao Xi.

360
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,760
Since love is impossible between you two,

361
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,419
I won't force you to defy your medical ethics.

362
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:08,279
However, you have to promise me one thing.

363
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:13,239
Do whatever you can to make her leave Tang Huan.

364
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:17,440
As long as my medical ethics aren't compromised and Fenghua Valley's rules aren't broken,

365
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,240
there's no reason for me to reject you.

366
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,090
Excellent.

367
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,960
Once that is done, I'll send you a generous gift

368
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,840
to thank you for saving me again.

369
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,760
If you fail to accomplish this task, I'll lead the Black Armored Guards to raze Fenghua Valley to the ground.

370
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:44,760
Why weren't I the first man she fell in love with?

371
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,500
I failed to find the dragon bone this time.

372
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,739
Her memory loss won't be cured.

373
00:30:56,739 --> 00:31:01,000
However, someone as carefree as her won't harp on the past.

374
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,970
♫ Always unyielding and never speak rashly... ♫

375
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,910
Are you all right?

376
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,970
♫ ... yet I’m willing to risk my life for you ♫

377
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,400
Cang Qi is already gone. Why are you...

378
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,539
Why are you still here?

379
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,159
Are you admiring the moon?

380
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,580
How can you ditch me once you no longer need me?

381
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,040
Though... I don't mind.

382
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,620
I'll head to the capital city and keep an eye on Cang Qi for you.

383
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,000
I'll report any news to you at once.

384
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
By the way, that pigeon you borrowed is an exorbitant thousand-mile pigeon.

385
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,759
It has yet to return.

386
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,980
Did you roast it?

387
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,660
That's bad. Ye Xi is in trouble.

388
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,960
Young Master!

389
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,160
It's fine if you ate it.

390
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,040
- Young Master!
- I don't mind since we're friends.

391
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,880
But what could possibly happen to Miss Ye?

392
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,400
♫ All my misfortunes becomes understated ♫

393
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:03,130
♫ After many upheavals, our love hasn’t diminished, just like the day we first met ♫

394
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,200
♫ With every passing year ♫

395
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,070
♫ Our longings for each other are stacked into eternity ♫

396
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,780
Pitch darkness that hides evil.

397
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,500
Light births all life and nature.

398
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,459
Does this Solar Sword from Eldest Mistress Lin contain too much Yang energy?

399
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,879
Such an audacious sword.

400
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:51,100
I didn't even do a thing.

401
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,159
Did I pass the first trial that quickly?

402
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,120
Where are the assassins and traps?

403
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:38,920
Did my martial arts skills improve again?

404
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,299
I barely unleashed one strike, but everything vanished.

405
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,580
How is she?

406
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:17,179
Miss Ye's internal strength is robust, so she's fine for now.

407
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,660
So why did you call for me so desperately?

408
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:24,940
I'm sure you'll dash back even if she's unscathed.

409
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,099
Let's get back to a serious matter.

410
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:30,579
I read her pulse, but it was too peculiar.

411
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:34,099
I was truly worried that she'd never regain consciousness

412
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:39,200
and pass away.

413
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:41,939
Uncle Hui.

414
00:34:41,939 --> 00:34:45,000
- Don't read the pulses of others so casually.
- I...

415
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,720
She already passed the second trial.

416
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,320
You may be able to deceive others, but not me.

417
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,099
You're worried over her.

418
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:58,059
Let's spare her from the third trial.

419
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:02,280
Ask those at the pagoda to retreat as well. Why make a fuss?

420
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,700
Let her enter. I'll get her medicine.

421
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,200
Uncle Hui, keep an eye on her.

422
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,639
Call for me if there's an emergency.

423
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,119
Who's on duty at the pagoda today?

424
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,099
Yang Ke. What's wrong? Do you want him to go easy on her?

425
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,799
Subtly go easy on her?

426
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:50,680
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi
