Fenghua Valley, located at the magnificent peak of Western Jin's Changliu Mountain.

16
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,880
Fenghua Valley's Valley Master, Bai Yue is a famous young physician in the martial arts world.

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,500
He is superb in swordsmanship.

His medical skills are even more outstanding.

But only a few people have seen what he looks like.

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,659
His years of experimenting with medicines have left him with a lingering illness.

He has to keep on taking ginseng in order to stay alive.

I've cultivated under the Changliu Mountain for a thousand years, and I can finally be able to explore.

This won't do. You already have my rootlets.

00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,960
It's actually harmful to you if you eat other ginseng.

She was also in the underground palace.

That's impossible. Who else can come in here?

120

Ever since you got into trouble, it's been strictly guarded.

121

The underground palace is already closed.

122

You rascal. If you barge into the forbidden area again, I'll really have to punish you harshly.

That's enough. Get a good rest.

Such a big incident occurred in the underground palace.

It's necessary to review the precautions.

139
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:47,719
Ever since Bai Yue got hurt last time, he's been in a daze.

140
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,080
He doesn't remember who happened.

141
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,559
He's even had hallucinations.

142
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,940
He said there are strangers in the valley.

143
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,399
That would be hallucinations.

00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,159
I need to go back to sleep.

152
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,310
Maybe I have to wait until my hair grows long again to recover.

153

At that time, I'll have to cultivate some more before I can return to visit you.

Her name is Ye Xi.

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,759
So she helped Tang Yang to retrieve the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

162
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,200
[Mo Sect]

163
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,499
But Tang Yang claimed he was avenging the Mo Sect

164
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:40,219
but actually used the opportunity to annihilate the Mo Sect.

165
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,220
Tang Yang also cajoled the lone survivor, Mo family's eldest miss, Mo Rou,

166
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,060
to testify against Ye Xi and caused outrage in the martial arts world.

167
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,300
Right now, all the major sects are pursuing Ye Xi.

168
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
- Don't run!
- Stop right there!

169
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,059
Stop right there!

170
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,100
Stop right there! Stop right there!

171
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,419
Stop right there!

172
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:19,319
Don't run!

173
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Demoness!

174
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,699
Hand over the Storm Pear Flower Needle!

175
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:36,200
It's up to you to believe it or not,

176
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,350
but Tang Sect's trouble has nothing to do with me.

177
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,900
The eldest miss of Mo Sect testified to the Lord of Martial Arts World Alliance

178
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,319
that you are the culprit who stole the Storm Pear Flower Needle and killed everyone in the Mo Sect.

179
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,240
Tang Sect also testified that you unsuccessfully seduced Young Lord Tang Yang,

180
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,000
and then stole the secret books from the Tang Sect and the other sects.

181
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,340
A demoness like you who does all kinds of evil,

182
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,400
we must uphold justice for everyone in the martial arts world.

183
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,839
Brothers, kill this demoness!

184
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,680
Let's eradicate evil for the martial arts world.

185
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,760
I've never killed anyone.

186
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,400
Is justice in the martial arts world

187
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,200
so indiscriminate?

188
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,040
Come at me then!

189
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:53,840
Heaven as my witness, not killing is harder than killing.

190
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,359
It's been so hard for me.

191
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,279
Xiao Xi, I'm here to pick you up.

192
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,240
Come home with me.

193
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,880
You're also here to kill me.

194
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,560
Xiao Xi, you always surprise me.

195
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:56,960
Your martial arts are outstanding.

196
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,900
I'm sure not many in the martial arts world are a match for you.

197
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,939
So what?

198
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:08,099
Must I be the public enemy of the whole martial arts world?

199
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:10,980
You're to blame for this.

200
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,219
They accuse me of seducing you.

201
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:15,699
When have I ever done that?

202
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:18,259
Weren't you the one who adored my chivalrous nature?

203
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:20,800
I was fooled into believing that you were a righteous man.

204
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,739
Xiao Xi,

205
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,660
I genuinely adore you.

206
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,979
You possess an ethereal beauty and phenomenal martial arts.

207
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:36,199
However, I married Mo Rou because Mo Sect has the Storm Pear Flower Needle that I desire.

208
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:38,299
Yet, they still treated me like a stranger.

209
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:42,220
In that case, they're forcing me and Tang Sect to resort to extreme measures.

210
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,780
How am I involved in your scuffles?

211
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,319
I don't wish to hurt you either.

212
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,840
Let us reunite in our next lives.

213
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:24,219
The needle is tipped with Tang Sect's new Tears of Yearning concoction.

214
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:26,859
In fact, as simple word like love

215
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,559
is the most lethal poison.

216
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,419
At least bury me.

217
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:41,599
I didn't want to kill you either,

218
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,320
but Mo Rou brings more benefits than you do.

219
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,100
She has what I want.

220
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,839
I can only trade for it with your life.

221
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:54,419
It's not easy for me to serve Tang Sect either.

222
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:58,600
Don't resent me for this.

223
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:04,470
In this life, we can only part.

224
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,319
Farewell.

225
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,480
Ye Xi.

226
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,920
The moment I heard about you, I dashed over from the mountains.

227
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,739
I was still too late.

228
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,999
I know you're the girl who saved me in the ancient tomb.

229
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,520
I didn't think that parting would be an eternal farewell.

230
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:40,060
I can no longer repay my debt of gratitude.

231
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,319
Martial artists boast about their chivalry,

232
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:50,300
but those who can truly sacrifice themselves for others are few and far between.

233
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,700
Yet, someone as kind as you has been sullied by the world.

234
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,460
They even caused your ruin.

235
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,639
Thank goodness you're a ginseng fairy.

236
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:08,440
Ginseng grows in the ground.

237
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,280
I've checked the ancient records.

238
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,659
I'll bury you deep in the ground.

239
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:16,559
May you reawaken one day.

240
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,319
There's a chance that your memory will be wiped clean.

241
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:26,300
However, as long as you open those eyes again,

242
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,080
I will find you .

243
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:45,260
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫

244
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,450
[Five Years Later]

245
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,179
Where am I?

246
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,459
Why am I here?

247
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,659
Is this the burial mounds described in books?

248
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,850
(noises)

249
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,480
(noises)

250
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,600
Oh my!

251
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,559
Everyone, did you hear something?

252
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,359
No, I didn't.

253
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:59,000
Is there anyone out there?

254
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:02,400
Give me a hand! Help!

255
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,680
The gates of hell have opened!

256
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,300
Help!

257
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,880
N-N-Niu!

258
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,259
Wang Daniu, get your behind back here!

259
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,800
Miss?

260
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:23,755
Miss? Miss?

261
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:26,600
Young lady, wake up! Are you all right?

262
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,879
Thank goodness. She didn't die of fright.

263
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,919
If she did, that would've caused a horrible misunderstanding.

264
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,019
I'm sorry.

265
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,519
I didn't mean to startle everyone.

266
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:47,359
But you all are way too cowardly.

267
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,000
Well, be it.

268
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,500
The date, place, and hour right now make such a misunderstanding totally understandable.

269
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:04,240
But why am I here?

270
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,459
I should find a place for a bath first.

271
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,960
Young lady, lie there for now.

272
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,379
I'll get someone to collect you later.

273
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:27,839
I'm such a gorgeous woman.

274
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,339
Why did I end up in unmarked burial mounds?

275
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:36,140
Let me recall the story's plot.

276
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,200
Got it.

277
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,880
As the top beauty of the martial arts world, the strongest martial artist fell in love with me at first sight.

278
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,780
After that, the young lords of the various sects were besotted by my beauty as well.

279
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,440
As a result, a war broke out in the martial arts world.

280
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,260
Even the imperial court was involved.

281
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,960
The current emperor and aristocrats were captivated by me too.

282
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,219
In order to win my heart, the world spiraled into chaos.

283
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,640
In the end, I could only sacrifice my own life

284
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,359
to ensure the peace of the martial arts world and the entire country.

285
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,960
- Miss Ye!
- Wait for me!

286
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,039
- Miss Ye!
- Miss Ye!

287
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:20,480
- Miss Ye, wait for me!
- Miss Ye!

288
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,440
- Beautiful lady!
- Miss Ye!

289
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,960
Beautiful lady!

290
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,860
Miss Ye!

291
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,880
Miss Ye!

292
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,000
Don't jump!

293
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,400
Don't jump down!

294
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,639
No!

295
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:35,680
Beautiful lady!

296
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,159
No!

297
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,799
No, that's not it.

298
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,739
The story didn't go like that.

299
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:50,360
I'm sure they had their reasons for not jumping after me to save me.

300
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,960
One thing's for certain.

301
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,540
They were deeply in love with me.

302
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,300
After my death, they lost all desire to live.

303
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,680
They committed suicide for love.

304
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,039
Unfortunately, such foolish devotion.

305
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:09,280
Beautiful women truly suffer cursed lives.

306
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,260
Those stories are false.

307
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,119
I heard those villagers talk about a ghost sighting at the burial mounds.

308
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,019
I thought there'd be something exciting in store.

309
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,580
So, it's just you.

310
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,820
How can there be someone so handsome in this world?

311
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,039
You're really alive.

312
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,510
Hey.

313
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:38,020
An ordinary man bumping into a lady bathing would leave at once to avoid suspicion.

314
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,920
You aren't just staying put, but you're staring.

315
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,219
You didn't even blink once.

316
00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:46,559
But... why are you so composed?

317
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,319
Am I not pretty enough?

318
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,280
That's impossible.

319
00:31:58,621 --> 00:31:59,759
I got it.

320
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,940
I bet your courtship was rejected by me and you resent me to this day.

321
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,480
You have to get this through your head.

322
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,859
A stunning beauty like me is very hard to woo.

323
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:13,600
Why has she become so narcissistic after her resurrection?

324
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,979
Perhaps she was duped too miserably in her past life, so her subconscious is in denial.

325
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:20,519
Repeat yourself.

326
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,699
I have no impression of you, but your attitude toward me is horrible.

327
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:30,240
All I can construe is hatred borne from love.

328
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:35,759
Were you the culprit who buried me at the burial mounds?

329
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,140
As expected, she has lost her memory.

330
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:43,140
Do you know me?

331
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,440
What is my name?

332
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,659
I really can't remember.

333
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:55,219
Well... it's a little chilly at night.

334
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:58,680
How about we speak after I get out of here?

335
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,559
We can let bygones by bygones.

336
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:06,159
Since we've met again, can you lend me some clothes?

337
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:09,359
By the way, what's your name?

338
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,980
Should I call you "Older Brother"?

339
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,039
Kind Brother, I'm begging you.

340
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,839
Kind Brother! Don't leave!

341
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,739
Kind Brother!

342
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:30,400
Kind Brother! Wait up!

343
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,200
Hold on!

344
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,380
The Yin energy here is too potent.

345
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,520
Her blood clots need to be expelled. Otherwise, there might be further implications.

346
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,720
Thank you, Kind Brother!

347
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,359
Don't call me that.

348
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,240
Who knows where you picked that up from?

349
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,720
Don't you have any sense of shame?

350
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,079
Fine, all right.

351
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,720
I'll stop calling you that.

352
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,800
Well, can you tell me—

353
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,199
Listen up, your name is Wang Tieshuan.

354
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,679
No way.

355
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,019
I'm so pretty. How can I have such a name?

356
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:19,620
Is that so? I'm so handsome, but you don't seem to have any memory of me either.

357
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,840
Wang Village is the closest place around.

358
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,920
There's the folk saying that a plain name ensures a good life.

359
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,920
So, it isn't unusual for you to have such a name.

360
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,159
That does make sense.

361
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,960
But that name is such a bad fit for me.

362
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,020
Well, is the burial mounds a place for a stunning beauty?

363
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,319
Every single martial artist and aristocrat are head over heels for you.

364
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:42,880
Yet, you've been dumped in the burial mounds.

365
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,480
In the end, not a single person came to collect your body.

366
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,300
I wonder what story has such a horribly flawed plot.

367
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,280
How could you eavesdrop on me?

368
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,800
You were the one hollering away.

369
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
She still seems very frail.

370
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,679
I have to take her to the city to recuperate at once.

371
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,760
Can you rein in that sharp tongue?

372
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,039
I'm about to puke blood from anger.

373
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,679
Well, puke it out.

374
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:09,499
You have way too many enemies anyway. I'm sure you won't live for long.

375
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:12,259
I have many enemies? What do you mean by that?

376
00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:13,719
Come into the city with me.

377
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,419
I'll explain to you then.

378
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,299
I'm not following you into the city.

379
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,719
Explain what you mean by having many enemies.

380
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,320
I can't tell you yet.

381
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,559
If you want to find out, come with me.

382
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,159
Make your choice.

383
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:41,060
Why are you bent on taking me into the city? Are you a twisted human trafficker?

384
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,779
Are you planning to sell me to the city's brothel?

385
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:49,559
W-Wait! C-Calm down!

386
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:53,399
I'll go with you, b-but I can't be dressed like this.

387
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:55,679
Find me some clothes.

388
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:16,520
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

389
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:22,130
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

390
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:28,280
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

391
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:34,150
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

392
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:39,550
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

393
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:45,470
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

394
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:51,270
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

395
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:57,030
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

396
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:02,890
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

397
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:08,910
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

398
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:14,660
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

399
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:20,640
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

400
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,480
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

401
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:35,270
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

402
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:45,580
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
