[Episode 18]

15
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,980
Bai Yue, you've deceived me time and again.

16
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,540
Have you already forgotten what you promised me when you took her away from the palace?

17
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,879
When I received the news, I was actually feeling grateful to you.

18
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,359
But in a blink of an eye, the two of you have become a fugitive couple.

19
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:15,319
Even if I could tolerate her liking another man, but you absolutely should not be that man.

20
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,759
You kept saying that it was impossible for you to be with her.

21
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,713
That's why I believed you and personally entrusted her to you.

22
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,124
Yet you played me as a fool.

23
00:02:25,124 --> 00:02:27,231
What else do you have to say?

24
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,700
- Bring him!
- Yes.

Young Master Bai.

26
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,539
I happened to run into your buddy on the way here.

27
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,060
When he heard there was trouble in Fenghua Valley, he hurriedly rushed over.

28
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,019
I was also in a hurry. So I brought him along.

29
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,360
If he is not enough, I heard that the Bai family clan's land is located around Moon River.

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,280
Those others that escaped from Fenghua Valley must be there now.

31
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,517
No matter how hard it is to search, it's just a river.

32
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:08,000
I have plenty of manpower.

33
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,660
Let go of them. I'm the only one you want.

34
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,058
You're the only one I've ever wanted right from the beginning.

35
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,700
I won't make it difficult for you.

36
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,780
You told me yourself.

37
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,920
You suffer from a searing heart, and the death will be horrible.

38
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,882
As long as you take responsibility, I will let go of the others.

39

Young Master Bai!

40
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,499
Is the way I look now not horrible enough?

41
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:56,800
As for suffering from a searing heart, I already feel numb.

42
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,714
It's not necessary for you to make the kill.

43
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:03,120
I may be going to see the king of hell anytime now.

44

She is being nice to me now out of kindness toward a dying person.

45
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:15,860
Tang Huan was able to destroy Fenghua Valley because of her.

46
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,059
She is only repaying what she owes me.

47
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,800
Let me take over the vengeance.

48
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,959
Tang Huan shouldn't have been tolerated back then.

49
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,580
Tang Sect should have been razed to the ground to totally root out evil.

50

What exactly is his incurable illness?

54
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,680
Weren't you so hateful of him that you were about to kill him?

55
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,383
As long as you aren't in love with him,

00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:52,920
I wouldn't be so callous to a dying man.

I'll find the best doctor for him.

60
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,240
No need. It's useless to find any doctor.

61
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,340
He himself is a miracle physician.

62
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,399
He has an incurable illness. It's heart exhaustion.

63
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,339
Each successive valley master of Fenghua Valley died in the prime of life.

64

He will wake up, however.

65
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:37,559
He is only sleeping now.

66
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,805
How long can he still live?

00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:42,439
I don't know.

68
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:45,520
But he will live until he dies.

- I finally got away from her.
- You should immediately go to her.

Of course, it's to return to Fenghua Valley for revenge.

I will go with you. I have the Black Armored Guards with us.

Now that the imperial court is stabilized, I will never leave you.

The rumors in the martial arts world say that Miss Ye really is a demoness.

00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:16,180
I'm fine.

160
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,260
Do you remember what you just did for me?

161
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,670
♫ Day and night, I’ll protect you unconditionally ♫
♫ How many times have we been through life and death? ♫

162
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,369
Are you treating me like your painkiller?

163
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:35,100
♫ All my misfortunes becomes understated ♫

164
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,699
I also want to try this method.

165
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:41,300
Maybe it can relieve my fatigue.

166
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:50,300
♫ With every passing year, our longings for each other are stacked into eternity ♫

167
00:15:50,300 --> 00:16:01,500
♫ The road gradually becomes farther, we will abide by our long-ago promise to be together forever ♫

168
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,600
His Highness is still not up?

169
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
That's right.

170
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,620
Your Highness!

171
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,740
Your Highness!

172
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,799
- Your Highness!
- What are you doing? Get out!

173
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,279
Yes.

174
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,961
Did you get scared?

175
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,410
I will marry you right away and give you the best of everything in the world.

176
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,559
Can you wait a few days? I need to take care of some matters.

177
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,799
Where are you going?

178
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,899
Fenghua Valley?

179
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,853
I will go with you.

180
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,880
Come here.

181
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,880
These days, a lot of devious sects and factions in the martial arts world are hunting me down.

182
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,680
They use vicious means.

183
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,279
Can you dispatch the Black Armored Guards to capture them?

184
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,920
Capture them alive, and don't torture them.

185
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,459
Just locked them up in dark rooms.

186
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:46,682
Give them food and beverages, but don't let them see or hear.

187
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:49,874
Let's see how long they can endure.

188
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:55,199
If anyone begs for forgiveness with a good attitude before it's over, they can be released after seven days.

189
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,680
Sure.

190
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Leave it to me.

191
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,799
I'll definitely make them kneel and beg for forgiveness.

192
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,299
Good.

193
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,740
You only need to handle this matter for me.

194
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,359
No need to intervene on anything else.

195
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:12,139
Tang Huan didn't come after me. It means he is still in the valley.

196
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:14,830
I will go there to kill him with my own hands.

197
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:21,200
Once I've killed him, I will escort Bai Yue to Moon River so that he can return to the Bai family clan.

198
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:31,679
These two men, one is my enemy, the other is my savior.

199
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,359
I must take care of these two matters by myself.

200
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,340
Otherwise, my conscience will feel bad.

201
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,479
We were both drunk last night.

202
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:54,640
If you are truly committed to me, you should trust me.

203
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,039
Give me a little more time.

204
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,740
Let me finish my mission, all right?

205
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,879
Since you are so insistent, I will agree.

206
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:13,400
I will be right here waiting for you, and I'll prepare our wedding.

207
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,300
I'm only giving you seven days.

208
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,353
You must return when the time is up.

209
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:22,080
Otherwise, even if it's to the ends of the world, I will find you.

210
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,339
Miss Ye, I've fed the horse for you. Travel safe.

211
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,499
Yes, thank you.

212
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,660
Go!

213
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,099
Your Highness.

214
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,459
Dispatch guards to follow and protect the princess consort in secret.

215
00:19:58,459 --> 00:19:59,959
Also,

216
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,156
if Bai Yue dies, report to me immediately.

217
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:06,640
Yes.

218
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,860
Your Highness, could he be pretending to be ill?

219
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,160
Haven't you suspected at all?

220
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,060
The Bai Yue who I know is full of pride and would never lose to me.

221
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,900
But now, he lets me raise my sword to his neck.

222
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,959
As well, he has always been mindful of his appearance.

223
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:34,259
The way he's changed into now, he is the one who cannot tolerate it the most.

224
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,720
Therefore, he really is dying.

225
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,800
If he recovers and dares to fight me for my woman, I will definitely kill him.

226
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,119
Princess Consort is already my woman.

227
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,300
I believe her.

228
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,979
I've already waited such a long time. What're seven more days?

229
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,519
After seven days, enmity and grace are evened out, the living and the dead are separated,

230
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:08,840
she and her heart will thoroughly and forever belong to only me.

231
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,780
Stop.

232
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,673
Why don't I pass some more spiritual power to you?

233
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,769
It's not a good idea that you keep passing spiritual power to me.

234
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:50,219
I'm fine.

235
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:53,820
I've decided. We are going back to Fenghua Valley.

236
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,879
I know that you want to go back to Fenghua Valley to revenge against Tang Huan.

237
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,079
But it's too risky for you to do it alone.

238
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,700
So you want Cang Qi to carry out the revenge for me?

239
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,479
Once he starts, there will be a massacre with the bloodbath out of control.

240
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,839
He is actually not a bad person.

241
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,059
It's just that his past experiences were too painful.

242
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:19,043
He is very talented in governing a nation.

243
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:22,620
Since he trusts you, you can give him guidance.

244
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,440
It will benefit the people.

245
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,179
There is still residual poison in his body, so I've been prescribing medicine to nurture him.

246
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,519
So he really is ill.

247
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,099
Later on, I'll speak nicely to give him advice.

248
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:35,000
But your body is the most important right now.

249
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,360
Upon our return to Fenghua Valley, I'd like to see if there's a way to lift the curse.

250
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,720
Didn't you say the curse was invoked by the first valley master?

251
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,919
In that case, let's go back to the initial location for the search.

252
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:53,980
Since you said that the forbidden area is sealed, if it can be re-opened, maybe we can find the answer?

253
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,259
The forbidden area is sealed due to a collapse.

254
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:00,575
It cannot be reopened by human strength.

255
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:07,839
Then... There has to be a way. We have to give it a try.

256
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,380
All right.

257
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,140
Ye Xi.

258
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,620
Where are those pursuers who are hunting us down?

259
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,400
I'm letting the Black Armored Guards eradicate those varmints.

260
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,320
I came up an idea for Cang Qi not to start a massacre.

261
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,859
I'm really curious. How did you deceive him?

262
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,979
Didn't I tell you already? I used illusion.

263
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:39,091
Most people won't understand.

264
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,361
Why won't you look me in the eye then?

265
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:52,102
Is it because my current appearance can't compare to the past?

266
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,839
In my eyes, you are always the best.

267
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:02,420
Your elegant demeanor is incomparable in the world.

268
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,060
Every word and every move is impeccable.

269
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,539
With your white hair, you look like a celestial immortal who is demoted to the mortal realm.

270
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,240
You are admired by the whole world.

271
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,800
This is nauseating.

272
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,659
If you say anything so nauseating again, beware that I will...

273
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:32,980
What will you do to me? If the whole world admires you, of course, I can't help but succumb to you.

274
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,619
Sure.

275
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:38,319
I will enjoy your pampering and be proud then.

276
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,140
Let's go.

277
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,830
Go. Go.

278
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,650
Halt.

279
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,159
I could see you two from afar.

280
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,679
- It's truly—
- It's truly better to have a loving couple than one immortal.

281
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:08,900
How did you escape from the mass of encircling Black Armored Guards?

282
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,900
At this perilous moment, you actually have the idle time to be romantic.

283
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,079
You'd better protect yourself.

284
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:19,939
Without you as a hostage, it would be easier for us to carry out the mission.

285
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:23,119
Your words are making me sad.

286
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,219
Why did you run away faster than a rabbit?

287
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:27,240
It's like I stepped on your tail.

288
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,919
It would have been useless even if I didn't run.

289
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,040
It's useless when you have so few guards with you.

290
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,900
Nonsense. If you are with me,

291
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,459
- I'll just say you are the son-in-law of Flowing Water Manor.
- What?

292
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:42,359
The Prince Regent won't touch you out of respect for me.

293
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:44,659
This... I've bothered you enough.

294
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:46,339
Don't be nervous.

295
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:48,640
I didn't mean I'd really force you.

296
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,639
I'm just giving you a title.

297
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:55,159
Otherwise, can you traverse the martial arts world only depending on your money?

298
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:56,879
Do you think you've lived long enough?

299
00:25:56,879 --> 00:26:01,060
I should go back to Bailu City and live as an idle rich for a few years.

300
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,020
Are you scared of my father?

301
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,759
No problem. I'll just say that I'm pregnant.

302
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:10,479
The rice is already cooked.

303
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,200
- No...
- Wait.

304
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,219
Haven't you advanced a little too fast?

305
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:18,340
No, no, no.

306
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,860
Nevertheless, I should thank you. You'd better go back.

307
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,830
Under your father's protection, no one will dare touch you.

308
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,359
As for us, we will go back to Fenghua Valley first.

309
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,319
We'll send you a message if there is any need.

310
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,519
It is time to clean up those devious sects and factions.

311
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,820
But, just with the two of us, can you handle it?

312
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,099
Oh yes, Tang Huan's Storm Pear Flower Needle was destroyed by me.

313
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:47,000
Good job!

314
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,219
It's too bad that I didn't end things decisively back then.

315
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:51,380
This time, I won't be softhearted.

316
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,039
Wait and see.

317
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,680
As the legendary demoness in the martial arts world, I won't be scared even by an army of thousands.

318
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,820
Your imposing manner is really stronger than mine.

319
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,980
Listen, I even want to become a demoness.

320
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,400
Come.

321
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,720
Calm down. Calm down. That's enough. That's enough.

322
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,600
Well... Don't let me see you so intimate with others from now on.

323
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,260
So petty.

324
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,020
When I chased after you before, you never showed a friendly face to me.

325
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:28,259
Now that I chase Ye Xi instead of you, you still don't show me a friendly face.

326
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:33,700
It's precisely because you always look mean to people, that's why your face looks so ghastly now.

327
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,380
Even your hair has turned white.

328
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,459
Don't talk anymore.

329
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:40,299
Everyone, we bid our farewell now.

330
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:43,180
Goodbye.

331
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,260
Does my face look ghastly?

332
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,739
No.

333
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:52,680
Young Master, you look especially spirited, with red lips and white teeth.

334
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,059
We should leave too.

335
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,835
Young Master Bai is already looking like that. How can you still criticize him?

336
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:10,380
I know I should act normal, but I forgot to be restrained as I was talking.

337
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,800
How did Bai Yue get an incurable disease?

338
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,799
He is a miracle physician.

339
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,520
If he can't even cure himself, how can he be a miracle physician?

340
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,007
Are we really leaving then?

341
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:41,540
Once my father assigns more guards for me, we'll be able to help them.

342
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:55,060
I hope this trail can keep leading us there.

343
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,319
Look at the trail, not at me.

344
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,480
You've given me your hand, why should I watch where we're going?

345
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:08,459
Don't trust people so easily in the future.

346
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:10,880
Otherwise, you'll always be the one who is taken advantage.

347
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,980
I trust you just like I trust myself.

348
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,619
I'm talking about other people.

349
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:18,999
Other than you, there won't be anyone else.

350
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,020
This is bad. Someone is following us.

351
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,599
What do we do?

352
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,599
Don't worry.

353
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:36,719
To prevent outsiders from intruding into Changliu Mountain, there are always traps all around Fenghua Valley.

354
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:40,120
Starting now, you must remember every one of my footprints.

355
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,819
Don't make a wrong step, and you won't trigger the trap.

356
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:46,959
Go.

357
00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:03,399
I heard the followers of Five Poison Sect have been captured by the Black Armored Guards.

358
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:05,568
Luckily we ran fast.

359
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,079
Don't the demons only live in the storybooks?

360
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,459
I've never seen a live one.

361
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:11,559
And it's one with formidable martial arts skill.

362
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,520
If she really is a demoness, how could she rampage under broad daylight?

363
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,300
Maybe her cultivation reached a certain level.

364
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,480
What cultivation level? What demons?

365
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,790
Can she eat people, or can she summon the wind and the rain?

366
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,323
If she is really that powerful,

367
00:30:27,323 --> 00:30:32,099
she wouldn't be running like a rat being hunted by us.

368
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:36,079
She just has a bewitching face and her skills are unnatural.

369
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:41,299
These kinds of unnatural skills must have been obtained from a secret book.

370
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:45,940
Big Brother, are we being too persistent?

371
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:51,879
If we want to become as powerful as she is, we must get those secret books from her.

372
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:53,946
Don't you have the same desire?

373
00:30:53,946 --> 00:30:55,519
That makes sense. Big Brother is right.

374
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,119
That's right. He makes sense.

375
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,779
Big Brother, what do we do now?

376
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:02,739
The demoness' traces are unpredictable.

377
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:04,960
The imperial court is intervening.

378
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,240
How about that rascal from Tang Sect? Is he still digging the ground in the valley?

379
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,519
Yes, Big Brother.

380
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,440
He's already out of those Thunder Bombs.

381
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,240
He blew up a pagoda and even blocked the passageway beneath the pagoda.

382
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,039
He is now digging with his hands. Who knows how many years that will take?

383
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,440
He even wants to order us to be his laborers.

384
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,059
Who does he think he is?

385
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,040
He really thinks highly of himself.

386
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,540
He is only a bastard with an unknown origin.

387
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,159
He is even so despicable that he would kill his wife at their wedding.

388
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:37,139
He couldn't do the killing, so he set it up for us to help him kill.

389
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:40,119
He is just a clown.

390
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:44,339
If it weren't for him to lead us in, who would listen to him?

391
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:46,580
But there really is great wealth in Fenghua Valley.

392
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,859
If he doesn't lead the way, we would never be able to find a place with so much wealth.

393
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:56,180
Since we can't find the demoness, why don't we take the money and go home?

394
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,680
Are you stupid?

395
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,080
The real valuables and those secret books are in the secret passageway.

396
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,100
This big brother is right.

397
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,059
What you can see now are just one hair from nine cows.
(a trivial amount)

398
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:12,920
Fenghua Valley's real treasures and secret books are in the underground palace.

399
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,540
We've agreed to cooperate.

400
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,260
So we should work together.

401
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,119
I know you've worked hard in chasing after the demoness.

402
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,340
It also hasn't been easy for me to search for the treasures in the valley.

403
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,060
As long as we can open up the passageway,

404
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,899
those who want the money can take the money, and those who want the secret books can take the books.

405
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:30,219
Each takes what he wants. We'll all be happy.

406
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:33,219
But that demoness still has the Scripture of Materia Medica.

407
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:37,580
Don't be anxious. Let's take away whatever can be taken.

408
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,519
Then we'll set up a trap in the valley.

409
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,860
We'll sit tight and wait. The demoness will come on her own.

410
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,379
You've talked about this and that, you just want us to help you dig up the passageway.

411
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:50,880
I relied on my smarts to have reached this place.

412
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,919
As for those treasures and secret books in the passageway, do you want them or not?

413
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,899
You can think it over.

414
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,039
- Big Brother, let's go.
- Go.

415
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,380
- Go.
- Go.

416
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,540
Are you all right?

417
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,860
I'm fine.

418
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,240
Where did you go just now?

419
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,740
I was simply...

420
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,920
I was simply looking for a place to relief myself.

421
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,499
Next time, if you want to use an excuse, how about a more elegant one?

422
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:46,559
All right. I did a little exploring.

423
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,960
There are still a lot of people in the valley.

424
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,799
Tang Huan has just located the entrance to the underground palace.

425
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,599
Can you hold up to enter through the waterway?

426
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,760
So? Are you afraid that I'll drown?

427
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,160
Let's go. I can hold up.

428
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,399
- Let's go.
- All right.

429
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,320
So pretty.

430
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,320
To build a place with such uncanny workmanship,

431
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,339
perhaps the first valley master had supernatural power?

432
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,559
What a pity that such a beautiful place will eventually be destroyed.

433
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,360
Once Tang Huan enters the underground palace, there'll be a rampage.

434
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,045
I really wanted to kill him just now.

435
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:50,500
But I remembered you were waiting for me, so I let him live for the moment.

436
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,259
Don't let your mind go wild.

437
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,799
I already said.

438
00:34:57,799 --> 00:35:02,119
These materialistic things aren't worth paying attention to.

439
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:04,651
Even an empire can change hands.

440
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:08,439
Not to mention Fenghua Valley, it's already been through over a dozen valley masters.

441
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,159
It's lasted long enough.

442
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,760
I am the valley master. I don't blame you.

443
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,000
No one in this world is qualified to criticize you.

444
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,060
If any of the past valley masters are feeling resentful in the netherworld,

445
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,860
I can shoulder all the condemnation.

446
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,579
Young Master, you are great.

447
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:33,779
Don't worry. When I get rich later,

448
00:35:33,779 --> 00:35:38,639
I'll buy even more and better jewelry for you to fill up the entire Fenghua Valley.

449
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,419
You are so poor, what can you buy for me?

450
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:45,540
I'm afraid I won't be able to wait that long.

451
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,740
Seriously, if I die,

452
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:51,239
you shouldn't be too sad.

453
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,680
It's best to forget me quickly.

454
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,000
People should also look ahead.

455
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:00,152
Nevertheless, I want to tell you this.

456
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,117
Wipe your eyes first before you find someone next time.

457
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:07,239
You must take note of what I'm saying.

458
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:09,619
Don't easily trust anyone.

459
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:11,719
Don't be cheated by anyone.

460
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:16,320
Also, don't risk your life on a whim.

461
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,380
After I'm dead, I won't be able to save you again.

462
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,000
What do you mean by next time?

463
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,991
There's no next time, only this time.

464
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:27,020
I only want this to be the last time.

465
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:31,420
I will unreservedly give you my life and myself to you.

466
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,659
It's not so bad this way.

467
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:40,459
After I'm dead, at least you can find a good man that you like.

468
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
What good man?

469
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,480
Where else is a good man?

470
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,165
I only want you. It's fine if you don't marry me, as long as you are well.

471
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,417
Didn't you want to know what illusion I conjured on Cang Qi?

472
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,120
What's the illusion?

473
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,659
An unforgettable night of romance.

474
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:10,027
How could you do that?

475
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,620
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

476
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:32,100
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

477
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:38,340
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I’ve become forgotten in the horizon ♫

478
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:44,200
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

479
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,640
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

480
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:55,510
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

481
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:01,370
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

482
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:07,250
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

483
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:13,100
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

484
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,970
♫ A gentle dream become reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

485
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:24,690
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested it again? ♫

486
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:30,690
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

487
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:36,590
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

488
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:45,310
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

489
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:56,490
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
