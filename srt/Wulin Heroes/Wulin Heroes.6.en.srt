♫ I’m full of skills, I broke into the Martial Arts World alone ♫

♫ Take a look at me, I’m open and candid, careful, and never doubting love ♫

♫ Although I fan the flames and cause trouble everywhere, I came to the world just to ask about the whereabouts of love

[Episode 6]

16
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,040
If I had known, it'd be like this.

17
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,360
I wouldn't have left by myself.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,639
Even if I died, I would have died together with her.

19
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:43,339
Since you don't believe that she's dead,

20
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,259
why do you casually say that word?

21
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,540
But where can I go to find her?

♫ How can love be drawn like the moon but missing a piece from the circle? ♫

♫ I'll write a preface for you, a moment of fireworks  ♫

00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,919
that I'll find you.

28
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,910
I'll revenge for you!

♫ The years don't hold on to the memories  ♫

34
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,979
At that time, I was troubled by both old and new injuries.

35
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,139
Additionally, the chill went into my body.

36
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,580
I almost died.

37
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,950
If I hadn't run into you, I wouldn't be here today.

38
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,099
As a physician, I can't stand by and not help.

39
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,719
- But your body...
- I know.

40
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,159
I was forced to try different medications for many years.

41
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,460
Even if Hua Tuo were reborn,
(T/N: most renowned physician in ancient China)

42
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,900
I still wouldn't be fully cured.

43
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,040
I've developed a new medication. It may be effective on you.

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,740
I'm fine.

45
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,439
I only wish for her to be all right so that she can quickly remember who I am.

46
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,759
Perhaps she doesn't even want to remember the past.

47
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,279
She may just want it to be a dream and forget everything when she wakes.

48
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:22,379
To live through it again is not necessarily a good thing.

49
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,560
You only want to relive the past, but it would be too cruel for her.

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,800
Don't you want her to remember everything?

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,019
Speaking of which, I don't think I've ever known what relationship you've had with her.

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,039
But it doesn't matter. I love her the most compare to anyone else.

53
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,239
I once heard the crown prince say the same words.

54
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,820
Regardless how beautiful the promise is, eventually Ye Xi will be the one who is heartbroken.

55
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,320
Don't compare me with him.

56
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,519
As it is, if you hadn’t saved them, what consequently happened wouldn't have happened.

57
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,819
Fenghua Valley has been passed down through the generations.

58
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,640
It has its own principles as foundation.

59
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,040
I can't break the valley's rules.

60
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,039
That's why someone who is otherworldly like you has no idea what love means.

61
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:23,179
When I was lowly and lived the least like a human, she was the only one who extended a helping hand to me.

62
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,760
She even saved me despite breaking her hands.

63
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,140
When I looked into her eyes,

64
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,399
I felt that all that was bad in the world had instantly changed for the better.

65
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,619
There is no other woman who is as good as her.

66
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:45,300
From that moment on, I swore that I would be good to her for the rest of my life.

67
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,620
If I ever fail her in the future, I would take my own life.

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,779
Now that I've found her, nothing else but her is the most important concern to me.

69
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,040
Your Highness, do you still remember about the people in the country?

70
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,820
Besides, it's useless to only impress yourself.

71
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,960
Considering our past bond, I don't mind what you said.

72
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:17,599
But I should warn you,

73
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,579
what you should do is to help me find the dragon bone to help her remember me.

74
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,339
All the rest has nothing to do with you.

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,319
Don't have any delusions for what you don't deserve.

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,420
What a pity.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,820
I can't help it even if I wanted to.

[It's not as deep as my affection for a departing friend.]

79
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,400
Young Master, do you still want to view the scenery?

80
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,299
The sun is about to set.

81
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:15,179
It's useless even if you keep staring.

82
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:18,000
- There's still no news about him?
- There is.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,500
Speak up.

84
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,260
But the news isn't good.

85
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,859
A fellow servant saw Young Master Bai and the Prince Regent together on the way outside the capital city.

86
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,820
Young Master Bai didn't look pleased.

87
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,799
He appeared to be coerced. So this guy secretly asked around.

88
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:33,699
They said they were going to some place called Nanke Temple.

89
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:37,520
Prince Regent Cang Qi?

90
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,459
When he was trampled by the crown prince, he could not be more pathetic back then.

91
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:46,979
At that time, I felt that when a man could be so handsome looking, he would be a disaster.

92
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,160
Now that he's ascended the throne, he is indeed scary.

93
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:54,759
Then, is Young Master Bai in danger when he is with the Prince Regent?

94
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,439
There must be a reason why Young Master Bai is coerced by him.

95
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,480
I must rush over there to help him escape from Cang Qi.

96
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,979
Let's get on our way now!

97
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:10,079
- Eldest Young Master!
- Eldest Young Master!

98
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,399
Your Highness.

99
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,600
We've discovered a secret passage behind the Buddha's statue.

100
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,079
I've already inspected it but didn't find the dragon bone.

101
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,519
No dragon bone?

102
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,940
You all wait outside.

103
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,420
- I will search by myself.
- Your Highness.

104
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,179
Speak.

105
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:41,680
According to the abbot, the crown prince...

106
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,800
the former crown prince previously stayed here for a while.

107
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,120
He had nightmares every day.

108
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,199
He even asked the abbot to chant the Pure Heart Mantra.

109
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,380
But later, for an unknown reason, he ordered people to seal this place.

110
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,720
You will go in with me.

111
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,859
What are you scared about?

112
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:26,759
W-Who is scared?

113
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,800
I'm not scared.

114
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,279
I have you here, don't I?

115
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,600
Your panic is caused by claustrohobia.

116
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,779
I can't help you relieve any bit of that.

117
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,159
I don't have any illness.

118
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,459
Fine.

119
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,720

120
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,600
Bai Yue!

121
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,759
Where are you?

122
00:08:58,299 --> 00:08:59,899
I'm right here.

123
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,040
You are claustrophic and also fear the dark and the ghosts. You are scared by everything.

124
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,650
- Why try to act brave to come here?
- You...

125
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,540
Do not tell anyone. Otherwise, I will...

126
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,500
Bai Yue, wait for me!

127
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,139
Ye Xi?

128
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,299
Are you all right?

Come!

135
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,060
The girls in Spring Fragrance Courtyard can sing well, and their dancing is even better.

136
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,540
I guarantee that you'll find it so enjoyable that you won't leave, Crown Prince.

137
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,380

- Whose rooster is this?
- Whose rooster is this?

139

How dare it eats my young master's fighting champion!

140
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,279
It's my rooster.

141
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,340
Men! Arrest her!

142
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,620
Wait, wait!

143
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,039
You look so delicate and cute.

144
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,180
It's not good to be arrogant in public, is it?

145
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,540
You are blatently bullying.

146
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,640
In this case, I should give you a good talking to.

147
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,059
First of all, it's a chicken's nature to eat insects. My rooster didn't eat your cricket on purpose.

148
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,020
You bumped into me first and caused your cricket to fall on the ground.

149
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,279
My rooster's appetite was stimulated and that's why it ate the cricket.

150
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,879
May I ask, how does it have anything to do with me?

151
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,259
- I...
- If you really want to convict me of a crime, we should follow the law.

152
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:27,159
May I ask, which clause in the law did I violate?

153
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,940
How are you! You are being insubordinate!

154
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,020
- I'm not daring, I'm just courageous.
- You...

155
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:37,540
May I ask your name, Miss?

156

You aren't named Little Red, are you?

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:46,519
My last name is Ye (Leaf), as in "Leaves are fluttering down."

158
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,600
Xi is my first name, as in, "Alas, where are they going yonder?"

159
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,799
Ye Xi.

160
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,220
It's my name and nothing will make me change it.

161
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,740
Miss, but this rooster...

162
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,440
I'll give it to you.

163
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,240
You can take it back and cook it to vent your resentment.

164
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,620
This... I'll give it to you too. It's delicious.

165
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,720
I'm busy and have to leave first.

166
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,879
Your Highness.

167
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,479
Your Highness?

168
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,239
Should we look for the cricket?

169
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,220
Look for what? A cricket?

170
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,419
Didn't you hear her name is Ye Xi? Go find this woman.

171
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,659
Why are you so dazed? Go!

172
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:37,800
- Didn't you hear? Hurry and go.
- Yes.

173
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,360
Go.

174
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,120
Your Highness, it's right. This is the place.

175
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,720
They say the shopkeeper of this store found her and brought her back.

176
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,519
She was outside the city at the time, and her hands and feet were all broken inexplicably.

177
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,720
The shopkeeper pitied her and put her inside a coffin to bring back.

178
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,040
Later, seeing that she had nowhere to go, he let her stay.

179
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,759
Anyone here?

180
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,879
Anyone here?

181
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,419
Anyone...

182
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,520
I'm someone.

183
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,080
Miss Ye.

184
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,880
Why you?

185
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,259
- What is it? You want to buy a coffin?
- Yes.

186
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,579
No. I'm not buying.

187
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:30,519
But can I not take a look around?

188
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,600
Since you are sincere in helping my business,

189
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,559
there's a new one made of the Phoebe Zhennan tree.
(T/N: a rare and precious wood in China)

190
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,560
When it's buried, it will last more than 10,000 years without rotting.

191
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,679
Regular people can't afford it.

192
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,659
But someone like you, Young Master, will eventually use it.

193
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,440
You... You don't want to live?

194
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,540
How dare you to call His... name directly!

195
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,440
You are even cursing him. It's an outrageous offense!

196
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,840
You are right.

197
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,080
The Phoebe Zhennan tree's wood cannot be used by ordinary people.

198
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,360
I will buy it to give to my royal... father to keep it until he eventually passes.

199
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,540
It's considered an auspicious wood.

200
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,859
You're really buying?

201
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,939
Is 1,000 taels of silver enough?

202
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,780
That's probably not enough.

203
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,900
Let's pay in gold. That should be enough, right?

204
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,120
Your... Your...

205
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,400
Young Master, please be clear-headed.

206
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,539
That'll do.

207
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:27,940
Considering how you've been teasing me, that should be enough.

208
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,360
Don't misunderstand.

209
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,380
I've truly fallen for you on first sight, Miss.

210
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,320
I can't even forget you in my dreams.

211
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,840
Don't you think it's inappropriate to be romantic in a place like this?

212
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:45,239
Then, how about I take you to a nice place?

213
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,020
You aren't taking me to the palace, are you?

214
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,240
You... How did you know?

215
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,740
Aren't those skilled fighters from the imperial guards?

216
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,980
Although they are dressed in black with their faces covered, but they are wearing shiny badges on their waists,

217
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,819
as if they're afraid that people can't see.

218
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:07,480
And you, you had a slip of the tongue and almost called him "Your Highness."

219
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,020
Don't waste your effort, however. I won't enter the palace.

220
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,679
Sachets, charms, toys!

221
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,259
Take a look at this one.

222
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:19,960
Do you like it?

223
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,200
Take a look!

224
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,180
Your Highness. Your Highness, she's coming.

225
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,160
- She's coming!
- Here, give it to me. Go away.

226
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,179
Why are you here again?

227
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:46,859
Miss Heroine, I know you are skilled in martial arts.

228
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:49,639
You can pick up anything to beat other people into pieces.

229
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,779
But, don't the martial artists usually carry their own swords?

230
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:53,840
Where is your sword?

231
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,340
The shopkeeper got sick some time ago, and there wasn't enough money for medicine.

232
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,739
So I pawned my sword to meet the urgent need.

233
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,259
Take a look at this sword and see what you think.

234
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,140
It's a gift to you.

235
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:07,499
So you are here to give me a sword? So cheap.

236
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:09,539
Yes. It's a real sword.
(T/N: "so cheap" and "real sword" sound alike}

237
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,399
Take a look.

238
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,639
It's so shiny.

239
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:21,160
It will blind people's eyes if it's unsheathed at night.

240
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,720
I also have to guard it from thieves.

241
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,939
It's uncomfortable to carry. Take it back.

242
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:28,259
This sword is worth 1,000 taels of silver.

243
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:30,220
See?

244
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,159
Your Highness. Your Highness.

245
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,499
What's wrong with the sword? You didn't give it to her?

246
00:17:34,499 --> 00:17:36,279
You bought a broken sword.

247
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:39,040
This... Your HIghness, it costs 1,000 taels of silver!

248
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,940
Your Highness!

249
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,779
He is right.

250
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,799
What if those who want to kill the demoness pursue me here?

251
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,500
What will I do without a weapon?

252
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,119
Xi Xi! Can I call you this nickname?

253
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,340
I get annoyed when people use a reduplicated word.

254
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,559
If someone calls me by that when I'm fighting,

255
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,440
I will definitely beat them so hard that their mothers won't recognize them.

256
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,800
Then, Xiao Xi.

257
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,760
You put on a hairpin today. Is it for me?

258
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,960
Although it's pretty, but it's a little too plain.

259
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll give you some prettier ones later. You can choose.

260
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,640
Did you sleep well last night?

261
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,340
How about it? Do you like me a little more this morning?

262
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,680
Xiao Xi, the weather is really nice today.

263
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,950
Are you interested in coming with me to view the flowers?

264
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,340
It's fine if you dont' want to go. No need to hit me.

265
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,240
I'll go.

266
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,060
But I'll decide where to go.

267
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,660
Sure.

268
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:14,880
I want to go to a brothel.

269
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
The best brothel in the entire city.

270
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,699
Today, I'm telling the true love story

271
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:25,020
of the best heroine in the martial arts world, Ye Xi,

272
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,519
who encountered the one who is destined to be emperor

273
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:33,759
and successfully married into the palace.

274
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,079
Sorry, sorry.

275
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,920
His story is too outrageous, and I couldn't tolerate it.

276
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,359
It's all right, no problem.

277
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,980
I know that people in the Martial Arts World aren't restrained by formalities.

278
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,900
Just a few days ago, he was telling the story about the demoness Ye Xi.

279
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,200
It's just a coincidence.

280
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,939
Many people have the same names in this world.

281
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,999
From now on, all the storytellers will only tell the story of Martial Heroine Ye Xi.

282
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,479
Word has it that Ye Xi, the strongest heroine of the Martial Arts World,

283
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:09,060
possesses extraordinary skills.

284
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,560
Her martial arts skills are outstanding and unbeatable.

285
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,599
She is as beautiful as a fairy.

286
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,339
She has unwavering righteousness and has admirable virtue even among the good.

287
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:23,179
How much did you pay that storyteller?

288
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,640
Not much, just enough to make him recite every day.

289
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,540
I paid him enough for three months.

290
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:33,880
Even though his previous story about Demoness Ye Xi was false,

291
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,579
this story you weaved makes me feel really uneasy and disturbed.

292
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:41,700
If you think this sounds false, tell me the truth.

293
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,859
I'll get the story written word for word.

294
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,060
After I woke up this time, I was taken in by the coffin shopkeeper.

295
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,159
All I do is man the shop and steal from the rich for the poor.

296
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,639
I'm not a heroine, but I definitely won't harm others.

297
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,160
But, I lost my memory.

298
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,780
I don't remember my past deeds.

299
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,480
Everyone calls me Demoness Ye Xi.

300
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,119
Even if these are just rumors, are you completely unbothered?

301
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,100
I don't care what other people say.

302
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,400
You shouldn't be bothered, either.

303
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,859
I told you, trust my words.

304
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,900
In my heart, you're my heroine.

305
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,000
Help! Assassins!

306
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,119
Run!

307
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,920
Hide somewhere! Make sure the arrows don't get you!

308
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,119
All right.

309
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:41,019
Surround this place!

310
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,480
Protect His Royal Highness!

311
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,040
Hurry up!

312
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:12,759
I have a phobia of heights.

313
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:15,919
Oh, you're afraid of heights. Get up.

314
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,059
You were leaping too high up.

315
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,119
No one has ever leaped so high up in the air with me.

316
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,680
Shouldn't you focus on who your enemy might be?

317
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,900
Let's discuss this back in the palace.

318
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,139
The capital officials will investigate anyway.

319
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,200
You sure are worry-free.

320
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,900
That's because you're here.

321
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,799
Without you here, I would've died.

322
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,560
Xiao Xi, you're really my lucky star.

323
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,320
Cang Nan is good at pretending to be a good person. Xiao Xi is too kind that she fell for his kind act.

324
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,800
She just returned after going missing for two years after Tang Yang's incident.

325
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,300
She forgot everything, but was called a demoness out of the blue.

326
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,760
I'm sure she was yearning for a shred of kindness.

327
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,480
[Jianyin Pavillion]

328
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:30,939
Miss Ye! You're part of the Eastern Palace now!

329
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:33,680
You're no longer who you were! You're a person of prestige!

330
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,880
Please pay attention to your behavior and appearance!

331
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,540
As the ancient saying goes, "A lack of dignity is equivalent to death."

332
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,519
"A lack of deportment is equivalent to death."

333
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,480
"A lack of propriety is equivalent to death."

334
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,019
What's all this about death?

335
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:48,300
Puny eunuch!

336
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,079
Are you looking down on me now that I'm in the palace?

337
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,140
What...

338
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,480
You only speak in quotes.

339
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,499
You're doing that just because you want to be like—

340
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:57,199
Be careful!

341
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,459
- Let go of me!
- Watch your skirt.

342
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:01,440
This costs a fortune.

343
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,019
Ordinary folks can't even wear this.

344
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:05,739
I'd better leave quickly.

345
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:07,480
Miss Ye! Miss Ye!

346
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,799
Miss Ye! Miss Ye, you can't leave!

347
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,559
Miss Ye! Miss Ye!

348
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,179
His Highness treats you so well.

349
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:15,900
He even sent men to boost the coffin business of your savior.

350
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,000
That's why you agreed to be a guard in the Eastern Palace.

351
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,200
If you leave, His Highness will chase me out of the palace.

352
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
All right.

353
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:26,780
But isn't His Majesty seeking enlightenment and in reclusion?

354
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,559
We still have to greet him at his door.

355
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:31,340
Let go of me!

356
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,319
Who's that?

357
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,900
Why is he so beaten and bruised?

358
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,900
He's the son of the King of Huainan, sent here to be a hostage prince.

359
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,519
They've already beaten him up.

360
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,419
Miss Ye, let's hurry up. It's bad if we're late.

361
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:02,819
Fine.

362
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:19,179
Xiao Xi, this isn't worthy of being put on by you.

363
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,140
Hold this.

364
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,180
Look.

365
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,660
Only this is fit for you.

366
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,699
I'll help you put it on.

367
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:39,480
It's pretty, isn't it?

368
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Your Highness.

369
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,920
Why are you here?

370
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,259
Don't be angry. I heard that a new lady joined us.

371
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,680
I'm here to offer tea.

372
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,899
Younger Sister, you sure look unique.

373
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,880
Aren't the palace maids supposed to bring tea over?

374
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,980
Why are you here?

375
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,240
Though, you seem rather knowledgeable.

376
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,079
How about you sing or dance for me?

377
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,999
I don't know all of these. Could you enlighten me?

378
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:31,519
I know you're His Highness's new favorite, but please spare me a place in here.

379
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,119
S-Stand up first!

380
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:37,200
If you refuse, I won't get up!

381
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,140
You're probably mistaken. I'm here as a palace guard.

382
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,680
I don't get all this nonsense about being a favorite.

383
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,880
If you like to kneel, then I'll leave you be.

384
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,340
Your Highness!

385
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,960
Your Highness, you have to speak up for me!

386
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,799
My Lady, what are you doing here? Come with me.

387
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,279
Your Highness! Your Highness, I refuse to leave!

388
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:10,079
Your Highness!

389
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,740
Disseminate my orders! Send all of them away!

390
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,259
Did you send her back?

391
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:20,319
Your Highness, that woman is such a hassle!

392
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,999
She made a huge fuss before leaving.

393
00:27:24,194 --> 00:27:26,559
Send all of them to the Cold Palace.

394
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,580
Satisfy all their requests and desires.

395
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,979
Get them to calm down for now.

396
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:32,779
Sure.

397
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:37,239
By the way, did Xiao Xi see Cang Qi?

398
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,419
Your Highness, that was pure coincidence.

399
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,599
I was leading Miss Ye to His Majesty,

400
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,979
but she happened to see Cang Qi carried away after being beaten up.

401
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:47,359
Why are you so stupid?

402
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:49,920
Stay alert! Don't let her see what she's not supposed to!

403
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,859
- Yes!
- Capture Cang Qi right away.

404
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:54,440
I'm going to beat him black and blue.

405
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,779
I need to vent my anger.

406
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:56,819
Cang Qi?

407
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:59,900
How dare that old and rotting King of Huainan send assassins after me!

408
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,520
He really wants his son dead, doesn't he?

409
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,920
Speak. Where's the medicine taster?

410
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,900
In the medical chamber.

411
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,259
What's this? Open it.

412
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,319
Is this the medicine you refined for His Majesty?

413
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,399
Why are you feeding it to others when you don't even try it first?

414
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,340
Who are you?

415
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,940
It's me.

416
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,800
Are you all right?

417
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:52,120
This is no big deal. When I saw you in the palace earlier today,

418
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,759
I wondered why you were also here.

419
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,600
It's a long story. I'll explain next time.

420
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,739
How do I get you out of here?

421
00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:04,339
I'm beyond saving.

422
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:06,280
I'm a hostage prince.

423
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,179
My fate is carved in stone.

424
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm doomed to be humiliated and abused by others.

425
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,399
I wanted to kill myself.

426
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,959
Too bad

427
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:24,079
my only chance was ruined by you.

428
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:27,180
You have to live on while you still can.

429
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,380
Are you really fine after eating those red pills?

430
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,219
If I don't die, I'll probably get through it.

431
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,480
Even though I can't help you escape, I can help you get out of this terrible place.

432
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:03,459
I don't know how you got in, but the palace isn't safer than the world out there.

433
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:05,759
The Imperial Army's troops are everywhere.

434
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,199
Come on.

435
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,939
They're over there!

436
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:24,439
There!

437
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:30,380
Those inside, hand over the hostage prince from the King of Huainan!

438
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,599
This is the Eastern Palace!

439
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:35,319
If you want him back, get His Royal Highness's approval.

440
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,400
If you don't hand him over, there'll be severe consequences if His Majesty is infuriated!

441
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,680
Even His Highness the Crown Prince can't save you!

442
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,800
Don't blame us for conducting our duties! Barge in!

443
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,519
I'm in here!

444
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,419
This has nothing to do with her!

445
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,619
You...

446
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:57,159
Barge in!

447
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,419
Witch! Just you wait! I'll report this to His Highness the Crown Prince!

448
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:17,620
Move it! Retreat!

449
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,319
- Hurry up!
- Grab onto me!

450
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,019
Come on!

451
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:24,200
You're really strong.

452
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:27,419
I...

453
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,399
D-Did I startle you?

454
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:36,200
I've always been strong, even as a kid.

455
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,359
You're badly injured.

456
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,559
You can rest here tonight. Don't worry.

457
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,959
If I sleep here, where will you sleep?

458
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,120
I... I'll sleep on the platform.

459
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,000
You can't sleep there.

460
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,559
I always wake up from the cold.

461
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,559
Have you never slept on a bed ever since you came here?

462
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,599
You look so handsome, but you've suffered terribly. You're making me cry!

463
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,799
I'd like to cry as well,

464
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,159
but I can't cry before a woman.

465
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,739
You'll despise me.

466
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:13,040
Who said that men can't cry?

467
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,899
That's the same as saying that women are bewitching disasters. These are all prejudices!

468
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:18,800
You're not to blame for having a handsome face.

469
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,979
Those who bully you are true evildoers.

470
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:28,279
All my life, you're the only one who told me I'm not to blame.

471
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:31,660
My father sold me away.

472
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,000
He said I'm a curse.

473
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,460
But... Did you come back because you don't want to get them in trouble?

474
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,199
That's not it. I just...

475
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,000
You don't have to say anything. I'll help you to the bed to rest.

476
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,240
Come on.

477
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:28,220
How can you bear with this?

478
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,459
How about I get some antidotes from the Imperial Pharmacy?

479
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:33,219
Don't leave.

480
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:40,959
I just feel chilly.

481
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,039
Can...

482
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,299
Can you hug me?

483
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,579
Okay.

484
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,320
Don't worry.

485
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,700
I'll watch over you tonight. Get some rest.

486
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,300
His Highness the Crown Prince won't come over tonight.

487
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,960
He has tons of people demanding his consolation.

488
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:21,780
If you want to grow stronger, bear with as much as you can.

489
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:25,180
If you're at your limit, just cry.

490
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:29,780
Once you're done crying, face reality bravely.

491
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:37,560
I'll keep your words in mind.

492
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:57,200
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

493
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,770
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

494
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:08,980
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

495
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:14,840
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

496
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,230
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

497
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:26,120
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

498
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:31,950
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

499
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:37,830
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

500
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:43,610
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

501
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:49,530
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

502
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:55,430
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

503
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:01,290
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

504
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:06,980
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

505
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:15,970
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

506
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:26,380
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
