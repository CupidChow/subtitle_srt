[Tang Fortress]

16
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,960
Who are you? How dare you block my way.

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,980
Young Master.

18
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,500
Your Highness, please be calm. Young Master Bai asked me to give you a message.

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,899
It's about what you asked him to do.

20
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:02,140
On the way over, I kept thinking

21
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,219
about how to deal with him to vent my frustrations.

22
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,320
I couldn't think of a satisfactory method.

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,160
But you are here.

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,180
Since the two of you are so brotherly...

25
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,420
Don't, don't, I-I really cherish my life.

26
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,519
I-I'm just a messenger.

27
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,760
After listening to the message I'm delivering, if you still want to trample this place, go ahead.

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,119
Speak.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,959
- That's about done.
- Be careful.

30
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,479
Move the tail a little to the left. To the left.

31
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,819
- GIve me that.
- A little higher.

32
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:42,460
- Go up some.
- Slowly.
- Will this do?

33
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,360
- That one.
- That looks good. Let me see.

34
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,779
Everyone, thank you for your hard work.

35
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:48,180
- It's not hard.
- This red color is gorgeous.

36
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,319
- So festive.
- Yes.

37
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,019
A little higher.

38
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,179
- Miss Ye.
- Slowly. Yes, just a little higher.

39
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:57,780
By the way, when Seventh Uncle went out last night,

40
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,180
I forgot to tell him to buy more red fabric and red candles.

41
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,560
They would look good for the decoration.

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,479
There is still red fabric in the storeroom. We'll get it right away.

43
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,639
Miss Ye, you're probably mistaken. Seventh Uncle didn't go out last night.

44
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,719
I probably remembered wrong. It's fine. You can go back to your work.

45
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,019
Sure.

46
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:20,679
Could he have killed Seventh Uncle?

47
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,879
I must be extra careful tomorrow.

48
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,400
Good. One, two, three, go. Here.

49
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,960
Miss Ye.

50
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,162
You look absent-minded. Why don't I work out a divination for you?

51
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,100
Young Master Chu, why are you here?

52
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,860
Don't tell me Bai Yue is also here to attend the wedding?

53
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,000
What is it? You've changed your career to be a fortune-teller?

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,140
You can't rely on fortune-telling to traverse the Martial Arts World.

55
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,779
My bodyguard agency also received an invitation from the Tang Sect.

56
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,959
This time, I'm here as a distinguished honor guest.

57
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
Usually, I wouldn't do the divination for just anyone.

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
It's because my divination is very expensive.

59
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,480
I've already divined

60
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,179
that your marriage is destined to be full of upheavals.

61
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:44,740
Then, what should I do to not have upheavals? Should I change the date?

62
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:48,239
Change the person.

63
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,079
Each one of you seems to

64
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,900
really think I'm stupid.

65
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,359
Even if I look stupid, I can still discern good and bad, and know what's right from wrong.

66
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:05,039
I'm not that easy to be taken advantage of.

67
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,299
Miss Ye, I couldn't help but speak up. All I wish is for you to be careful.

68
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:12,620
It's really difficult to tell who the villains are these days.

69
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,779
They can pretend to be better than good people.

70
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:19,220
In the end, they harm people and set up others to take the blame.

71
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,059
Enough now, I won't talk about it anymore.

72
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:24,860
No matter how this marriage will be, as a friend, I still should express my goodwill.

73
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,020
This time, I've prepared a big gift for you.

74
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,199
- Is it money?
- Of course.

75
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,079
You are indeed a reliable friend.

76
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,940
Oh yes.

77
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,500
Eldest Miss Lin of Flowing Water Manor also sent a message that she is coming to the wedding tomorrow.

78
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,360
But I don't know if she'll make it in time for the auspicious hour.

79
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,240
I can introduce the two of you to meet.

80
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,040
Eldest Miss Lin? I met her once,

81
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:58,219
if only she can remember my face.

82
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,940
Young Master Chu,

83
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,300
in fact, when most people get their fortune told, they already know the answer.

84
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,639
They just want to get the confirmation through someone else's mouth.

85
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,120
I don't need to have my fortune told. But I must confirm the answer on my own.

86
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,319
Don't worry. I will protect myself.

87
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,779
I don't believe that I'll fail once agin.

88
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:27,800
Understood. I'll definitely pass the message to him.

89
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,819
- Madam.
- Madam.

90
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:00,399
Xiao Xi, the upcoming ituals will be complicated.

91
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,240
I asked the kitchen to prepare some small dishes.

92
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,979
You can eat a little first to have the strength to endure.

93
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,759
The wedding involves both of us. You'll get tired too.

94
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,320
Why don't we eat together?

95
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,739
All right.

96
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,240
Xiao Xi.

97
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,890
Have a piece of Crispy Rice Cake.

98
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,220
By the way, Xiao Xi. With such a crowd of guests,

99
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,319
I think it's safer to put the Storm Pear Flower Needle in the ancestral hall.

100
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,160
I already put it back in the ancestral hall last night. It's all arranged safely. Don't worry.

101
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,219
That's good, then. You are so thoughtful.

102
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,959
It's not mine, so of course I have to return it.

103
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,860
What's this nonsense again?

104
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,879
Today is our wedding date. From now on, Tang Sect belongs to you and me.

105
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:10,999
The martial artist among the guests asked me, why displease many people in the world to marry you?

106
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:16,139
But they don't know that marrying you is the most right thing I've done in my life.

107
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,540
Don't overthink it. You can count on me on everything. I've made all the arrangements.

108
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,420
Let me peel a grape for you.

109
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,419
This grape is very sweet. Try it.

110
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,480
I don't eat grapes. I am picky on a lot of foods. You go head and eat it.

111
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:53,519
Xiao Xi. You don't eat many things. It really makes my heart ache for you.

112
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,519
I'll eat the vegetables.

113
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,080
Oh yes, Xiao Xi.

114
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,399
That's chicken soup. You should get more supplements.

115
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,559
You've worked hard lately. Thank you for everything you've done for me.

116
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,700
What soup are you drinking?

117
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:38,159
It's an ordinary vegetable soup.

118
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,580
I still have lingering poison in me, so naturally I need to eat lighter food.

119
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,120
The chicken soup is too greasy.

120
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,120
I want to drink some fresh vegetable soup to clear the fire in my lungs.

121
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,959
As you wish, as long as you like it.

122
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,000
Xiao Xi. I need to greet the guests outside.

123
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,960
I'll be back soon to pick you up.

124
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:18,599
Xiao Xi, you are very beautiful today.

125
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:40,359
Sect Lord!

126
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,039
- Sect Lord!
- Sect Lord!

127
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,639
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

128
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,579
I'm fine. Let's hurry and go to the ancestral hall.

129
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,479
- Yes.
- Yes.

130
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,280
Be careful.

131
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,600
Come, come.

132
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,799
Have a drink.

133
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,899
Here. Fill it up.

134
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,759
- Fifth Master.
- Fourth Brother.

135
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,500
Come.

136
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,160
Brother Yang.

137
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,399
- Congratulations.
- Drink up.

138
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:58,019
Here.

139
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,819
I filled it up for you.

140
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,619
Everyone, here.

141
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:06,960
Come.

142
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,320
Cheers!

143
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,799
Cheers!

144
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,299
Cheers!

145
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:15,599
The bride is here!

146
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,199
I am grateful for all the martial arts heroes coming from afar to our Tang Sect.

147
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,280
Ye Xi has entered the trap. Help yourselves, everyone.

148
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,360
Why?

149
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,619
Xiao Xi, you still don't get it even now?

150
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,579
Why are you doing this to me?

151
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,680
I really don't understand.

152
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,120
I haven't done anything against Heaven and conscience.

153
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,900
I also haven't done anything to be sorry to you.

154
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,719
Even just now, you said you would treat me even nicer.

155
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:01,980
Why would you kill me when I'm wearing this wedding gown?

156
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,979
A demoness like you who has committed all evils, everyone has the right to kill you.

157
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:11,499
Because you are by nature sinister and cunning, and you are adept in crafty escapes,

158
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:14,659
that's why I had to use the wedding as an excuse

159
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:19,419
to gather everyone here and eradicate you in one strike.

160
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,579
Demoness?

161
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,759
I've heard this kind of talk from plenty of other people.

162
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,900
But this is the first time I heard it from you.

163
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,440
It's quite new and interesting.

164
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,799
With such an evilish and bewitching face, aren't you a demoness?

165
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,200
That's right!

166
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,760
Not only do you look evil, your martial arts are also unfathomable.

167
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,820
You must have stolen the secret martial arts books from various sects and their fierce weapons.

168
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,200
Hurry and hand them over.

169
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,940
Demoness, you're not going anywhere today even if you have wings.

170
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,920
Today is your day to die.

171
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,739
If you behave and self-destruct your martial arts skills, we'll leave your corpse in one piece.

172
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,720
You guys sure are like haunting ghosts.

173
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:15,420
When Tang Yang died, you all told me that you would have nothing to do with me anymore.

174
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,499
So what if I had stolen the secret books?

175
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:21,200
So what if I had fierce weapons?

176
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,039
I practiced my own martial arts skills.

177
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:31,240
Why won't you admit that someone is more talented and more diligent than you are?

178
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,940
Apparently, not only that you aren't talented, your brains also don't work.

179
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,200
Who are you smearing?

180
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,259
Don't continue with the wasteful talk.

181
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:46,000
Isn't it because you have the Scripture of Materia Medica that can enhance one's strength?

182
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,520
Demoness! Hurry and hand over the scripture!

183
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,659
This is the real reason that you want to kill me, isn't it?

184
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:57,139
You've been deceiving me.

185
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:59,020
You wouldn't tell me anything.

186
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,560
Xiao Xi, to get to where we are today, it's because you forced me.

187
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,820
Xiao Xi, ask yourself honestly.

188
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,600
Do you really love me?

189
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,639
You have too many secrets.

190
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,399
You have entanglements with too many men.

191
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,939
You wouldn't share what's valuable with me.

192
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:22,020
Is this how you treat your husband?

193
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:27,640
Might I ask what kind of men in this world will marry such a demoness like you?

194
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:33,940
I see that this is your true face.

195
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,360
The way you are the villain who complains first, it's really opening my eyes.

196
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,559
Everyone, the demoness is already poisoned with Muscle Softening Powder and arsenic.

197
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,979
The toxins are taking effect right now.

198
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,360
All of you can attack as you wish.

199
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,779
Whether you can force her to hand over anything, it's up to your capabilities.

200
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,919
Since you are so sure that I'm on the brink of death, allow me to die in an honest manner.

201
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,620
Everyone, don't be afraid.

202
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,359
She doesn't dare to perish with us all.

203
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,680
Why bet on your lives against me?

204
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm about to enter the marital grave.

205
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,839
I only want to ask you a few questions.

206
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,940
During breakfast this morning,

207
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,279
both of us ate.

208
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,260
Why aren't you poisoned?

209
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,499
You've been on guard against me, but you still would marry me.

210
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:51,100
How can you say you are not a demoness?

211
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,819
Of course, I was poisoned.

212
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:59,299
But, as the poisoner, why would I poison myself to death?

213
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:01,039
He is truly vicious.

214
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,820
If one wants to get ahead, one has to be vicious even to himself.

215
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,340
You thought if you killed me, you could get ahead in the Martial Arts World.

216
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,599
Open your eyes wide and look around you.

217
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,440
There are countless people in the Martial Arts World who want to kill you.

218
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,900
As Sect Lord of Tang Sect, of course I side with compatriots in the Martial Arts World.

219
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,980
So they want to kill me? They don't need any excuse.

220
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,440
Neither the righteous or the evil factions would accept me anyway.

221
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,459
But, even if I had committed wrongs against all people,

222
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:42,279
I still don't owe you a single bit, considering that I saved you.

223
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:44,659
It's useless to beg me.

224
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:48,279
The people here want you dead.

225
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,379
You are overthinking it.

226
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,380
I only want you to honestly answer one question.

227
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,139
Are Seventh Uncle and Xue Ting still alive?

228
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,620
Why are you asking about that?

229
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,799
Although they have nothing to do with me, but aren't they the closest people to you?

230
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,219
So what?

231
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:07,279
Too bad they were traitorous.

232
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:11,459
You really killed them.

233
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,839
That day, Seventh Uncle was still alive.

234
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,820
I started to have doubts.

235
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,540
Now that I think carefully, our meeting wasn't that coincidental.

236
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,820
There were too many coincidences.

237
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,639
I didn't think you'd be so vicious.

238
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,960
Seventh Uncle was so loyal to you.

239
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,459
Xue Ting was pregnant with your child, wasn't she?

240
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:34,000
How could you kill them?

241
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,359
Men, strike now!

242
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,839
She wouldn't dare to use the Thunder Bomb!

243
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,000
Attack her!

244
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,160
I can kill you without the Thunder Bomb.

245
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,000
Take her down!

246
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:20,600

00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:37,819
You won't learn until you get hurt, will you?

251
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,480
Did you lose all your martial arts skills along with your brain?

252
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,840
Why can't you fend them off?

253
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,920
If you want the Storm Pear Flower Needle, get it from Seventh Uncle!

He's Bai Yue! He probably has the Scripture of Materia Medica!

[Border of Tang Fortress]

264
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,720
Why isn't he here yet?

265
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:31,679
Young Master! He's here!

266
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,019
Why is she in this terrible state? Are you all right?

267
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:37,019
This isn't my blood.

268
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:40,900
Such recklessness always taints my clothes with blood! Get out of the way!

269
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:49,399
This is terrible.

270
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:54,780
What happened? Is Ye Xi hurt?

271
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,160
Is Yueyue all right?

272
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,919
The Miracle Physician is here, so they'll be fine.

273
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,320
Eldest Miss Lin, we meet again.

274
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,040
Have we met before?

275
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,340
Enough with the nonsense. Hurry into the city and look for a herbal medicine store.

276
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,460
Eldest Miss Lin, we shouldn't stay here. Let's leave.

277
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,180
Turn the carriage around.

278
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,059
Keep the carriage stable.

279
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,440
Hurry up! Hurry!

280
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,400
We're running out of time!

281
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,179
Eldest Miss Lin, why did we stop here?

282
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,340
Eldest Miss, slow down.

283
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:33,159
Hurry up! We need to get on our way!

284
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:39,100
Miss Ye, are you all right?

285
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,700
Get lost.

286
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,880
I'm in a lot of pain.

287
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,480
Aren't you going to cure me?

288
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,580
Aren't you fearless of death?

289
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,099
Why are you whining about pain?

290
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,900
I'm not made of iron.

291
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,240
I feel pain.

292
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,020
We don't have a mirror for you to look at your horrible state now.

293
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,840
Why is my hair white?

294
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,439
Physical pain is truly more tortuous than emotional agony.

295
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,719
I feel so ashamed.

296
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:21,400
I shouldn't have drunk that soup from him.

297
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,939
How was it?

298
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:25,819
Was that Bewitchment Soup tasty?

299
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:30,339
Do you really think I'm in this state from heartbreak?

300
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:33,240
He isn't worthy of my sadness.

301
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,839
Well, why did you agree to this marriage?

302
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,680
Will you only give up after seeing things to the bitter end?

303
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,739
You were the one insistent on witnessing my marriage.

304
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:43,979
You refused to respond to any of my hints or declarations.

305
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:47,340
What else could I do? I had to give it a shot.

306
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,759
I was just kidding! What are you doing?

307
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:52,259
W-Wait! What are you doing?

308
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:54,300
Ouch! Stop! What are you doing?

309
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,159
Don't touch me!

310
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,840
Ouch!

311
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,839
Don't touch me!

312
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,359
Let go!

313
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,259
It's none of your business! Sit back down!

314
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:13,419
Excuse me! Peace and harmony is best!

315
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,119
Get lost.

316
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,980
My current state and this place isn't very appropriate.

317
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,219
I just can't stand the smell of blood on those robes.

318
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:26,939
If you blabber nonsense, I'll throw you out.

319
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:31,479
I can endure arsenic, but your words are even more toxic.

320
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:34,419
Arsenic won't turn all of your hair white.

321
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,520
Bear with it.

322
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,420
That hurts!

323
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,319
Hey! Are you made of medicinal powder?

324
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,780
Does this even work?

325
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,100
This medicinal power will only heal external wounds.

326
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,759
I don't have anything prepared to deal with your white hair.

327
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,160
Besides, when I was reading your pulse, I noticed that it was vacant.

328
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,399
It's as thought your martial arts skills have been drained.

329
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:07,440
That's unusual.

330
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,119
I... I've never been in such a situation before.

331
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,559
It's the perfect challenge for you.

332
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,080
I don't want such challenges.

333
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,379
I really want to rip out your heart and see what it's made of.

334
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:22,519
Don't you feel sad?

335
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:24,780
What's that about ripping out hearts?

336
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,660
That's brutal!

337
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,880
What do you know?

338
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,000
Excuse me! Is there some misunderstanding between you two?

339
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,540
Please consider speaking frankly with each other.

340
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,319
Don't beat around the bush. You'll see the light if you persevere.

341
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,859
Keep your mouth shut!

342
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,760
I've told you many times. Honeyed words are lethal poison.

343
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,799
False displays of affection are murderous weapons.

344
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:53,739
I'm not even afraid of death. Sadness is nothing.

345
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:55,040
Uncle Hui told me this.

346
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,839
The more handsome a man is, the more deceitful he is.

347
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,340
If you can deceive me for a lifetime,

348
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,819
I don't mind. But you won't, right?

349
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:09,860
My hair probably turned white because the soup's ingredients is clashing with my body.

350
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,510
He won't notice this, will he?

351
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,620
Your Highness!

352
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,759
I'm sorry! It's all my fault!

353
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,060
It hurts.

354
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,899
You're pressing down on my wound!

355
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:40,260
It's all my fault that you're in this state!

356
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,980
Eldest Miss!

357
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,259
What's going on?

358
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:50,939
Why did the prince regent come over? They won't start a fight, will they?

359
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:52,640
I have no clue either.

360
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,540
What are your plans now?

361
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,580
How would I know?

362
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,159
Come with me. I'll cure you.

363
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:03,640
Then, I'll raze Tang Sect to the ground and avenge you!

364
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Let go of me!

365
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:19,260
You defied me time and again, and even got her so badly hurt!

366
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,319
Are you trying to sever all ties with me?

367
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,640
Enough. Don't pull that trick.

368
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,200
She's poisoned with arsenic, Muscle Softening Powder, and other poisons.

369
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,359
Her internal organs are in shatters.

370
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,740
It's best if you don't touch her.

371
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,600
A single mistake could kill her.

372
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:40,779
Is Ye Xi that terribly hurt?

373
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:43,240
I was planning to take her into my carriage.

374
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,159
Thank goodness I left her as she was.

375
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,719
A sudden worsening of injuries does happen.

376
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:52,640
How dare they do this to you!

377
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:57,726
I'll rip them into shreds!

378
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:59,319
Listen up!

379
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:02,180
Mobilize the entire Black Armored Guards to attack them!

380
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,639
- Yes!
- You can't do that!

381
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:06,400
- Stop!
- Yes!

382
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,840
Even though I'm severely injured, I'm still alive.

383
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,359
Those martial artists are just leaping onto a good chance.

384
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,720
Those disciples are just acting on orders.

385
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,040
They injured you so horribly! Why are you speaking up for them?

386
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,160
Do you still have lingering affections for Tang Huan?

387
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,679
I'm trying to say, this is Tang Huan's ploy!

388
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,939
Don't harm the innocent.

389
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,679
See that?

390
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,939
Her riled up emotions turned her hair white.

391
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:42,159
If you continue harassing her, she might just kick the bucket.

392
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,840
If you really care about me, don't make me repeat myself.

393
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,820
I'll deal with my own problems. Don't intervene.

394
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,340
Anyone who intervenes will be killed as well!

395
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,019
Fine! Stop talking.

396
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:57,260
I'll abide by your wishes.

397
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,440
I have an imperial residence in the vicinity.

398
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,658
I'll summon all imperial physicians over.

399
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,419
I'm sure they'll cure you.

400
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,799
Hold on. You don't have to do that.

401
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,620
My injuries can be cured by him.

402
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,960
You're right. This isn't the first time, anyway.

403
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,739
I'm used to it.

404
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,836
If you fail to cure her, I'll hold you accountable.

405
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:23,939
Ye Xi sure is suave.

406
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:25,319
Even I'm starting to fall in love with her.

407
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,759
Eldest Miss, please choose your words carefully.

408
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,780
Eldest Miss, this place is already a whirlwind.

409
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,980
Don't add to the problems.

410
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,619
- Head to the imperial travel residence.
- Yes.

411
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,580
Hurry up!

412
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,480
Yes!

413
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,259
Sect Lord. We've ransacked Seventh Uncle's room, but we couldn't find the key.

414
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,659
Seems like that demoness was lying.

415
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,700
Isn't there a disciple of Lu Ban in the Martial Arts World?

416
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,340
Find him.

417
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,619
He'll get this open.

418
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:20,319
Did all of them chase after the demoness?

419
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,640
No one dared to give chase.

420
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Eldest Miss of Flowing Water Manor saved the demoness with a strange weapon.

421
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,799
What weapon?

422
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,079
Nobody knows what it is.

423
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,799
We plan to go after her with Thunder Bombs, but the storehouse is flooded.

424
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,179
The Thunder Bombs and explosives are soaked.

425
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,079
What did you say?

426
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,279
What about the formula?

427
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,440
Don't we have the formula for it?

428
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,920
The steps are complex.

429
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,880
These aren't items that ordinary folks can make.

430
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,200
Sect Lord.

431
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,319
A bunch of useless trash!

432
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,259
Nothing but trash!

433
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,300
It's all that demoness's fault.

434
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,659
That demoness's fault!

435
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:01,379
Her methods are truly peculiar.

436
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:07,480
Sect Lord. I heard that the prince regent has arrived in Shu.

437
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,599
When he came to Tang Sect, he was backing the demoness.

438
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:15,320
After that, I heard that the demoness fought a terrible battle with the Black Armored Guards.

439
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,819
Xiao Xi!

440
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,100
Xiao Xi.

441
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,340
Weren't there 100-year-old ginsengs in Changliu Mountain?

442
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,279
Why are they all gone now?

443
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,440
If only if we had those old ginseng...

444
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,720
They're the best for revitalizing energy

445
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,640
and hastening recovery.

446
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:08,179
Everyone knows about the value of Changliu Mountain's ginseng.

447
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:10,419
All of them have been dugged up.

448
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,599
Panax ginseng?

449
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:19,279
It's rare to even find these now.

450
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,759
Who knows whether she'll eat it?

451
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,070
Hurry up.

452
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,710
Yes.

453
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:36,079
Fallopia multiflora?

454
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,820
That won't treat her white hair.

455
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,300
You just have to do your duty as a physician.

456
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:52,419
I'll gather the best medical herbs and take care of her.

457
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:54,980
She'll definitely recover.

458
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,039
I won't let anyone hurt her again.

459
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:06,639
Anyone who does will not be spared.

460
00:33:20,219 --> 00:33:21,100
Eldest Miss Lin.

461
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,640
I forgot to say this in my haste yesterday!

462
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,060
You're worlds apart from that pig head of Bailu City.

463
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,899
I didn't even dare to look at your face back then.

464
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:31,820
Your face was like roasted pork skin!

465
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,920
The sight of it made me nauseous.

466
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:38,000
Sorry for scaring you.

467
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,400
What do you think about me now?

468
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,640
Now?

469
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,880
It feels pretty good to the touch.

470
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,520
P-Please stop.

471
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,659
Your skin is pretty thick. What's wrong with a few pinches?

472
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,540
You look pretty masculine.

473
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,519
Why are you so bashful?

474
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,759
I'm not bashful!

475
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,020
I'm warning you!

476
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,340
Don't harbor strange ideas about me.

477
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,540
I share the same thought.

478
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,059
This is a Western gun, right?

479
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:11,400
Not bad, pretty knowledgeable of you.

480
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,020
I've named it Tyrant Shooter.

481
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,239
Tyrant Shooter?

482
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,959
This name matches your personality perfectly.

483
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,679
This is a foreign import.

484
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,839
I wanted to let that disciple of Lu Ban analyze it and make a copy.

485
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,219
But this person is very elusive.

486
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,960
So, I can only train with this.

487
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,739
Eldest Miss, are you planning to get into a fight?

488
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,179
Of course not.

489
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:39,360
But the sight of Ye Xi fighting off a hundred men alone was way too cool.

490
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:45,119
So, I asked my father for lost secret martial arts books for instant mastery.

491
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,939
If these are lost books, how can they be delivered instantly?

492
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:54,639
I... I'm sure your father said these lost secret martial arts books aren't available,

493
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,140
but he has a marvelous weapon that doesn't require martial arts to wield.

494
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,480
So, my father gave this to me.

495
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,740
What do you think?

496
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:09,480
Is my Tyrant Shooter or Tang Sect's Storm Pear Flower Needle more formidable?

497
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,860
I'm not very clear about the fights in the Martial Arts World.

498
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,519
I'm just a merchant.

499
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,179
You're more formidable. You're the most powerful.

500
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:23,680
Be careful. Don't misfire it.

501
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,380
How dare you send men to steal poison!

502
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,780
You promised her that you won't harm the innocent!

503
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,480
I promised not to raze Tang Sect to the ground, but I didn't say I'll spare them!

504
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,040
I'm just giving them a taste of their own medicine!

505
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,820
You don't know a thing!

506
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,060
Tang Huan's daily consumption of arsenic has its own antidote.

507
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:16,439
If you do this, you'll just be harming innocent folks.

508
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:32,940
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

509
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:38,440
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

510
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,610
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

511
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:50,530
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

512
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:55,900
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

513
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,780
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

514
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:07,620
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

515
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:13,520
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

516
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,340
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

517
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:25,170
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

518
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:31,120
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

519
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,960
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

520
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,800
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

521
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:51,610
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

522
00:37:51,610 --> 00:38:02,480
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
