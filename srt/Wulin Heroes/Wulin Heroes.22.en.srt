♫ I just came from the forest not yet awake looking like a ginseng elf ♫

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:20,970
♫ I’m full of skills, I broke into the Martial Arts World alone ♫

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,660
♫ I believe in destiny, looked everywhere but nobody specified what it is ♫

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:33,760
♫ Once again, I have hope and expectation of love yet who is my destiny is unknown ♫

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,760
♫ See, turns out that destiny has always been waiting for me ♫

♫ I came to the world just to ask about the whereabouts of love ♫

[Grand Finale: Episode 22]

17
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:40,260
Hey, beautiful girl.

18
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,100
Are you calling me?

19
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,319
At this beautiful moonlit riverside, do you want to have a drink with us?

20
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,399
Let me ask you a question first.

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,300
Those lights are really pretty. Did you make them?

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,059
Those are melon lanterns from the central plains.

23
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:58,380
Just now, a young master bought a cartful of melons from us.

24
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,419
He must have made them.

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,080
Come. Let's have another drink.

26
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,599
Wait.

27
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,839
Did you make all of these?

28
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,320
Why are you here?

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,540
Don't stop pouring the wine.

30
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,180
But you look much more pleasing in white.

31
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,359
Just pleasing?

32
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:32,059
Fine, you're so charming that I can't keep my eyes off you, but I'm not obsessed with good looks.

33
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,479
The moon in the water is as unreachable as that in the sky.

34
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,599
The lady before me is the one who has captured my heart.

35
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,439
I can recite poems, too.

36
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,219
If you want to hear stories about Moon River, I can relate them to you for three days and three nights.

37
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,060
- For example, there used to be a—
- I don't want to listen to that.

38
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm handsome, delightful to be with, and knowledgeable.

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,819
Why aren't I a match for that scholar?

40
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,539
These aren't important. I'm looking for...

41
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,439
Forget it. You won't understand.

42
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,299
Of course, I understand. You're looking for a good man.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,260
How did you know?

44
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,240
Naturally, I know your wishes.

45
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:26,519
You're looking for a good man to marry you.

46
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,800
You want to build a family with him and never part.

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,539
Once you have someone to light a lantern for you, you'll never be alone again.

48
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,560
There is spiritual consonance connecting our hearts.

49
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,419
I'm the only good man for you, and you're still my dearest love.

50
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,759
Even though you've forgotten the past, that doesn't matter.

51
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,880
Every moment we shared is engraved in my heart.

52
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,459
I see you when I open my eyes,

53
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,939
and you're still there when I close my eyes.

54
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,800
Humans suffer from countless illnesses.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,379
Lovesickness is the only incurable one.

56
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,780
While you were absent, my yearning has turned into an illness.

57
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,539
So, I can only try time and again to sketch your face.

58
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:18,559
When you see this, you'll understand my heart.

59
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,199
Aren't ladies in marriage robes meant to be the prettiest?

60
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,639
Why are you prettier than me in these drawings?

61
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,639
Are these your true feelings?

62
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,679
Young Master, this is just our second meeting.

63
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:47,580
Am I supposed to believe your devotion to me just because of this storybook?

64
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,419
You're too foolish and naive.

65
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:51,819
Wait!

66
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,539
What will make you believe in my feelings?

67
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:59,500
Whatever you ask, I'll risk my all to fulfill your request and prove my love.

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,940
Risk your all?

69
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,979
Why do these words sound so familiar?

70
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,500
You once risked everything to marry me.

71
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,920
You eliminated everything in your path, be it man or god.

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,639
From that moment, my heart was yours. You're more important than my life.

73
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,499
Did I pursue men in that manner?

74
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:22,700
Let go first.

75
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,299
You're the only one for me. I won't let go.

76
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,939
- If you don't, I'll scream for help.
- Go on and scream.

77
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:34,260
I already regret never expressing my feelings earlier.

78
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,979
Right now, I want the whole world to know my feelings.

79
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,079
Scream.

80
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,660
Young Master, no matter how handsome you are, you can't be so shameless!

81
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,279
For you, even my dignity isn't important.

82
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,400
Young Master, you're a real sweet talker.

83
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,039
Those fictional scumbags who dupe women with words aren't even a fractional match for you.

84
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,680
Why are you still so blind?

85
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,260
I'm so refined! Why are you calling me a scumbag?

86
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,480
Aren't you the one who loves such gimmicks?

87
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,539
I ditched my dignity for you! What else do you want?

88
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,160
Gimmicks? I'm blind?

89
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,579
Young Master, the night is cold, and the pathogenic wind is damaging your body.

90
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:19,020
You're blabbing nonsense because you're muddled.

91
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,700
Consult a physician quickly.

92
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,460
By the way, this lantern is gorgeous.

93
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,920
Someone like you wouldn't make it. It's out of character.

94
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,120
Sure!

95
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,139
The beautiful lady is leaving. She's leaving.

96
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,180
Why are you laughing?

97
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,759
Come on! Eat up. Enjoy the meat.

98
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,759
Eat up. Enjoy the meat.

99
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,800
Hami melon! Hami melon!

100
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,119
Take some. Here.

101
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:47,639
Must I really vomit blood?

102
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,500
It tastes good.

103
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,260
Here is your wine.

104
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,060
Come on, bottoms up.

105
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,159
Hold on! Young Master!

106
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,160
Wait!

107
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,620
Miss, we're in public. Please don't grab me.

108
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,879
What a coincidence! We're living in the same inn!

109
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,520
But why are you in this state? What happened?

110
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,140
I was robbed by some ruffians out there.

111
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,760
You were robbed?

112
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,380
- I'll get your stuff back!
- No, wait!

113
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,900
They didn't take my money.

114
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,079
They... caught me.

115
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,439
Thank goodness some soldiers saved me.

116
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,519
Listen up, this is a rowdy place.

117
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,580
You're frail and unskilled in martial arts. You need to be careful when you're out and about.

118
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,770
How about traveling with me? I can protect you with my martial arts!

119
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,260
No, thanks. I'll head back.

120
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,940
I'm being serious!

121
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,839
Someone like you needs protection! Just stick with me!

122
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,160
Hold on, Miss. I really need to go in and change my clothes.

123
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,760
That's perfect.

124
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,779
What's perfect?

125
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:59,019
Perfectly shameless.

126
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,940
As a lady, how can you be so brazen?

127
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,760
What's great about this?

128
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,060
Just you wait.

129
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,259
Miss!

130
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,879
You're late.

131
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,900
Valley Master Bai, you sure are scheming.

132
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,259
We've made quite a detour from Jiangnan all the way past the Great Wall.

133
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,799
You don't look upset.

134
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,000
We've done our best, so this must be fate.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,320
His Highness is a gifted man, and only he can govern this country.

136
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,060
I'm sure the heavens wouldn't want His Highness to be obsessed with a woman who doesn't belong to him.

137
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,039
His Highness should be well after recuperating in Fenghua Valley.

138
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,359
You can take him back to the capital.

139
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,920
One more thing.

140
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,799
Pass this to him on my behalf.

141
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,759
I hope he'll keep his promise.

142
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,990
I, too, hope for his good health so that he can protect this world.

143
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,460
Farewell, Valley Master Bai.

144
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,080
- Shopkeeper!
- Yes?

145
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,519
- Do you have radishes?
- We do. I'll get them for you.

146
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,359
Why is this happening? This isn't right.

147
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,860
What's not right, Miss?

148
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,479
Tell me upfront if you want to look at my birthmark!

149
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:37,159
There's no need to be so brutish.

150
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,419
Hold on.

151
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:42,900
How can that be a birthmark?

152
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,120
This birthmark has been here since my birth! What's wrong with it?

153
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,940
Let me have another look just to be sure.

154
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,700
Let me see!

155
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:00,140
A man and a woman alone in a room? Preposterous!

156
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,340
This is none of your business!

157
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,159
You, too. Why didn't you say it's a birthmark?

158
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,640
I wouldn't want to look at that!

159
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,839
You didn't tell me a thing or give me a chance to speak! Look at you!

160
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,920
You even ripped my clothes apart! Utterly uncouth!

161
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,819
So, that's what you're looking for.

162
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,580
What...

163
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,060
Big Brother! I saw that rascal run there!

164
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,919
Come on! Let's go over there!

165
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,880
T-Those were the ruffians who robbed me!

166
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,359
Fine, I'll teach them a lesson to make it up to you. I'm off.

167
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:37,939
Miss! Miss, they...

168
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,840
Eat this.

169
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,800
W-What... How can you two be so unruly?!

170
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,999
You're even tagging along for a fight? How long are you going to follow me around?

171
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,820
Forever.

172
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,719
- Did you find him?
- Nope.

173
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:09,020
He's from the central plains, so he should be in the inn up ahead. Let's go.

174
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:16,359
This one is even more good-looking than the one who fled. Grab him!

175
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,280
Are you guys blind? Why are you targeting him instead of me?

176
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,799
Why would we capture you? Women dancing is a common sight.

177
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:41,939
Oh, I see.

178
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:46,559
Watching men dance is entertaining, but you can't kidnap people off the streets!

179
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,579
We're in the wrong for kidnapping people, but you can't beat people up!

180
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:54,360
You even beat us up so brutally!

181
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,860
Shouldn't you be punished for your evil deeds?

182
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,559
I'm warning you guys.

183
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,480
Don't bring knives and swords when you're out. Scram!

184
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Let's go!

185
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,420
Come on!

186
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,539
What's up with you? Why are you injured from just watching us?

187
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,899
I...

188
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,600
I'm feeling unwell from the pathogenic wind.

189
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,100
You won't puke up blood from that.

190
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,939
I told you, the pathogenic wind is afflicting me.

191
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,100
Should I get you a physician?

192
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,220
I'm a physician.

193
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,820
Quick, help me back.

194
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,380
Hurry up! I'm about to topple!

195
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,480
Fine.

196
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,020
W-Wait, what are you doing?

197
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,780
Conducting acupuncture to cure myself.

198
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,639
Are you going to prick yourself with needles? Aren't you afraid of pain?

199
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,539
I am, so...

200
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,979
Can you hug me from behind?

201
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:27,620
If you do so, I won't fidget no matter how pain it is.

202
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,479
If I insert the needle in the wrong place,

203
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:32,860
my meridian flow will be reversed, and I'll lose all my martial arts skills.

204
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,459
Saving a life is more honorable than building a seven-tier pagoda.

205
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:52,959
Fine. I'll call that scholar over and let him have this blessed chance.

206
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,439
Why are you calling him over?

207
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,020
Aren't I the one you've been looking for?

208
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,759
This bite mark...

209
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,779
You can't possibly forget the mark you left behind.

210
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,040
I...

211
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,619
Let me bite you again to confirm if I did that.

212
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,879
You're still so reckless.

213
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,539
What's wrong? Want to bite me again?

214
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:30,539
Your arm. You bit yourself thrice to save me.

215
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,719
Did you forget that too?

216
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,320
Didn't you say to only take one bite?

217
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,200
How many bites did you give me?

218
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,219
When I woke up this morning, I couldn't even stop my nose from bleeding.

219
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:44,620
I was afraid it wouldn't be enough, so I bit a few extra bites.

220
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,959
Don't worry. My flesh is good.

221
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:01,639
Don't worry, I'll recover tomorrow. I bit down a little hard.

222
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,540
You look like you've been chewed by a rat.

223
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,019
Quite a few chunks are missing. It will look ugly.

224
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,080
Don't hate me for biting you.

225
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,179
It took me great effort to recall my memories, but you tried to steal them away.

226
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,139
I don't want to forget you.

227
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,399
If I really did,

228
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,300
this mark

229
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,340
will lead me to you.

230
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:03,999
In life and in death, we shall never part.

231
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,639
We will never be separated again.

232
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,879
In fact, we're fated to be together.

233
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,199
I would never make a mistake in finding you.

234
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,579
Did you bite that raw radish earlier?

235
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,639
You didn't have to remind me in that manner.

236
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,899
Have you recalled the past?

237
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:34,619
The night is long. We have all the time in the world to find out.

238
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,880
♫ Day and night, I’ll protect you unconditionally ♫

239
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,310
♫ How many times have we been through life and death? ♫

240
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,280
♫ Because you are by my side ♫

241
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,870
♫ All my misfortunes becomes understated ♫

242
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,150
♫ After many upheavals, our love hasn’t diminished ♫

243
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,480
♫ Just like the day we first met ♫

244
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,550
♫ With every passing year ♫

245
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:02,620
♫ Our longings for each other are stacked into eternity ♫

246
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:13,410
♫ We will abide by our long-ago promise to be together forever ♫

247
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:14,799
Is that the Bai family's clan land there?

248
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,240
Yes, that place is surrounded by water and is very serene.

249
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,140
I'll take you there next time.

250
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,000
Why not now?

251
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,440
That's because your best friend, Lin Xiaoxiao, is waiting to tease you on your wedding night.

252
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,240
But, other than you, I haven't recalled anyone else.

253
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,619
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have made decisions for you.

254
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,319
Nevertheless, even in my muddled state, I still came here.

255
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,739
That mark also helped me recognize you.

256
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:47,440
I'm sure other memories will come back to me in time.

257
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,319
Well said.

258
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,919
We can definitely grow old together and spend every moment by each other's side.

259
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,819
We shall never part.

260
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,840
Must we spend every moment together?

261
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,620
In that case, I won't be able to enjoy watching other men dance.

262
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,100
I also won't be able to chat with other men about life, ambitions, and poetry!

263
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,400
Repeat yourself. I didn't hear you clearly.

264
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,480
I said...

265
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,240
Well...

266
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,259
I see no one else. You're the only one I see.

267
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:18,419
There won't be anyone else.

268
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,199
Young Master, you're the most perfect man in this world.

269
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:26,799
What an exaggerated expression and superficial words.

270
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,500
Well... Will this action help?

271
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,159
I don't have the energy to hug you.

272
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,740
Just say you don't want to hug me. What's that about having no energy?

273
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,159
Do you know how exhausted I am from looking for you?

274
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,520
You had the time of your life drinking wine and feasting on meat.

275
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,680
Don't you think you've gained weight?

276
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,519
Are you disdainful of me for getting fat?

277
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,560
Someone once told me the western region has delicious food.

278
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,920
Since I'm here, I have to eat to my heart's content.

279
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,579
I said that, and you still look pretty even if you're fat.

280
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,036
Having a sweet mouth is wonderful.

281
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:22,260
Let me say something too.

282
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,600
Spending every moment with you, growng old together,

283
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,880
is the greatest blessing of my life.

284
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,680
Me, too.

285
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,799
I will change for you.

286
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,012
I will make your life blissful.

287
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,419
Your Highness, I failed to locate Miss Ye first.

288
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,499
If you're still angry, I'll accept any punishment.

289
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:06,239
I'm not angry.

290
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,100
I admit defeat, and our wager has nothing to do with you.

291
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,900
Your Highness, this is a gift from Valley Master Bai.

292
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,400
He hopes that your troubles can dissipate, and you can treasure your life to govern the world.

293
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,760
I can never obtain what I desire.

294
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:32,620
My wishes end up in nothing.

295
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:35,520
Yet, he wants me to love the common folk?

296
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,319
Your Highness, Miss Ye is part of the common folk.

297
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:41,979
She would also wish for your health and safety as well.

298
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:44,766
Only then will you have the chance to meet frequently.

299
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:48,019
You recovered so quickly because of Fenghua Valley's meticulous care.

300
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:50,320
You often talked about razing Fenghua Valley to the ground,

301
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,480
but Valley Master Bai never held grudges and saved you many times.

302
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,960
More than benevolence, he treats you with sincerity.

303
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,619
I will treasure my life,

304
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,859
but true love no longer exists in my world.

305
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,080
What are you hiding?

306
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,639
Did you buy more storybooks behind my back?

307
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:33,279
This isn't a storybook! It's a travel diary written by that scholar!

308
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:39,800
You don't treasure my drawings for you, but the works of others are gems to you.

309
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,620
That's because you were so ungentlemanly!

310
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,859
You only beautified yourself!

311
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,119
This scholar is a talented gentleman!

312
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,939
His writings are excellent!

313
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:06,599
Yes, they're great. Why didn't you agree to admire the misty rain in Jiangnan with him?

314
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,520
You knew about that? Are you jealous?

315
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,779
- What are you doing?
- Stay still!

316
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,499
It looks hideous. Toss it away.

317
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:34,699
That wasn't a gift from the scholar. Are you jealous over that too?

318
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,079
This hair tie is so exquisite.

319
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,359
Is this a token of your love?

320
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:47,480
Our love is set in stone. We don't need such tokens.

321
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,920
This is just something for you, but I'm just lacking a hair stick.

322
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,800
When I find excellent camphor wood, I'll make a nice hair stick for you.

323
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,300
Camphor?

324
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,459
Isn't Jiangnan famous for those trees? The travel diary said so.

325
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,879
Can you stop mentioning Jiangnan to me?

326
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,399
Why not?

327
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:10,311
Why won't you take me there?

328
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,520
Why did you even ask me about rejecting him? You're the reason.

329
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,020
In my eyes, you're always the best.

330
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,800
Are you still jealous?

331
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,080
I'm never jealous.

332
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,919
Well, what's with that gloomy face just now?

333
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,580
That's because I've had enough.

334
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:32,779
Come on.

335
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,259
Tie it on.

336
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,520
Young Master, let's conduct our marriage ceremony first

337
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,839
and then head to Flowing Water Manor to have fun at their wedding?

338
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:57,030
♫ Leaving clues in the melody of the zither, no one can hear my thoughts  ♫

339
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,720
♫ How do we stay together?  ♫

340
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,320
All done.

341
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:06,819
By the way, I haven't asked you about the man buried alongside you.

342
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:10,259
That's an old friend you don't need to know about.

343
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,599
Is that so?

344
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:16,879
He sure is handsome, so much so that I can't forget him after a single glance.

345
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:20,910
If you mention other men before me again, I'll keep your lips sealed.

346
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,720
♫ Unrequited love leaps into reincarnation to pursue the beloved  ♫

348
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,770

349
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,150

350
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:45,200
♫ How can we stay together when you didn't come with me?  ♫

351
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,899
Being with your true love is such bliss.

352
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,980
This is what you've wanted.

353
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,700
I will fulfill your wishes.

354
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,940
I will protect the peace you wish for in this world and ensure your life of peace.

355
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,820
There is no tree of wisdom, nor stand of mirror bright.

356
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:14,020
Since there is but a void, where can dust fall?

357
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:22,270
♫ The years don't hold on to the memories  ♫

358
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,580
Your Highness, you've made your prayers. Let's hurry back to the palace.

359
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:31,440
Wasn't this tree dead at that time?

360
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,800
This is an aged tree, but Valley Master Bai said there was hope in reviving it.

361
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,440
We followed his instructions, and we managed to revive it.

362
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:44,459
I still remember a tree older than this one growing in Fenghua Valley.

363
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,680
It was so lush.

364
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,000
I was just about to make a report.

365
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,680
Fenghua Valley sent over many top-grade medicinal herbs and ingredients for porridge.

366
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,280
Porridge?

367
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,380
Are those worth making such a long journey to deliver?

368
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,879
Valley Master Bai specifically selected them for you.

369
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:02,119
Daily consumption can strengthen the body and ensure longevity.

370
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,219
These are supposed to be better than medicine...

371
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,159
Deliver all the Night Pearls in the palace to Fenghua Valley.

372
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,760
Make that payment for Fenghua Valley's gifts.

373
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,800
After that, move this tree right before my bedroom.

374
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,539
But...

375
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:22,100
But this tree was just revived. Valley Master Bai advised that we take meticulous care of it.

376
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,780
If the move damages it...

377
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,139
If it withers, so be it.

378
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,600
If you can't even carry out such a simple task, don't bother showing up before me again.

379
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,380
One more thing.

380
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:37,759
Don't mention the two of them so casually.

381
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,739
Why aren't you going in?

382
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:11,879
The weather is nice today, so I'm taking a stroll.

383
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,359
Uncle Hui, what are you carrying?

384
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:18,180
They bought this. It cost 10 taels of silver.

385
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,400
Don't doubt your eyes. This word cost 10 taels of silver.
[Scripture]

386
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,159
10 taels of silver for a useless piece of paper?

387
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,860
Selling a secret scripture per page.

388
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,599
Isn't that a smart idea?

389
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,520
Maximizing profits in this way is too unscrupulous!

390
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,779
I was just trying to earn some allowance!

391
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:41,359
Besides, I'm doing this for the harmony of the Martial Arts World!

392
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,280
This is a fair and transparent transaction!

393
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,459
Isn't it great that people don't have to fight?

394
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:51,919
What's going on? Did you get into a quarrel?

395
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,939
Hey, couldn't you make it clear that she's behind it?

396
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,699
If you did, I wouldn't have offended her.

397
00:27:56,699 --> 00:28:01,270
What's the reason for this fight? Tell me, and I'll mediate.

398
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,259
It's all because of Chu Yao and his wife.

399
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:09,739
On the second day of their marriage, they quarreled over sweet soymilk and savory soymilk.

400
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:12,739
She came back and asked about my favorite flavor.

401
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:16,940
I casually answered, savory soymilk has its charms.

402
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,739
She said she was devastated.

403
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,960
J-Just because of this?

404
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,200
There was also...

405
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,739
She said those years wandering the world was tiring.

406
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,979
I prescribed medicine to soothe her body.

407
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:35,841
The medicine was a little bitter, so she accused me of making her life miserable.

408
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:38,900
In that case, it must be more than a little bitter.

409
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,340
It was definitely extraordinarily bitter.

410
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,820
In my opinion, you were in the wrong.

411
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,900
I have an idea.

412
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,980
You can plead guilty and atone on your knees.

413
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,900
Atonement?

414
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,960
Only kneeling on thorns would express true sincerity.

415
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,879
Uncle Hui, go look for some thorns, those that are resistant to breaking.

416
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,760
Okay.

417
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:14,779
Enough! Will you really make me suffer on thorns? Get moving.

418
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:17,859
- Aren't you the one who wants to atone for your wrongs?
- Come on.

419
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,639
Let's not argue anymore.

420
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:27,919
Sit.

421
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:36,880
I'll listen to you on everything from now on. Don't be angry anymore.

422
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
Good.

423
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,940
But I have a condition.

424
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,099
I heard Xiaoxiao and Chu Yao have an agreement of three rules.

425
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:48,939
I don't mind however many rules.

426
00:29:48,939 --> 00:29:51,140
But can you please not mention them?

427
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,840
Speak.

428
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,119
When we get up in the morning, you must comb my hair and draw my eyebrows.

429
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,939
When the weather is cold, get an extra comforter for me.

430
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:05,119
When the weather is hot, you'll fan for me.

431
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:10,079
If you leave my sight for more than one hour, you must notify me in advance.

432
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,400
Why don't you drink the medicine first? Here.

433
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,680
That...

434
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,371
The most important thing is, can you not force me to drink the medicinal soup anymore?

435
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,939
I can agree on everything you said before that.

436
00:30:25,939 --> 00:30:30,660
But if you think the medicine is too bitter, I'll feed you.

437
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:37,779
Your way of sharing the good and bad in life is a little too much, isn't it?

438
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,979
What's the matter? Are you feeling bad?

439
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:50,920
I'm fine.

440
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,759
Don't try to diagnose and treat me on anything trivial.

441
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,600
Come.

442
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,580
Do you realize that you're pregnant?

443
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,380
I'll take your pulse every day from now on.

444
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,259
Don't get upset over nothing. Don't eat randomly.

445
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:14,420
When you leave my sight over half an hour, you must notify me in advance.

446
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:19,080
Also, don't sell that scripture anymore. It'll take too much effort.

447
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,699
We aren't short of money.

448
00:31:20,699 --> 00:31:23,340
So many Night Pearls are piled over thre.

449
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:27,119
Those are a gift to you, not to me.

450
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,219
Are you still separating what's yours or mine now?

451
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:32,480
You are making me sad.

452
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:35,699
I'm devastated.

453
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:40,780
I said that casually.

454
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,739
Don't get agitated.

455
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,780
I will listen to you on everything from now on, all right?

456
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:49,579
Good.

124shernelle14_996, danielley_montgomery_936, humilim, miss_rochester, t_jinyagd21,

460
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,859
I'm pregnant, but this is how you treat me?

461
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:16,400
Don't worry. I'm a miracle physician.

462
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,900
I know what to do. It's good for your health to move around more.

463
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,419
Don't they say you'd lose your calm if you care too much about something? Why aren't you nervous at all?

464
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:28,579
That's because I don't want you to get anxious.

465
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,920
I think we should raise our child like an herb.

466
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,419
There are some that are difficult to raise.

467
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,799
They get sick whenever there's too much or too little water.

468
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,739
They also get sick if it gets cold or hot.

469
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:39,380
But some of them are easy to raise.

470
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,720
You can throw them to the wilderness to be exposed to the wind and the sun, they can still grow well.

That's after the baby is born.

476
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,839
It's still early. I think you are the anxious one.

477
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,060
I'll tell you something that'll make you happy.

478
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,520
Remember the seeds you planted in the ginseng garden?

479
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,979
Later, I asked Uncle Hui to move them to a less-traveled place in Changliu Mountain.

480
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:23,060
Uncle Hui said 80 percent of them are alive.

481
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,259
- Really?
- Really.

482
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:27,599
There'll be ginseng in Changliu Mountain in the future.

483
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,720
This is wonderful. I've finally achieved virtuous merits.

484
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,340
I'm going to find some good foods to celebrate.

485
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,240
You better not go. I'll go.

486
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:45,480
How can I let my young master do such manual labor?

487
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,720
You should let me move more. Didn't you say it's good for my health?

488
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,480
Be good.

00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:49,340
Let's make some soup. Chicken soup, fish soup, or rib soup?

502
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,900
I'm tired of those soups.

503

Don't be picky.

Actually, I think you should never go to the kitchen, Young Master.
