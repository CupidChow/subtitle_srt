Ye Xi,

18
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,954
have I ever told you this?

19
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:44,406
In my entire lifetime, I believe what I did most right

20
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:47,730
was waiting by the unmarked burial mounds

21
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,820
so that you could see me as soon as you woke up.

22
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,780
In this lifetime, I haven't wasted even a minute or a second of time to be with you.

23
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,847
As such, I have no regrets.

24
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:05,210
To be with you at this moment,

25
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,126
to know and be committed to each other like this,

26
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,611
I never would have dared to dream of such.

27
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:17,826
But the curse cannot be lifted.

28
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,839
I, Bai Yue,

29
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:23,742
to have a good woman as you

30
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:25,652
who doesn't leave or abandon me,

31
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:28,035
follow each other in life and in death,

32
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:30,939
I'm content for this lifetime.

33
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:33,682
So, don't feel pity for me.

34
00:02:33,682 --> 00:02:36,244
Sleep well.

35
00:02:36,244 --> 00:02:39,278
Forget me when you wake up.

36
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:43,106
Become the simple and happy you again.

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,018
Stay live and live well.

38
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,964
But you absolutely must remember, never give your heart easily,

39
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,867
because in this world, the one you love the most should be yourself.

40
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:03,479
Understand?

41
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:14,226
What did you make me eat?

42
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:16,088
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,039
I lied to you.

44
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,259
There is simply no medicine to restore memories in this world.

45
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:29,103
There is only medicine to forget the past.

46
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,620
Ye Xi, I want you to forget me.

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,498
You've never experienced the agony of losing a loved one.

48
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:48,701
That feeling when you see your lover lying before you,

49
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:52,663
but too afraid to check her breath or pulse.

50
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:59,239
I can't bear letting you experience such misery and heartache.

51
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,906
Do you think this is a form of kindness?

52
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:06,946
You're only satisfying your own desires.

53
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:11,159
I told you, I don't need you to make decisions for me.

54
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,200
Forgive me...

55
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,120
for defying your wishes...

56
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:19,200
one last time.

Back then, you told me about that lullaby.

60

I mastered it.

61
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,726
I'll play it for you now.

62
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:51,316
You'll fall asleep while listening to it.

63
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,782
No, I won't.

64
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,267
I won't listen to it!

65
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:13,057
There's one more tune, but I'm exhausted.

66
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:20,606
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:27,962
At the very end, I failed to show you a proper marriage ceremony.

I really...

00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,137
wanted to grow old with you.

If you're alone in this world, I'll be worried sick.

You are in my heart, but you don't know.

100
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,273
Your heart was filled with so many grievances.

101
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:41,124
Even at the brink of death, you refused to utter a word.

102
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:48,839
That was why you were plagued by resentment and turned into a curse.

So many people in the world miss a chance at love in this manner.

If you like someone, you should say it out loud.

It took me great effort to recall my memories, but you tried to steal them away.

00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:06,540
This one is like an immortal untainted by the world.

160
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,419
The other is like an alluring demon ready to bewitch the soul.

161
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:20,539
But why did two grown men die in this place at the same time?

162
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,000
Based on storybooks...

163
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,287
Did you two lose your lives fighting over a ravishing beauty?

164
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,101
Such handsome faces! Alas, what a pity!

165
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:40,200
Though, why do they seem so familiar?

166
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,910
Was I that beauty?

167
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:46,020
No, that can't be true.

168
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,179
I can't possibly be so uncaring about such darlings.

169
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:54,259
Well, meeting them is fate. Should I do a good deed and bury both of you?

170
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:57,719
Hold on.

171
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,464
What if people mistake me as the murderer?

172
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,779
Sorry! I'm really sorry!

173
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:10,720
My two handsome men, death is the end anyway.

174
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,205
Nothing matters now, right?

175
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:14,879
I'll get going!

176
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,680
Ye Xi. Ye Xi!

177
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,479
I'm still alive, and my heart isn't aching.

178
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:28,956
Turns out the way to lift the curse is to be buried together with one's beloved in the coffin.

179
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:34,447
Only when both lovers are willing to die for each other, can they transcend life and death.

180
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,523
Why are you the one here?

181
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:02,019
Get up.

182
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,363
Why are we here?

183
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:13,180
Where is Ye Xi?

184
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:16,719
Ye Xi!

185
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,039
Where are you, Ye Xi?

186
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,739
Where is Ye Xi?

187
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:26,119
I remember the two of you lying down in the jade coffin together, and the coffin closed.

188
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,799
I couldn't push it to open at all.

189
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,019
And then the jade coffin exploded, and I passed out.

190
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,239
- Why are we here? Where is she? What happened to her?
- Calm down.

191
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,267
Why are you howling like this?

192
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:43,459
She must have left because she believed we were dead.

193
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:47,499
Why? Why did she leave?

194
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:49,819
Because she lost her memory.

195
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:52,066
I made her lose her memory.

196
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,295
I thought I was definitely dying, so I made her lose her memory.

197
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:01,712
I thought it would be good for her.

198
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:05,940
But I ultimately made the same mistake as you did.

199
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,740
Perhaps the intentions are good, but we may end up making mistakes.

200
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,417
That's why the punishment will come fast.

201
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:16,300
We can't find her now.

202
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:20,401
How did this happen?

203
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:22,480
She should still be in Changliu Mountain, right?

204
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,340
Isn't this her home?

205
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,040
Yes.

206
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,596
But she doesn't have any family.

207
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:37,399
There are very few people here.

208
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:39,487
She wouldn't stay here for long.

209
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,839
The world is vast, but I don't know where she'll feel at peace.

210
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,060
Then... what do we do?

211
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,719
Do you really not know how to find her again?

212
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:55,500
The world is vast. How can I find her by myself?

213
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,559
By telepathy?

214
00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:02,691
If so, it's more reliable to let your Black Armored Guards to search.

215
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:05,497
Of course, I'll dispatch the Black Armored Guards to search.

216
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,149
But, are you serious about what you said?

217
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:14,592
You've been lying to me all this time.

218
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,060
I really don't know if I can believe you anymore.

219
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,540
Without my life-saving pill, you would have already died in the tomb.

220
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,199
Why would I have waited for you to wake up to fight me?

221
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,556
How is your wound?

222
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:34,579
It didn't pierce a vital organ. Otherwise, no one would be around to save you now.

223
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:40,040
Your internal injury is quite severe, so you need to rest quietly.

224
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,019
Previously, I painstakingly nurtured your health.

225
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:46,799
But you don't seem to pay attention to your life.

226
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,780
What a waste of my kindness!

227
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,706
It doesn't matter if you save me.

228
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:55,460
Without her, it's meaningless for me to live.

229
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:07,759
Your stubbornness has caused all three of us to die once already.

230
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,138
Can you not let go?

231
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,940
I didn't know this would happen.

232
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,241
I became stronger in order to protect her.

233
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:21,386
Why doesn't she need me?

234
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:23,720
Why can't she give me a little of her heart?

235
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,599
Just a bit would be enough.

236
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,228
That's how pure she is.

237
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:30,519
Love and hate are distinctly different to her.

238
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,080
But you should know that she trusts you and wishes you well.

239
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,884
That's how you think of yourself.

240
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:40,370
Without you, there would be chaos in the country and in the Martial Arts World.

241
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,279
She wouldn't be freely wandering everywhere.

242
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,470
Therefore, even for her only,

243
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,195
you should take care of your body and recuperate well.

244
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,420
Let's do this.

245
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,559
I'll give you one last chance.

246
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:11,321
If the Black Armored Guards find her first, I'll voluntarily withdraw to fulfill you two.

247
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:18,512
But if I find her first, you will give up and go back to being a good prince regent,

248
00:24:18,512 --> 00:24:21,279
take care of your health, and safeguard the country.

249
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,640
All of us will rely on you in the future.

250
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,199
Fine.

251
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:31,980
- You can't renege.
- You're the one who mustn't renege.

252
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,700
Let's go then. I'll help you.

253
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,380
Thanks.

254
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,159
If you want to express thanks, just send over more pearls.

255
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,459
Xiao Hua, look at this.

256
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,060
I told you there should be some. Such a long ginseng!

257
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,500
It must be worth 1,000 taels of silver?

258
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,939
So large!

259
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:04,019
- We won't have to worry about our living anymore. No more worries!
- We're rich!

260
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:06,759
No, no. This isn't ginseng.

261
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,519
It's called Yuanzhi.
(Thinleaf Milkwort Root-bark)

262
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,680
It is also called Fine Grass.

263
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,559
It can enhance your brain and strengthen your will. That's why it's called Yuanzhi.

264
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,841
How would you know?

265
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:22,240
Hold it. Miss, has anyone told you that you look like Demoness Ye Xi?

266
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,539
- Demoness Ye Xi?
- Don't talk nonsense.

267
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:28,019
What demoness? Prince Regent has said there's no demoness.

268
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:33,000
But there were wanted posters everywhere in the city, and a bunch of people were searching for her.

269
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,260
Is that right? Why are they looking for me?

270
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,759
As I see it, it's never good when the authorities are looking for you.

271
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,999
They may want to capture you in the palace to be a concubine.

272
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:46,820
Miss, you'd better run farther away.

273
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,179
Yes, yes, thank you.

274
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:51,480
Oh yes, do you know how to go to the western region?

275
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,279
Western region?

276
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,879
- This way!
- That way!

277
00:25:54,879 --> 00:25:56,160
No, it's this way.

278
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,899
- Go westward. Go over this mountain, and keep heading west.
- That's right.

279
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:02,259
- It's far.
- Quite far.

280
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:03,580
- It is.
- Xiao Hua is right.

281
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,500
All right then. I'll go ahead and leave then.

282
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,039
Miss, let me ask you. Do you know where to find ginseng?

283
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,720
There hasn't been ginseng in Changliu Mountain for a long time.

284
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,279
I advise you to dig for other herbs.

285
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,379
I'm leaving now.

286
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:18,059
Best of luck to you.

287
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,759
Wang Daniu, it's all your fault.

288
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,159
You said there's ginseng here, but look at what you dug up!

289
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:32,025
Aren't you worried? Black Armored Guards are searching everywhere.
[Tea]

290
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:36,140
It looks like you know where Ye Xi is.

291
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,060
The western region.

292
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,700
- You really know?
- I guessed.

293
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,580
It's because I recall she mentioned the western region before.

294
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,599
But didn't you say she's lost her memory?

295
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,788
Even if you talked about it, but she would have forgotten it.

296
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:53,099
I believe there is spiritual consonance connecting our hearts.

297
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,459
Young Master Bai, it's far to go to the western region.

298
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:00,080
Can your body handle it?

299
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,970
Also, it's strange that your heart exhaustion ailment came so suddenly, and it also recovered strangely.

300
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,279
Valley Master, you are really something. Why didn't you tell us sooner?

301
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,240
I've recovered already. No more worries.

302
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,979
What's so strange about it? Ye Xi must have cured it.

303
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:17,340
What heart exhaustion? It's just lovesickness.

304
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,780
As the saying goes, lovesickness needs the right cure.

305
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,759
She is your heart medicine.

306
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:26,579
As long as you two can be together for life, everything will work out.

307
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:28,060
You are right.

308
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,660
She gave me the hope to live.

309
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,939
Without her by my side, even my heartbeats aren't steady.

310
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:36,179
I will find her as soon as I can.

311
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,720
This is the first time I see you talk about love with such deep feelings.

312
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,619
I'll get a pen to write it all down and show Miss Ye when she returns.

313
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:46,669
Are you certain that you'll bring her back?

314
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,585
I actually have an idea.

315
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,179
You can use internal force to force blood out of your mouth.

316
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:55,160
And then pretend you are unconscious.

317
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,379
Ye Xi will be softhearted and help you recuperate, you'll take the chance to cling to her.

318
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:00,319
Eldest Miss Lin's idea is great.

319
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,780
It's written in all the storybooks. Go ahead and try.

320
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,259
You don't need the hassle of the Self Injury Strategem. I'll teach you a tactic.

321
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,499
Use the Male Beauty Strategem. Pretty yourself up.

322
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:12,119
And sweet talk those words of love like just now.

323
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,300
Of course, you should project a gentle demeanor.

324
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:22,180
It's best to add the kind of gaze and voice that can make an iron tree bloom and force tears out of a rock.

325
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,680
Trust me. She'll be enchanted by you.

326
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,460
- Do I need to pretty myself up?
- What...

327
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,100
At least change your clothes.

328
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,720
You're always dressed in white.

329
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,519
So boring.

330
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:41,839
If you really want her to fall for you for a millennium with one look, just try my method.

331
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,079
All right. I won't bother you anymore. I know what I'll do.

332
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,720
She and I have a token of love. I'm sure I will find her.

333
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
That will be wonderful.

334
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,728
I'll be waiting for you to attend our wedding next month.

335
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,079
W-What wedding? Why don't I know anything about it?

336
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,680
I haven't even met your father.

337
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,419
It's my birthday next month. Let's just have the wedding too.

338
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:03,480
- I...
- Don't worry.

339
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,340
Your Male Beauty Strategem already trapped me.

340
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,279
My father has to approve even if he doesn't want to.

341
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:14,000
All right. In that case, I hereby give you my best wishes for your marital bliss.

342
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,060
We'll meet again at Flowering Water Manor.

343
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,540
Uncle Hui, take good care of Cang Qi when you go back.

344
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,179
Make sure to let him take my prescription regularly.

345
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:25,500
- Valley Master, rest assured.
- I'm leaving now.

346
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,580
Everyone, farewell.

347
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,019
Young Master Bai, be sure to take good care of yourself during your travels.

348
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,519
Why don't you give me a token of love?

349
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,200
I can make it up on the token of love.

350
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,520
But we must have a strict agreement.

351
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,120
First of all, you must not hug other people under broad daylight.

352
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,459
Secondly, don't be lovey-dovey in the carriage.

353
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:05,319
Thirdly, without my permision, you can't knead my face or pinch my ears again.

354
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,199
I have to knead your face.

355
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,599
- I just love kneading your face.
- You two,

356
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,939
I'll bid you farewell now.

357
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,599
Farewell, Uncle Hui.

358
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:16,699
Travel safe, Uncle Hui.

359
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,519
- Let's go.
- I'm not going.

360
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,039
If you don't go, I'll have to knead your face again.

361
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:24,420
- I'm not going.
- Hurry up.

362
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,159
Hurry and go.

363
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,079
Once more!

364
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,079
Here, Miss. Try it.

365
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,540
Sure.

366
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:10,440
Miss, look at this. Pretty things.

367
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,280
Choose one.

368
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
Great!

369
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,200
Miss, do you also like this dance?

370
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,640
Good!

371
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,856
Do you know its origin?

372
00:31:46,856 --> 00:31:48,780
I don't.

373
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,658
It's the Sogdian Whirl Dance.

374
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:54,260
The dancers turn fast like the wind, that's why it's called whirl dance.

375
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,680
A poem describes it this way.

376
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,480
Her sleeves raised to the sound of drum music,

377
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,876
fluttering like snowflakes in the air as she turns and dances.
(T/N: Poem by Tang-dynasty poet, Bai Juyi)

378
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:08,740
When I heard this poem before, I could only imagine it.

379
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:14,260
Now that I'm here, I can finally witness how exquisite this dance is.

380
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,819
It proves that reading ten thousand books cannot compare to traveling ten thousand miles.

381
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:22,960
Young Master, you are so knowledgeable.

382
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,599
She is not watching the dance. She is watching the men.

383
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:35,420
After all, it's rare to see men who can dance.

384
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,640
I'll ask you a question then.

385
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,020
Look at that man.

386
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,719
Too short, not as tall as I am.

387
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:45,119
The other one is too tanned, not as fair as I am.

388
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,480
The last one is too ugly, not as handsome as I am.

389
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,719
So which one do you like?

390
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,720
- I...
- - I'll take my leave then.

391
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,939
Goodbye.

392
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,660
Your Master, don't leave! I haven't finished talking.

393
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,179
You like him?

394
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,179
How is he better than I am?

395
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,680
His accent sounds like it's from Jiangnan.

396
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,780
They say the river and soil there nurture people.

397
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,160
No wonder he is handsome like a jade tree.

398
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,839
He even speaks in a gentle and mild manner, and he is educated in poetry and books.

399
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,119
He can travel far, it means he is healthy.

400
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:23,060
He can appreciate music and dance, it means he has a refined taste.

401
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,880
The more I think, he is simply too perfect.

402
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,960
You think he is handsome and educated?

403
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,779
Let me tell you the truth. The more handsome a man is, the better he is at deception.

404
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:36,340
Aren't you the best liar than?

405
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,699
My beauty doesn't require compliments.

406
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:42,140
How can those ordinary and mediocre men compare to me?

407
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,415
It turns out that you are the most shameless man.

408
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:51,099
I remember now.

409
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,359
You are that dead man!

410
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,770
I didn't recognize you when you are dressed like this.

411
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,559
Where's your friend who was also lying on the ground?

412
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:03,640
I'm standing in front of you. Why are you asking about another man?

413
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,385
So you two didn't die.

414
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:09,039
Luckily I was unkind and didn't bury you.

415
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,879
After all, a mortal man cannot be grown back alive.

416
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,519
You must be looking for that other man, right?

417
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,668
I'm looking for you.

418
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,800
You can't remember me because you lost your memory.

419
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,760
But I am actually your husand.

420
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,059
You've also said, you will only have eyes for me.

421
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:30,660
Even if someone else is better by 1,000 or 10,000 times than I am, you wouldn't take another look at them.

422
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,900
I have lost my memory, but I'm not stupid.

423
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,960
I am very sure that I've never spent a wedding night with anyone.

424
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,719
I've never been married. How did I get a husband?

425
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,180
Besides, Young Master, I can't help but say this.

426
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:49,139
When you walk around on the streets dressing all in red, it's simply too glaring.

427
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:54,779
I really don't think I would have liked a man dressed in red before I lost my memory.

428
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:02,200
Young Master, if you really believe that you are totally dazzling and stunning,

429
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,860
just enjoy admiring yourself. I can't match up to you.

430
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,400
Wow!

431
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,500
I can't get angry.

432
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,439
I must be patient.

433
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:25,160
You are not stupid. I'm the stupid one.

434
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:29,339
I shouldn't have listened to that dummy Chu Yao.

435
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,920
Who is thinking of me?

436
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,719
It must be him.

437
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:55,080
I wonder if he has arrived in the western region.

438
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,280
I know that you two are good buddies, but you still don't need to keep nagging about it.

439
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,900
I'm just curious. I wonder if he is using my idea yet.

440
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,239
I think he will use my idea.

441
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:08,419
Why don't we wager and see whose idea works?

442
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:12,039
When Ye Xi gets back, we'll find out.

443
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,920
- Here, here.
- Thanks.

444
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,719
- Come, let's raise our cups.
- Come.

445
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:23,360
Let's all have a drink.

446
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:31,999
Please eat.

447
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,920
Come, come.

448
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:38,279
It smells wonderful.

449
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,840
Come, come. Let's have another drink.

450
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,920
- Come.
- This liquor is good.

451
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:54,159
Hey, beautiful girl.

452
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,100
Are you calling me?

453
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:02,320
At this beautiful moonlit riverside, do you want to have a drink with us?

454
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,499
Let me ask you a question first.

455
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,300
Those lights are really pretty. Did you make them?

456
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,059
Those are melon lanterns from the central plains.

457
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:12,380
Just now, a young master bought a cartful of melons from us.

458
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,319
He must have made them.

459
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,280
Come. Let's have another drink.

460
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,599
Wait.

461
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,842
Did you make all of these?

462
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,860
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

463
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:52,500
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

464
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:58,640
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

465
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,570
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

466
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:10,010
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

467
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:15,750
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

468
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:21,630
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

469
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:27,530
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

470
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:33,390
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

471
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:39,240
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

472
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,080
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

473
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:50,960
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

474
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,690
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

475
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:05,590
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

476
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:16,230
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
