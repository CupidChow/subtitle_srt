♫ I’m full of skills, I broke into the Martial Arts World alone ♫

3

♫ I believe in destiny, looked everywhere but nobody specified what it is ♫

♫ Once again, I have hope and expectation of love yet who is my destiny is unknown ♫

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:59,370
Although I fan the flames and cause trouble everywhere, I came to the world just to ask about the whereabouts of love

[Episode 2]

15
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,159
How long more do we have to walk?

16
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,319
Since we have nothing else to do, tell me more about the world.

17
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,879
I can tell you, but call me Young Master.

18
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,520
Keep your distance from me as well.

19
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:48,259
Young Master, please enlighten me.

20
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,600
The reigning martial artist right now is Lord Lin of Flowing Water Manor.

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,419
He dotes on his only daughter, Lin Xiaoxiao.

22
00:01:55,419 --> 00:02:00,219
However, this man often goes into reclusion and doesn't care much about worldly affairs.

23
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:04,319
So, a number of sects in the martial arts world are restless.

24
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,719
Doesn't that mean trouble is brewing again?

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,800
Aren't you fond of having chaos unfold because of you?

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,239
I'm not like that. Those are just stories.

27
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,740
I think growing old with a nice partner is nice.

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,220
Growing old together?

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,640
Why?

30
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,800
Don't you ever feel lonely journeying in the martial arts world?

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,700
Geniuses are fated to be lonely.

32
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,440
I can't be free of this destiny.

33
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,019
I hate being lonely, and I want a companion.

34
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:42,180
I won't feel so lonely if I have a lit lamp waiting for me at home.

35
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,119
Well, what kind of person must they be?

36
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:51,319
Let's go. We're almost there.

37
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,759
- Trinkets!
- Fresh dumplings!

38
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,419
Young lassy, have a look at these trinkets!

39
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,119
We're finally here. It's really bustling.

40
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,339
Candied hawthorns!

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,640
Come over here.

42
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,979
Wait here for me. Don't move an inch.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,520
Have a look.

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,920
Put this on.

45
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,199
- Are you being nice to me?
- You're overthinking.

46
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,840
I just think it's sunny.

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,520
The sun doesn't bother me. Why are you giving this to me?

48
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,539
I'm using your head as a rack.

49
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:38,840
It's so it's always within reach. Displeased?

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,419
If so, then don't enter the city.

51
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:43,599
- Move it.
- Hold on! I'm glad to do so!

52
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,779
- Where are you headed?
- We're visiting relatives.

53
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:54,639
- What's your name?
- Lin Qingqing.

54
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,920
- Are you two traveling together?
- Yes.

55
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,519
Young Master, what are they holding?

56
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,760
A travel pass. It's necessary to enter the city.

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,740
Are you lacking one? Without it, you can't enter the city.

58
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,800
I... clearly have one.

59
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,619
Stick close.

60
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:15,840
Take a look!

61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,199
What's inside?

62
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,199
Just some grains.

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,879
Who told you I didn't have one?

64
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:33,719
Travel passes.

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,460
Are you traveling together?

66
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,820
Wang Tieshuan of Wang Village?

67
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,519
Remove your headwear.

68
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,820
Why is a pretty lady like you named Wang Tieshuan?
(Tieshuan means iron bolt)

69
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,360
I like this name. Got a problem with it?

70
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,320
Fine, get moving.

71
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,120
Inform the imperial guard immediately.

72
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,020
That young lady who just entered seems to have a bounty on her head.

73
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,020
Hurry up.

74
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,799
With your current condition, you can only eat plain noodles.

75
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,460
Madam, your dishes are ready.

76
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,119
Thanks.

77
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,840
Can't I have a bite?

78
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,320
No.

79
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:05,140
- A sip of the soup should be fine, right?
- No.

80
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,360
You can't finish so much. Why can't you share some with me?

81
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,559
My good looks are enough to satisfy your hunger.

82
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:13,779
You're already privileged to be in my presence for so long.

83
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,859
He's absolutely right!

84
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,079
Even I want to have a second glance.

85
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,999
And you are...

86
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,979
I'm Chu Yao, Young Master Bai's good friend.

87
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,399
I really want to be good friends with Young Master Bai.

88
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,659
It's rare for Young Master Bai to have a traveling companion. What is your name?

89
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,959
Wang Tieshuan.

90
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,399
An excellent name.

91
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,299
Since you're in Bailu City, I have to be a good host.

92
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:59,240
The chef at my manor whips up wonderful dishes.

93
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,900
Would you like to try them?

94
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,620
Of course!

95
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,240
Young Master Bai, come to my manor.

96
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,500
Preparations have been made in accordance with your preferences.

97
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,279
You saved my life when you were here last time.

98
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,979
I owe my life to your miraculous hands.

99
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,360
It's rare for you to leave the mountains and visit Bailu City.

100
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,800
We have to drink until we're drunk to celebrate our reunion.

101
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,060
Let's dismiss everyone first, so our reunion won't be disrupted.

102
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,699
Men!

103
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,439
What's going on?

104
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,959
- Hurry up and leave.
- Get moving.

105
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,179
Move it!

106
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:44,979
You haven't paid yet!

107
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:48,419
Don't worry, I'll pay for everyone.

108
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:03,740
Young Master Chu, since you're so generous, how about you pay for my meal as well?

109
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,600
I only ate a few bowls of noodles.

110
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
I won't interrupt your reunion.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,079
Pay for you own meal if you want to leave.

112
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,519
I'll sit around for a little longer.

113
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,160
What's this?

114
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,859
A greeting gift for you.

115
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:31,279
If you can convince Young Master Bai to reside in my manor, I'll be deeply grateful.

116
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,519
Are you bought over with so little silver?

117
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,700
Don't you feel insulted?

118
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,719
If this is an insult, I don't mind suffering a few more.

119
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,020
Truth be told, Young Master Chu is such an enthusiastic host.

120
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,140
You should reciprocate the kindness of others.

121
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,260
Don't be so stubborn with your rejections.

122
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,860
You're right.

123
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,200
I can't be rude.

124
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,500
With tea in lieu of wine, I thank you.

125
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,460
Wine is fine, and so is tea.

126
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,019
If you're truly willing to come over, I'll be over the moon.

127
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:12,279
Chu Yao's place is a decent place for her to recuperate.

128
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,079
This is ginseng orange peel tea.

129
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:18,759
Excellent tea.

130
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,020
Forget it.

131
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,200
I'll drink my soup.

132
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:24,679
The sun is setting.

133
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,520
How about you follow me back to my manor first?

134
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,060
Fragrant herbal baths have been prepared there.

135
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,039
Y-Your face...

136
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,560
Young Master!

137
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,500
It's so itchy!

138
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
- Young Master.
- Stop.

139
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,739
- Don't hurt them!
- Are you all right?

140
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,439
Stand back.

141
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,299
Stand back!

142
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:47,999
Yes.

143
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,299
Young Master.

144
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:50,759
Are you all right?

145
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,459
- It's so itchy.
- You're the culprit, aren't you?

146
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,200
Do you have to be so brutal?

147
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,400
What do you know?

148
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,700
A rich family's son like him needs regular detoxifying.

149
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,120
Otherwise, he'll lose his life easily from dispersion-thirst.

150
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,420
This medicinal tea is my gift to him.

151
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,240
Young Master Bai is right. He's always right.

152
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,919
Fine, he's happy to suffer at your hand anyway.

153
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,719
I won't intervene.

154
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,559
Are you really going to leave?

155
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:25,280
Don't you want to know about your past?

156
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,440
One shouldn't linger on the past.

157
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,240
You sure are worry-free.

158
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm sure you aren't fretting about threats in your future either.

159
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,720
I didn't drink your tea.

160
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,920
But you've eaten the noodles I ordered.

161
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,759
- You...
- Don't worry.

162
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,240
He's just joking with you.

163
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,940
I took a glance outside.

164
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,459
The sun has set, but it's still warm.

165
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:02,839
When you leave, I'll hold up an umbrella for you to avoid a heat stroke.

166
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,900
You're truly a fascinating lady.

167
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,480
No wonder Young Master Bai favors you.

168
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm just adaptable.

169
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,459
Well said.

170
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,580
Life doesn't always go one's way.

171
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,340
For example, I have no wish to visit Young Master Chu's manor.

172
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,280
However, I have to.

173
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,719
Take our belongings along.

174
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:37,339
Young Master.

175
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,619
Wait. Don't mind me. Hurry and go take care of Young Master Bai.

176
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,240
I only know that his story is quite popular.

177
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,539
- Everyone knows it in Bailu City.
- Wait, what are you doing here?

178
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,759
Aren't you serving Young Master Bai in the Moon Viewing Tower?

179
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,900
Young Master Bai said he didn't need our help.

180
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,200
He prefers to be quiet and alone.

181
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,320
MIss, you can go wherever you want.

182
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,520
We're rushing to listen to the storyteller.

183
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,840
What's the story?

184
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,159
The story is about the top demoness in the martial arts world, and her men.

185
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,799
Hurry and go, or we'll miss it.

186
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,660
Miss, take it easy. We'll get going.

187
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,470
Take care, Miss.

188
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,840
- Quite a lot of customers here.
- Sirs, you're here. Come inside, please.

189
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,980
Didn't I tell you?

190
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,600
- This way, please.
- It's really popular.

191
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,720
Sirs, just let me know what you need.

192
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,840
All right. You can go.

193
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,039
Sure.

194
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,180
- Bring a pot of premium tea.
- Sure!

195
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,819
- Aren't the seats good today?
- They are good. We're facing the center.

196
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,440
Sorry to make you wait a while.

197
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,020
The wind blows, the war drums beat, the mountains and rivers vibrate.

198
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,820
The general is born brave, like the offspring of the Qilin from heaven,

199
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,390
and the enemies are like ants in a hole, how can they escape?

200
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,299
- Good!
- Good!

201
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,279
The story we're talking about today is called,

202
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,100
Demon Spirit in the martial arts world.

203
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:01,840
This... Everyone, please excuse me.

204
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,460
My tongue got twisted.

205
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,140
It's called, Demoness in the martial arts world.

206
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,559
Demoness?

207
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:14,459
I am speaking of the most notorious demoness in the martial arts world, Ye Xi.

208
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,440
- Ye Xi?
- Relying on her superb martial arts skills,

209
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,860
this demoness stole many ancient martial arts books from numerous sects and groups.

210
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,639
She also stole their secret treasures.

211
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,480
Later, she went to Shuzhong and seduced without success the Young Lord Tang Yang of the Tang Sect.

212
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,679
Her love turned to hatred, so she killed his fiancee's entire family.

213
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,419
- Killed the entire family?
- So abominable and detestable!

214
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:24,620
This demoness even wanted to destroy the most powerful hidden weapon in the martial arts world,

215
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,500
Storm Pear Flower Needle!

216
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,639
Young Lord Tang Yang swore to avenge his fiancee.

217
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,659
The demoness Ye Xi deserved to be punished.

218
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:36,080
In the end, she was killed by the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

219
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,959
Her corpse was left unburied in the Jade Bamboo Forest.

220
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,500
Well said, she got what she deserved!

221
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,720
This demoness indeed deserved to die.

222
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
You're right!

223
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,960
Well said! She deserved to be killed.

224
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,579
- Well said!
- She can't be forgiven.

225
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:50,039
That's right. She can't be kept alive.

226
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,859
Justice is clear under Heaven!

227
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:55,399
Demoness Ye Xi, you can't escape!

228
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:57,619
Demoness?

229
00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:59,620
S-She is the demoness?

230
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,980
That can't be.

231
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,180
Isn't that Miss Wang?

232
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,720
Miss Wang is the Demoness Ye Xi?

233
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,939
But isn't Ye Xi already dead? What's going on?

234
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:09,480
We're on duty for the Prince's Manor. Unrelated people should move aside!

235
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,080
Hurry, move aside!

236
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,639
Get out! Get out!

237
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,779
Officers!

238
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,380
- Officers!
- Hurry and tell Young Master Bai. Go! Go, go, go.

239
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,000
Customers, don't leave.

240
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:23,159
Official, what's going on?

241
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,799
Heroes and officials.

242
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,159
Please be kind. Don't get into a fight here.

243
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,340
If you fight, go outside to fight.

244
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,360
- This is a small eatery.
- We're on official duty.

245
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Anyone who isn't involved, move aside to avoid getting hurt by mistake.

246
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,159
We're upholding justice for Heaven. If there is any loss, go ask Heaven for help.

247
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,639
Young miss, you must be Ye Xi.

248
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,540
By the order of Prince Regent's bounty award, we are capturing a woman named Ye Xi.

249
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,760
Behave and come with us, Miss Ye.

250
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,100
Are you talking to me?

251
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,400
Demoness! Quit pretending!

252
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,000
Everyone in the martial arts world said you stole ancient books from various sects and groups.

253
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,479
When I heard you were killed, I regretted that I didn't kill you myself.

254
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,980
I'm going to kill you right here today!

255
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,199
Aren't you mistaken? My name is Wang Tieshuan.

256
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:15,220
It's impossible that I'm that demoness you're talking about.

257
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,319
You are named Wang Tieshuan? Why aren't you named Wang Tiedan?

258
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,980
Demoness, you are clearly insulting our intelligence.

259
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,080
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

260
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,399
Aren't you admitting who you are yet?

261
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,580
The Flying Frost Swordplay that you just used is that demoness Ye Xi's swordplay.

262
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:56,539
If there is any similarity, it's purely by coincidence.

263
00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:00,920
There are many similar moves among the martial arts of many sects.

264
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,780
Based on that one move, how can you reach this conclusion?

265
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,479
Demoness, look closely here.

266
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:12,319
Stop your trickery! You are the one on this drawing, aren't you?

267
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,100
Announcing to all people, an award is offered to capture the woman in the drawing.

268
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,179
This beautiful woman is named Ye Xi.

269
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,759
If there are any clues of Ye Xi's whereabouts...

270
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,760
What else do you have to say?

271
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,620
I...

272
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,359
Maybe... she and I happen to look alike?

273
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,419
No more desperate attempts before you perish! You should obediently surrender!

274
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,880
Wait, everyone.

275
00:17:58,219 --> 00:18:00,319
I have proof.

276
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,119
Miracle Physician, Young Master Bai, you are also here.

277
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,319
Young Master Bai came at just the right time. He can prove that I'm not Ye Xi.

278
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,140
She is

279
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,140
Wang Tieshuan.

280
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,760
Brothers, they are together! All of us, charge!

281
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,020
Go.

282
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,920
Quick, go after them!

283
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,279
After them!

284
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,879
Hurry up!

285
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,420
Hurry.

286
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,319
Shoot the arrows!

287
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,820
Luckily the arrows can't get to this place for now.

288
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,280
Is this good enough?

289
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,159
Over there! Capture them! Chase!

290
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,759
Don't Run! Stop right there!

291
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,179
It's useless to hide. We should rush out together.

292
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,119
Stop right there!

293
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,440
- Charge!
- Charge!

294
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,979
Go.

295
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,760
Young Master Chu? Why are you here so late at night?

296
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,439
Eldest brother, what is the official duty that you're on?

297
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:36,200
I happened to be strolling around.

298
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Now that I've run into you, maybe I can offer some help?

299
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,539
By the order of Prince Regent's bounty award, we're capturing Ye Xi.

300
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,960
Did you release the smoke just now? Did you do it?

301
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,480
- This...
- You dared to ambush us.

302
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,659
You are opposing us.

303
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:49,999
I wouldn't dare to.

304
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:55,279
Eldest brother, she's already run away, so she's probably far away.

305
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,079
The bounty award that you're missing, I'll pay for it.

306
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,480
You work hard for your job.

307
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,860
On behalf of the people in the city, I'll definitely treat you well.

308
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,660
You aren't sleeping at home this late at night, but are gang-fighting on the streets.

309
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,759
So noisy!

310
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,519
She must be Lin Xiaoxiao, daughter of Alliance Lord Lin.

311
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,640
- Why is she here?
- I wonder, too.

312
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,479
On behalf of my fellow brothers, I thank Young Master Chu.

313
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,599
- Farewell.
- Take care.

314
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,399
Let's leave.

315
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:24,459
We don't care if the government will capture them.

316
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:27,040
We are here to uphold justice in the martial arts world.

317
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,880
We must kill the demoness Ye Xi and her partner,

318
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,079
Bai Yue. Isn't that right?

319
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,079
Yes, kill the demoness!

320

All the heroes here, please listen to me.

321
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,080
I am the most wealthy man in Bailu City.

322
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,279
I am also among the top ones in the whole world.

323
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,960
To eliminate evil from the martial arts world, you almost dismantled that teahouse.

324
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,719
I'm really impressed.

325
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:50,100
Therefore, I'll shoulder the cost of all the losses.

326
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,180
As for that demoness' partner, I'm looking for him as well.

327
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,779
To tell you the truth, my face was ruined by him.

328
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,280
But there is no rush, you must be tired after such much fighting today.

329
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,780
The injured brothers also need to be treated.

330
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,240
Why don't you all go to my manor to recuperate.

331
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,039
I'll dispatch men tomorrow to search for their tracks.

332

As soon as I get any news, I'll send a messenger to notify you.

333

At that time, you can make your moves together.

334
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,919
Wouldn't that be successful with half the effort?

339

00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,519
- Yes.

Thanks.

- Go.
- Let's go.

343
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Go.

344
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,079
Isn't the demoness Ye Xi already dead?

345
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,720
How did Bai Yue become the demon woman's partner?

346
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,040
I don't care.

347

Whoever dares to harm him will be my enemy.

You are my friend, then.

349

Don't smile.

350
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,359
When your face smiles, it's even more scary. Did Bai Yue do this?

351
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,120
How did you offend him?

352
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,720
He was helping me to detoxify.

353
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,620
It looks scary, but it's really effective.

354
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,659
As to his current situation, I can't tell you much, either.

355
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,560
If you can't tell much, don't talk anymore.

356

I only want to know, is Bai Yue all right? Where is he?

357
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,880
With me around, they'll be fine.

358
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,260
As to where they went,

359
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,359
I don't know, either.

360
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,240
Eldest Miss, let's hurry and go back to the manor.

361
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,000
It's useless for you to chase after Young Master Bai. If you catch up to him, he'd still ignore you.

362
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,059
If you don't get back soon, Master will get angry.

So she is Eldest Miss Lin from the Flowing Water Manor.

372

Isn't that my hairpin?

Why did you take my hairpin? Put on your clothes first.

This hairpin is expensive.

I didn't know you have something like this.

381
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,799
Young Master Chu gave it to me.

I still need to exchange it for money. Where else can I get money for travel?

Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose.

It's just that I saw on your back...

388

Let's go.

389
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,400
Fine, I won't touch you. So petty.

390
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,440
I won't hold a grudge since you saved me.

391

But those marks on his back...

392

This is strange.

Why do they look familiar?

394
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:57,519
Also, the storyteller in the restaurant said...

395
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,240
That demoness Ye Xi deserved her punishment.

396
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,400
In the end, she was killed by Tang Yang's Storm Pear Flower Needle.

397
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,039
Her corpse was left unburied in the Jade Bamboo Forest.

398
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,419
That means I'm really named Ye Xi.

399
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,620
But they kept calling me a demoness.

400

Although I've lost my memory, but I know a person should strive to be kind.

403
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,260
He wanted to kill me over this needle.

404
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:22,659
Then he... must not be a good person.

405

And that thing on your back...

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,960
Nonsense. So far, I'm the one who poisons people.

No one can poison me.

00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,920
How about I touch you again? Perhaps—

479
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,539
You can't.

480
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,920
So be it.

481
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,720
Seems like I had no reason to fret. You guys are fine.

482
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,999
You're even so spirited.

483
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:20,859
Why are you blushing?

484
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:22,980
He's shy.

485
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,079
The ginseng in your ginseng wolfberry tonic isn't top-grade ginseng, right?

486
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:36,039
Moreover, the taste of ginseng in yesterday's tea was odd.

487
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,499
I can buy the best ginseng available for you.

488
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,519
Why the heck do you have to brew ginseng?

489
00:32:45,979 --> 00:32:50,120
I used a medicinal herb similar to ginseng to produce some health tonics.

490
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,580
Good ginseng is hard to acquire.

491
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,600
Even if I found them, they should be used to save lives.

492
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:02,440
The duty of a physician never leaves your mind.

493
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,279
You have bidding farewells at this pavilion.

494
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,319
Please enjoy your drinks.

495
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,759
I need to head to Shu's Tang Sect to interrogate Tang Yang.

496
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,340
I'll get going. See you.

497
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:19,239
Are you letting her leave?

498
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,720
Well...

499
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,079
P-Please don't be angry. You'll damage your health.

500
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,219
You sent a messenger to inform me of your arrival in the city, didn't you?

501
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:38,219
You drugged me and ruined my appearance in public because you didn't want to implicate me. I understand.

502
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:41,580
You're doing all these for her, right?

503
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,000
However, her journey will be treacherous.

504
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,160
Aren't you worried if she's all alone?

505
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,200
Stop blabbering nonsense.

506
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,179
Do you really want to be disfigured?

507
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,860
Calm down.

508
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:57,739
Someone like me may look unreliable, but I know where to draw the line.

509
00:33:57,739 --> 00:34:00,200
I know what shouldn't be said before her.

510
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,739
You're a great man, but you refuse to be honest about your feelings.

511
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:06,660
You really need to

512
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:09,399
improve on this.

513
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:19,900
These are to be consumed. They're for your face.

514
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:22,079
Thank you.

515
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,119
You...

516
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,180
You've never thanked me before.

517
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,059
- Stop!
- Stay right there!

518
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,619
Stop!

519
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,400
Run, they're catching up!

520
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,780
- Stop right there!
- Don't move!

521
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:03,260
- Stop!
- My chicken...

522
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,999
Hey, my chicken!

523
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:07,040
Quick!

524
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,279
Atrocious!

525
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:11,959
Hurry up!

526
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,319
Stop!

527
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,619
Tang Huan, how dare you betray Tang Sect and defy your elders!

528
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:20,800
I didn't!

529
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,039
We're under the young lord's orders to kill you on sight.

530
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,959
Young Master, leave them to me.

531
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,120
Find a chance to escape.

532
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,300
I won't.

533
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,880
I won't ditch you and escape alone.

534
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,680
Young Master!

535
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,039
My puny life isn't worth much.

536
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,719
You're meant for grander horizons.

537
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,300
Be resolute.

538
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,100
As long as you're alive, there will always be another chance to retaliate.

539
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,759
Tang Yang corrupted Tang Sect and committed heinous crimes!

540
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:52,579
Even if I lose my life, I will fight to the bitter end!

541
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:53,719
Young Master!

542
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,800
They, too, bear grudges against Tang Yang.

543
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,940
You've run out of secret weapons. Stop this vain struggle.

544
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:07,279
Fine, let's see who shall be the last man standing.

545
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,900
Young Master, flee!

546
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,000
Stop!

547
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:35,279
Seventh Uncle!

548
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,180
Young Master.

549
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,300
Run.

550
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,699
Leave.

551
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,780
Seventh Uncle.

552
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,480
Seventh Uncle!

553
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,900
Stop!

554
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:27,100
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

555
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,580
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

556
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:38,830
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

557
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:44,760
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

558
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,090
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

559
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:55,890
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

560
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:01,820
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

561
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:07,560
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

562
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:13,450
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

563
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:19,430
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

564
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:25,120
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

565
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:31,110
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

566
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:36,980
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

567
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:45,760
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

568
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:55,840
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
