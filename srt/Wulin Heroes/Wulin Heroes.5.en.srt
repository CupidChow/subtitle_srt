00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:14,610
♫ I just came from the forest not yet awake looking like a ginseng fairy ♫

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,930
♫ I’m full of skills, I broke into the Martial Arts World alone ♫

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,450
♫ I believe in destiny, looked everywhere but nobody specified what it is ♫

5
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:33,790
♫ Once again, I have hope and expectation of love yet who is my destiny is unknown ♫

6
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,700
♫ See, turns out that destiny has always been waiting for me ♫

7
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,670
♫ I believe that love really exists ♫

8
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:52,090
♫ Take a look at me, I’m open and candid, careful, and never doubting love ♫

9
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:59,420
♫ Although I fan the flames and cause trouble everywhere, I came to the world just to ask about the whereabouts of love

10
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,600
♫ How do I find the ripple effect of my destiny? ♫

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,800
♫ What are the consciences of the proud me? ♫

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,230
♫ Why bother worrying too much? ♫

13
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,220
♫ I just know that wherever I go, you will be there with me ♫

[Episode 5]

16
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,499
Just watch.

17
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:39,259
I'll exact revenge for you!

18
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:41,059
Your Highness.

19
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,920
It was all a misunderstanding.

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,499
Tang Sect can still bring you benefits.

21
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:47,380
Kill him.

22
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,879
Then, raze Tang Sect to the ground!

23
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,059
Are you deaf?

24
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:54,439
I told you, I'll avenge myself.

25
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,799
Why are you still so stubborn?

26
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,319
Your hands are tainted with the blood of so many.

27
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,160
You should die in by my hands.

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,800
Moreover, I've decided that waiting is a bad idea.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,360
I won't be doing those aggrieved souls justice by giving you a slow death.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,900
I'll let you die a swift death right now.

31
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,379
This is what you said!

32
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,820
You admired my ambition!

33
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,079
You promised to do anything to conquer the Martial Arts World with me!

34
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:33,980
What's wrong with using unscrupulous means to rule over the Martial Arts World?

35
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,439
I did everything to fulfill your wishes!

36
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,580
You're the one who changed!

37
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,859
I didn't even begrudge you for that.

38
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:45,260
I once loved you,

39
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,820
so you should let bygones be bygones. How can you kill me?

40
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,220
You're really unparalleled in sophistry.

41
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,420
Once I kill you, let's see if you can continue blabbing away.

42
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,660
Ye Xi, were you that blind?

43
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,919
Ignore his rambling.

44
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,599
Strike and end things.

45
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,980
I did no wrong!

46
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,919
I did no wrong! You're the one in the wrong!

47
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,780
Not me!

48
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,779
Tang Huan.

49
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:45,959
He's no different from me.

50
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,379
You'll regret this.

51
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:53,039
Still inciting conflict to the bitter end?

52
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:58,699
Since you've ditched all humanity, head on to the afterlife.

53
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
Are you all right?

54
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,439
I've killed Tang Yang. You're safe now.

55
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,299
Hang on and don't worry. I'll save you.

56
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,199
Where's the Storm Pear Flower Needle?

57
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,519
Xiao Xi, I'll survive.

58
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,460
If the imperial court gets the Storm Pear Flower Needle, the consequences will be dire.

59
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,199
You have to get it back.

60
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,639
Stop talking.

61
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,979
I'll get it back for you.

62
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,979
You're truly a loyal subject.

63
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,200
- Help him up and leave with me.
- Okay.

64
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,079
No one is allowed to leave!

65
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,199
As long as you stay, I'll let him leave.

66
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,219
He's on the brink of death anyway.

67
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,299
Give me the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

68
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:17,199
Come with me.

69
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,019
In addition to the Storm Pear Flower Needle, I can give you anything you desire.

70
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,000
There's no need for that.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,779
I only want to retrieve the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

72
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:25,579
Retrieve?

73
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,139
Are you still insistent on helping him?

74
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:31,520
He won't need it once he's dead.

75
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,639
He won't die.

76
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,560
I promised to save him.

77
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,980
Even if he leaves Tang Sect, I'll kill him out there.

78
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,939
In that case, I'll protect him with my life.

79
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,720
He shielded me from the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

80
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,959
Even if he didn't do so, I still won't let you harm him.

81
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,600
It's my choice who I decide to be with.

82
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,200
Why are you taking your anger out on others?

83
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,139
What are you two doing?

84
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,020
Your Highness, Ye Xi isn't willing to leave with you.

85
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,799
Don't force her to do so.

86
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,400
Ye Xi, I agree that Tang Sect isn't made up of decent folks.

87
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,000
How about reconsidering your decision?

88
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,879
- Your Highness, you can consider me.
- Shut up!

89
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,819
Fine, I won't talk. I'm leaving.

90
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,999
Before I leave, I have one last thing to say.

91
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,960
Ye Xi, take care.

92
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,359
These two are not to be trifled with.

93
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,620
I told you.

94
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,679
I'll avenge myself.

95
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:44,080
I also told you that I won't leave with you.

96
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,239
I don't care if you accept my decision. I always keep my word.

97
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,239
I'm taking the Storm Pear Flower Needle with me.

98
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:51,779
I'm saving Tang Huan as well.

99
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,179
If you oppose, we'll have to fight it out.

100
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:58,739
Are you really going to fight me over some other man?

101
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:00,279
Yes.

102
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,539
Stop! Don't hurt her!

103
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,920
I can stay. Only if you don't mind being left with a corpse.

104
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:24,320
I don't want to threaten you with suicide, but I can only resort to such cheap tricks with you.

105
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
I'll let you leave!

106
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,479
Give it to me.

107
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,460
I won't give up.

108
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll make you change your mind.

109
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Your Highness!

110
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:25,720
Having a miracle physician with me has its perks.

111
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,540
Can't you heal your own wounds?

112
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,839
I can, but it still hurts.

113
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,219
Is that so?

114
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,320
I thought you were undaunted by pain.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,260
You were impressively valiant earlier on.

116
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,119
Really?

117
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,120
- Hey, tell me-
- Shut up.

118
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,499
Close your eyes.

119
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:53,000
I can still smell it with my eyes closed.

120
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:57,979
You smell great.

121
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:01,280
Even more fragrant than the fragrance sachet from Tang Huan.

122
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,360
I lost that one. How about giving me another one?

123
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,840
Keep your hand here.

124
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,079
Be careful of your wound.

125
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:12,280
A scratch like this doesn't bother me.

126
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,340
My hands were just trembling now.

127
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,079
I suddenly recalled something. When we first met, you were pointing a sword at me.

128
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,999
It seemed like it was because of something I said.

129
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:25,879
The fact that you didn't cause your own death is already a huge blessing.

130
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,540
Wait! Wait! I have a serious question for you!

131
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,000
Are you really unable to save Tang Huan?

132
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,460
The poison on the Storm Pear Flower Needle is very unusual.

133
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,499
It's not something with an easy antidote.

134
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,999
Even I can't save him.

135
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,960
Fine.

136
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
I'll have to visit Fenghua Valley.

137
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm sure the valley master can save him.

138
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,520
That'll depend on the valley master's mood.

139
00:09:56,219 --> 00:10:00,459
Even if there's only a thin thread of hope, I won't give up.

140
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,720
Miss Ye, we're ready. We can leave anytime.

141
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,319
All right.

142
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,040
Can you give him a few more of those Nirvana Elixirs you fed him?

143
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,340
It'll be a long journey, and I can't be sure—

144
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,699
If he eats a few more, his soul will really be heading to nirvana.

145
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:19,699
But you're so directionless.

146
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:20,980
I won't be surprised if you get lost.

147
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,419
If that happens, he's really fated to die.

148
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,200
I've seen the map of Fenghua Valley.

149
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,559
It seems inexplicably familiar, like the road home.

150
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,879
Forget it. You don't need to worry about this.

151
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,700
Even if it rains daggers, I'll do my best to get there.

152
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,159
Daggers won't rain down.

153
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,500
He isn't worth your effort either.

154
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,300
Hold on! Wait!

155
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,840
I have a word of advice for you.

156
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,099
Nirvana Elixirs are worth tens of thousands of gold.

157
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:55,159
You promised to repay your gratitude to me.

158
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,559
I'll keep my word.

159
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,280
Well... What do you want me to do?

160
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,820
Perhaps we'll meet again in the future.

161
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,620
If that happens, I'll tell you.

♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

163
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:16,299
Bai Yue, you have a sharp tongue, but I'm not that stupid.

164
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:20,439
Every time I'm in a fight, you've always stood by me.

165
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,379
My opponent doesn't matter.

166
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,979
As long as I stand firm, you don't retreat either.

167
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:29,059
You answer all my requests.

168
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,639
You've saved me countless times and others I bring to you.

169
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,659
I'm not helping you.

170
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,039
These are all debts to be repaid.

171
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,030
I'll come asking for repayment in time.

172
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,790
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

173
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,899
I know this clearly.

174
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:50,060
You won't tell me the truth even if I pester you.

175
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,380
We have all the time in the world anyway.

176
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,139
Before you leave, I want to ask you something.

177
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:05,040
Everyone claims that I have complex entanglements with all of those men.

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,200
What about us?

179
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,720
I may not remember, but you should.

180
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,799
Did something happen between us?

181
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,220
What is our relationship?

182
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,220
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

183
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,300
There is... nothing between us.

184
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,260
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫

185
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,640
You... It's pointless to flee! I won't trust that!

186
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:39,359
Miss Ye! Sorry for troubling you.

187
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,699
Please watch over him.

188
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:44,899
Don't worry. I'll keep my word.

189
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,260
I will reach Fenghua Valley and ask the valley master to save him.

190
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,079
With me around, even the prince regent won't be able to kill him.

191
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,600
Tang Sect is a mess right now.

192
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,320
Your loyalty is precious.

193
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,120
Be extra careful in Tang Sect.

194
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,459
Okay.

195
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,059
I'll get going.

196
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,979
We meet again.

197
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:31,739
You're as aloof as ever.

198
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,859
You're still plagued by illness.

199
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:37,819
You won't last long if you don't watch your health.

200
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:42,239
When I heard about her death, I thought I wouldn't be able to go on living.

201
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,979
You saved me.

202
00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:46,820
I have yet to thank you.

203
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,460
Now that she's really back, I'll live to 100 years old just for her.

204
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,099
How do you plan on thanking me?

205
00:13:56,099 --> 00:14:01,220
My words of thanks right now have a different meaning.

206
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,779
Didn't you wait here for me to ask about her?

207
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,540
We need to have a good chat.

208
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,299
She's probably setting off for Fenghua Valley with Tang Huan.

209
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,320
Don't be rash.

210
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,219
From now on, you're forbidden from leaving my side.

211
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:07,240
I won't let you save him.

212
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,140
Fenghua Valley has its own rules.

213
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,819
You refuse?

214
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:15,919
Fine.

215
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,820
I can kill him once he leaves Fenghua Valley.

216
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,919
It's just going to be a slight hassle.

217
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,720
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

218
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,080
Do as you please.

219
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,479
It's inethical for a physician to refuse treatment!

220
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:28,779
I want you to cure her memory loss.

221
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:31,159
This is within your capabilities, isn't it?

222
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,499
It's beyond me.

223
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:37,900
Since you're incapable of doing so, I don't have any patience to spare either.

224
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,619
If it's a hassle, so be it.

225
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:42,058
I'll stage an accident.

226
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,919
What are you planning?

227
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,320
Killing Tang Huan on their journey?

228
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,199
She can't possibly keep an eye on him at all times.

229
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:01,759
The thought of their companionship on the road makes me want to slaughter him immediately!

230
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,260
Tang Huan was stabbed by the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

231
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,480
He's unconscious and immobile.

232
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,720
You'll only trigger more damage.

233
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,639
You witnessed the Black Armored Guards yesterday.

234
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,939
You were present, yet you couldn't stop them in time.

235
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:16,800
She's bent on saving him as well.

236
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,999
What if she decides to perish along with him?

237
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,372
Resurrection from the dead isn't a guarantee.

238
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:28,399
It's up to fate.

239
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,640
There might be one way to cure her memory loss.

240
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,500
What is it?

241
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,679
Find the Five-Colored Dragon Bone.

242
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,440
That should help her recover her memories.

243
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,739
Even if I have to mobilize the entire kingdom, I'll find it.

244
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,619
Xiao Xi, how could you forget?

245
00:16:57,619 --> 00:17:00,439
If you didn't insist on saving me three years ago,

246
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:03,033
I would've been turned to dust.
[Three Years Ago]

247
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,079
Are you all right?

248
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,559
Why am I still alive?

249
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,299
That's because I saved you.

250
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:08,100
You almost lost your chance to see the light of day.

251
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,500
Don't poke your nose in my affairs.

252
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,619
I don't need your help.

253
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:16,220
Young man, a sloppy life is better than a glorious death.

254
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,500
Why kick up a fuss?

255
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,499
My life or death is none of your business.

256
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,566
I can't be half-hearted in saving someone.

257
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:35,660
Since you met me, I can't watch you die and do nothing.

258
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,640
My conscience will haunt me.

259
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,459
Do you think I'll trust your nonsense?

260
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,133
What are you plotting?

261
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,530
Plotting?

262
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,640
I'm such an upright young lady.

263
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,039
Why would I try to gain from you?

264
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,999
I... just think you're good-looking.

265
00:18:56,999 --> 00:19:00,380
It'll be a waste to let such a dashing man die.

266
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,220
My face is the cause.

267
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,487
I'll ruin this face!

268
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,240
This is my dagger.

269
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,980
- I want to chop vegetables with it. You can't taint it with your blood.
- You...

270
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,519
I already saved you, so I can't let you throw your life away.

271
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,319
You'll be letting this face go to waste.

272
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,960
- Let go!
- I won't!

273
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,680
You have to promise me to stop debasing yourself first!

274
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,259
Why do you care?

275
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:24,659
You're even grabbing my wrist!

276
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,520
Don't you know that men and women have to keep their distance?

277
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,199
I'm saving you, not taking advantage of you.

278
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,699
Your parents blessed you with this body.

279
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:38,100
Spare a thought for your parents before debasing yourself!

280
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,739
They pushed me into the tiger's den.

281
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:46,420
I can't escape nor hide.

282
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,460
I might as well die at my own hands.

283
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,959
I'm being hunted down, but I'm not such a wimp.

284
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,119
Even if they surround me,

285
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,539
as long as I have an ounce of strength in me, I would fight to my utmost to survive.

286
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:05,339
Young man, you'd better shape up.

287
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:08,019
Wait!

288
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,459
I'm a little hungry.

289
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,860
Do you have any food?

290
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,000
Don't be anxious.

291
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,480
The mushrooms are almost cleaned and can be cooked soon.

292
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:48,620
Why wouldn't you let me die at ease?

293
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,960
It took me so much effort to save you.

294
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,900
Why can't you behave and live?

295
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,419
Because it's too tiring to live.

296
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,300
Eventually I won't see the sun anyway.

297
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,819
When I wake up, it's always the dark night.

298
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:07,360
I don't know about my past.

299
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,420
I have no father, no mother, no relatives, and no friends.

300
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,200
The entire Martial Arts World is hunting me down.

301
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,119
I have more reasons than you to commit suicide.

302
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,620
But I'm still going to live on.

303
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,859
It's not easy for anyone to live.

304
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:29,960
There are many days ahead of us.

305
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,400
You will understand eventually.

306
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,799
You have no idea what I have to face.

307
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:40,259
We are different.

308
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,680
I loathe myself.

309
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,259
To stay alive will only make me feel disgusting.

310
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:53,979
You say this even though you're handsome?

311
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,179
We picked a lot of wild mushrooms today.

312
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:02,360
If you die, I can't finish eating them by myself.

313
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,740
The sunshine is great.

314
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,819
The occasional storm and snow will pass quickly.

315
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:41,040
The sunlight can only hurt my eyes.

316
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,880
My heart is already riddled with holes.

317
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,020
I talked so much that my mouth is dry.

318
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,940
Why are you still so stubborn?

319
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,659
And why are you still haunting me?

320
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,000
How much longer will you follow me?

321
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,219
You want me to leave, but I just won't leave.

322
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:03,019
I'll keep following you until you give up on killing yourself.

323
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:06,679
Every hour and every second in this world, someone is being born, and someone else is dead.

324
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,160
Can you intercede on so many people?

325
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:12,620
I'm only a stranger to you.

326
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,559
Why do you pick on me and won't let me go?

327
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,540
For us to meet, it's a fated connection.

328
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,759
I can't ignore you.

329
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:25,219
Besides, my instinct tells me that you're worth saving.

330
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:29,199
This is ridiculous.

331
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:32,439
I just want to destroy myself.

332
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:35,119
Don't I even have the right to die?

333
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,599
At least I'm cherishing your life.

334
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:42,200
I've never treated anyone like I am to you.

335
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,860
Why wouldn't you change even a little bit?

336
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,280
I only want to end it all and die quickly.

337
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:56,200
Because it's really too hard to live.

338
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,659
I don't believe anymore in the nonsense that "Heaven can see" or "Evil will get its retribution."

339
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:04,259
Instead of you dying, why not let other people die?

340
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:05,300
Evil will get its retribution.

341
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,160
Even if Heaven can't see temporarily, I can help you.

342
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
I'm not worth it.

343
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,160
This Mortal World isn't worth it, either.

344
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,939
Are you even human?

345
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,880
I risked my life to save you.

346
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,240
You'd actually scold me.

347
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,179
You asked for it.

348
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:47,539
Isn't life fragile?

349
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:49,659
Why is it so hard for me to die?

350
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:52,139
I'm the fragile one.

351
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:54,039
I'm hurting all over my body right now.

352
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,340
It hurts on a slightest touch.

353
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:07,400
Pass on the word from His Highness.

354
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,839
As a hostage prince, your secret escape

355
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,079
has already implicated others around you and caused them to be executed.

356
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,800
If you want the entire Prince Huainan's clan to die with you, you can try again.

357
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,140
I'll go back with you. This has nothing to do with her.

358
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,140
She is only a passerby.

359
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,419
I jumped down to kill myself just now and happened to crash into her.

360
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:32,119
If you seek death, you should have gone further away.

361
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,160
There are many people here.

362
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,339
If you crash into other people, you'd be committing a sin even if you die.

363
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:39,560
- Take him away.
 - Yes.

364
00:26:40,939 --> 00:26:42,380
My name is Can Qi.

365
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,180
I'm sorry.

366
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,979
I've stayed alive for you.

367
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:51,160
I got strong for you.

368
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,659
Ye Xi, I'll always wait for you and stay true until I die.

369
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,240
Bai Yue!

370
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,899
I asked the imperial physicians to check all the books in the palace.

371
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:13,559
They finally found one record.

372
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,899
It said that the dragon bone that you mentioned could be under the Nanke Temple.

373
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,200
Isn't that a royal temple?

374
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,100
So what?

375
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,479
Even if it's a royal mausoleum,

376
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:27,240
If I want to open it, who will dare to stop?

377
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,939
We can start on our journey right away.

378
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,259
It's too late at night to travel far.

379
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:34,780
Your Highness, for the sake of your own health, let's not rush out at night.

380
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,900
It's fine. Aren't you with me?

381
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,420
Let's go.

382
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,920
I'm really annoyed by tricks.

383
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,099
If you don't come out, I'll get upset!

384
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,339
Go!

385
00:28:04,939 --> 00:28:08,239
Demoness, how dare you say we play tricks.

386
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:10,259
You guys again?

387
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,580
Have you forgotten what I said at Tang Sect?

388
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,699
Quit talking useless stuff. Hurry and hand over the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

389
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:17,939
Demoness, you've betwitched Prince Regent,

390
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:22,419
stolen the Storm Pear Flower Needle, killed the young lord of Tang Sect and destroyed the Tang Fortress.

391
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:25,140
You turned the fine Tang Sect into a bloodbath.

392
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,179
It's all your doing.

393
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:33,040
In the end, all of you are here for the Storm Pear Flower Needle, right?

394
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,840
Fine. I have the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

395
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,554
But are you able to get it from me?

396
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:41,299
Listen well.

397
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,340
Prince Regent has my back.

398
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:50,040
Prince Regent already said, whoever dares to bother me, his whole clan will be executed.

399
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,640
Who are you scaring?

400
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,400
We are all here to uphold justice in the Martial Arts World.

401
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,920
Back then, you bewitched the crown prince.

402
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,259
Didn't the crown prince eventually issue an edict of apology?

403
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:02,480
Even the prince regent can't disrupt the rules in the Martial Arts World.

404
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,720
He may have even understood that by now.

405
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,699
You should be the one to be executed.

406
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:10,580
Uphold justice for Heaven? You don't deserve to!

407
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,380
You just rely on having more people to reverse what's right and what's wrong.

408
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
If that's the case, just come at me!

409
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:26,400
Demoness, you've actually stolen the Solar Sword from Flowing Water Manor!

410
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,440
You are caught with the loot right now. What else will you say?

411
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,759
Everyone, have no fear. There are many of us.

412
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,119
Let's capture her and take the sword to Flowing Water Manor.

413
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,919
We'll get an award.

414
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,839
The Solar Sword in her hand is a gift from me.

415
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,879
So? You all don't like it?

416
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:55,359
Eldest Miss Lin, are you also bewitched by this demoness?

417
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,920
Your father already said

418
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,140
demons and evildoers should be annihilated.

419
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,179
My father also said there are many hypocrites from renowned families and righteous sects.

420
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:05,299
They are more despicable than the real villains.

421
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:07,159
What do you mean by demons and evildoers?

422
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:10,179
I think you are just partners in robbery.

423
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:14,560
Eldest Brother, is Flowing Water Manor also here to grab the Storm Pear Flower Needle?

424
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,580
You would even smear Flower Water Manor.

425
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,119
No wonder you find it easy to smear a woman who is not from any sect.

426
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:23,759
My father already said the incident at Tang Sect involved many people.

427
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,030
He will investigate it thoroughly.

428
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,900
Before that's done, If anyone bickers randomly and engages in secret fights,

429
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,280
don't blame Flowing Water Manor for not being polite.

430
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,400
If we allow you to act rampantly, the Martial Arts World will be in a mess.

431
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,880
Who else wants to fight?

432
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,380
Right here and now, I dare you to try.

433
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,240
Since Flowing Water Manor is taking charge, we will show respect to the Alliance Lord.

434
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,040
We hope Alliance Lord will give us a good explanation in time.

435
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,540
Brothers, let's go!

436
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,579
- Go! 
- Go!

437
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,000
Eldest Miss Lin, thank you.

438
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,799
I didn't know you were so fierce in the way you talk.

439
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,200
You were so logical and convincing.

440
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,179
I can be better than that.

441
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,119
Too bad that my family has a long legacy,

442
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:23,659
so I can't engage in physical fights. But I can still move my lips to scold people.

443
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,979
Enough for now. You should hurry and go.

444
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:28,940
No one should bother you anymore on the way.

445
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,880
Even if anyone does, I won't be there to intercede.

446
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,660
To those who insist on getting beaten up, just think of it as getting some fitness exercises.

447
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,500
Good. Hope we'll meet again.

448
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,300
Hope we'll meet again.

449
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,780
Come, let's go.

450
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:52,319
Where is Bai Yue's pigeon?

451
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,580
He worries about Ye Xi, but he sent a pigeon with a message to deploy me.

452
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,960
Does he think I will listen to him?

453
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,260
Eldest Miss, have you forgotten that you even went to the unmarked burial mounds for Young Master Bai?

454
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,180
I'm honest with my emotions. How can I change?

455
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,759
Go and cook his pigeon. I need some supplemental nutrients.

456
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,920
You aren't sending him a reply?

457
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,340
No reply. I'll let him worry.

458
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,759
What's this about ensuring harmony in the Martial Arts World?

459
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,759
He would be the one to use such a stupid excuse. Does he think I'm stupid?

460
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,339
Let's go.

461
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,499
The snow this year has come especially early.

462
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:40,780
In the Fenghua Valley, the mountains are usually sealed by massive snow.

463
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,319
I'm already used to it.

464
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,579
To me, the snow is an auspicious sign.

465
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:50,400
I believe we'll definitely find the dragon bone.

466
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,600
Compared to this faint and flying snow,

467
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,319
I'd rather believe in sincerity.

468
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:01,840
How sincere do you have to be to attain your wish?

469
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:05,719
Do you still remember that snow?

470
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:11,739
I was kneeling at the bottom of the city wall, wishing time could reverse,

471
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,060
and I begged to Heaven to give her back to me.

472
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,799
I was willing to exchange my life for hers.

473
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:25,440
The snow that night was the most massive snow that I have ever in my life.

474
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,239
I was almost frozen to death.

475
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,000
Your Highness, here's what you asked for.

476
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,940
It's a belated present from me.

477
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,919
I still remember,

478
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,600
you became a snowman that day.

479
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,240
Only your tears were warm.

♫ Leaving clues in the melody of the zither, no one can hear my thoughts  ♫

482
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,800
♫ How do we stay together?  ♫

483
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,960
♫ My yearning can't be fulfilled ♫

484
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,950
♫ My life is left empty for you to influence for the better ♫

485
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:40,690
♫ How do I look back when you didn't come with me? ♫

486
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:47,760
♫ Unrequited love leaps into reincarnation to pursue the beloved  ♫

487
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:55,330
♫ How can love be drawn like the moon but missing a piece from the circle? ♫

488
00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:02,240
♫ I'll write a preface for you, a moment of fireworks  ♫

489

♫ How do we stay together when you didn't come with me? ♫

490
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:06,430
Have you seen her?

491
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,640
♫ How do we stay together when you didn't come with me? ♫

492
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,840
Have you seen her or not?

493

♫ I pledge you my life ♫

494
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,919
Isn't it written here?

495
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:17,410
She's already been bestowed death.

496
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,279
No.

497
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:22,200
This can't be.

498
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,110
♫ Even if love connects our hearts to keep you in my dreams ♫

499
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,080
She can't be dead.

500
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,950
♫ The feathers are free of dust ♫

501
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:42,180
She drank the crown prince's poison wine, Red Crane Top.

502
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,430
Instant death when drunk. There is no antidote.

503
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,490
♫ The Autumn wind rises as I look at the faraway stars ♫

504
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,860
Even if everyone says she is dead, I still won't believe it.

505
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,180
I don't believe it!

506
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,679
Have you seen her?

507
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:59,932
Did you see her die with your own eyes?

508
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,820
She is still alive.

509
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,099
She is surely still alive, isn't she?

510
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,619
I'm searching for her, too.

511
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:11,319
Whether she's alive or dead, there has to be a trace.

516

This is where she led me out of the city.

517
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,619
To save me, she's shouldered all the blame.

518
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,500
I thought we would meet soon again.

519
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,940
If I had known, it'd be like this.

520
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,319
I wouldn't have left by myself.

521
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:11,700
Even if I died, I would have died together with her.

522
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,299
Since you don't believe that she's dead,

523
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,119
why do you casually say that word?

524
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:22,370

♫ The next life traverses the galaxy  ♫

that I'll find you.

531
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:42,919

”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

534
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,490
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

535
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:30,770
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

536
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:36,560
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

537
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,010
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

538
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:47,840
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

539
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:53,770
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:59,580
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

541

♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

542

♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

543
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:17,100
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

544
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,980
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

545
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,940
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

546
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:37,640
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

547
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:48,160
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
