00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,050
[Episode 17]

15
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,159
We seem to be the only two people left between Heaven and Earth.

16
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,239
Why aren't you awake yet?

17
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,860
It's all right if you don't wake up.

18
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,539
As long as you are by my side, all is well.

19
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,460
I'm still alive?

20
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,160
What is this nonsense?

21
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,340
I'm with you, and I'll make sure you'll live beyond 100.

22
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,320
Does your head still ache?

23
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,580
If you are fine, I'm fine.

24
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,480
Therefore,

25
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,868
why don't you take a bite? You will recover really fast.

26
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,059
If I take a bite of you, what will happen to you?

27
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:32,939
Nothing much. I'll recover by tomorrow.

28
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:35,959
Have you already guessed? I'm indeed that Ginseng Fairy.

29
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,455
What are you worried about?

30
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,292
I don't want to bite into your flesh.

31
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,360
Don't move. Didn't you say you couldn't feel my heartbeat?

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,591
That's because I don't have a heart.

33
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:57,499
So you don't need to treat me as if I were a mortal.

34
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:59,846
Just feel free to bite.

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,000
I guarantee that I'll really be fine if you take a bite.

36
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,159
Then...

37
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,759
Then, what will happen to your real form?

38
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,756
There'll be a piece missing from my real form, but it's fine.

39
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:21,336
Before I met you, I was buried in the Changliu Mountain

40
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:25,339
for 1,000 years to transform into a human form. You were the first person I met.

41
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,800
I went to the valley and saw you practice swordplay and read books.

42
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,078
I was the one who saved you in the ancient tomb.

43
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:31,680
I was really naive at that time.

44
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,120
I mean, I was too innocent and kind.

45
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,599
I was afraid that you'd die of injuries.

46
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,800
So I gave you half of my rootlet.

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,940
It's because I lost this half of a rootlet that I lost my memory.

48
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,789
My hair is transformed from the rootlets.

49
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:51,919
That's why whenever you are injured, my head would ache.

50
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,460
The rootlets have a restorative effect.

51
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,479
But after all, you only have a half rootlet.

52
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,819
You are injured too severely this time.

53
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,980
Those pursuers are still hunting us down.

54
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,659
If you don't take a bite from me,

55
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,560
you won't be able to recover fast.

56
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,140
Oh, yes.

57
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,599
- What about your previous resurrection?
- Since I don't have a heart,

58
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,079
my breathing and pulse only temporarily stopped.

59
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
To me, that's not a real death.

60
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,621
It's like hibernation.

61
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:24,939
My real form is the king of herbs, and it has a very strong vitality.

62
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:29,205
No matter how severely I'm injured, I can revive again.

63
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:31,795
All right then. You should have no more doubt now.

64
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:33,879
Just take a bite!

65
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,600
What about those injuries you suffered at Tang Sect?

66
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,620
You are a miracle physician, so you should know the contraindications for ginseng.

67
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,418
That time, I mistakenly ate hellebore.

68
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:46,779
That soup was meant for Tang Huan to induce vomiting.

69
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:50,000
I was too careful and insisted on drinking the same soup.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,060
That's why I suffered a backlash, lost my spiritual power, and even turned ugly.

71
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,860
Forget that. Let's not waste time. Hurry and bite.

72
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,420
Here.

73
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,320
But...

74
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,580
A ginseng will look ugly with a chunk of it missing.

75
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,060
Remember where we are.

76
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,979
You should worry about your own life right now instead of whether my real form will look ugly.

77
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,360
Both are them are equally important to me.

78
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,219
When I take a bite, you will feel the pain.

79
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,120
If a chunk is missing from you, I'll feel bad.

80
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,680
But, if you don't take a bite from me,

81
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,200
I alone won't be able to deal with those pursuers once they get here.

82
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,940
WIthout me dragging you down, you can run away faster.

83
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,420
You haven't been to the western region, have you?

84
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,120
If you want, you should visit there.

85
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,660
The western region has beautiful scenery,

86
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,700
many delicious foods,

87
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,679
and, most importantly, no one will know you there.

88
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,759
No one will hunt you down to kill you.

89
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,460
Besides, you can find your perfect partner there.

90
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,239
I don't know the way.

91
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:59,933
I want you to take me there.

92
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,419
Together we can go anywhere.

93
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:05,299
You traversed north and south previously for many years.

94
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:09,839
You don't know the way? All the flowers and plants will show you the way.

95
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,960
What are you doing by talking about all this now?

96
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,909
Are you entrusting your last will?

97
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:18,519
If you would simply take a bite, we can both live and live well.

98
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,879
You still haven't told me you love me.

99
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,300
I absolutely won't take a bite from you.

100
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,719
Don't hurt yourself for me.

101
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,900
Actually...

102
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,199
I told you to bite, but you won't. You forced me to do it myself.

103
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,020
Don't you know it hurts more when I bite myself?

Here I am.

116
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,599
Where did you go? Why did you disappear without a word?

117
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,119
Have you recovered? I was scared out of my wits.

118
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,639
What's this you, you, you again?

119
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,459
I already said, call me Young Master.

120
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,720
Didn't you say to only take one bite?

121
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,600
How many bites did you give me?

122
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,679
When I woke up this morning, I couldn't even stop my nose from bleeding.

123
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,979
I was afraid it wouldn't be enough, so I took a few extra bites.

124
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:25,520
Don't worry. My flesh is good.

125
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,200
Don't worry, I'll recover tomorrow. I bit down a little hard.

126
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,899
You look like you've been chewed by a rat.

127
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,640
Quite a few chunks are missing. It will look ugly.

128
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,159
You can stop now.

129
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,759
It's not visible to people normally. Just pretend that you don't know.

130
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:10,339
Actually, you didn't need to do this for me.

131
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:14,959
I know you are afraid that I would be hurt.

132
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:17,319
It's fine.

133
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:22,179
Just talk nicely to me, and I'll feel better.

134
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:27,299
Such as... when did you start liking me?

135
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:34,579
Like? This word is too superficial.

136
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:36,659
I can't say it.

137
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,040
It's all right.

138
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,128
Anyway, I'm already used to you not saying what's in your heart.

139
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:46,037
Just say nothing then.

140
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:48,200
You've already eaten my flesh anyway.

141
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,999
That makes us merged into one, and we'll never be separated again.

142
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,039
I'm running away with a fugitive, of course, we'll stick together.

143
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,859
However, I have a question.

144
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:05,080
After eating your flesh, can I live forever?

145
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,279
If you eat all of me, I still wouldn't know if you'll live forever.

146
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,840
But I'm pretty sure you won't if you eat only a little bit.

147
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,639
Jut a little bit?

148
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,679
You are quite generous.

149
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,810
You give it away on a whim.

150
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:25,420
Then, I want a reward.

151
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,579
We're in broad daylight, restrain yourself.

152
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,939
Do you mean I can go wild once the lights are out?

153
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,020
If I had known, I should have kissed you a few more times when you were unconscious.

154
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,920
Ye Xi.

155
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,300
I'm simply astounded by Young Master's beauty.

156
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,740
Young Master, you are usually aloof and domineering.

157
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,099
When you are suddenly sickly and pitiful, I can't control myself.

158
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:58,759
Have you forgotten?

159
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,200
There are pursuers hunting us down.

160
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,679
You are already fully recovered.

161
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,859
With the two of us, we should be able to handle them.

162
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:07,399
Where are we going now?

163
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,347
We'll look for Uncle Hui.

164
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:12,359
Sure!

165
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,706
Are Uncle Hui and the others all right?

166
00:11:27,706 --> 00:11:30,465
They sneaked away by going under the hot spring.

167
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:32,760
This is a mark left by Uncle Hui.

168
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,219
They should be on their way to Moon River.

169
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:36,840
That is the Bai family clan's land.

170
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,639
They should be recuperating and taking temporary refuge there.

171
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,068
Why don't we also go to Moon River? It sounds so beautiful.

172
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,380
Don't you feel that we're more like eloping than running for our lives?

173
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,359
It does seem like it.

174
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:58,100
There's a tea stand there. Let's go take a rest.

175
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,130
All right.

176
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,760
Go.

177
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,220
Are you two tired? Take a seat. What would you like to drink?

178
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,080
Premium Jasmin tea.

179
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,690
Sure. Just a moment, please.

180
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:26,999
How is it? Feel much better now?

181
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:29,800
I'm very confident in my abilities.

182
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,679
I guarantee a mortal like you will feel totally refreshed.

183
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,639
A mortal will grow old and die eventually. It's unavoidable.

184
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,561
That will be after 100 years.

185
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:44,660
Compared to death, I think becoming senile is scarier.

186
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,060
After many years, your appearance won't change.

187
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,030
But by then, my handsome looks would have faded away already.

188
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,639
I would rather die instead of being that way.

189
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,540
You are so hopelessly narcissistic.

190
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:03,620
That's why I can't do hard work in order to preserve my health.

191
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,505
I'd have to trouble you to work harder.

192
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:08,260
Don't gaze at me like that.

193
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,800
When you risked your life for those men,

194
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,659
it cost you painstaking effort. I'm not asking you to do much.

195
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:16,999
You just need to work a little harder.

196
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,740
I thought you didn't mind it at all.

197
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,515
Turns out you are so petty.

198
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,220
Your tea is ready.

199
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,990
Shopkeeper, I remember the previous shopkeeper was an old man.

200
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,480
He recently went away on a trip. I've been here lately.

201
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,580
Enjoy the tea.

202
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,800
Go!

203
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,620
Demoness, today is the day you die!

204
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,699
Hurry and hand over the Scripture of Materia Medica!

205
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:15,620
The whole world knows you are undeniably a demoness.

206
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,140
That's why you can repeatedly live after death.

207
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,579
The Changliu Mountain is filled with people who want your head.

208
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:24,848
The two of you won't be able to escape even if you had wings.

209
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:27,659
Should I call you Young Master Bai or Valley Master Bai?

210
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,659
You are asking for death when you partner with the demoness.

211
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:36,359
Better to hand over the scripture now, and we'll let you die quickly.

212
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,520
In that case,

213
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,740
I'll let you see what a real demoness looks like.

214
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,440
Stop!

215
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,778
Surround them!

216
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,180
Even the imperial court is after the demoness' head?

217
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,199
This is too much. Haven't you heard of first come first serve?

218
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,057
I guess Cang Qi will be here soon.

219
00:14:58,057 --> 00:14:59,779
He has had people watching Fenghua Valley.

220
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:02,260
It's impossible that he doesn't know about such a huge ruckus.

221
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,720
Are you saying he also wants my head?

222
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,300
He wants you. Any head that he wants would be mine.

223
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,320
He is insane. Let's get out of here before he shows up.

224
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,080
Ye Xi. After I've eaten so much of your flesh,

225
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,659
how are you doing?

226
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,240
Didn't we agree not to talk about this anymore?

227
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm afraid that I can't digest it all.

228
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,300
Have you heard the saying that poor physical condition cannot absorb highly nutritional supplements?

229
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,360
Sometimes, too many supplements will actually take lives than save lives.

230
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,840
Don't worry.

231
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,200
I'm here, and I'll definitely protect you to be safe and sound.

232
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,279
From now on, you don't need to fight. I'll protect you.

233
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,699
When you want to eat something, just tell me and I'll do as you wish.

234
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:16,660
I will be virtuous and gentle.

235
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,139
I won't ever talk back at you to upset you.

236
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,479
I hope you'll recover very soon.

237
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:26,565
There are still many things that we haven't done and many places we haven't visited.

238
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:28,219
You're right.

239
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,501
We have so much in the past,

240
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,900
but we'll have more in the future.

241
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,160
Actually, what Uncle Hui said is true.

242
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:44,240
Perhaps he understood my feelings for you a lot earlier than I knew.

243
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,780
But you know it already.

244
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,179
Someone as prideful as I am won't easily admit it.

245
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,460
I thought I could restrain myself.

246
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,879
- Are you restraining yourself now?
- No.

247
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,679
Who was the one that disregarded everything in order to save me?

248
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,799
He cared about what I ate and how I slept.

249
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,702
He even played the flute on the rooftop for me.

250
00:17:07,702 --> 00:17:10,400
You didn't sugarcoat anything and scolded me constantly.

251
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,178
You appeared to greatly dislike me.

252
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:16,480
Even though you aren't the perfect partner that I imagined, but it's fine.

253
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,263
What's important is that you love me.

254
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,587
That's why you must change.

255
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:28,340
If you need to say something, just say it. Don't suppress it.

256
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:33,080
All right. But you should change too. Be a little more restrained.

257
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,999
A young lady shouldn't be so wild.

258
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:45,540
We've already missed out so much time.

259
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,440
Going forward, I don't want to waste any minute and any second.

260
00:17:51,129 --> 00:17:57,379
I used to dream of having a home because I was too alone and wanted a companion.

261
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,926
But now I've finally understood, not anyone can be my family.

262
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:08,400
Only you can let me feel what it's like to be loved.

263
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,919
Therefore, promise me you'll get well.

264
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,900
As long as you recover, I'll do whatever it takes.

265
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,780
If you really want to save me now,

266
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,879
there is one method.

267
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,719
Look.

268
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,219
There is a cliff after this forest.

269
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:31,661
The Heavenly Bestowed Grass grows by the mountainside.
(aka Rhodiola Rosea)

270
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:33,820
It's effective on me.

271
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,840
What is this herb that is more effective than I am?

272
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:41,747
My congenital ailment needs to be treated with the right medicine.

273
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:45,880
In this aspect, the Heavenly Bestowed Grass works better than ginseng.

274
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:50,081
I already drew this plant here.

275
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:51,900
Take the drawing to find it.

276
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,800
Be sure not to get the wrong one.

277
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,560
You'll recover once this is found?

278
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,880
- Yes.
- Good.

279
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,740
I'll go look for it right now. Wait for me. I'll definitely find it.

280
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:19,739
Ye Xi, I know you are powerful.

281
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:22,760
Be careful. Don't rush.

282
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,819
Come back soon. I want to eat the roast chicken that you cook.

283
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:07,060
Heavenly Bestowed Grass... Heavenly Bestowed Grass?

284
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,757
Does it have something to do with immortals and spirits?

285
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:11,379
This isn't right.

286
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:15,699
I am the king of herbs. How can it be more powerful than I am?

287
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,759
"Life passes by like a flash of lightning."

288
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:49,620
"The drawing is for missing a date with a beauty."

289
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,160
What does it mean?

290
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,419
How can he write a poem at this time? Can't he talk like a regular human?

291
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,452
He gave me a drawing.

292
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:06,026
He told me to go by myself.

293
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,951
Bai Yue, you are a jerk!

294
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,309
If I want to go somewhere, is there anywhere I can't go in this world?

295
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,818
So weird that he wants me to find this heavenly grass.

296
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:22,201
He actually wants to abandon me.

297
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,919
Bai Yue! Bai Yue!

298
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,000
Bai Yue!

299
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,520
♫ I'm willing to pledge my life for unwavering love in the unpredictable future ♫

300
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:45,350
♫ Sadness and joy are silent in the vast sea while mountains and rivers have you in their hearts ♫

301
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:53,520
♫ Even if love connects our hearts to keep you in my dreams ♫

302
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,200
♫ The feathers are free of dust ♫

303
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:06,030
♫ I'm willing to use up the hasty years to compose a parting song ♫

304
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:12,790
♫ The next life traverses the galaxy  ♫
♫ The autumn wind rises as I look at the faraway stars ♫

305
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:20,820
♫ Even if love connects our hearts to keep you in my dreams  ♫

306
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:26,820
♫ The years don't hold on to the memories ♫

307
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,419
Bai Yue! Bai Yue!

308
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,319
Bai Yue!

309
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,960
♫ Unrequited love leaps into reincarnation to pursue the beloved ♫

310
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,401
Bai Yue, come out!

311
00:23:51,401 --> 00:23:54,356
I know you are inside.

312
00:23:54,356 --> 00:23:57,821
Why are you abandoning me? Bai Yue!

313
00:23:57,821 --> 00:24:01,210
♫ I'll write a preface for you, a moment of fireworks ♫

314
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:11,260
♫ How do we stay together when you didn't come with me? ♫

315
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:17,970
♫ I'm willing to pledge my life for unwavering love in the unpredictable future ♫

316
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:24,900
♫ Sadness and joy are silent in the vast sea while mountains and rivers have you in their hearts ♫

317
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:32,950
♫ Even if love connects our hearts to keep you in my dreams ♫

318
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:38,710
♫ The feathers are free of dust ♫

319
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:45,450
♫ I'm willing to use up the hasty years to compose a parting song ♫

320
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:52,300
♫ The next life traverses the galaxy ♫
♫ The autumn wind rises as I look at the faraway stars ♫

321
00:24:52,300 --> 00:25:00,280
♫ Even if love connects our hearts to keep you in my dreams ♫

322
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:07,210
♫ The years don't hold on to the memories ♫

323
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:16,280
♫ The years don't hold on to the memories ♫

324
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,100
Bai Yue,

325
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,250
I'm telling you.

326
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,401
Don't dream of running away from me.

327
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,440
No matter where you hide, I will find you.

328
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,459
You won't ever get a chance to disappoint me in this whole lifetime.

329
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,791
Looks like you understand that poem.

330
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,839
It's not that easy to see each other in the next life.

331
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,532
Now that I'm committed to you, I won't give up.

332
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:11,800
No matter what unspeakable secret you have, or how sickly you'll become, I won't mind at all.

333
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,924
As long as you stay alive, all is well.

334
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,400
Besides, I have such strong power,

335
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,040
how can I not keep a mortal like you alive?

336
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,580
Actually, I immediately wanted to stop you at that time.

337
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,821
You don't need to lose parts of your real form for me.

338
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,160
You can't save me.

339
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,979
It's unavoidable.

340
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:41,299
Impossible. I don't believe it.

341
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,319
Are you hiding something from me? Tell me!

342
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,179
Listen...

343
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,423
Listen well.

344
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,899
You guessed it right.

345
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:57,800
The Fenghua Valley Master is, in fact, a tomb keeper.

346
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:04,659
Fenghua Valley is a mausoleum built by the first valley master as the joint tomb for him and his beloved woman.

347
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,860
It is said that young woman

348
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,419
was fickle and left him.

349
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,100
So he

350
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,179
sealed the tomb where the jade coffin was placed

351
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,379
and banned entry from then on.

352
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:24,300
He built Fenghua Valley around it

353
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,919
to collect countless treasures and rare medical and martial arts books.

354
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,040
He also demanded the successive valley masters guard the tomb for life.

355
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,320
They could enjoy all the treasures in the valley, but they could not fall in love with anyone.

356
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,200
Otherwise, they would be cursed and die of heart exhaustion.

357
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,639
This rule

358
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:48,519
has been verbally passed down through each valley master for generations. Even Uncle Hui doesn't know.

359
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,640
I used to think

360
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,640
I would never fall in love.

361
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,299
But love came unexpectedly and made me fall deeply.

362
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,919
Ye Xi,

363
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,180
meeting you

364
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,680
has made me very happy.

365
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,380
Heart exhaustion?

366
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,958
It hurts when I fall in love.

367
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,384
It hurts even more when I fall more deeply in love.

368
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,719
But I don't hurt anymore.

369
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:31,820
I think I'm dying.

370
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:38,580
From inside the heart to my skin, this curse is extremely tormenting.

371
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,363
When did this curse get activated?

372
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,380
When I saw you climb out of the unmarked burial mounds,

373
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:58,098
I was pleasantly surprised, but it was also the first time that I felt unprecedented heartache.

374
00:28:58,098 --> 00:29:00,480
I pretended to be mean on purpose.

375
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,712
But the more I covered it up,

376
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,260
the more my feelings grew, and my heart ached even more.

377
00:29:12,939 --> 00:29:15,060
Love can take one's life.

378
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:18,890
Who would willingly give up his life for this?

379
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,960
♫ The wind is not lonely ♫

380
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,260
But if humans could control their feelings,

381
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,839
there wouldn't be so many people who are hindered by love.

382
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,300
After thinking more about it, I decided to give up struggling against it.

383
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,518
If I had to die, I would just die.

384
00:29:38,518 --> 00:29:40,877
I didn't want you to go to Tang Sect.

385
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:43,942
Moreover, I didn't want you to marry another person.

386
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,920
I wanted to stop you.

387
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:53,699
But I could feel my heartache getting worse every day.

388
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:56,440
Apparently, the curse was becoming more ferocious.

389
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,460
I could only watch you leave.

390
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,440
Because I knew you yearned for someone to grow old with,

391
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:11,619
but I was unable to give you any promise, how was I qualified to stop you?

392
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,480
After you left, I desperately searched for a solution to the curse.

393
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,179
I checked all the medical books,

394
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:24,100
tried all kinds of medications, but it was useless.

395
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,630
As you can see now, I don't have much time left.

396
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,320
Ye Xi,

397
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,459
this is a curse.

398
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,059
It's not an injury.

399
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:39,400
You really can't save me.

400
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,482
Don't do anything silly anymore.

401
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,860
Listen well.

402
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,736
I'll say this only once in my life.

403
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,280
I love you.

404
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,380
I'll die without regrets.

405
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,527
You'd better not love me anymore.

406
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:08,260
Why are you using your life to exchange for it?

407
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,010
Don't cry.

408
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:17,190
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

409
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,480
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

410
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,180
Don't cry.

411
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,599
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

412
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:30,699
It's fine.

413
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:32,179
Don't worry.

414
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:34,610
I was too anxious when I came out.

415
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,260
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

416
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,939
You must always stay by my side.

417
00:31:40,939 --> 00:31:44,279
No matter how powerful I am, I can't live without you.

418
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,990
You won't die. I won't allow it.

419
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,980
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

420
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,619
Even if someone is here to stop me,

421
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,473
I'll just kill them.

422
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,590
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

423
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,539
If a god comes here to stop me, I'll just kill that god.

424
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:05,799
If this is Heaven's will, I will change it.

425
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,491
If it's a curse, I will break it.

426
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:11,404
Fly up to heaven or dive down into the ground,

427
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,799
regardless of any obstacles from people or gods,

428
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,040
I will never give up.

429
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:24,060
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

430
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:34,640
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫

431
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:33,016
Young Master, I know you can't stand the sun.

432
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,919
I am curious.

433
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,119
If you can conjure magic anytime, you must be able to turn a rock into gold.

434
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,699
If I can really turn a rock into gold,

435
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:47,820
when I first went to Bailu City,

436
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,400
why didn't I know anything about money?

437
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,680
You didn't even want to pay for a bowl of noodles for me.

438
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,599
My skills are illusions. They fool people.

439
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,299
I can't use them randomly.

440
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,599
It's good that you have this insight.

441
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,619
But I have to remind you. It wasn't one bowl.

442
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:07,000
To count accurately, there were six bowls.

443
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,980
You let me go to the city to nurture my body, didn't you?

444
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,215
You even bought a vailed hat for me.

445
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,000
Were you afraid that I had many enemies who would recognize me and slaughter me?

446
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,200
If I had told you right then, would you have listened to me?

447
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,220
If you could talk nicely, I think I would have loved you much sooner.

448
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:36,619
But we would have lost a lot of fun from our arguments.

449
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:38,800
I indeed didn't know how to speak well at that time.

450
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:43,308
So you have poor eyesight, and I have a bad mouth.

451
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:47,120
Aren't we quite the perfect match?

452
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,020
That's not right. Look at us.

453
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:53,199
When you had white hair, I had black hair.

454
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,079
I have white hair now, but you have black hair.

455
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,559
Does this mean that we won't grow old together?

456
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,380
- I don't even have the strength—
- Bai Yue.

457
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:12,572
It isn't important if we can grow old together.

458
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:16,780
If you had to die tomorrow, I would still want to be with you.

459
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,239
I've already told you.

460
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:20,417
I don't care what kind of curse it is,

461
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:23,140
I'm not afraid. Why are you afraid?

462
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,280
I'm not afraid of the curse.

463
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,919
I'm afraid that if I die, you would be sad.

464
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,705
Don't worry about whether I'll be sad.

465
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:42,543
As long as you can stay with me,

466
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:47,193
even if it's one day of happiness, I'd gladly exchange my whole life for it.

467
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:04,919
He is coming.

468
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,822
You can't use your martial arts skill now.

469
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:10,735
I can use my power to conceal both of us.

470
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,119
Don't use your power randomly anymore.

471
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,760
I know a way.

472
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,880
Sooner or later we have to face them.

473
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,280
What is this way?

474
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,839
In a while, don't get impulsive no matter what happens.

475
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,136
- Help me get up.
- All right.

476

”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

477
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:48,920
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

478
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,190
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

479
00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:00,920
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

480
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,490
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

481
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:12,210
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

482
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:18,100
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

483
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:24,040
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

484
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:29,800
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

485
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,680
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

486
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,610
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

487
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:47,460
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

488
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,220
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

489
00:37:53,220 --> 00:38:02,130
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

490
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:12,490
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
