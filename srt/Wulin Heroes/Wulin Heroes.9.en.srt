Who are you?

18
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,560
A fight shouldn't require self-introductions.

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,200
If I defeat you, can I get up there?

Why are you here again?

21

Where's your man?

22
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,439
He's in the carriage. Taking him along will hinder me.

You're here to save your lover again.

Can you come up with a different excuse next time?

I'm sick of hearing the same one all the time.

- Hold on.
- Why?

27

What's with that look in your eyes?

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,939
Do you think I stopped you because I was afraid of losing?

29

This isn't the right attitude when facing an opponent.

As someone who values martial arts knowledge, I only wish to seek your opinions.

Fine. Ask away.

I'm not in the mood for it.

When I'm in a good mood, I'll consider your request.

Ever since I entered your valley, I haven't had the chance to fight.

I'm starting to regret handing you those Nirvana Elixirs.

On the topic of Nirvana Elixirs...

112
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,020
Uncle Hui, she hasn't paid for those Nirvana Elixirs.

113
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,240
Keep an eye on her.

114
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,460
Make sure she pays up before she leaves.

115

Miss, don't fret.

117
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,520
He's kindhearted, with a sharp tongue.

118
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,279
Were we really strangers in the past?

119
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,099
You'll have to ask him about that.

120
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:50,660
How about this, Miss?

121
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,399
I'll get men to bring that person in here.

122
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,720
We'll get him in a safe spot first. Is that all right?

123
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,360
- Come this way.
- Sure. Thank you, Uncle Hui.

124
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,539
Thank you, Uncle Hui.

125
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:24,820
How is he?

126
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,160
He was poisoned by the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

127
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,540
My meager medical skills can only detect

128
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,799
a combination of nine poisonous insects and nine poisonous plants.

129
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,320
There are tens of thousands of poisonous insects and plants.

130
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,939
If we want to identify the specific poisonous insects and plants, we'll have to rely on our valley master.

131
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,620
That's fine, as long as he can be cured.

132
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,159
That's without a doubt.

133
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,740
No ailment in this world can perplex Fenghua Valley.

134

A former patient suffered from a rare poison.

135

His organs were rotting terribly.

136
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,660
After the valley master saved him, he survived without a scratch.

137
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,800
Is he that miraculous?

138
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,020
He might be, but that miraculous power hides a life of misery.

139
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,880
In order to save that patient, the valley master expended over six months of energy.

140
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,539
Oh, yes.

141
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:23,259
Does your valley master have any preferences about those he chooses to save?

142
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:26,300
Never. It's entirely dependent on his mood.

143
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:34,379
Miss Ye, do you really like him so much?

144
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,040
Look at him.

145
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,900
What does he have other than a pretty face?

146
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,419
Besides, even on comparing looks, he is no match for our valley master.

147
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:49,119
Uncle Hui, your valley master is indeed handsome.

148
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:51,739
Any woman would be swayed by his looks.

149
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:53,359
But he seems to hate me.

150
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,600
He's always cold and mean to me.

151
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:03,839
As for him, he is a good-looking young man who is very polite.

152
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,960
When he looks at me, his gaze is very gentle.

153
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,100
I'm sure quite a lot of women would be affected by him.

154
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:34,459
Uncle Hui, what's wrong with your valley master?

155
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:38,320
Did we do something to provoke him?

156
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,019
Miss Ye. Let me ask you this.

157
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:45,119
Do you really want to save Tang Huan?

158
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,099
He saved me in the past, and I've promised to save him.

159
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:52,260
Silly girl, why can't you remember?

160
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,059
I really advise you to shove your head into a pail of cold water so that you can sober up.

161
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,880
How many times have I reminded you?

162
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,779
Absolutely do not believe in men.

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,140
The more good-looking a man is, the better he is at cheating.

164
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,539
A gentle and seemingly harmless face will make you lower your guard.

165
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:11,440
You'll be deceived even more deeply.

166
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,939
What is Uncle Hui talking about?

167
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:23,779
I want to save Tang Huan. What does that have anything to do with being deceived?

168
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:27,138
Do I look that easy to fall for lies?

169
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:31,600
“The more good-looking a man is, the better he is at cheating.”

170
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,739
What about Bai Yue?

171
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:37,060
Could he be lying to me, too?

172
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,320
I don't know what happened between you and Ye Xi along the way.

173
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,900
But despite my repeated questioning, she is determined to save Tang Huan.

174
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,659
Going around and around, it's back to the Tang Sect again.

175
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,000
What do you plan to do?

176
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,519
Uncle Hui, have you forgotten the rules in Fenghua Valley?

177
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,859
In that case, I suggest you demand a special request this time.

178
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,919
Don't be like the last time when you saved the crown prince.

179
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,220
Instead of makng those terrifying requests to scare her away,

180
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,360
why not make her stay in Fenghua Valley for the rest of her life?

181
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,539
If she refuses, you won't need to save that rascal.

182
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:27,780
If she agrees, you won't need to see that womanizer anymore.

183
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,840
Isn't this perfect?

184
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,840
On the other hand, I'm even more worried about you.

185
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,299
That rascal happens to be poisoned by the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

186
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,799
I know you've been developing the Nine Turn Resurrection Pill.

187
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,700
Why else would you be tinkering with those herbs every day?

188
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,759
I'm really afraid that you'll test the medication on yourself again.

189
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,459
You must not do that.

190
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,580
Xiao Bai, I've thought it back and forth.

191
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,720
I think he's been lying to me.

192
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,000
I recall when your master saw me for the first time, he already looked at me with disgust.

193
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,600
Even Uncle Hui seems to know me quite well.

194
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,459
I must have missed out on something.

195
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,699
How dare he said that we have nothing to do with each other.

196
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:29,720
You are your master's most favorite horse.

197
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,340
What if I kidnap you, will your master tell me the truth?

198
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:40,739
Uncle Hui, did you hear me?

199
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:43,220
What do you think of my idea?

200
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,859
Don't worry. I'm not going to do anything bad to the horse.

201
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,059
I'll just bluff a little to make a few threats.

202
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:54,579
This is really not a wise idea.

203
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,559
But I must do something, right?

204
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:02,460
You keep making up ideas on Xiao Bai.

205
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,799
Why don't you do something directly to its master?

206
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,540
Do something? How?

207
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,879
I can't fight him.

208
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,639
Who told you to fight him?

209
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,440
To someone who talks harsh but have a soft heart, you just have to cling to him relentlessly.

210
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,400
Do what you should do when it's time.

211
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,720
He won't kick me out, will he?

212
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,259
Miss, you haven't settled your account's balance. You can't leave even if you want to.

213
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,460
Do you understand now?

214
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,759
I'm not really sure.

215
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,440
You are really quite dim-witted.

216
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,580
- Nonsense.
- I've said enough. Think it over by yourself.

217
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:44,440
Xiao Bai, why do I still think kidnapping you is a better idea?

218
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,619
Right? Come, eat up.

219
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,480
Hurry and sun-dry those newly picked herbs.

220
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,019
- Yes.
- And the stable, tidy it up.

221
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,480
Yes.

222
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,500
Valley Master,

223
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:00,360
are you going to feed Xiao Bai again? It's just been fed.

224
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,959
Uncle Hui, prepare a priceless pigeon, and send another message to Chu Yao.

225
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,760
Tell him that it's for repaying him.

226
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,660
Also, prepare a good gift to Flowing Water Manor.

227
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,900
Just say that I wish for Eldest Miss Lin's success in hosting the martial arts conference.

228
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,540
Eldest Miss Lin has already sent over a long list of gifts that she requests.

229
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,959
She said that you owe her a favor.

230
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,120
Didn't you say Fenghua Valley adheres to etiquette?

231
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,540
As the valley master, why are you disobeying the rules?

232
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,839
If we really have no grudge between us, why won't you save him? I don't understand.

233
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,579
What are you doing?

234
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:36,919
Let go of me now!

235
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,999
We aren't meeting for the first time.

236
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:44,020
When I'm in this position, it's not much different than when we were unreservedly open to each other, is it?

237
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,679
Unreservedly open to each other?

238
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,179
She and Valley Master?

239
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,679
No way, I must have misheard.

240
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,639
Is our valley master...

241
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,419
What are you looking at?

242
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,579
You're dismissed!

243
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,100
Go, go.

244
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,659
Yes, yes.

245
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:59,659
Let's get out of here.

246
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:10,260
For Tang Huan, is it worth it to embarrass yourself?

247
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,319
You say I'm doing this for Tang Huan.

248
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:20,340
Is this really my point?

249
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:27,700
The way you look now, not to mention saving him, it's like you want to kill him immediately.

250
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,719
I've exhuasted all the patience I have in this lifetime on you.

251
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:37,500
Think of this time as the last time you upset me.

252
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,079
Why are you upset again?

253
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:41,160
You still haven't told me what requests you'll demand.

254
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,639
Didn't I embarrass myself in vain then?

255
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,099
So detestable.

256
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,499
Uncle Hui. You saw it all.

257
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:54,399
Relentless clinging doesn't work.

258
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,120
Don't give up.

259
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,599
Just like the saying, "Keep fighting and keep losing, so keep losing and keep fighting."

260
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:02,639
You had poor timing for this time.

261
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,880
You need to find an opportunity that combines good location and good timing

262
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,640
so that Valley Master cannot avoid you nor escape.

263
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,180
Once he can't overcome you, he'll naturally yield to you.

264
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,039
Don't be afraid of failure, only be afraid of having no will.

265
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:23,860
If you need any secret help, don't hesitate to ask.

266
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,360
Good timing and good location?

267
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,200
Here, here.

268
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,019
Come, that's right.

269
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,280
I'll help you.

270
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,780
I only hugged his leg for a little bit.

271
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,679
Does he have to bathe for such a long time?

272
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,380
Do this much?

273
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,620
So comfortable.

274
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,160
Let's relax.

275
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
Who will knead you?

276
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,340
My shoulder is sore.

277
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:58,619
Are you the only one with a sore shoulder?

278
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,439
That incident we got into yesterday, what happened in the end?

279
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:03,500
I heard that person got beaten to death.

280
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,939
That bad?

281
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,040
What is this?

282
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,979
Don't you feel it?

283
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:12,419
- Let's get out!
- It's so hot!

284
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,559
Hurry and get out of here.

285
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,920
Hurry!

286
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,620
Go, go!

287
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,960
Why isn’t coming out yet?

288
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,759
Is he not afraid of getting scalded?

289
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,059
What was that?

290
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:33,319
It was so hot!

291
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,819
Hurry up.

292
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:37,119
It was so hot.

293
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,900
Why are you here?

294
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,340
You're a tramp!

295
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,740
I... Wait!

296
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,079
Wait! Stop right there.

297
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,579
Who did you say is a tramp?

298
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,200
- Where is Bai Yue?
- He was talking about you.

299
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,139
What's going on? Aren't you afraid of getting a sty in your eye?

300
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,520
What is it? Do you think you can make me cave in by doing this?

301
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,819
You might as well jump into the water yourself.

302
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:07,140
Really?

303
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,240
I'll try it then.

304
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,000
Hand it over.

305
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,800
Don't come near this place.

306
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,099
I don't want to grow a sty either. I just couldn't help it.

307
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,719
Uncle Hui... Hurry and come teach me.

308
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:30,780
Miss Ye.

309
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,020
Don't you enjoy reading storybooks?

310
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,420
I collected these myself.

311
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,459
There are many ideas in here.

312
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:41,799
They can make your imagination become more robust.

313
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,330
You'll be stronger after each defeat. Here, take them.

Remember, you get the skills when you are under pressure.

316
00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:55,800
But, Uncle Hui, it's embarrassing to let you spend the money to buy the storybooks.

317
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,079
No worries.

318
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:02,219
As long as you take down our valley master, it's nothing to spend a little money.

Let me tell you something.

351
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,799
This kind of storybooks are forbidden in Fenghua Valley.

I only gave her a few hints.

In fact, I stood outside for quite a while.

I didn't see any movement inside, so I thought you went to bed already.

Do you think this is the reason why I don't save Tang Huan?

395

You’re purposefully making have a nightmare, isn’t that right?

Could this be...

No wonder as soon as Yang Ke saw me, he said that I should give up Tang Huan and choose you.

You know that I can't remember. Why bother asking me?

442

Then, do you know what kind of people I detest the most in my life?

443
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:50,980
Usually, when you ask this way, the answer is probably me.

00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,700
Do you know what kind of person you are?

Other than my beauty, I'm probably full of shortcomings.

Furthermore, I don't have any patience.

447

Let me tell you this.

448
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:08,900
If you keep acting so mysterious and hold back from telling the story, I may have to take action to rush you.

449

The kind of people I detest the most is people like you who have no remorse.

When other people suffer or get hurt once, they wound't repeat the same mistake.

And you've shamelessly begged me to save them.

Everytime, you would say that he is someone you must save even if you sacrifice your life.

In the end, these unkind men, who one can tell on first look,

I'll tell you right now about how it was when you came to beg for the crown prince three years ago.

460
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,480
After you've heard it, tell me whether you'd still save him.

When you came to me the last time, it was for Crown Prince Cang Nan.

00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,260
You said the imperial physicians could not cure his illness.

463

You begged me to save him no matter what.

464

You said he needed to inherit the throne.

465

His life was a concern for the sake of the country and the people.

00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,199
I was hurt previously.

478
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:34,840
After I was in a coma for a long time, I work up but forgot everything.

479
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,139
Is your brain still buried underground and you didn't bring it?

480
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,160
No... Can you talk more normal?

481
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,080
Does Fenghua Valley not welcome people who suffer amnesia?

482
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,119
Amnesia?

483
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,080
What an easy excuse!

484
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:53,920
We can talk about these unimportant matters later on.

485
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,260
He is about to die.

486
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Who is he?

487
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,080
[Tower Pagoda]

488
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,759
He is the crown prince.

489
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:05,780
I've already passed through those trials.

490
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,260
Please help me save him.

491
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,940
I'll agree to any of your conditions.

492
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,240
He's afflicted with several dozens of toxins.

493
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,500
The entire body has been pierced by blades in many places.

494
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,319
I'll ask you one more time.

495
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:30,039
Is he really worth your effort?

496
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,760
His life is important.

497
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,359
If he dies, there may be chaos everywhere.

498
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,419
I have to save him.

499
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,899
I don't think you have amnesia.

500
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:46,379
Obviously, you have eyes but you don't see, and you are incorrigibly stubborn.

501
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:48,660
You've already died once but you still haven't learned.

502
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,059
The men you find gets worse and worse.

503
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:53,013
What rights you have to say this of him?

504
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:54,719
No.

505
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:58,480
- Why do you talk about me like this?
- Do you know who he is?

506
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,439
If you have any sense, you should stay away from his kind.

507
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:05,899
Otherwise, your ending will be more miserable each time.

508
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:07,840
Why are you so angry?

509
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,839
What is it to you the kind of people I find?

510
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,179
If you don't want to help, just say it.

511
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:15,380
Don't drag in these useless nonsense.

512
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,160
Fine.

513
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,260
Someone like you who is half human and half ghost, you'd better not go out and scare people.

514
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,180
Just stay in the Changliu Mountain.

515
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,499
If you can find the seven-leaf ginseng,

516
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:31,299
I'll help you save him.

517
00:36:31,299 --> 00:36:35,260
It's recorded in the book that this item can miraculously restore life from death.

518
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,020
I'll wait for you to find it.

519
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,039
It doesn't matter how long it'll take.

520
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:44,199
Even if he can't wait and dies, this item will bring him back alive.

521
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:46,339
This is my condition.

522
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:48,500
Is it really this simple?

523
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:50,459
You think it's simple?

524
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,279
No, no, no.

525
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:55,100
I'll go look for it right now. Wait for me.

526
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,159
Miss, hold on.

527
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,310
Take this with you.

528
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,000
Heal yourself first.

529
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,839
Deep in the mountain forests, there are many snakes and beasts.

530
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:11,199
You must be extra careful.

531
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,000
Thank you. I'll be right back. Help me take care of him.

532
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,939
Do you know what happened to you eventually?

533
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,539
I heard I died by drinking the poison wine from the crown prince.

534
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:35,860
And the corpse was abandoned in the unmarked burial mounds.

535
00:37:37,259 --> 00:37:38,920
I didn't listen to your advice.

536
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,019
When I provoked a man of his status.

537
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:43,019
I deserved to be played to death.

538
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,139
When I buried you with my own hands, do you know

539
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,599
how I felt?

540
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:09,950
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

541
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:15,510
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

542
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:21,710
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

543
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:27,550
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

544
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:32,970
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

545
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:38,870
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

546
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:44,710
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

547
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:50,640
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

548
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,400
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

549
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,330
♫ A gentle dream become reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

550
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:08,100
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested it again? ♫

551
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:14,000
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

552
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,870
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

553
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:28,690
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

554
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:40,060
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
