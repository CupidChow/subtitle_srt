♫ I’m full of skills, I broke into the Martial Arts World alone ♫

00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,480
♫ I believe in destiny, looked everywhere but nobody specified what it is ♫

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,710
♫ Once again, I have hope and expectation of love yet who is my destiny is unknown ♫

♫ Take a look at me, I’m open and candid, careful, and never doubting love ♫

9
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,470
♫ Although I fan the flames and cause trouble everywhere, I came to the world just to ask about the whereabouts of love♫

10
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,540
♫ How do I find the ripple effect of my destiny? ♫

[Episode 15]

16
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:39,419
Come over here, Miss Ye.

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,040
You can't escape from this medicine.

18
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,220
Drink it while its hot.

19
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:03,239
That's more like it.

20
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,460
Only the valley master has the antidote to counter his own medicine.

21
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,219
No one else can help.

22
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,039
Put it down.

23
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,180
Are you doubting my medical skills as a miracle physician?

24
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,139
I was suffocating from keeping my thoughts to myself!

25
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,319
Are you finding chances to bully me?

26
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,200
What did you say?

27
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:53,860
I mean...

28
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,660
Thank you for your antidote, Young Master.

29
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,120
If my internal energy weren't damaged,

30
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,419
I would've retaliated by now!

31
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,419
I'll stop bullying you, if you can beat me in a fight.

32
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,600
That doesn't sound quite right.

33
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,419
Ignore his words.

34
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:21,220
Sometimes, the heart might even lie to its owner, but the eyes never lie.

35
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,700
What are you doing?

36
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,059
Don't move. Look into my eyes.

37
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:36,540
I want to have a good look at yours.

38
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm too busy to entertain your nonsense today.

39
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,180
I really have to speak to you!

40
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,040
Stop! Don't move!

41
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,879
Have you been following me around?

42
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,020
Why didn't you tell me about the sacrifices you made?

43
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,132
Uncle Hui! Come back here!

44
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:57,039
Uncle Hui is worried sick about us!

45
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,359
Why can't we speak to each other honestly?

46
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:05,060
I'm not the slightest bit moved by your actions!

47
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,079
Moreover, you're extremely presumptuous!

48
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,779
I'm presumptuous?

49
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,600
Fine, I'll give you a choice.

50
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,680
How do you wish to die?

51
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,000
I wish to die naturally of old age.

52
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,639
Don't forget that you spent countless medicinal herbs to save me.

53
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,978
You'll be wasting all of that if I die.

54
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:29,879
Fine, at least you're smart enough to realize that.

55
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,200
You've stated a reasonable argument.

56
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,790
I'll let you live, but I want you to disappear from my sight.

Bai Yue! Come back!

59
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:48,780
♫ But you speak coldly with words never showing mercy ♫

60

♫ Although you have many shortcomings, I find that you're warming up to me ♫

61

♫ You won’t ask for results, you won’t be left out ♫

62
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,879
It's really hard to move about by jumping!

63
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,620
Just a day of this feels like I've run for miles with a boulder on my back!

64
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,630
I... I'm dying!

♫ I believe that love really exists ♫

If you really don't want to talk about certain matters,

67
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,240
I won't pry any further!

68
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,379
Let's pretend nothing happened, all right?

69
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,120
What did you say?

70
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,050
Young Master, please give me the antidote.

♫ I came to the world just to ask about the whereabouts of love ♫

72
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,459
I'm sorry, Young Master! Please give me the antidote!

73
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:34,299
You must think that meeting me was the greatest mistake in your life.

74
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:37,350
No way! My mistake was...

75
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,859
Forget it, you'll find out eventually.

76
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,459
I'll be frank.

77
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:44,600
I was really suffocating when I couldn't talk.

78
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,879
I smashed all the herbs drying in the garden out of anger.

79
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,760
I was scared that you'd scold me, so I tossed the herbs into the pond and poisoned a few turtles.

80
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,700
Then, I buried those dead turtles in your medicinal herb field in the mountain to erase all evidence.

81
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,990
Since I had already gone that far, I turned that field into a barren land.

82
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,280
♫ What are the consciences of the proud me? ♫

♫ I just know that wherever I go, you will be there with me ♫

84
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,339
You sure are energetic to do so many misdeeds.

85
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,040
Who was your accomplice?

86
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,760
Don't blame Yang Ke! I instigated him!

87
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,319
That's odd. Why would Yang Ke listen to you?

88
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,460
That's because I promised to duel him once I've recovered, an all-out fight.

89
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:19,299
Did you remember what I just said?

90
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:21,419
Yes.

91
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,480
- Get moving.
- Come on.

92
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,620
I... I'm really sorry. I won't do it again.

93
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,660
Since I've confessed my wrongs, give me the antidote.

94
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,999
You can't duel Yang Ke, and you're forbidden

95
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,680
from keeping secrets and going on rendezvous with other people in the valley.

96
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Take it.

97
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:48,140
You can't call this a rendezvous!

98
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,900
- Uncle Hui!
- Hey!

99
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,979
Do you think I should eat this antidote from him?

100
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,620
Will this antidote also contain some strange poison?

101
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,120
Miss, didn't you realize that all this jumping is helping you recover?

102
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,539
Are you saying that he's healing me?

103
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,739
Yes.

104
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:17,399
His methods are too twisted!

105
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,539
Fine, let's leave this jumping issue aside.

106
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:22,160
What has turning me into a mute has to do with my recovery?

107
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,310
Well...

108
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,419
I'll check on Yang Ke and the rest.

109
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,319
Uncle Hui!

110
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,800
I can walk!

111
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,120
Yang Ke is in deep trouble because of me.

112
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,100
I should gift him some interesting storybooks as an apology.

113
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,639
How can I avoid embarrassing him as a miracle physician

114
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,599
while putting a stop to his endless bullying?

115
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,940
Forget it, I'll focus on restoring my internal energy.

116
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Am I too eager to grow old with my lover?

117
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,700
Is that why my hair has turned white?

118
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:42,484
This isn't my flower.

119
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:27,439
Bai Yue!

120
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:30,799
It's him. I bet it was him again!

121
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,100
For some reason, my flower ended up in his body.

122
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,892
Now, I can't recover properly.

123
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:41,420
This strange flower even popped up!

124
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,619
I'll be damned!

125
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,100
I...

126
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,180
I'll be damned...

127
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,419
There's nothing wrong with growing flowers, but why must it be on my head?

128
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:24,779
Am I a flower pot?

129
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,420
Bai Yue!

130
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,079
Bai Yue! Come down!

131
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:08,633
It's so late! Why are you playing the flute on the roof now?

132
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,820
This is a jade flute.

133
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,020
Who cares? It sounds horrible!

134
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,459
Remove this darn flower right away!

135
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:28,779
I can't do that.

136
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:33,459
It took me great effort to cultivate this Flower of One Thousand Pains.

137
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:37,070
Once it flowers on your head, you'll feel pain.

138
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,619
The more vigorous your actions, the more pain you'll suffer.

139
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:42,159
I don't want this flower.

140
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,459
If you rip it off, you'll die.

141
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:45,740
What should I do?

142
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,399
Simple. Get into a horse stance, and channel your energy into your elixir field.

143
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,039
Close your eyes and rest without moving.

144
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,293
Am I supposed to starve and stop reading storybooks?

145
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:58,260
You don't have to stay absolutely still.

146
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,160
Just bear with a little pain.

147
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,899
Why must you bully me?

148
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,939
I don't have what it takes to bully you.

149
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:19,532
I'm merely treating your illness.

150
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,439
Your white hair and loss of internal energy couldn't be cured by other methods.

151
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,759
It must be because your head is infected by something toxic.

152
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,360
This flower can expel evil.

153
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,140
What evil?

154
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,020
You're the strange flower here.

155
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:42,200
I already told you, this isn't an illness.

156
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,519
Many things are hard to explain in words.

157
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,379
You might not grasp a lengthy explanation, and your troubles might double.

158
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,420
Forget it. Treat me as a sick patient that doesn't want help, all right?

159
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,779
Stop worrying about me.

160
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,100
Kick me out of here.

161
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,839
As far as possible. Deep into the mountains would be best.

162
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,079
Leave me to shrivel and die there.

163
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,479
Absolutely not. You clearly doubt my abilities as a miracle physician.

164
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,799
I was playing the original Serene Heart Melody on the flute.

165
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:12,440
It's supposed to relief pain, but you said it sounded horrible.

166
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,119
Fine. You can stay here alone.

167
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,399
Keep this in mind.

168
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,279
The crux of this horse stance is to close your eyes and focus while channeling energy into your elixir field.

169
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,699
Not a sound is to be made.

170
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:23,199
I'm leaving.

171
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,460
Bai...

172
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:33,679
Bai Yue! Just you wait!

173
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,840
A noble person will carry out revenge, even if it takes ten years!

174
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:44,759
Look, the flower growing on her head is quite festive.

175
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,219
- Yes! How festive!
- Look at it! It's bright red!

176
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:49,759
Hilarious!

177
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,020
Guys, come over and take a look!

178
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,939
- Come over here!
- This flower is so amusing.

179
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:56,679
Look at this flower. Festive, right?

180
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,620
Are you all done?

181
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,520
You follow me wherever I go.

182
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,500
I'm a young lady!

183
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,039
- Can you cut down on the humiliation?
- Nope.

184
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,079
This flower is pretty darn hilarious.

185
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:16,740
Hey, Yang Ke. Are you feeling restless again?

186
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,840
Do you want the valley master to wallop you again?

187
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,080
The rest of you too!

188
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,640
Why are you making a fuss here? Move it.

189
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

190
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,260
Let's go.

191
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,139
All they do is fool around.

192
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,539
Uncle Hui, I was in the horse stance for the whole of last night.

193
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,679
I didn't even dare to budge an inch.

194
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,920
I thought my legs were about to fall off.

195
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,879
I only went to the kitchen for a snack because I was starving.

196
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,080
They spotted me and chased me all the way here.

197
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,159
Any other young lady would've died of embarrassment.

198
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,819
Uncle Hui, look at how miserable I am.

199
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:01,860
Can't you find a way to save me?

200
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,760
Miss Ye, I even divulged that secret about growing flowers.

201
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,059
Why are you so dull?

202
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:12,160
Here's what I think. You should've just leapt into his arms last night.

203
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,679
If you're in pain, bawl your eyes out.

204
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,659
Drench him with your tears.

205
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:18,059
He'll remove the flower if he feels sorry for you.

206
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:20,940
But... I've hugged his legs and pleaded before.

207
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,620
That's different! You were begging him to save another man.

208
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,419
The valley master was being more tolerant than others.

209
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,879
This time, your pain will make his heart break.

210
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,119
He will crumble.

211
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,639
Don't you know?

212
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,091
He stood on your rooftop for the whole of last night.

213
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:41,420
Wasn't he cold?

214
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,040
I bet he was there laughing at me.

215
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,179
I'm right, aren't I? Forget it, whatever.

216
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:50,279
He can stand there if that pleases him.

217
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,659
Anyway, all the roofs in this place belong to him.

218
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:58,819
Uncle Hui, I want to leap into his arms, but I just don't get the chance to.

219
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:05,860
Besides, I'm pretty certain his fixation on me doesn't surpass his devotion to medicine.

220
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,680
I'm not sick!

221
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,540
Yet, he's bent on curing me like some lunatic.

222
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,337
He even forced me to stay in that stange horse stance!

223
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:18,999
Is that how you interpret all this?

224
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,419
I got it.

225
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:29,140
He stood on the rooftop the entire night to make sure that I was in a proper horse stance.

226
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,660
Miss Ye, this flower looks nice on you.

227
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,759
Does it look nice?

228
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,859
Pretty... nice.

229
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,200
I'm sorry.

230
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,520
I won't criticize you behind your back.

231
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,496
I won't even do it in your face.

232
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:04,920
I promise! Look at the sincerity in my eyes!

233
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,259
It hurts! Hurts!

234
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:27,359
It's painful!

235
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,994
Wipe away your tears, and I'll remove the flower.

236
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:52,219
The plucked flower is the real antidote. Eat it.

237
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:54,427
Your internal energy will be restored.

238
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:06,019
Hold on!

239
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,380
I have to say something.

240
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,979
If you're playing a vertical flute...

241
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:18,580
No, that's a transverse flute you're playing.

242
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,400
Can you avoid doing it on the rooftop?

243
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,499
There'll be a downpour at night in a few days.

244
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:27,219
If you really want to play the flute, do it by my bedside and play a lullaby.

245
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,519
I think I just had a flash of insight.

246
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:55,020
Do you know how much effort it took me to get this green plum tree?

247
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,060
I'm sorry.

248
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,746
I didn't think I'd be that strong.

249
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,160
Did that flower cause this?

250
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,919
Enduring such intense pain is bound to produce such results.

251
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,559
Do you really think I'm incapable of curing you?

252
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,157
No, I trust you.

253
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,580
Since this flower is so effective—

254
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,900
You're eager to risk your life again, aren't you?

255
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,359
A little pain to boost my internal energy is worthwhile.

256
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,897
I want to restore my martial arts skills quickly.

257
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,720
Restore your martial arts skills?

258
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,079
So you can take revenge on Tang Sect?

259
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,880
Of course, an eye for an eye, payback for the grudge.

260
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,418
Isn't it the way of the martial arts world?

261
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,240
Are you really going to kill Tang Huan?

262
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,499
You desperately stopped Cang Qi from hurting him back then.

263
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:47,200
Yes, I have to kill him with my own hands.

264
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,259
Cang Qi isn't involved in my vengeance.

265
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:55,700
Besides, he's always talking about massacres and razing places to the ground.

266
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,159
True criminals should be punished. Innocent folks can't be scapegoats.

267
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,529
Do you think I can't bear to kill Tang Huan?

268
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,079
Don't worry.

269
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,440
I will be merciless when I need to be.

270
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,820
I didn't think so.

271
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,319
You're merely forbidden from leaving until one year is up.

272
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,040
Don't try to negotiate with me.

273
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,540
Forget about making promises to return after you've exacted revenge.

274
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,219
If I let you leave now, you might spark another riot.

275
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,136
After all, the martial arts world is filled with your enemies.

276
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,439
Burn away the front cover of the Scripture of Materia Medica.

277
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:32,719
Aren't you afraid that the medical sage will creep up to you in the night for a long talk?

278
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:35,117
Read your storybooks if you want to.

279
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:40,280
Don't use such a misleading name and dig your own grave.

280
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,839
One more thing.

281
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,820
You're responsible for that green plum tree.

282
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,391
You can pick medicinal herbs to make up for it.

283
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,939
A whole year's worth of gathering regular herbs won't pay for that.

284
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:53,538
Well, unless you can find one ginseng.

285
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,399
Uncle Hui.

286
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,680
- Miss Ye! Why are you dashing off?
- Hello!

287
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,410
She's off to pick medicinal herbs.

288
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,390
What does she know about picking herbs?

289
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,099
Did she recover her martial arts skills so soon?

290
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:27,640
Don't pry into the matters of others.

291
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,480
I just want to spar with her and learn from her.

292
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,100
You'll have to get past the valley master for that.

293
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,619
Greetings, Valley Master.

294
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,760
Aren't you going to take a look?

295
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,940
She's been cooped up for days. Leave her be.

296
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,440
Tell her not to wander.

297
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,620
She might break another treasure.

298
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,440
It'll be great if she breaks something.

299
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,060
She can pick medicinal herbs as compensation.

300
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,880
A year or two won't be enough.

301
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,799
It's best if she remains in Fenghua Valley forever.

302
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,624
Isn't this idea brilliant?

303
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:06,580
I made another melon lamp.

304
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,580
When Miss Ye returns, she's bound to see it.

305
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,599
Why do you have so much free time?

306
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,099
But...

307
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,239
You're not allow to come out!

308
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,159
However, the Flower of One Thousand Pains is miraculous.

309
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,559
The sun and soil aren't needed.

310
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,140
A little pain and I'm rejuvenated with boosted internal energy.

311
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,499
But my flower is still the best.

312
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,580
Though... Why is my flower in his body?

313
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,482
Was it because of that ginseng rootlet?

314
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,977
Why is it growing on him?

315
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:07,640
How about... I'll touch him again to make sure I'm right.

316
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,799
But he always has that expression, like I owe him a fortune.

317
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:14,390
I bet he won't agree to me touching him.

318
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:22,580
A single touch is misery for him.

319
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,300

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,850
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I’m become forgotten in the horizon ♫

482
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:27,750
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

483
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:33,190
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

484
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:39,070
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

485
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:44,960
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

486
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,700
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

487
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:56,640
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

488
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,480
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

489
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,260
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

490
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:14,200
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

491
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:20,080
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

492
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:28,860
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

493
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:38,830
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
