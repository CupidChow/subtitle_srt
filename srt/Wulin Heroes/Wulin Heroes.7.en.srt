♫ I’m full of skills, I broke into the Martial Arts World alone ♫

[Episode 7]

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,839
Don't worry. I'll watch over you tonight. Get some rest.

18
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,519
The crown prince won't come over tonight.

19
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,179
He has tons of people demanding his consolation.

20
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:54,100
If you want to grow stronger,

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,079
bear with as much as you can.

22
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,400
If you're at your limit, just cry.

23
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,100
Once you're done crying, face reality bravely.

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,879
I'll keep your words in mind.

25
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,780
You said you shared the same bed with her in the Eastern Palace.

26
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,260
Why didn't the crown prince kill you?

27
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,800
I left before he arrived.

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,040
She let me have a good night's rest.

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,779
I never slept so soundly before.

30
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,240
I owe a lifetime of gratitude to her.

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,639
How could I possibly implicate her?

32
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,000
I didn't know about her identity in the Eastern Palace back then.

33
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,100
I thought she was trapped there for some reason.

34
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,599
She told me to bear with it, so I did.

35
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,619
Even if endless misery awaited me,

36
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:02,819
her words helped me push on.

37
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,199
She is bold in love and hate and dares to do what she wants.

38
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,679
No one could possibly force her to do anything.

39
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:13,339
Yet, she forgot. There'll always be deceitful people like Tang Yang.

40
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:19,579
She assumes everyone is like her, honest to a fault.

41
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:35,500
Xiao Xi, I heard that you picked up a pretty boy last night behind my back.

42
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,100
- I...
- If you're bored, you can take in a cat or a dog.

43
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,419
You shouldn't casually take in people.

44
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:44,699
Could it be... he's an acquaintance of yours?

45
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,639
That rascal escaped this place once.

46
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,059
He was trying to commit suicide, but he failed.

47
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:52,199
In the end, he even crashed into someone else.

48
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,140
I was that person he crashed into.

49
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,180
He just seemed way too pitiful!

50
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,579
You're too clueless! The pitiful have thier own fault.

51
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,519
His father is a plague to the imperial court.

52
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,939
Besides, this man is Imperial Father's wanted man.

53
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,340
If Imperial Father is furious, I'm equally doomed.

54
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,639
Even if he's a hostage, you can't trample over his dignity.

55
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,960
Xiao Xi, I know that you're kindhearted.

56
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,039
I may be the crown prince, but I'm not in such a great spot either.

57
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,779
Well...

58
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,040
Can you release him from the palace?

59
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,859
It makes no difference as long as he's in the capital city.

60
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:50,279
I've already explained so thoroughly.

61
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,580
Why are you still so disobedient?

62
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,879
It's not good to ask for too much.

63
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:01,159
Move it.

64
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,079
- Hurry up!
- Must everyone in the palace be at your beck and call?

65
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,560
You don't have to send away those beauties.

66
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,460
I'll leave.

67
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:12,480
Seems like you're still ignorant about the rules in the palace.

68
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:15,759
I was too lenient with you.

69
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,639
Drink with me first.

70
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,560
Once I finish this cup,

71
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,199
will you let me leave?

72
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:43,779
Don't drink it!

73
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,650
The wine is poisoned!

74
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,900
- Grab him!
- Stop!

75
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,500
Don't move!

76
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,560
There's poison in the wine! An old trick in the palace!

77
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,040
This wine pitcher is a special device.

78
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,540
Once you enter the palace, you'll belong to the imperial family in life and in death.

79
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,899
He won't spare you unless you leave this place dead.

80
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:13,319
Xiao Xi, d-don't listen to his rubbish.

81
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,480
Don't you know my nature?

82
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,079
I can't even kill a chicken.

83
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,679
He's lying!

84
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,099
There's definitely poison in this wine!

85
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:24,560
Just wait! The poison will take effect on me soon!

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,720
Miss Ye, this Yuan Yang Wine Pitcher does contain two types of wine.

87
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,120
One of them is His Highness's favorite,

88
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,460
while the other is the wine he thinks you'll enjoy.

89
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,960
Trust me!

90
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,920
He's lying to you!

91
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,820
Don't trust him! Don't drink it!

92
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,280
Let go! Let go of me!

93
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,100
Don't drink it!

94
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,579
I trust you.

95
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,680
How dare you to sow discord between me and Xiao Xi?

96
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,999
She's my woman.

97
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,500
Why would she trust you over me?

98
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,860
You even risked your own life?

99
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,179
Does your life even belong to you?

100
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,199
Since Xiao Xi pleaded for you, I won't hit you.

101
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,600
Get up.

102
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,920
Why did I never notice?

103
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,600
Your face is becoming more exquisite by the day.

104
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,739
If you play the woman role in opera, you'll be even more vivacious than a real woman.

105
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,699
Imperial Father has been troubled lately.

106
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,340
Let's change things up.

107
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,859
You can perform opera for him.

108
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:17,459
You...

109
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,580
There are no issues.

110
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,160
He can perform for His Majesty later.

111
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,799
Yes.

112
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,519
Miss Ye!

113
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,000
Miss Ye! Miss Ye!

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,919
His Royal Highness is dying.

115
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,220
What did you say?

116
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,679
Those red pills caused this!

117
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,279
Cang Qi was fine after eating those red pills.

118
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,279
He was even jumping around!

119
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,679
His Majesty was pleased and wanted to eat those red pills.

120
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,259
He was about to eat them, but he made His Highness take them for no reason.

121
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,960
His Highness didn't dare to reject His Majesty.

122
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,220
He said it was bitter and drank some wine.

123
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,840
After that, he collapsed.

124
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,960
The imperial physician said the red pills might still be a little poisonous.

125
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,440
Whatever was in the wine reacted with the pills.

126
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,840
That's why His Highness's life is hanging by the thread!

127
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,720
Those imperial physicians are at a complete loss.

128
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Hold on! Stop!

129
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,480
What about Cang Qi? Is he fine?

130
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,559
He's fine and very energetic

131
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,120
That's odd.

132
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:43,919
He ate them too.

133
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,000
Why is he fine?

134
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,799
Perhaps he ate too much poisonous stuff that he's immune.

135
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,820
Miss Ye, please save His Highness.

136
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,400
His life is fading away! Stop getting distracted by others!

137
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,619
Miss Ye!

138
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:58,320
I'm not a miracle physician.

139
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,159
You already said that the imperial physicians are at a loss.

140
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,320
What can I do?

141
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,519
The imperial physicians can't save him,

142
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,759
but they say that the miracle physician at Fenghua Valley might be able to save His Highness.

143
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,159
It's very far from here, so he might not make it there in time.

144
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,259
Fenghua Valley is also a mysterious and terrifying place.

145
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,220
Ordinary people can't find it or get in.

146
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
- Where is His Highness?
- His Highness is...

147
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,619
Crown Prince has arrived.

148
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,780
What?

149
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,159
Your Highness! Your Highness!

150
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,539
Your Highness, are you all right?

151
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:30,339
Xiao Xi.

152
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,420
Save me. Cang Qi did this.

153
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,840
He did this to me.

154
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,040
If I die, he has to die as well.

155
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,580
I'll save you.

156
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,240
I'll take him to Fenghua Valley. Get the carriage ready!

157
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,120
Hear her? Get the carriage!

158
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,820
Yes!

159
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,900
You two, carry His Highness in!

160
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,159
- Yes.
- Yes.

161
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,220
L-Let me do it!

Miss Ye, I heard that the help of Fenghua Valley's valley master comes at a great price.

164
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,920
- I'm worried...
- Even if I have to battle dragons and tigers,

165
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,860
as long as there's hope, I won't give up.

166
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,080
You're really devoted to His Highness.

167
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,380
Wait.

168
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,620
I just value camaraderie.

169
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,200
If the crown prince dies, Cang Qi will be killed.

170
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,240
The tides of the imperial court will shift as well.

171
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
I have to save him.

172
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,379
His life carries great importance.

173
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,939
I have to save him at all costs.

174
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:42,559
State your price. Just tell me.

175
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,800
I thought she'd be deterred by an impossible condition.

176
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,459
She never feared trials and tribulations.

177
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,659
She yearned for warmth in the world.

178
00:11:55,659 --> 00:12:00,659
Yet, she never knew how cold and cruel this world can be.

179
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,519
Even though we failed to meet the valley master this time,

180
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,799
I'll never forget the words he said.

181
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,900
I only ignored his words because he's a miracle physician.

182
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,579
Anyway, I've paid the price he demanded.

183
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,419
I won't forsake your devotion to me.

184
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:22,179
I'll release Cang Qi once I return to the palace.

185
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:26,139
In the future, I'll abide by whatever you say.

186
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,420
I'll swear on my throne.

187
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,699
If I break this vow,

188
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,220
I'll...

189
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,379
I'll be struck by lightning.

190
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,659
Excuse me.

191
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:38,759
It's not right to be acting lovey-dovey here.

192
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,100
If you don't leave soon, I'll be charging extra.

193
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,400
Uncle Hui, we'll get going.

194
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,419
Take care, Miss Ye.

195
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,660
Let's go.

196
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,439
Be careful.

197
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,059
This silly lass seems to have forgotten her tragic fate in Tang Yang's hands.

198
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:07,980
Barely two years passed, but she brought an even more prestigious man.

199
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,779
He easily swore on the throne.

200
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,679
Even an old man like me is surprised.

201
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,900
I'm sure a lightning is headed his way.

202
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,440
Uncle Hui, I want to leave the mountains to take a look.

203
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,839
Why was she resurrected with a wiped memory?

204
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,279
I'm truly curious.

205
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,540
I reckon you're just worried that she'll be duped again.

206
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,379
Listen up, that was the crown prince. He can't be trifled with.

207
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:33,340
The lightning that strikes down might burn you too.

208
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,030
Hey! Wait!

209
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,600
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

210
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,640
The relationships between men and women sprout from curiosity.

211
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,960
A single thought might cause a flood and drown one to the point of no return.

212
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,940
I don't understand why you saved him.

213
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,359
Is someone like him worth saving?

214
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,359
Are you all right?

215
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:04,040
I'm fine.

216
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,140
Recollecting these memories must be painful.

217
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:23,199
You can't move on from such agony,

218
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,299
but you're unwilling to vent them out either.

219
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:31,920
Hence, they continue to torture you from within, taking root in your heart.

220
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,440
Your body is damaged as a result.

221
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,939
You may lose your life in the process.

222
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:42,839
If I could move on from such pain so easily and free myself from this misery,

223
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,840
miracle physicians wouldn't be needed in this world.

224
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:49,200
I really couldn't understand back then.

225
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,779
Why did she risk everything to save him?

226
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,440
That's because she believes there is good in this world.

227
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:59,960
She forgot Tang Yang's utterly despicable nature.

228
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,760
She also didn't know that there could be someone worse.

229
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,300
Hence, she's always the one who suffers the most tragic deaths.

230
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,999
Sachets, charms, toys!

231
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,610
Go! Go!

232
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,580
Out of the way! Move it!

233
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,450
Go!

234
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,840
Bastard!

235
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,980
How dare you assassinate the crown prince! I'll skin you alive!

236
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,040
Stop.

237
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,100
Whose carriage is this? Move it! I told you to get out of the way!

238
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,979
What's the matter? Aren't we in the capital city?

239
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,000
There's a dog in our path.

240
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:14,240
Brazenly committing murder! Utterly inhumane!

241
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,899
Brat, watch your mouth!

242
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,720
How dare a woman like you intervene!

243
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,460
Do you know who I am?

244
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,260
Who are you?

245
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,800
Nice hit!

246
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,519
These guys need to be taught a lesson!

247
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,919
Exactly!

248
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,939
W-Why are you guys here?

249
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:44,339
Your Royal Highness, why is this demoness...

250
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,919
Didn't I teach you how to fight?

251
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,919
Why did you let them beat you up so terribly?

252
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,980
They're men in power.

253
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,020
- I—
- So what?

254
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,259
Even if you die, make sure you drag them to hell with you.

255
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,179
Hey, isn't she Demoness Ye Xi?

256
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,860
- She is, right?
- Make way! Make way!

257
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,179
Please forgive us for our delay.

258
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,119
Isn't harming me enough? Why must you hurt Xiao Xi?

259
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,580
If you weren't there, Xiao Xi wouldn't have picked a fight.

260
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,559
Xiao Xi is a sinner because she tried to save your worthless life.

261
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,380
Even I'm in a fix now!

262
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,480
What did you do to her?

263
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,700
Xiao Xi never did any wrong.

264
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,380
She was merely standing up against those audacious and corrupt nobles!

265
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,719
Your Highness!

266
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,039
Fire! Fire!

267
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,440
- Put out the fire!
- Fire!

268
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,739
Help! His Highness is inside!

269
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,620
Cang Qi, what are you doing? Are you insane?

270
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,160
We'll die together!

271
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,400
Men! Where are they?

272
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,799
- Cang Qi, let go!
- You're coming to hell with me!

273
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,599
Men!

274
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,800
Save His Highness! Quick!

275
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,340
Your Highness! Your Highness, are you all right?

276
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,399
Your Highness, you scared me to death!

277
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,440
- Your Highness!
- Let's go.

278
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,160
Your Highness.

279
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,880
Don't stop me. I'll shove him into the fire.

280
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,920
- Hurry up!
- Where is he?

281
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,359
He was right there, but he vanished!

282
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,880
Capture him right now!

283
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,240
Your Highness, forget about him. We're right next to the Cold Palace.

284
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,980
All the ladies are in there. The fire will...

285
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,359
Idiot, why didn't you say so? Get men to come with me!

286
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,080
- Stop putting out the fire! Follow me!
- Yes!

287
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,530
[Eastern Palace]

288
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,819
Be careful.

289
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,180
Let's rest here.

290
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,720
We're finally safe.

291
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:20,059
Word spread to the Eastern Palace.

292
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,800
The King of Huainan seems to be dying from an illness.

293
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,399
I think it's time for you to leave.

294
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,680
You're finally free.

295
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,320
I can only take you this far.

296
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,200
You've saved me time and again.

297
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,919
Don't you seek some form of repayment?

298
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,059
Come with me. Never return to this place.

299
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,780
I really wanted him to die with me.

300
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,419
He's as wicked as his imperial father.

301
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,739
Trust me.

302
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,200
But the wine he gave me wasn't poisoned.

303
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:57,919
Yet, he almost died from the red pills.

304
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,599
You were behind that, weren't you?

305
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,000
Look at all these wounds on me.

306
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,950
Why do you still choose to trust him?

307
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,640
Did he inflict all these wounds?

308
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:15,319
His imperial father did.

309
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:22,429
Under the flowerbeds of the Palace Garden lies corpses.

310
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,620
All opposition in the imperial court will meet with accidental deaths.

311
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,520
He rules with an iron fist and covets immortality,

312
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,240
while ignoring the suffering of the common folk.

313
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,719
The crown prince never dares to dissuade him.

314
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:37,319
Isn't it the same as helping the evil?

315
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,580
Cowardice is also a kind of sin.

316
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,880
Do you have any personal items that you can give me?

317
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,839
It's so that whenever I see it, I can remember you.

318
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:56,000
I can't give you the hairpin. I have uses for it.

319
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,799
I'll give you this green foxtail grass.

320
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,880
Although this grass looks ordinary, it can grow anywhere.

321
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,120
Be safe in your journey.

322
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Don't worry. I won't disappoint you.

323
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:27,039
From now on, regardless of any hardship,

324
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,319
I won't ever yield.

325
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,619
I will work hard to become strong.

326
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,340
It's getting chilly here.

327
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,559
Let's go up.

328
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,260
No.

329
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,119
I want to know how she got killed.

330
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,899
Your Highness, look at how this fire has dirtied up my skin.

331
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:03,920
Enough now.

332
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,979
Once you've washed, it'll look just as fair and clean as before.

333
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:07,019
- Don't cry anymore.
- Your Highness.

334
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:08,739
Everyone, don't cry.

335
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:09,820
Don't be afraid.

336
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,920
Look, my clothes are ruined by the fire.

337
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,319
- All right, all right.
- You just bought it for me the other day.

338
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:16,019
His Highness came to rescue you, didn't he?

339
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:18,179
Your Highness, I won't go anywhere other than the Eastern Palace from now on.

340
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,620
You won't go anywhere else.

341
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,920
This...

342
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,160
Your Highness, didn't you say you sent all of them away?

343
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,860
This fire sure came at an interesting time.

344
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,140
None of them is gone.

345
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:39,900
- Xiao Bei, take them all back.
- Your Highness.

346
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,459
My ladies, hurry and go.

347
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:43,899
- Quickly, go, go.
- Hurry and leave.

348
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:45,459
- Hurry and go.
- You are delusional.

349
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:48,240
He just wanted someone new and fresh.

350
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,720
You think you'll become the legal wife?

351
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,039
Enough, enough. That's right, enough.

352
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,039
My ladies!

353
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,460
Xiao Xi, I've never forgotten my promise to you.

354
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,019
I mean it.

355
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:07,159
I...

356
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,980
By His Majesty's edict, we are here to capture Demoness Ye Xi.

357
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,060
Insolence!

358
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,860
She is a member of the Eastern Palace.

359
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,959
How dare you capture her in front of me!

360
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:21,679
Your Highness, please excuse our offense.

361
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,259
You are not excused.

362
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:26,900
Then we can't help but offend.

363
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:36,459
Don't!

364
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:38,059
Don't move.

365
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:40,179
Even wood can cause death.

366
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,639
Can I leave now?

367
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:44,060
Demoness!

368
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,619
Even if you get away, the imperial court will issue an order to pursue you in the whole world.

369
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:49,240
You can't escape even if you had wings.

370
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,740
I'll take your crown prince with me to wander the world together.

371
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,580
Your Highness, your wish is coming true.

372
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,820
Isn't it exciting?

373
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,299
Xiao Xi, don't joke.

374
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,159
My imperial father is ruthless.

375
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,440
He'll forget that I'm his crown prince.

376
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,040
Xiao Xi!

377
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,459
The wine you gave me last night,

378
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,939
that wine pitcher...

379
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:26,700
In the real Yuan Yang Wine Pitcher, the mechanisam is not visible.

380
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,179
I didn't know you'd play such a trick.

381
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,579
I...

382
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:38,250
Looks like the casual comment has come true.

383
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,800
Someone like me can't survive for long in the palace.

384
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,920
Take her away.

385
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

386
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,179
We are searching everywhere for a medical classic that's titled Scripture of Materia Medica.

387
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:04,480
We also need high-grade snow lotus, ginseng, etc.

388
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,140
The more the better.

389
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,799
Whoever that can contribute will be awarded 10,000 taels of gold!

390
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,019
I've never heard of such a scripture.

391
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:14,200
I agree.
[Notice]

392
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,860
Which expert wrote that?

393
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,979
Such ginseng can't be found either. It's already extinct.

394
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:21,380
That's right.

395
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,960
Miss Ye, I'm sorry.

396
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,580
They say you were killed two years ago at Tang Sect in Shuzhong.

397
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,160
How did you survive?

398
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,099
That's just a rumor in the martial arts world.

399
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:44,599
Everyone calls me a demoness.

400
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:47,019
What strange stories can't be made up?

401
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:52,219
- But...
- if you want to kill me, make it quick.

402
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,540
Why are you still asking questions?

403
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,860
I'm not the one who is asking.

404
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:01,519
His Majesty heard from those court ministers who can't wait to dig up all of your ancestors.

405
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,020
They told His Majesty with sureness that you are that demoness who has resurrected from death.

406
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,440
They want to have you executed publicly.

407
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,380
It's not that I won't tell you, but I really can't remember.

408
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,140
His Majesty is wondering, if you died and resurrected,

409
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,360
either you ingested an elixir or wonder pill, or a miracle physician saved you.

410
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,579
The most likely physician is Fenghua Valley's master.

411
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,680
Didn't he also save His Highness the Crown Prince?

412
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,119
And then?

413
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:29,140
His Highness was saved all because of you.

414
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,199
So you must have a secret relationship with Fenghua Valley.

415
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:36,380
Unless you tell us what elixir or wonder pill you ingested,

416
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,820
or get that valley master into the palace.

417
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,020
His demands are more difficult than flying to the sky.

418
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,360
If I really had some special relationship, why would I almost die there?

419
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,640
What's really a secret is his true face.

420
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,019
I never saw it the whole time.

421
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:01,419
Miss Ye, you really don't understand His Majesty.

422
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,240
I advise you to try harder to recall.

423
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,139
Perhaps pain will stimulate your memory.

424
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:14,559
How can he do that to her?

425
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,459
I really regret it.

426
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:19,000
I should make him die under ten times the pain.

427
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,079
A hundred times!

428
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,900
A thousand times!

429
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,580
What's the use to vent against a stone slab?

430
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,780
At least you can still revenge for her.

431
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:34,119
I had to watch her being taken away right in front of me.

432
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,259
But I'm not able to do anything.

433
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,719
Xiao Xi, you're awake.

434
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:57,310
Here.

435
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,839
Xiao Xi, are you all right?

436
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,560
Do you still hurt?

437
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:09,420
I can tolerate the pain.

438
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,359
But I am so nauseated that I want to vomit.

439
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:18,440
I've heard people say, one would want to vomit under extreme anger.

440
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,660
It's actually true.

441
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:23,900
Don't touch me.

442
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,139
Xiao Xi, don't be like this.

443
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:31,979
My imperial father and all those court ministers, none of them will let you go.

444
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:34,320
If someone else is judging you at the trial,

445
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,360
I don't dare to think about how miserable you'll be.

446
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,199
In this world, I'm the only one who is the best to you now.

447
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:47,279
Miss Ye, the Imperial Army will take you to see His Majesty soon.

448
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,900
Here.

449
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,820
If I'm going to meet His Majesty,

450
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,280
I'd better select a nice outfit to show good manners.

451
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,960
You're quite an optimist.

452
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,100
[Scripture of Materia Medica]

453
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,819
Your Highness, that...

454
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:25,279
Xiao Xi, give it to me.

455
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,920
Why do you still have so much strength?

456
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,939
There seemed to be a flash of green light just now.

457
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:32,919
You are mistaken.

458
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,119
My imperial father searched the whole world and didn't find this book.

459
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,540
Why is it here with you? Why do you want to destroy it?

460
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,140
I already said.

461
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,559
You are mistaken. It's an illusion.

462
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,219
All four eyes saw it.

463
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,499
Do you think I'm blind? Or, am I stupid?

464
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:51,079
I see that you really don't want to live.

465
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,359
That's not true.

466
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,700
But I still want my honor.

467
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,539
Your Highness the Crown Prince, it's time.

468
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,799
Take her away.

469
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,299
Yes.

470
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:20,339
I hearby announce, Demoness Ye Xi caused chaos in the imperial court,

471
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:23,120
harmed the good and loyal people, and set fire to the palace.

472
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,419
These are heinous crimes.

473
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:26,979
She committed wrongs in public, bullied the weak and the young,

474
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,699
cheated people around her, acted with insubordination,

475
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:32,580
disregarding palace rules, not adhering to female virtues,

476
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,319
committed theft and robbery. These are ten offenses.

477
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,699
These crimes cannot be pardoned, and they aren't tolerated by Heaven.

478
00:30:37,699 --> 00:30:41,000
She is to be punished by hot iron in adherence to the law.

479
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,479
I myself was deceived by the demoness and almost made a big mistake.

480
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,219
After being lectured by my imperial father,

481
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:52,020
I've decided to issue an edict of self reproachment to show my repentance.

482
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,979
I hope for forgiveness from all the beloved subjects.

483
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,360
It's winter now, will there be thunder too?

484
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,120
Your Highness.

485
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:11,540
Don't strike the wrong person.

486
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:23,270
♫ In the haziness, the moonlight fills both of your eyes ♫

487
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:29,770
♫ A smile tugs at my feelings ♫

488
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:36,330
♫ Always unyielding and never speak rashly, yet I’m willing to risk my life for you ♫

489
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:42,420
♫ The loneliness is now stained with dust and smoke ♫

490
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,440
♫ Day and night, I’ll protect you unconditionally ♫

491
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,579
Who... Who is that?

492
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:50,680
- He's even wearing a mask.
- Yeah.

493
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,300
Who is he?

494
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,620
Does he mean to do harm?

495
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,850
♫ After many upheavals, our love hasn’t diminished ♫

496
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,180
♫ Just like the day we first met ♫

497
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,280
♫ With every passing year ♫

498
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,580
♫ Our longings for each other are stacked into eternity ♫

499
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,690
♫ Be determined with one thought, a will to forge a sword ♫

500
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:14,599
Why are you here?

501
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,319
They've tied me up for three days and three nights so that they can capture Fenghua Valley's master.

502
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,380
Now that you've come,

503
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:26,860
they'll think that we have some unmentionable and unexplainable relationship.

504
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,220
♫ How many times have we been through life and death? ♫

505
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,100
♫ Because you are by my side ♫

506
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,700
♫ All my misfortunes becomes understated ♫

507
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,899
♫ After many upheavals, our love hasn’t diminished ♫

508
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,580
What is the relationship between that man and the demoness?

509
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,300
- Right.
- I've no idea.

510
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,340
Is he here to save her?

511
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,459
Turns out you are really handsome.

512
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:58,460
Although I don't think we are bound by friendship,

513
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,519
but now that you are here, will you save me?

514
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,919
What else then?

515
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,840
Did I come down the mountain just to witness your execution?

516
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,820
Can't you leave the umbrella to me?

517
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,300
I heard His Majesty is looking for me.

518
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,060
The weater is bad, so I'll come straight to the point.

519
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,380
My imperial father wants you in the palace to refine the immortality elixir.

520
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,680
You are superb in your madical knolwedge.

521
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,159
I'm sure your skill in refining the elixir should also be excellent.

522
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,820
What if I refuse?

523
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:41,300
If you can refine the immortality elixir for my father, I can promise any of your demands.

524
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:51,260
Valley Master, are you perhaps wanting to have her?

525
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,340
Your Highness is mistaken.

526
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,860
I'm merely recalling the time when she carried you and barged into Fenghua Valley to beg me to save you,

527
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,739
she was barely alive after being hurt by the traps in the valley.

528
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:04,520
I used up a lot of my precious ginseng and snow lotus to finally save her.

529
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,420
It'll be quite a waste if she dies like this.

530
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:12,379
Why not let her find some top quality medical ingredients for His Majesty to be used in refining the elixir?

531
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:14,600
I heard about the Purple Cloud Peak to the east of the palace.

532
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
There is a top quality ginseng here.

533
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,059
But onIy people with the best lightness skill can get up there.

534
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,660
Xiao Bei, hurry and untie her.

535
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,220
Wait.

536
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,660
Doesn't Your Highness want to protect her?

537
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,220
Why not let her achieve merits to redeem her guilt?

538
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,019
You don't need to worry that she'll escape.

539
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:38,400
Don't you have poison wine in the palace?

540
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,900
She has to return for the antidote after she's collected the medical herbs.

541
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,360
As long as you stay by my side, I'll rest easy.

542
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,739
Men! Let her down.

543
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,419
- Yes.
- Yes.

544
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,519
All he did was talk?

545
00:35:21,939 --> 00:35:26,219
Young Master Bai, we'll let you have Demoness Ye Xi.

546
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,740
I don't think my brain is workig.

547
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,300
I think you hardly have any brain.

548
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,080
Where is that Purple Cloud Peak you talked about?

549
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,199
Why haven't I ever been there?

550
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,880
What? You actually want to collect the medicinal herbs?

551
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,820
How about this? Tell me everything.

552
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,820
What kind of help am I supposed to give?

553
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,099
You can tell me so that I can consider it.

554
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:52,979
Otherwise, I feel a bit scared.

555
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:57,400
The pill that you just ate can temporarily suppress the toxicity.

556
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,740
After you're released, you must return to Fenghua Valley with me.

557
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,740
We'll settle our old and new scores all together.

558
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,939
You'll give me the antidote?

559
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:09,760
Are you perhaps telling me to work as your servant in Fenghua Valley?

560
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,040
Forget it. You should put your mask back on.

561
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,540
Your face really makes my mind wander when I look at you.

562
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,480
My elegant demeanor is obviously unparalleled in the world.

563
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,999
You are fortunate to even have a look.

564
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,559
But as soon as you speak, I just want to punch your face.

565
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,760
I knew that His Highness the Crown Prince can't bear to lose you, Demoness.

566
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,019
He repeatedly delayed and refused to use torture. He even secretly released you.

567
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:52,660
As things are now, I have to unabashedly go beg His Majesty.

568
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,900
I'm relaying His Majesty's edict.

569
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,380
Demoness Ye Xi is not allowed to leave the palace.

570
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,880
She is to be immedidately put back into jail to await disposition.

571
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,719
If anyone impedes, kill without mercy!

572
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,820
Yes!

573
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,620
Wait.

574
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:14,100
Thank you, but you've helped enough.

575
