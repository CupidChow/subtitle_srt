It's not so bad this way.

17
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,479
After I'm dead, at least you can find a good man that you like.

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,523
What good man?

19
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:45,571
Where else is a good man?

20
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,961
I only want you. It's fine if you don't marry me, as long as you are well.

21
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,426
Didn't you want to know what illusion I conjured on Cang Qi?

22
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:58,139
What's the illusion?

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,677
An unforgettable night of romance.

24
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,319
How could you do that?

25
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,120
How else can I rein him in?

26
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,959
He thinks we're a couple, that's why he agreed to wait a few days for me.

27
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,520
He'd love to tie you up and keep you with him.

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,020
Why would he let you leave?

29
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,932
Besides, you can't just...

30
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,918
You're exasperating!

31
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,919
- That's just a dream.
- I can't permit a dream either!

32
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,999
- It was his dream!
- I don't care whose dream it was! No means no!

33

Young Master, are you jealous?

34
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:39,240
I've never seen such an exaggerated reaction from you.

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,440
I don't get jealous.

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,113
Any respectable gentleman would feel this way!

37
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,340
I'm a respectable lady too, but for you, I can forsake propriety for a bit.

38
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,555
Why won't you look at me?

39

How about I blow it out again?

Perhaps... your heart will waver from this.

Stop this.

46
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,759
Young Master, life is brief, so why not treasure those right before you?

47
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,219
I kept my distance from you because I was afraid you'd uncover my secret.

the stuff inside is bound to be more valuable than everything out here.

162
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,340
The wall is hollow. There's definitely a secret passageway inside.

163
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,249
Come on, make way.

164
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:14,260
- I saw it first!
- No, I saw it first!

165
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,560
Screw you!

166
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,480
- It's mine!
- Let go!

167
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,799
- Hand it over!
- Give it to me!

168
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,720
- Let go!
- No, you let go!

169
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,159
- It's mine!
- I saw it first!

170
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,199
Stop right there! Don't take what's mine!

171
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,720
- It's mine!
- What? Let go!

172
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,879
- It's mine!
- I'll stomp on you if you don't let go!

173
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
Let's do this together.

174
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,939
Today, not a single one of you will leave this place.

175
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:10,710
Demoness, your threats aren't working!

176
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,759
Even if you're a demon, you're outnumbered by us.

177
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,919
I'm surprised you're alive with so many people hunting you down.

178
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,519
The King of Hell hasn't even claimed your life.

179
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,140
Why would he come for me first?

180
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,759
The rest of you as well!

181
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,819
You sure are having fun as bandits, pillaging and burning things!

182
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:35,619
By the way, aren't you looking for this book of scripture?

183
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:37,519
- The scripture!
- Why does she have it?

184
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,059
Why are you giving up before obtaining it?

185
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:46,151
If I'm truly a demoness,

186
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:50,360
how could I possibly strut about in broad daylight?

187
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,360
My martial arts are just a little outlandish.

188
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,081
That's because you've never seen martial arts in its supreme form.

189
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:00,720
So, you're making an unnecessary fuss.

190
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,060
Such outlandish powers are the result of pushing the body to its limit.

191
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,759
The method is written in this secret manual!

192
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,879
Anyone who obtains it is capable of mastering such skills.

193
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,919
- Is she telling the truth?
- Can anyone master it?

194
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,880
That's right! This secret manual does come from Fenghua Valley.

195
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,269
I almost lost my life trying to get it.

196
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,180
I should thank all of you for your persistent pursuit.

197
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,078
You helped me gain Bai Yue's trust.

198
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,499
Tang Huan, don't you want to be the Alliance Lord?

199
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,622
I've retrieved the secret manual for you.

200
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,340
It's time to repay your debt to me.

201
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,220
So, you two are the real villains!

202
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,360
Brat, how dare you make us your pawns!

203
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,679
You aren't fit to be the Alliance Lord!

204
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,640
Don't listen to that demoness's nonsense! She's trying to sow discord!

205
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,799
So? Don't you want that manual anymore?

206
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,045
Seems like you still covet it.

207
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:09,000
If you want it, make sure you hold on tight to it. Don't let it slip from your fingers again.

208
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:13,360
Stop your foolish games!

209
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,214
Are we invisible to you?

210
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,859
Brothers, snatch over that secret manual!

211
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:20,220
After that, you can have as much wealth as you desire!

212
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,100
- Yes!
- Hand it over!

213
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,600
Don't move!

214
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:26,399
Have you lost your wits?

215
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,000
This is the demoness's ploy! Don't fall for her tricks!

216
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,039
Fine, we'll trust you if you hand the scripture over!

217
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,939
We don't even know if this is real!

218
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:37,619
That demoness can steal things without a trace before so many people.

219
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:39,559
How can that be fake if she has such powers?

220
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,120
You caused her ruin, but she still gave the scripture to you!

221
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,759
Has her brain been trampled over by a donkey?

222
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,360
No one will believe that you aren't accomplices!

223
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,600
- Hand it over!
- Don't move!

224
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,319
You claim that you don't want it, but your actions are telling.

225
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,220
Folks, attack!

226
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,113
He won't burn it.

227
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:59,760
That's because he wants it more than anything!

228
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,499
He's incompetent. His martial arts skills are shabby, but his ambitions are sky-high.

229
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:07,820
This secret manual is the only way for him to change his fate.

230
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,299
Ye Xi, you're an utterly despicable demoness!

231
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:14,020
I knew it. You'd betray me again.

232
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,779
You've committed countless despicable deeds. Can't I do the same just once?

233
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,120
Don't think they'll spare you just because of this.

234
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
They'll still kill you to eradicate all threats.

235
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,710
They're free to hunt me down.

236
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,720
Only you don't have the right to do so.

237
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,799
- Big Brother!
- Big Brother!

238
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,000
Big Brother!

239
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,439
- What's going on, Big Brother?
- Big Brother!

240
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,140
Big Brother!

241
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,440
Big Brother! Big Brother!

242
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,360
It's poison. He died from poison.

243
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,259
There's something shady about that wall!

244
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,251
I felt unwell when we were breaking down the wall.

245
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:03,384
I reckon all of us have been poisoned.

246
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,079
- What's happening?
- Everyone, don't use your martial arts skills.

247
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,079
Otherwise, all of us will die here!

248
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,434
This is Fenghua Valley's poison trap.

249
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:15,439
Everyone, listen up! We only have one way out of here!

250
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,119
Capture Demoness Ye Xi!

251
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,599
Force Bai Yue to hand over the antidote for our survival!

252
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,000
You were the ones who stormed the place and robbed it.

253
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,660
Now, you're playing the victim? You deserve to die here!

254
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,980
You heard her! Demoness Ye Xi is colluding with Bai Yue!

255
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,420
Even if all of us die here, we have to kill Demoness Ye Xi first!

256
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,900
If Fenghua Valley had such poison powder, all of you would be in hell by now.

257
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,219
A poison that works upon touch

258
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:12,300
can only be Tang Sect's Five Poison Sand that was banned and destroyed.

259
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,099
No wonder you're joining forces with Five Poison Sect.

260
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:20,555
You must've convinced them to create the Five Poison Sand for you using unscrupulous means.

261
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:23,419
Five Poison Sect was desperately after our lives,

262
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:25,620
but they've been eliminated by the Black Armored Guards.

263
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,560
You didn't even have to lift a finger.

264
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,399
Yet, these folks who spent great effort breaking open the doors to the underground palace for you

265
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:37,019
are being killed by your Five Poison Sand unknowingly.

266
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:41,400
Then, you plan to make Fenghua Valley your scapegoat.

267
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,560
You sure are the most cunning man in the history of Tang Sect.

268
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:50,340
In the future, everyone would fear Tang Sect.

269
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,519
I guess you'll dominate the martial arts world in a sense.

270
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:55,580
Trying to monopolize power? Are you even competent enough for that?

271
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,400
We've witnessed the powerful at each other's throats,

272
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,340
but I've never seen someone as inhumane as you!

273
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,359
We know Tang Sect specializes in poison, so we brought our own rations.

274
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,160
But we still ended up getting poisoned!

275
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,184
When did you poison us?

276
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:14,020
Probably when you eagerly broke open the doors to the underground palace!

277
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:29,240
Everyone, this is the entrance to the underground palace.

278
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,119
Make room!

279
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,959
Let's do it!

280
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,960
Once we leave this place, I'll inform the whole martial arts world!

281
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,440
I'll make sure a despicable rat like you never see the light of day!

282
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,759
Hand over the antidote!

283
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,500
Otherwise, we'll chop you into pieces!

284
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,659
- Give us the antidote!
- Hand over the antidote!

285
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:11,720
- Give it to us!
- Give us the antidote!

286
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,839
Give us the antidote!

287
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,680
Once you kill Demoness Ye Xi and Bai Yue,

288
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,419
I'll hand over the antidote.

289
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,545
Are you still going to trust him?

290
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:25,639
Five Poison Sand was banned and destroyed because it doesn't have an antidote.

291
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:29,280
Anyone who has been poisoned is doomed to die.

292
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:31,539
Fifth Brother!

293
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,272
Even if I die, I'll kill you first!

294
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,280
Fifth Brother!

295
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,300
You really have the antidote?

296
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,640
You saw what happened.

297
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,000
I have the antidote but in limited amounts.

298
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,400
The one who succeeds in killing Demoness Ye Xi and Bai Yue will receive the antidote.

299
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,039
Do we attack?

300
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,419
We'll die either way!

301
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:06,599
We can't beat them!

302
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,399
Leave Tang Huan to me.

303
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:09,839
- You can deal with the rest.
- Be careful.

304
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,720
- Let's take the gamble!
- We'll be digging our own graves.

305
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Xiao Xi, will you really kill me?

306
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,899
I've made many mistakes. I shouldn't have tricked you.

307
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:41,740
My desires got the better of me, but my love for you was true. Xiao Xi.

308
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,720
I never belittled you.

309
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,919
You're just too remarkable, so I felt insecure.

310
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,559
But I wanted to become stronger so I could be worthy of you.

311
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,780
I don't care if you're really a demoness or not.

312
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,120
Even if you are, I'll still love you.

313
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,000
You have to trust me.

314
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:05,060
Recall our wonderful moments together.

315
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,179
We were so close to being a married couple.

316
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:17,739
Stop struggling. You've all been poisoned.

317
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:20,719
Take it.

318
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:23,720
Why do you have the antidote?

319
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,879
This isn't the antidote.

320
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:27,519
It can only repress the poison for a while.

321
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,720
People like you folks aren't worthy of dying in Fenghua Valley.

322
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,520
Don't look into his eyes!

323
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:46,699
Still trying to bewitch me?

324
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:49,959
Xiao Xi, I'm sorry. I've erred horribly!

325
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:53,780
You have a kind heart, so please give me another chance.

326
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,200
I won't waste my kindness on you.

327
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,400
It's an eye for an eye right now.

328
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,999
The blood debt you owe me can only be paid with your life.

329
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:04,480
Xiao Xi, I'm begging you! Please!

330
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,859
Even though our marriage wasn't realized, you're still the one who knows me best.

331
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:10,619
My life was terrible.

332
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:13,639
I'm only doing this to break free from my past.

333
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:16,177
I'm obsessed with being the strongest.

334
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,240
I'm a lunatic. I'm a lunatic! A lunatic!

335
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,319
A gracious person like you should forgive a lunatic!

336
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,139
One moment, you're terrifying.

337
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:27,738
The next moment, you're pitiful.

338
00:24:27,738 --> 00:24:31,859
You're even feigning madness to survive. What an actor.

339
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:34,960
How many masks do you have hidden up your sleeve?

340
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,959
Why do you seem like the real demon instead?

341
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,519
Don't listen to his nonsense.

342
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,240
Eliminate him right away.

343
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,059
Xiao Xi! You can't do this to me!

344
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:46,000
You've done so much for me!

345
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,839
You even liked me! Xiao Xi.

346
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,640
Aren't you being too brutal right now?

347
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,840
Tang Huan, you're wrong! I never liked you!

348
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,780
Everything I did wasn't for you!

349
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,400
Moreover, someone like you shouldn't be pleading about brutality.

350
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,720
No, you can't kill me!

351
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,959
If you kill me, the antidote will be lost, and they'll die!

352
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:16,583
Are you going to let all of them die?

353
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,799
You're about to die! Why bother about them?

354
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,380
If they turn into vengeful ghosts, they'll be after you anyway!

355
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,119
No, I can't die.

356
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,419
I can't die. I can't die at the hand of a demoness!

357
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:30,919
I'd rather die than be tortured by a demoness!

358
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,220
No! I can't! No.

359
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,979
The Scripture of Materia Medica?

360
00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:16,359
There's no such thing!

361
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,940
It's just a storybook.

362
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,180
I forgot its former title.

363
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,860
This one is "The Strange Fates of Wood and Rock," and it's a gift from Xiaoxiao.

364
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,259
I didn't think my hobby would stir such a huge misunderstanding.

365
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,480
In fact, I told you the truth ages ago.

366
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,422
You just refused to believe me.

367
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,580
The first chapter of this book

368
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,490
is "The flower in the mirror and moon in the water are mere illusions."

369
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,900
"Life is but an ephemeral and passing dream."

370
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,560
It's perfect as your epitaph.

371
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,519
There aren't any shortcuts in this world.

372
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,320
Your limits can't be rewritten.

373
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,639
You stubbornly tried to snatch what didn't belong to you.

374
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:54,959
It's fine if you failed.

375
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:58,379
Yet, you murdered for wealth and committed grave sins.

376
00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:03,700
With your current state, you'll be dead soon without me doing anything.

377
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,300
Since you're so fond of this book, I'll burn it as an offering to you once you're dead.

378
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:42,712
Is there no cure for these people?

379
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:47,100
Tang Huan probably fed him something similar to anesthesia.

380
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,640
His pain was numbed temporarily.

381
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,739
I already said that Five Poison Sand doesn't have an antidote.

382
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,900
There is only one way to cure them of the poison.

383
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:01,543
Reverse the meridian flow in the body and expunge the poison.

384
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:05,865
Just like how I expelled the poison from your body?

385
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,400
Five Poison Powder seeps into the entire body, making it even more lethal.

386
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,319
A forced discharge of the poison requires the entire body's meridian flow to be reversed once.

387
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,279
Strong internal energy is required.

388
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,179
Moreover, the one conducting the recovery might lose their martial arts skills.

389
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,799
Ye Xi, you can't save them.

390
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,340
But I think... you're even more eager to save them.

391
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,900
These people have been punished for their deeds.

392
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,779
However, if I let them die in Fenghua Valley,

393
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:52,819
that's against my medical ethics.

394
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:56,380
I've already given them medicine to temporarily repress the poison.

395
00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:01,759
I'll think of a way to purge the poison.

396
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,580
Stop the carriage!

397
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,881
Stop looking.

398
00:29:33,881 --> 00:29:36,699
Even one glance feels toxic.

399
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:39,979
They should've been arrested ages ago, but why is the imperial court interfering?

400
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:42,200
Apparently, Five Poison Sect has been pursuing Miss Ye.

401
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,741
They even injured Young Master Bai terribly.

402
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,900
Y-Young Master Bai is gravely injured?

403
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,439
- Let's hurry up.
- Worrying won't get us anywhere.

404
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,640
I can silently pray.

405
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,699
Who knows if we'll make it in time?

406
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:01,160
Don't spout nonsense! Young Master Bai will be fine!

407
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,101
I'm talking about arriving before that scumbag Tang Huan kicks the bucket!

408
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,996
Hurry up! Get moving!

409
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,539
Come on! Hurry!

410
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,740
Look.

411
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,620
I-Isn't this a double ginseng? Isn't it...

412
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,439
I know, but an idea popped into my mind.

413
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,839
I think we can let them save themselves.

414
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,200
We'll get them to purge the poison from each other.

415
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,619
If anyone refuses to give their all in helping another,

416
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:51,920
we'll let that person suffer the poison's effects.

417
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,440
I'll save those who really can't be saved by others.

418
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,710
This is a pretty good idea.

419
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,010
But even if all poison is expunged from the body, the damage will still be severe.

420
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,359
A frail person won't be able to withstand it.

421
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,799
Their meridians will burst, and they'll die.

422
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:11,259
Well... How about feeding me to them?

423
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:13,000
This way, their vitality can be preserved.

424
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What are you saying?

425
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,440
I can't bear to let that happen.

426
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,780
I'm just joking.

427
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:24,760
I thought you'd brutally sacrifice me to uphold your medical ethics.

428
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,540
My real body is already missing a few parts.

429
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,419
I can't be chopped up any further.

430
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:34,299
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for you, but I'm not noble enough to harm myself for others.

431
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:37,499
Besides, they dug their own graves.

432
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,302
We don't have to use the Nirvana Elixirs yet.

433
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:44,799
There is still time before the poison takes effect.

434
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,759
I'll try thinking of another solution.

435
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,544
Hold on, I'll help you over there to rest.

436
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,060
Ignore them. Your health is more important.

437
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,000
I can still hold out.

438
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,139
I'm warning you.

439
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:10,780
You can't hurt yourself to save others.

440
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,740
I'll only be in the mood to be kind if you're doing well.

441
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,740
♫ Among all the fated connections in the mortal world ♫

442
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,230

00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:45,020

454
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,480
Why are you in a daze?

455
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,206
You scared me!

456
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,300
Why are you guys here?

457
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,780
We were worried about you.

458
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,919
Did you get your revenge? Is my help still needed?

459
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:21,420
Look, my father dispatched even more bodyguards for me.

460
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,380
If you need any help, you have to tell me.

461
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,959
By the way, I discovered a book on the history of torture from the bookseller.

462
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:30,700
It records all forms of torture.

463
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,019
Should we try everything on Tang Huan?

464
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:35,780
You won't have a chance for that.

465
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,019
Tang Huan is dead. He even died quite miserably.

466
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:40,639
That's great!

467
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,440
What about Young Master Bai? Is he all right?

468
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,920
He's fine. He's in the pharmacy.

469
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,300
Don't worry. As long as I'm around, I'll keep him safe.

470
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,180
It's just a pity that this paradisiacal Fenghua Valley

471
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,140
was trampled over by those scumbags.

472
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,700
Since you guys are here,

473
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,219
how about doing some work and tidying up the place?

474
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:06,597
Uncle Hui and the rest are still at Moon River.

475
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,159
By the way, those people are still in the underground palace.

476
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,480
They've been poisoned by Tang Huan's Five Poison Sand.

477
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,940
This poison is quite a hassle.

478
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,679
Bai Yue is still trying to come up with an antidote.

479
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,360
They only have themselves to blame.

480
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,460
You should've tossed them out of the valley and left them to die.

481
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,719
You may just be wasting your efforts in saving them.

482
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,000
Who knows? They might turn against you again!

483
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,356
The benevolence of the miracle physician isn't something we can criticize.

484
00:35:30,356 --> 00:35:33,360
In that case, we can use a special antidote.

485
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,639
An antidote that won't work on the duplicitous. Those can die.

486
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,419
Only those who have turned over a new leaf will be cured.

487
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:42,480
Why are we always on the same page?

488
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,555
As expected of my good friend.

489
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,360
All right, you two can enter the valley and help tidy up.

490
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,220
I'll join you in a while.

491
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:52,760
Let's get going.

492
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,235
If ginseng could still grow in this soil, Bai Yue would be able to save everyone.

493
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:30,957
It's a pity there aren't any seeds at hand.

494
00:36:30,957 --> 00:36:36,515
But plants can grow if I channel spiritual energy into the soil.

495
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:12,250
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

496
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:17,810
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

497
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:24,030
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I’ve become forgotten in the horizon ♫

498
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:29,770
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

499
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:35,310
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

500
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:41,150
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

501
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:46,970
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

502
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:52,880
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

503
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,700
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

504
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:04,540
♫ A gentle dream become reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

505
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:10,410
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested it again? ♫

506
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:16,310
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

507
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:22,110
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

508
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:30,930
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

509
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:40,860
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
