[Episode 20]

15
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,060
[The heart is filled with love, but I can't confide over the far distance.]

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,800
[Hidden in the depths of the heart, I shall never forget.]

17

[Hidden in the depths of the heart, I shall never forget.]

18
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,170
[Hidden in the depths of the heart, I shall never forget.]

19
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Something's not right.

20
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,599
This is the jade coffin of the first valley master.

21
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,525
Why are there ginseng seeds in here?

22
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,799
Were these left behind by the first valley master's lover?

23
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:56,419
If that's the case, why are ginseng seeds left here?

24
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:59,851
I was still cultivating in Changliu Mountain a thousand years ago.

25
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:06,944
Did my spirit enter that lady's body?

26
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:10,480
Well, why did she betray the first valley master

27
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,484
and caused all subsequent valley masters to be be cursed?

28
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,200
Miss Ye!

29
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,040
He's been looking for you ever since he woke up!

30
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,080
Your absence is making him distraught!

31
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,719
Wait, what does that mean?

32
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,060
Come with me.

33
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,000
Where did you go?

34
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,319
I couldn't find you the entire day!

35
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,240
I swapped the hanging couplet and unlocked the mechanism. There really is a jade coffin inside.

36
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,300
I found two ginseng seeds in the jade coffin. Look.

37
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,879
I told you I don't have a heart, didn't I?

38
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,400
Two seeds lie where my heart is supposed to be.

39
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,144
If these are forcibly removed, I'll—

40
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:10,380
Did you forcibly remove them?

41
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,754
Do you feel unwell?

42
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:14,897
Why didn't you tell me?

43
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,880
You forbid me to hurt myself to save others.

44
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,360
Similarly, I don't want you to be hurt!

45
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,940
We're a married couple.

46
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,460
Have you ever considered my feelings before acting?

47
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,260
H-Hold on. Don't get riled up and listen to me...

48
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,560
Did you say... we're a married couple?

49
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,504
A-Aren't we?

50
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,659
Yes, we are.

51
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,900
A married couple are one.

52
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,060
You can't harm yourself, all right?

53
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,180
I didn't say these are my seeds.

54
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,600
I'm guessing... the first valley master's lover left these behind.

55
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,060
Back then, the valley master wanted to plant ginseng in the valley.

56
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,679
The lady took great effort to find these seeds for the valley master,

57
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:04,639
but she was misunderstood by the valley master for some reason.

58
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,099
She left behind the seeds as a love confession, but the valley master didn't realize it.

59
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,900
He assumed she betrayed him and left. Hence, he left behind the curse.

60
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,999
Look at their missed opportunities and unrealized affections!

61
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,260
Love should be professed out loud!

62
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,900
I know you want to plant ginseng and help even more people.

63
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,940
Fenghua Valley's soil has been searched by you many times, but you failed to find suitable seeds.

64
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,786
That's a reasonable guess.

65
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,879
I want to plant ginseng, but I don't have the seeds.

66
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,040
Ginseng also requires very specific soil to grow in.

67
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,979
Don't worry. I channeled my spiritual energy into the soil.

68
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:41,879
With these seeds and cultivation through spiritual energy, I reckon ginseng will grow in no time.

69
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,160
When that happens, you can use them with other medicinal herbs.

70
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,519
You'll probably be able to save those people.

71
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,139
You don't have to do this.

72
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,140
You'll be exhausting too much spiritual energy!

73
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,160
Calm down.

74
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,779
I know you're worried about me, so I won't overexert myself.

75
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:56,680
I'm not trying to be hopelessly kind either.

76
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,079
I just want to help you.

77
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:03,620
Besides, you're right.

78
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,520
Fenghua Valley is too beautiful to be tainted by deaths.

79
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,560
We'll be spending the rest of our lives here in sweet bliss.

80
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,460
We can't let tragedy haunt this place.

81
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,957
You don't have to worry about such matters, but I need your help with something right now.

82
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:27,720
What is it?

- Thank you, Valley Master Bai.
- Thank you, Valley Master Bai.

91
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,940
Your benevolence saved our lives and forgave our wrongs.

92
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,045
You should thank yourself.

93
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:18,240
There is a thin line between good and evil.

94
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,229
One wrong step might doom you to be buried in that wasteland like a certain someone.

95
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,759
Miss Ye, I'm grateful to you as well.

96
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,080
In the future, we won't ever call you a demoness again.

97
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,320
I won't ever fight women either.

98
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,996
Are you belittling women?

99
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:38,500
Fine. If we meet again in the Martial Arts World,

100
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,800
you'd better not retaliate when my ladies and I beat you up.

101
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:46,796
I'm sure you won't dare to anyway.

102
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:50,864
You're lucky to have survived this incident.

103
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:54,399
I'm sure you'll train even harder from now on.

104
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,200
After all, it's embarrassing to strut about with such shabby martial arts skills.

105
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,799
You...

106
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,960
You can't do as you please just because you're formidable!

107
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,759
She can insult you as she pleases precisely because she's formidable.

108
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,899
If you're up to no good again, I bet the poison will act up and kill you.

109
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,960
Stop your empty threats! Such mystical poison doesn't exist!

110
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,059
We've been cured of the poison! There's no way it'll act up again!

111
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,240
Eldest Miss Lin. Don't worry. We won't commit evil again.

112
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,919
We will turn over a new leaf and focus on training hard.

113
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,399
We won't utter a word about this incident in Fenghua Valley, nor will we reenter Changliu Mountain.

114
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,620
Farewell.

115
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,120
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

116
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,110
Tranquility has finally been restored in Fenghua Valley.

117
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,101
It's just a pity that the treasures they destroyed are gone.

118
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,200
Young Master Bai!

119
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,360
How about I give you more treasures?

120
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,866
Tell me whatever you desire.

121
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:56,620
I... I want you to come home with me and marry me.

122
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,260
Lin Xiaoxiao! Don't seduce me in broad daylight and before a crowd!

123
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,225
This is an important life decision!

124
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:09,099
Ye Xi. How about you two return to Flowing Water Manor with us?

125
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:11,060
You can avoid Cang Qi as well!

126
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,580
Even if he tries to barge in, my father can shield us, so there's nothing to fear!

127
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,680
He's been in reclusion for years, and definitely falling sick from boredom.

128
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,699
All right, enough. Let's leave first.

129
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:23,000
- Well, next month, remember to—
- Enough chatting.

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,420
- Let's go!
- Hey, I...

131
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,809
What's on your mind?

132
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:42,879
I'm thinking... about Cang Qi.

133
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,759
I'm right here, but you're thinking about him?

134
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,799
What nonsense are you spouting? I'm thinking about the unresolved issue with him.

135
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,459
Have you decided on how to confront him?

136
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,859
Nope. He won't listen, and I can't kill him.

137
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:02,779
I'm out of options, so I resorted to deception.

138
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,934
Do you have any ideas?

139
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,063
If I'm no longer alive, he's the only one

140
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,960
that I can leave you with.

141
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,240
What the heck are you blabbering?

142
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,979
He is overbearing, but his feelings for you are sincere.

143
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:23,220
He even has power now.

144
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,879
At present, he's able to keep you safe.

145
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,954
I can die in peace as well.

146
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:33,780
All his advantages won't win my affection.

147
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,799
I told you.

148
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,560
From here on out, you're the only man for me.

149
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,617
We'll live and die together.

150
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:46,394
No, that's not right. I won't let you die.

151
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:48,664
I'm hopelessly greedy.

152
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:53,124
We just became a couple and have yet to share a bed.

153
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:56,580
Don't say such things in broad daylight.

154
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:03,300
I told you. Sharing a bed is a blessing exchanged with a thousand years of hard work.

155
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,900
My heart only beats for you.

156
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,261
You're the only one I want to spend my life with.

157
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,500
Don't shove me to someone else, please.

158
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Can you really bear to do that?

159
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,160
You're jealous over a dream that Cang Qi had of me.

160
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,811
If that happens in real life, won't you...

161
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,015
I won't say such things again.

162
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:33,449
You don't have to mull over him either.

163
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:38,520
When the time comes, I'll make a clean break with him.

164
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,040
Right now, I just want to spend every minute and every second with you.

165
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,539
I want to do everything that couples do as they grow old together.

166
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,479
Young Master, your charms are truly irresistible.

167
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:59,240
Even words can't fully express my love.

168
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,260
- Men!
- Come back!

169
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,860
Help!

170
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,079
What... What do you want?

171
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,600
I... don't feel well.

172
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,620
If you feel unwell, drink more water!

173
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,559
- I can't sleep!
- Can't sleep?

174
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,519
I'll get Young Master Bai to prescribe a sleeping pill for you.

175
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't want any medicine!

176
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,800
I can't sleep because this is an unfamiliar place.

177
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:54,059
How about you stay here and chat with me?

178
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,939
Chat? Chatting will only keep you up!

179
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,639
- Young Master!
- Young Master!

180
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,399
- Are you all right?i>
- Your young master is just fine.

181
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,781
Go back, wash up, and sleep!

182
00:15:03,781 --> 00:15:05,734
Those two!

183
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,240
Am I being too nice and polite to you?

184
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,540
Can you stop pinching my cheeks while speaking?

185
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,519
Sometimes, I wonder if you like me or my face!

186
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,300
I... I just wanted to ascertain the truth.

187
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,840
Let's go.

188
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,460
I can't deal with such talk.

189
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,020
Come on, let's go to bed.

190
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,839
Let's go. Time to sleep.

191
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,040
I bet they'll do the deed this time.

192
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,060
- Let's take a look.
- Come on.

193
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,020
Miss Ye, what are you doing here?

194
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,340
I...

195
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,580
I'm planting flowers here.

196
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,159
Where is your young master?

197
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,500
He's in Eldest Miss Lin's room.

198
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,660
Aren't you going to intervene?

199
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,559
They aren't even married yet.

200
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,399
What if he gets bullied?

201
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,480
Miss Ye, that isn't bullying.

202
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,960
Perhaps they're just having a chat tonight.

203
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,519
Miss Ye, shouldn't you be worried about Eldest Miss Lin?

204
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,501
How about you step in?

205
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:30,220
Forget it. You're right.

206
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,779
Let's not interrupt their chat.

207
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,639
Miss Ye, we'll leave you to your task. We're heading to bed.

208
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,200
- Come on.
- See you, Miss Ye.

209
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,259
I bet they'll do it this time.

210
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,460
Let's wait and see.

211
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,508
You sure have a keen nose.

212
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,979
The two of them just happen to be occupied, so this Triple Blossom Liquor is ours to enjoy.

213
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,300
You can find it no matter where it's hidden.

214
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,379
I haven't had a proper drink with you.

215
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:39,720
I remember the first time you stole liquor and got drunk.

216
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,802
You were trying to seduce me.

217
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,900
Right now...

218
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,340
I'm even more eager to do that.

219
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:57,120
Drink more. Don't be too strict with yourself.

220
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,219
I'll grant your wish. You can hug me.

221
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,440
Was that all it took to get you drunk?

222
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,540
I'm not drunk.

223
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,680
I want to hug you too.

224
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,255
I want to keep you in my arms

225
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,400
and never let go.

226
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,321
How is your health lately?

227
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:48,340
If you feel unwell, you have to tell me.

228
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,920
By the way, the jade coffin I saw was one meant for a couple's joint burial.

229
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,540
Tomorrow, let's check it out together.

230
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,319
Perhaps we'll uncover some clues.

231
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,079
Sure. I'll abide by your wishes.

232
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,819
But let's make those two leave tomorrow.

233
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,420
Rather than flirting in our home, they might as well go home and meet their in-laws.

234
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,319
Right now, I just want to enjoy peace and quiet with you.

235
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,200
♫ Our hearts are always linked ♫

236
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,039
Why is your breathing so frazzled?

237
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,500
That's clearly because you're in my arms.

238
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,038
What a beautiful sight,

239
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,340
and what a wonderful hour.

240
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
How can I miss such a moment?

241
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,960
♫ The breeze sends its blessings ♫

242
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,450
♫ Fate has connected us ♫

243
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:03,450
♫ Even the passing of time cannot change us ♫

244
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,470
♫ Our love is growing ♫

245
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:13,590
♫ My heart calls out to you tens of thousands of times ♫

246
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,220
♫ Let's hope, in our forever future, ♫

247
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,200
♫ Our hearts are always linked ♫

248
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:27,319
Returning here brings back stark memories.

249
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,855
I was hit by the coffin cover back then.

250
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:34,459
When I was losing my consciousness, I saw a young lady in red shielding me.

251
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,280
I never asked you, but I've always known.

252
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,240
You were the one who saved me.

253
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,457
Was that when you fell in love with me at first sight?

254
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,880
You saved me, so I wanted to repay you because I never remain indebted to others.

255
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,559
However, my love for you doesn't stem from gratitude.

256
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,420
I love you for who you are.

257
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,939
It's a pity that you forgot about me when we met again.

258
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,800
I could only witness you falling for other men time and again.

259
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,299
I lost my memory, and there were too many incidents along the way.

260
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,359
Let me ask you a question.

261
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,279
Am I prettier than before, or...

262
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,240
Of course... you're prettier now.

263
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,460
As expected of the miracle physician.

264
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,319
In such little time, you're feeling as good as new.

265
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:52,780
Well, you can cure illnesses, but you can't change fate.

266
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,439
I told you that I'd offer you a generous gift.

267
00:21:56,439 --> 00:22:00,020
After all, you saved me, and I don't want to be indebted to you.

268
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:04,199
These Night Pearls are all gifts of thanks to you.

269
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,585
These are my betrothal gifts.

270
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,759
I won't marry you.

271
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,240
That's fine, Xiao Xi.

272
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,480
I can marry into your family. I won't let go of you again.

273
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,380
Open your eyes wide.

274
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,754
Whether in life or in death, I will never part from him.

275
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,453
Changliu Mountain is your birthplace.

276
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:37,319
I can accept Fenghua Valley as your home.

277
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,319
He can act as your family and marry you off.

278
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,480
However, after this day, you can only hold your husband's hand.

279
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,960
That's me.

280
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,720
Are you deaf?

281
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,119
I told you, I won't marry you!

282
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,919
Only Bai Yue can be my husband.

283
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,980
He's the only one, for the rest of my life and for eternity.

284
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,480
Have you forgotten that night? You're my woman!

285
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,640
That night doesn't exist. I was never your woman.

286
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,260
Nonsense! That night, we drank from nuptial cups!

287
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,839
What about that night of passion?

288
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:12,119
Night of passion? That's just a phrase.

289
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,700
What else can it be?

290
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,280
I'm sorry, I lied to you.

291
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:21,859
That was just an illusion.

292
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,979
That's fine. I don't mind.

293
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:28,319
As long as he's dead, you'll return to my side.

294
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,300
Quick, come over here. I might just let him die less miserably.

295
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,911
Don't force me to fight you.

296
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:37,960
Even this number of Black Armored Guards doesn't scare me!

297
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,919
No one can force me to go against my wishes.

298
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,920
Nor can anyone touch a hair on his head.

299
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,959
Is there no one else you care for in this world?!

300
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,479
That's right.

301
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,940
Your Highness!

302
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:06,724
That's Xiaoxiao's gun.

303
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,776
What did you do to them?

304
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,724
Bring them here!

305
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,319
Move it!

306
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,979
- Let go!
- Let go of her!

307
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:19,379
Move it!

308
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,100
- Young Master Bai!
- Valley Master!

309
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,820
Uncle Hui, are you all right?

310
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,240
I met Eldest Miss Lin and the rest at the valley entrance as they were leaving.

311
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,079
In the end, we...

312
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,480
We're fine, except...

313
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,280
Except that he stopped my guards and stole my Tyrant Shooter.

314
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,379
I know that they're your friends.

315
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:45,019
I wanted to let them stay to witness our marriage.

316
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:48,319
I hate coercing you as well!

317
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,260
I can change if this is the reason you're rejecting me!

318
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,419
If I change, will you choose me?

319
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,780
It's fine if you refuse to marry me!

320
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,280
Can you just stay by my side?

321
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,370
Don't you trust that my feelings are true?

322
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,047
You can say whatever you want,

323
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:13,419
but you're still coercing her.

324
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,032
Get your men to leave.

325
00:25:19,032 --> 00:25:20,779
You can come with me.

326
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:22,890
I'll give you a proper explanation.

327
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,120
Your Highness.

328
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,329
There's something off about Young Master Bai!

329
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:39,240
Actually, I think Cang Qi is rather pitiful.

330
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,797
Why is the door to the forbidden area open again?

331
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,600
If he's dead, will you be free to choose me?

332
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,720
The officials in the imperial court urged you to take the throne

333
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,538
because they think you can govern the world and bring peace.

334
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:14,029
Why are you so fixated on me?

335
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:16,680
As for Bai Yue, he won't die.

336
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,580
That's because I won't let that happen.

337
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,320
Why?

338
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:25,640
Were all my efforts just wishful thinking?

339
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,260
I know.

340
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,240
You truly wanted to treat me well, but that's not what I want.

341
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,459
Perhaps love really is blind and illogical.

342
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,240
You'll never know that someone you just encountered

343
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,599
will become your dearest lover.

344
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,200
No matter how great someone else is, the heart will never falter again.

345
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,540
That's because no one else can be him.

346
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,799
I deceived you.

347
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,599
I'm sorry.

348
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,319
If your anger won't quell, feel free to stab me once.

349
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,419
But please stop using suicide as a threat.

350
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,960
When you tried to commit suicide back then, I told you to become stronger to protect yourself.

351
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,176
Now, you even have the power to protect the world.

352
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:26,080
When there is peace in the world and the Martial Arts World is united as one, you'll understand it.

353
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,640
A woman isn't that important, and giving up on her isn't that hard.

354
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,339
I do care

355
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,311
about the people of the world.

356
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:40,480
However, you're part of this world.

357
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,499
Why can't I have you as well?

358
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:44,260
You once held me in your arms and coaxed me to sleep.

359
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,219
That was the only warmth I felt in my life.

360
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:49,956
Why can't I put you before the rest of the world?

361
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:52,879
Why are you so heartless now, asking me to give up on you?

362
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:57,173
Why do you stand before me but can never be mine?

363
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,100
I'm filled with nothing but regret.

364
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,620
When we first met, you saved me time and again.

365
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,200
Yet, I only vented my anger on you.

366
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,531
Right now, I have an even greater regret.

367
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,079
Why didn't I kill him long ago to prevent this result?

368
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,670
Bai Yue!

369
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,519
I hate you! Your life is mine!

370
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,972
You won't let me die, but you raised your sword against me for him!

371
00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:34,300
I no longer want to live in such misery.

372
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,519
In life and in death, we shall never part.

373
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:45,672
Since you refuse to choose me while I'm alive, let's die together.

374
00:28:45,672 --> 00:28:48,871
If you're dead, I can keep you by my side forever!

375
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,827
Oh no, they are in danger!

376
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,199
Go!

377
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,547
Why isn't anything happening inside?

378
00:31:18,547 --> 00:31:20,880
Uncle Hui, hurry and open this door.

379
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,280
This door has been sealed for many years. No one can open it.

380
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,559
Will they die inside then?

381
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,119
But, why can't your own people open this door?

382
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,017
We haven't found the mechanism to do it.

383
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,319
Aren't the Black Armored Guards fierce?

384
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,691
Hurry and open the door. The Prince Regent is still inside.

385
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:39,519
Xiaoxiao, don't be anxious yet.

386
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,576
I'm sure they'll be fine.

387
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,840
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

388
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,431
Go see if he is all right.

389
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,626
You still care about him even now?

390
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,858
Didn't you say that the entire empire is his now.

391
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,285
He can do more great things.

392
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,160
I have a ginseng pill here.

393
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,250
Let him ingest it.

394
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,808
The black one is his.

395
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,877
You must remember my caution to you.

396
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:47,167
Even if your power is most astounding,

397
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,148
there are times when you can't do what you want.

398
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,149
Right now is one of those times.

399
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,279
Don't waste your spiritual power.

400
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:01,800
I know my own body.

401
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:05,448
Forgive me for not telling you the truth.

402
00:35:05,448 --> 00:35:07,660
The curse cannot be lifted.

403
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,020
The pain in the heart has never lessened. Don't feel sad.

404
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,441
Do you think

405
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:16,770
I can't feel sad because I don't have a heart?

406
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,642
Without you, immortality is meaningless.

407
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:24,701
What's the use for me to live forever but alone in this world?

408
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:28,300
I already told you.

409
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,067
I will live and die with you.

410
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:33,418
I won't leave you alone.

411
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,880
Let me hug you once more.

412
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:51,679
Ye Xi,

413
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,081
have I ever told you this?

414
00:35:56,081 --> 00:36:00,591
In my entire lifetime, I believe what I did most right

415
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:03,903
was waiting by the unmarked burial mounds

416
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,005
so that you could see me as soon as you woke up.

417
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,339
In this lifetime,

418
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:15,022
I haven't wasted even a minute or a second of time to be with you.

419
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:18,060
As such, I have no regrets.

420
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,835
To be with you at this moment,

421
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,399
to know and be committed to each other like this,

422
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,560
I never would have dared to dream of such.

423
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,380
♫ How can love be drawn like the moon but missing a piece from the circle? ♫

424
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,204
But the curse cannot be lifted.

425
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:35,999
I, Bai Yue,

426
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,350
to have a good woman as you

427
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,780
who doesn't leave or abandon me,

428
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,156
follow each other in life and in death,

429
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:47,039
I'm content for this lifetime.

430
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,890
So, don't feel pity for me.

431
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,933
Sleep well.

432
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:55,460
Forget me when you wake up.

433
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,219
Become the simple and happy you again.

434
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,336
Stay alive and live well.

435
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:10,340
But you absolutely must remember, never give your heart easily,

436
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:14,432
because in this world,

437
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:18,105
the one you love the most should be yourself.

438
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:19,740
Understand?

439
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:39,300
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi
