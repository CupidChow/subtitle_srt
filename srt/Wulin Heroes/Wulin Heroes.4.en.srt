[Episode 4]

16
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,319
I'm so hungry.

17
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,519
I should eat a good meal before going back to the inn.

18
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,059
Shopkeeper.

19
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:40,519
Bring me a pot of wine and a plate of meat.

20
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,119
Sure, coming up.

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,120
Just now, Tang Huan was very weak in his martial arts.

22
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,499
I can run into you when I'm just casually strolling around.

23
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:56,980
It's a kind of fated connection.

24
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,700
Not discerning the truth, not knowing good from bad, there can't be a second person like you in this world.

25
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,660
You're here on purpose to tell me I'm dumb?

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,839
Am I in your way?

27
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,779
There are many ways to live in this world.

28
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:14,180
A thousand pieces of gold won't make me happy.

29
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,379
However you want to live, that's indeed your own business.

30
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:23,500
But to drink so thoughtlessly here, it's easy to be schemed against.

31
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,600
A big battle is looming. If I don't eat, how will I have the strength to kill?

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,120
Someone is scheming against me?

33
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,880
I'll kill them, too.

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,260
Miss.

35
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,919
What big battle are you talking about?

36
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,800
Is it in our city?

37
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,920
Yesterday, there were indeed a lot of martial artists here.

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,280
But all of them have left.

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,240
I heard it's because the demoness they're after has left.

40
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,400
Come have a look!

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,139
This is strange.

42
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:53,140
I didn't even see them, and they've already left?

43
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,900
What? You are anxious to meet them?

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,660
Shopkeeper, add a bowl of noodles.

45
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,500
More vegetables, less oil and less salt.

46
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,099
No chopped scallions, no cilantro, and no chili peppers.

47
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,099
Yes, yes. Sure, of course.

48
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,520
What is it?

49
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,080
You talk about killing people so easily.

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,020
Eat some vegetables and calm the fire in your heart.

51
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,319
Miss, do you want anything else?

52
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,759
Just do what he asked.

53
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,359
Sure.

54
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:26,920
For someone like you to say that, it makes me feel a little weird.

55
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,359
If you can eat, then eat well.

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,539
After the big battle, who knows if you'll still be able to eat.

57
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,339
It's just the Tang Fortress.

58
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,879
Will I go and not come back?

59
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,979
I'm just reminding you.

60
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,500
If you die from the poisonous needle, you'll look awful.

61
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,240
My fate is lucky. I won't bother you to worry about me.

62
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:53,059
The Black and White Double Phantoms were sent by Yu Luo to test your martial arts skills.

63
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:56,020
Tang Huan's injury is clearly a tactic of self injury.
(to gain sympathy)

64
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,359
The reason is that you are their important weapon for winning.

65
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:02,560
How can you be so obsessed for him and volunteer to die?

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,400
I am skillful in martial arts. Who says that I'm going to die?

67
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,339
Tang Huan is injured for sure.

68
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:12,260
I can't ignore him. How does that make me obsessed?

69
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,900
Anyway, I was planning to kill Tang Yang.

70
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,999
We're just going together. So what about that?

71
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,179
Sir, Miss.

72
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,720
Your noodles are ready. Enjoy.

73
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:35,539
If by chance I die, doesn't that prove that I am not the demoness?

74
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,179
This meal is my treat.

75
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:44,219

00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,910
Hurry!

160
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,819
Kill!!

161
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:41,419
Charge inside!

162
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:42,840
Hurry up! Hurry up!

163
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,559
Kill!

164
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,779
Hurry up!

165
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,279
- This way!
- Do we need to kill so many people to get into Tang Fortress?

166
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,200
This is too cruel.

167
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,939
Tang Yang, come on out! Today is the day you die!

168
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,979
I advise everyone not to act rashly.

169
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,979
Put away your Thunder Bombs.

170
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:04,639
The ancestors buried a lot of explosives under the ground here.

171
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,960
Be careful not to hurt yourselves.

172
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:12,739
Tang Huan, you thought having a spy,

173
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:17,380
combined with the Thunder Bombs to enter Tang Fortress, and you are certain to win?

174
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,300
Those disciples that died just now were the ones who were disobedient.

175
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,440
You actually helped me clean house.

176
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,940
Sect Lord Yu, Tang Sect and your sect have always stayed clear of each other.

177
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,200
I didn't expect you to be so ambitious.

178
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,519
You would gather such a band of mismatched crowd.

179
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,479
Are you looking down at Tang Sect?

180
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,960
You... You are such a snob.

181
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,639
All of us are reputable in the Martial Arts World.

182
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,700
Is Tang Sect so great?

183
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,919
Aren't you just relying on weapons and poisons?

184
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,160
You are not presentable on stage!

185
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:54,000
Have we fallen into his trap?

186
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,679
Yes. It looks like he deliberately lured us in.

187
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,879
No problem. I'm here.

188
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,300
Ye Xi?

189
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,799
Ye Xi?

190
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,739
How did you find Ye Xi?

191
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:18,379
You didn't die?

192
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:22,219
You have aligned with him to revenge against me.

193
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:26,840
So what? You can kill me, but I can't revenge?

194
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:30,299
Sect Lord Yu, why didn't you tell us already?

195
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:33,279
How can we be in league with the demoness? Right?

196
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,759
Right!

197
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,759
Everyone, calm down.

198
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,020
You are all pragmatic people.

199
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,939
What a great move to kill using a borrowed blade!

200
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:43,699
Xiao Xi is my fiancée.

201
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:46,459
You are shameless. It doesn't mean everyone else should be shameless, too.

202
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,379
She is my woman.

203
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:51,120
How dare a bastard like you to fight with me for her!

204
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,980
Although the old man brought you, a bastard without any identity, home.

205
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,100
But he wouldn't acknowledge you even if he's on his deathbed.

206
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,139
Tang Sect has always been mine!

207
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:01,920
Shut up!

208
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:33,519
Are you all right?

209
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,440
Xiao Xi.

210
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,280
He is merely a loser that I defeated.

211
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,220
He thinks he can return after having you. In his dreams!

212
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,520
Even if you crawl out of hell to find me for revenge, it's still useless.

213
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,879
I could kill him the first time, and I can kill him the second time now.

214
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,060
Who's that?

215
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,750
Who are they?

216
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,199
Who are you?

217
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,340
- It's the Black Armord Guards!
- Black Armored Guards?

218
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,500
Black Armored Guards?

219
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,959
The Prince Regent is here.

220
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,599
You came just in time.

221
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,739
Tang Yang!

222
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,620
You've actually sought shelter with the Imperial Court and betrayed Tang Sect's secret path

223
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,820
to let the Black Armored Guards in.

224
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,079
It's only to deal with the ragtags like you guys.

225
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,579
Tang Sect's sinner is actually you.

226
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,379
You...

227
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:47,879
Has Tang Sect surrendered to the Imperial Court?

228
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:55,119
If all of you are killed, no one will know what happens here today.

229
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,680
Lord of Tang Sect, you are generous and don't hold a grudge.

230
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,600
None of us in Thunder Sect came here today.

231
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,759
Sect Lord Yu, how can you betray the brotherhood?

232
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,639
This is a famiy affair within Tang Sect.

233
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,799
My family affair?

234
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,999
He doesn't deserve it.

235
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:19,340
Sect Lord Yu, are you deliberately shaming me?

236
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,080
No, no, no. I misspoke.

237
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,599
The Thunder Sect is willing to hand over the recipe of Thunder Bombs to express our apology.

238
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:32,779
Good! Other than the Thunder Sect,

239
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:36,580
all the others... kill them all.

240
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,839
What do we do now?

241
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,100
Yu Luo, you dispicable villain!

242
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,279
And, Tang Yang!

243
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,000
You colluded with the imperial court, that make you a scum in the Martial Arts World.

244
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,619
- Scum!
- Scumb! Scumb!

245
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,559
So what if you're are slapped?

246
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,219
Half of the slaps were for myself.

247
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:04,000
I originally wanted to ask you about our entanglements.

248
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,200
But now I think it's disgusting and don't want to listen anymore.

249
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,540
I did the seccond slap for Tang Sect's ancestors.

250
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,900
It's a matter among between you and your brother, you actually sought help from the imperial court.

251
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,440
it's too easy on you to kill you with one blow.

252
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,499
I used inner force on the slaps.

253
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:19,879
So your meridians will slowly break.

254
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:23,220
No one has ever dared to do this to me.

255
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,019
No one has ever dare to do this to me!

256
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:30,240
Ye Xi! You demoness, aren't you shameless to scold me?

257
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,259
If I don't kill you today, the hatred in my heart won't dissolve!

258
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:37,180
Black Armored Guards, I order you to kill this demoness!

259
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,600
What are you looking at?

260
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,339
I... told you to kill the demoness!

261
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,380
The Black Armored Guards would be crazy to listen to you.

262
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,580
Miracle Physician Bai Yue?

263
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,580
What are you doing here?

264
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,559
To save me, Tang Huan got hit by the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

265
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,080
Can you save him?

266
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,060
He saved you?

267
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,079
He is too busy for that.

268
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,019
And you can't afford the money for me to save him.

269
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:21,359
You...

270
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,459
If you are willing to save him, I'll even be your servant to repay you.

271
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:30,060
Once the Storm Pear Flower Needle enters the body, even the gods can't save him.

272
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,160
Is that right?

273
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,720
Take this.

274
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:41,139
No one can be saved from the Storm Pear Flower Needle?

275
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,859
Don't you see someone who is alive in front of you?

276
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:48,119
So you're the one who saved her.

277
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,140
Then, neither one of you two will be able to walk out of here alive today.

278
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,540
Don't boast so much.

279
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,759
Haven't you noticed something?

280
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:02,440
The reason that the Black Armored Guards are here is to stop you from harming her.

281
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,480
Here's my advice to you.

282
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,699
Even if you have the Storm Pear Flower Needle, you should not act recklessly.

283
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,600
He called you a demoness,

284
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,300
but he's the last person in this world who should be insulting you.

285
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,560
Aren't you here to find out how he harmed you?

286
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,499
I don't want to hear about these filthy deeds.

287
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:31,599
Don't be afraid. He's the one in the wrong.

288
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,699
The Storm Pear Flower Needle belonged to Mo Sect, but you coveted it.

289
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:39,060
It's you pity your martial arts skills were too weak.

290
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,599
You were hurt by Mo Sect's ambush mechanisms.

291
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,340
If not for this person, you wouldn't have lived to see this day.

292
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,779
You noticed that she was a formidable yet a gullible martial artist.

293
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,620
Hence, you lied that the Storm Pear Flower Needle was Tang Sect's lost artifact.

294
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,300
You even promised to wed her.

295
00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:02,020
Hence, she risked her life for you to break into Mo Sect.

296
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,140
He used you as bait to lure fighters away.

297
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,430
After he obtained the Storm Pear Flower Needle, he committed murder and arson.

298
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,499
You barely managed to escape with your life, but you were branded as a demoness.

299
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:19,739
In the end, you were silenced with murder.

300
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:22,319
- Preposterous!
- So, that's the truth!

301
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,279
Did I experience something that bloody?

302
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,340
He's such a heartless person.

303
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,899
You shouldn't have saved him.

304
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:33,419
It's not too late for vengeance now.

305
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:37,920
Groundless accusations!

306
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,880
Who said there isn't any evidence?

307
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,279
- What?
- This…

308
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:52,559
- Brother, who is this?
- So, you're really here.

309
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,380
I didn't come here for you.

310
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,179
Is Tang Sect a place you can freely step foot in?

311
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,400
This is the first time I've been turned away at the door.

312
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,659
Bai Yue said you deceived Ye Xi.

313
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:10,160
As for Mo Rou, you've never said a single honest word to her.

314
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,480
In the end, you even murdered her!

315
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,560
Did he kill Mo Rou?

316
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,880
How can he be the one?

317
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,060
- Why is he the one?
- What a bastard.

318
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,179
That's because she uncovered the unspeakable!

319
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:25,219
- You've just confessed to your deed!
- H-He really did it!

320
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:29,800
You silenced her by killing her, and put on such a heartbroken farce.

321
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,800
What a pristine mask you built for yourself.

322
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,080
Who is this unreasonable shrew?

323
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,340
She's blabbering nonsense!

324
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,199
Who's blabbering nonsense?

325
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:41,280
Before Mo Rou died, she sent me a letter with the truth.

326
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,100
My words are the proof.

327
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,140
Since all of you are here, don't even think about leaving.

328
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,199
Anyway, more blood on my hands doesn't matter.

329
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:56,440
Be careful.

330
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,200
Aren't these the Solar Sword and Radiance Sword from Flowing Water Manor?

331
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,659
- Folks from Flowing Water Manor?
- Flowing Water Manor?

332
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:07,019
You're really Eldest Miss Lin.

333
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,659
Please forgive me for failing to greet you.

334
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:15,899
Since Flowing Water Manor is standing witness, we have no doubts!

335
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:17,580
Sect Lord Yu is right!

336
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,419
We'll abide by Flowing Water Manor.

337
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,779
We will defend the justice of the martial arts world and avenge Mo Sect!

338
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:24,699
- Avenge them!
- Avenge them!

339
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:28,559
Such malleable wimps!

340
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,759
You said the same thing when you killed Ye Xi.

341
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:37,659
Miss Ye, check on Elder Tang!

342
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,400
- Xiao Xi.
- Are you all right?

343
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,599
Save me. I don't want to die.

344
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,079
Ye Xi,

345
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,279
your worry over him is making my heart falter.

346
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:58,680
You can die with him.

347
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,280
All of you present!

348
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,419
I will reward the person who kills Ye Xi

349
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:08,439
with 100,000 taels of gold and spare his life.

350
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:09,739
100,000 taels?

351
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,179
- 100,000 taels?
- Does he mean it?

352
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:13,379
He'll show mercy too.

353
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:16,559
- Did you hear him?
- Yes, 100,000 taels.

354
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,400
If you kill her

355
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,780
or touch a hair on her head, I'll turn you to ashes!

356
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,299
Our respects, Prince Regent.

357
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:42,599
Our respects to the Prince Regent.

358
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:45,920
The Prince Regent? Why does he know me too?

359
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,860
Ye Xi.

360
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,740
I'll count to three.

361
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,980
If you don't let go of him, I'll chop off this man's hand.

362
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:04,919
One.

363
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,039
Two.

364
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,719
Ye Xi, come over here.

365
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,559
Come to me.

366
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,679
I've been waiting for so long.

367
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,999
I knew you'd return.

368
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,539
Ye Xi, hurry and come over here.

369
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:26,139
Don't make me repeat myself for the third time.

370
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,240
Wait, I've never seen you before.

371
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,500
Aren't you ordering the wrong person around?

372
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,880
You've never seen me?

373
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,059
That's not what you said when you shared my bed!

374
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:51,639
Prince Regent! Ye Xi is a notorious demoness in the Martial Arts World.

375
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:53,600
Don't be fooled by her.

376
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,140
If you are fond of beauties, I can present even more stunning women to you.

377
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,540
These folks colluded with this demoness to attack Tang Sect.

378
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,920
I will eliminate them today.

379
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,639
Did I let you talk?

380
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:11,740
Why do you think I stationed troops at Tang Sect?

381
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,240
Why did I keep my eye on clowns like you?

382
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,280
That's because I believe as long as she's alive, she'll return to Tang Sect for revenge.

383
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,320
I came here for her!

384
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,719
Don't you dare touch her!

385
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,799
- Xiao Shan.
- Here.

386
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,880
Abide by my orders! Arrest all irrelevant people in this hall!

387
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,620
Yes!

388
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,579
Sect Lord Tang, please come this way.

389
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:42,140
Get out! Move it!

390
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,940
Hurry up!

391
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,459
The Prince Regent will probably continue his love confession.

392
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:02,539
- Why do you look so terrifying?
- Shut up.

393
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,079
Your Highness. The crown prince died at the hands of this demoness.

394
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,720
You just stepped up to power.

395
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,780
You can't be bewitched by this demoness.

396
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,960
Please put the interests of the people first.

397
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,499
The crown prince?

398
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,319
I killed the crown prince!

399
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,539
He's brutal, corrupt, weak, and incompetent!

400
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,259
Your Highness, please have mercy!

401
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:36,699
Yet, he made a woman his scapegoat!

402
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,679
He's not fit to be human, what more an emperor.

403
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,659
Your Highness!

404
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:45,019
- Xiao Shan!
- Here!

405
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,060
Drag him out of here!

406
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,400
- Yes.
- Your Highness!

407
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,459
- Take him away.
- Yes!

408
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:54,280
Ye Xi, come over here.

409
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,139
I still want to speak to you.

410
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,740
How many unsavory relationships was I entangled in?

411
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:08,959
Your words to me don't matter. We're no longer acquaintances.

412
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,859
Why do you know my martial arts skills?

413
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:32,300
Evidently, you taught me.

414
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,380
Don't you remember?

415
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,499
I don't remember a single thing. No lies about that.

416
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:40,299
- I don't believe you.
- Stop.

417
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:42,040
Move back.

418
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,339
Your disbelief won't change anything. Stop bringing up the past.

419
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:50,159
Besides, you don't look very healthy.

420
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,979
Go back to where you came from.

421
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:54,659
Don't waste your life on a demoness like me.

422
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,679
I won't allow you to say that of yourself.

423
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:59,200
In my heart, you aren't a demoness!

424
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,280
You're the best woman in the world! My woman!

425
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,820
Your Highness, such overbearing lines don't even appear in books.

426
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,520
You were always the one proctecting me.

427
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,679
Now, I'll protect you.

428
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,180
I won't let anyone harm you again.

429
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,659
The crown prince harmed you, but I've taken revenge for you.

430
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,959
He died horribly. There was nothing left of his flesh and bones.

431
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,580
I didn't believe that you were dead.

432
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,880
So, I've been searching.

433
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,460
Come back with me. We'll never part again.

434
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:36,219
I really wish I could carve out my heart for you to see.

435
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:39,480
You... Don't you feel anything?

436
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,400
I do. I think dying without any remains is pretty terrifying.

437
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,239
Truth be told, what feeling are you trying to trigger in me?

438
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:52,760
Didn't I tell you? I really don't remember a thing about you. Sorry.

439
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,440
Do you know how much I suffered to become the Prince Regent

440
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,239
and possess the power to protect you?

441
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:04,340
Yet, you don't remember me.

442
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,700
Is your amnesia supposed to erased our past for good?

443
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,480
Do you know how heartbroken I am right now?

444
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:18,700
The misery of being fed poison in a dark prison

445
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:24,039
and my organs twisted in agony doesn't compare to this pain right now.

446
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,620
You make it out to be so miserable.

447
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,759
It's as though I'm the cause of this entanglement.

448
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:37,559
My life used to be utter agony.

449
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,600
It was possibly worse than death.

450
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,039
I thought I didn't deserve to live.

451
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,599
You saved me.

452
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:01,159
When I escaped the chains of misery, I thought the world was beautiful.

453
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,040
As for you, you were even more wonderful than the whole world.

454
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,119
A-After all that I've said, don't you feel the slightest bit moved?

455
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,000
N-Not at all.

456
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,060
Can you withdraw this dagger first?

457
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,360
I'll tell you more. I'll tell you everything about us.

458
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,960
I'll never forget about this.

459
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,680
Can you stop talking about the past? I don't want to hear it.

460
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm not unreasonable.

461
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,800
Either you come with me, or you can kill me.

462
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,080
Such an unrelenting confession isn't great.

463
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,500
Your Highness, I'm just an ordinary woman.

464
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,899
I'm not worth your life.

465
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,460
If you're truly a reasonable man, let me make my own decisions.

466
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,699
Since I saved you once, there's no way I'll kill you now.

467
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:53,980
However, I won't leave with you.

468
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:03,259
That's fine. I never accept rejection.

469
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:17,340
What are they talking about in there?

470
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,140
How would I know?

471
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,839
Don't try to pull tricks.

472
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:28,580
That'll ensure a peaceful death for you.

473
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,979
Tang Sect is my territory.

474
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:36,240
You have no right to dictate my movements.

475
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,559
Seems like you're eager to die right away.

476
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:58,880
Sect Lord!

477
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,480
All of you, stand still!

478
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,659
Yue Yue, well done!

479
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:04,640
A man like him deserves a beating!

480
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,340
Shut up.

481
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,680
Filthy!

482
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,599
Why haven't they come out?

483
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,980
Do they really have to chat for so long?

484
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,880
Ye Xi isn't a demoness!

485
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,419
If anyone spreads rumors about the demoness in the Martial Arts World,

486
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:49,239
I'll execute their whole family!

487
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:55,219
New rumors will spread if you do so.

488
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:59,379
Others will say that I bewitched the Prince Regent and oppressed the common folk.

489
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:03,460
No matter how many people you kill, you can't stop idle gossip.

490
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,100
They'll only choose to believe what they think is true.

491
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,040
No one cares about the truth.

492
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,679
I don't care about my reputation anyway.

493
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,599
I know I committed no wrong. I have a clear conscience.

494
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,119
Rather than wasting my breath on them, it's better to strike.

495
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:22,799
Ye Xi! You're far bolder than any man.

496
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:24,920
You have my admiration!

497
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:31,500
You're right. We should strike!

498
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,960
Execute every single person here!

499
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,190
- Yes!
 - What?

500
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,990
Wait.

501
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:38,879
Are you insane?

502
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,180
I told you this is my affair. This is none of your business.

503
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,759
They wanted to harm you for just 100,000 taels of gold.

504
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:47,460
Such people will only taint the Martial Arts World if left alive.

505
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,520
Fourth Brother.

506
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,719
In that case, tons of people won't meet your standards.

507
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:58,860
Even so, you can't decide whether they live or die.

508
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,720
Let them go.

509
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,739
Prince Regent! We swear to you.

510
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:07,760
From this day forth, we will never speak about the demoness...

511
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,000
N-No...

512
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,839
We won't speak about Miss Ye.

513
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:16,479
Mo Sect was tragically annihilated because of Tang Yang!

514
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:19,560
Prince Regent, please uphold justice for the Martial Arts World!

515
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Please uphold justice!

516
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,340
Let us resolve our misunderstanding with Miss Ye here!

517
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,580
Our paths shouldn't cross ever again!

518
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,499
Scram!

519
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:32,699
Hurry up! Leave!

520
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:34,639
- Let's go.
- Come on.

521
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,639
Hurry up.

522
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,960
My grudge only concerns Tang Yang.

523
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,340
Spare the other Tang Sect disciples as well.

524
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,560
Prince Regent, please have mercy!

525
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,799
Your Highness, if you spare Tang Sect's disciples...

526
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:55,980
Let them leave.

527
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,139
Get moving!

528
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:58,880
- Your Highness!
- Thank you, Prince Regent!

529
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,960
Hurry up!

530
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,640
Come back! Don't leave!

531
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,060
Come back. Come back!

532
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,520
Are you going to let them leave? Won't they be potential threats?

533
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,299
They don't have what it takes to threaten me.

534
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:23,579
A lady like you in the Martial Arts World is simply unheard of.

535
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,740
I heard about your mastery of the Falling Leaf Palm Method and Flying Frost Sword Play.

536
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,340
These sound pretty impressive.

537
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:34,159
They seem elegant, yet lethal and swift.

538
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,820
Quickly exact your revenge.

539
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,939
I want to witness your skills.

540
00:36:36,939 --> 00:36:38,900
Thank you for your compliments.

541
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,059
But, my sword...

542
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:42,859
Hanzi.

543
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:47,719
A precious sword should belong to a beauty.

544
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:51,119
Don't worry. The blade won't be blunted even after countless fights.

545
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,120
Thank you.

546
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,460
You don't have to dirty your hards.

547
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:58,879
Bring Tang Yang up here.

548
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,900
Just watch. I'll exact revenge for you!

549
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,560
Your Highness. It was all a misunderstanding.

550
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,100
Tang Sect can still bring you benefits.

551
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,980
Kill him.

552
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,479
Then, raze Tang Sect to the ground!

553
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:22,660
Are you deaf?

554
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,939
I told you, I'll avenge myself.

555
00:37:24,939 --> 00:37:27,600
Why are you still so stubborn?

556
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:47,000
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

557
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,550
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

558
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:58,730
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

559
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:04,620
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

560
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:10,000
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

561
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,890
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

562
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:21,770
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

563
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:27,660
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

564
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:33,370
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

565
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:39,310
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

566
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:45,260
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

567
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:51,040
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

568
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,990
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

569
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,550
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

570
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:05,680
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

571
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:15,600
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
