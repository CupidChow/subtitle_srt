Do you know what happened to you eventually?

17
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,180
I heard I died by drinking the poison wine from the crown prince.

18
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,400
And the corpse was abandoned in the unmarked burial mounds.

I didn't listen to your advice.

When I provoked a man of his status, I deserved to be played to death.

Ever since the beginning, the men you've found have been worse and worse.

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,859
Why would you believe the current one?

50
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:16,639
Are you perhaps misunderstanding about something?

51
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,979
I didn't say that I believed him.

52
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:22,340
What I believe is that I won't give up my life this time.

53
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:29,259
About those two from previous times, I killed one of them myself, the other got killed before I did anything.

54
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,339
So, as you see, those men who harmed me didn't have good endings.

55
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,620
So what if fate has played the cruelest prank on me?

56
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,239
Aren't I still standing in one piece in front of you?

57
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:42,460
I don't fear death, and I don't care about it.

58
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,979
Why do you care about it even more than I do?

59
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:51,940
I've never seen a woman who is so stupid like you and would be so unreasonable.

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,300
I've wondered sometimes, what does your heart look like?

Doesn't your heart ache?

I don't understand. Why are you upset?

63
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,979
You can't live without a man?

64
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,499
If's fine even if it's not a man.

65
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:26,620
Even a GO game needs both black and white pieces.

66
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,800
It's about playing against a suitable opponent.

67
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,940
I just want someone who can stay with me.

68
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,360
Even if it's just for chatting. Can you understand such a wish?

69
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:37,779
You probably don't understand what I'm talking about.

70
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:40,039
Try to imagine a scene.

71
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,839
You are all alone in a prairie by a mountain,

72
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,420
watching the sun gradually rises and then gradually sets.

73
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,639
You watch the snow getting thicker and thicker.

74
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,359
A white expanse without even one single footprint.

75
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,519
You see some trees closely lean on one another.

76
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,379
They grow tall and cover up the sun, as you feel colder and colder.

77
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:01,779
Forget it. This is too imaginary for you.

78
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,020
Take this chess board that is made of the Torreya Grandis tree.

79
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,220
It takes at least 1,000 years for the tree to grow enough to be used for wood.

80
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,379
The cut wood needs to be air-dried for at least 20 years to be made into this chess board.

81
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,479
During those 1,000 years, how lonely it must have been?

82
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,239
Can you imagine how much companionship it covets?

83
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:25,740
It's like the women in this world looking for a good partner to stay and grow old together.

84
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,020
They mean the same thing.

85
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,319
They mean the same thing?

86
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,680
Nonsense.

87
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,620
I understand all that you've said.

88
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,319
You're just saying all the men I found have been scumbags.

89
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,619
Tang Huan will also hurt me.

90
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:50,540
But I've already promised to save him, so I must do it.

91
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,979
Will he hurt me in the future?

92
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,280
It has nothing to do with whether I should save him now.

93
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,880
If he really will hurt me, I will certainly doubly repay him, an eye for an eye.

94
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,820
Actually, the way I've been to him—

95
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,300
I haven't finished talking yet.

96
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,820
- Stop right there!
- Valley Master, Valley Master?
- Stop!

97
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:26,239
But... This...

98
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,400
Uncle Hui, look at him.

99
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,439
He never lets me finish talking.

100
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,959
I didn't even get to ask the question that I most wanted to ask.

101
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,419
I think you will anger our valley master to death.

102
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,680
Let me go check on him.

103
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,040
He is in the peak of anger right now.

104
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,999
What is it that you didn't get to ask?

105
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,240
Oh yes, Uncle Hui.

106
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,979
Have you seen me before?

107
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,800
This is already the second time.

108
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:02,920
No wonder I felt everything was samiliar when I came to Fenghua Valley.

109
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,219
Other than saving people, is there anything else between us?

110
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,580
On this matter, it's not appropriate for me to talk about it.

111
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,400
Valley Master never mentioned much about it.

112
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,360
He's been on his own since childhood.

113
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,620
He has no confidant. That's why he has to bear a lot of problems all by himself.

114
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,680
What a pity for this good chess board.

115
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:38,200
A lot of times, what you see with your own eyes or hear with your own ears might not be the truth.

116
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,079
There are many things behind the scenes that you don’t know about.

117
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,559
Uncle Hui, why not just tell me?

118
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,600
When you don't tell me the whole thing, my head will hurt at night.

119
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,779
Uncle Hui, it's fine.

120
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,499
He won't know.

121
00:08:56,499 --> 00:09:00,940
Isn't he still angry? That temper is so bad.

122
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,779
Since your valley master dislikes me so much, shouldn't he be happy that I got fooled?

123
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,959
I'll be talkative and say a few more words then.

124
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,140
You see, Valley Master is a physician.

125
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,060
In general, he'd only treat people and not kill people.

126
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,080
Even less would he want to get involved in the grudges withiin the Martial Arts World.

127
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,519
But, when he was facing the Tang Sect, he took the initiative to expose Tang Yang's true face.

128
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,100
Can you guess why?

129
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,740
Uncle Hui, you've told half the story and want me to guess.

130
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,240
My head hurts.

131
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,080
Miss, take your time to guess.

132
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,140
I believe you will definitely reach the answer.

133
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,720
He took the initiave... for me?

134
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,779
So other people lie to me to use me,

135
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,480
but he doesn't let me know that he is good to me?

136
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,919
A man’s heart has such a deep sea within it.

137
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:06,799
I don't get it.

138
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,279
- Valley Master?
- Enter.

139
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:30,380
I helped Miss Ye go back to her room.

140
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,859
What's the matter with you? Are you upset with her?

141
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:37,360
She isn't worth it for me to get upset.

142
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,020
If I get upset with her every day, I would have died already.

143
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,480
You are really something.

144
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,440
Why do you have to get this way over a young lady?

145
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,200
And blow such a big temper.

146
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,920
That chess board made of a 1,000-year-old Terrya Grandis tree was...

147
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,779
I'll quit talking. You just calm down.

148
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,939
Hurry and leave. Go to sleep now.

149
00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:01,659
I'm old and don't sleep much. You should take good care of your health.

150
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,740
Bai Yue, at Fenghua Valley, we've practiced in the sages' way of medicine through generations.

151
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,440
We abstain from the mundane world and personal love.

152

From this day forth, you will succeed the position of Valley Master.

154
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,960
If you ever succumb to temptation, you will be condemned by Heaven and Earth

155
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,599
and suffer eternally with a burning heart.

156
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,820
Good morning! Good morning! Good morning!

157
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,159
I've brought over the pestle and mortar.

158
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,880
I heard this is a treasure at Fenghua Valley that you use every day.

159
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,680
Why are you doing this?

160
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:00,659
Oh yes, do you have anything that you treasure but don't have?

161
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:05,840
I'll help you get it. Consider it as my token of appreciation.

162
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,720
There are countless rare treasures in Fenghua Valley.

163
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,439
Do you think there's still something that I would want?

164
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,379
What are you doing?

165
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,539
I'll smash this piece.

166
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,140
Then I'll find a better one for you. Won't this be good?

167
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,540
You're really good at this. You have a promising future.

168
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,980
I heard that you even have designs on my Xiao Bai.

169
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,459
And now you want to smash my possession.

170
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,779
I just wanted to thank you.

171
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,139
Forget it then. I won't smash it.

172
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:37,679
Give it to me.

173
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,020
I can agree to help you save him.

174
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,100
- But I have a condition.
- I'm at your command.

175
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,800
You will stay a full year in Fenghua Valley and not leave at all.

176
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,559
You...

177
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,279
What are you wanting to do?

178
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,419
Did I really cling to you in the past life, and now you've decided to take me?

179
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:01,980
Stop your nonsense. Put away your obsessive fantasies.

180
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,340
Sure. If you want, I can stay in Fenghua Valley. But won't you tell me the reason?

181
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,059
Out of curiosity as a physician, I'd like to solve the puzzles in your body.

182
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,939
You want to research my body?

183
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:22,759
Why are you still holding on to whatever secrets I have? What is it about me that's worth researching?

184
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:26,640
- Besides, isn't a year too long?
- You don't agree?

185
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,979
- Perfect. I don't want to save him anyway.
- You...

186
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,500
Stop.

187
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,100
A good dog does not block the road.

188
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,500
Are you simply wanting to research me?

189
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,600
Of course.

190
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,700
How can anyone not be curious after hearing your story? I am going along with your wish.

191
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,520
Since you won't regret until you fail, I'm just doing my duty as a physician.

192
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,080
You don't have any ulterior motive?

193
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,319
I don't have any motive toward you.

194
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:02,180
That's perfect.

195
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,539
I also don't dare to have any motive toward you.

196
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,139
Stop.

197
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,500
Come here.

198
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,219
Come here.

199
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:24,700
As long as you save him, I will definitely come to stay a full year in Fenghua Valley.

200
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,340
Can't I take a stroll for now?

201
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,840
You beg me to save someone, but you don't want to do any work?

202
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,400
And you even want to stay and eat for free in the valley for a year?

203
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,600
There's no free lunch. Hold this.

204
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,260
Follow me closely.

205
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,300
Hold it well. You can't afford paying for it if it's broken.

206
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,700
You...

207
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,299
I was scolded by Valley Master again yesterday.

208
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:50,480
Why were you so careless?

209
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,260
♫ But emotions still make people unable to let go ♫

210
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,480
♫ We love and want to kill each other, but yet it’s him who I can’t part with ♫

211
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,460
♫ After going through life and death several times, there is nothing more to worry about ♫

212
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,570
♫ But in the eyes, I can find my answer ♫

213
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:13,410
♫ Without you, without me, who will care about the world? ♫

214
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,520
♫ The bright moonlight against the red sunset in the sky ♫

215
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,870
♫ The boy in white and the heroine in red in the Mortal World ♫

216
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,750
♫ In this life, I’ll accompany you to roam this world ♫

217
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,790
♫ Our unwavering longing goes in full cycle a few times ♫

218
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,080
♫ Several times life and death in the Martial Arts World crushes like waves into the sand ♫

219
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,180
♫ Destined to meet you is destined to spend time with you ♫

220
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,159
Are you all right?

221
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,360
Aren't you a miracle physician? Why are you like this?

222
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,660
I...

223
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,159
I... I'm not dying.

224
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,059
Why are you like this?

225
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,559
I'm also hurting.

226
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,020
What's the matter? Where do you hurt?

227
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,900
My head hurts. Am I going to die?

228
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:50,699
You... You don't need to worry about me.

229
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,600
It doesn't matter if I die. You must not die.

230
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,119
Valley Master! Valley Master!

231
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,819
Here.

232
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,900
Give it to her.

233
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,259
Miss Ye!

234
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:26,959
Help her.

235
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:51,399
You're awake? Does your head still hurt?

236
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,999
What happened to you just now? I thought you were about to die.

237
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,480
Don't curse me.

238
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:03,960
I thought I was dying.

239
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,119
I'm not dead, why would you die? Am I a miracle physician just to look at?

240
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,739
Have you seen enough?

241
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:20,640
What happened to you just now? It looked so scary.

242
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,799
If you've seen enough, just go back to your room.

243
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,519
Uncle Hui, I've recovered. Do I still have to take the medication?

244
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,680
It's not for you.

245
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,959
- I'm all right now. I won't drink it.
- No.

246
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,000
It's a serious matter when the remaining toxin is not cleared.

247
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,279
Besides, this is your own prescription.

248
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:54,240
So you don't like the bitter taste, either.

249
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,219
Those who don't know will think you are drinking poison.

250
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,679
Strange. Are you poisoned?

251
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,699
How did you get poisoned?

252
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:07,200
Can you please hurry and leave?

253
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,960
Whether I'm poisoned or not has nothing to do with you.

254
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,699
We are not strangers. It's fine, you don't need to pretend.

255
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,780
What… What is this poison in you? Hurry and tell me.

256
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,580
Who is not a stranger to you?

257
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,559
- I...
- Miss Ye, quit asking questions. Let's go. Let's go.

258
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:24,400
- But what happened to him? How did he get poisoned?
- Don't ask anymore. Let's go. Let's go.

259
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,760
Uncle Hui.

260
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:31,599
What is really going on?

261
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,979
If you don't tell me, I'm going to force Yang Ke to tell me.

262
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:41,359
It's none other than developing the Nine Turn Resurrection Pill to detoxify Tang Huan.

263
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,060
This antidote is very complex. You wouldn't understand even if I tell you.

264
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,659
Valley Master isn't totally certain, either.

265
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:50,680
That's why he is testing it on himself.

266
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,000
You are saying he is taking the poison himself in order to save Tang Huan?

267
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,839
To say it accurately, he is saving Tang Huan for you.

268
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,980
Bai Yue, are you crazy?

269
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,019
To save people, you don't need to sacrifice so much.

270
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:14,100
I do want you to save him, but I didn't want you to sacrifice your life.

271
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,599
Are you doing this to make me feel quilty?

272
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:24,359
When you do this, how can I believe that nothing ever happened between us before?

273
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,599
In fact, you don't dislike me, do you?

274
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,799
So what if anything had happened?

275
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:35,280
Uncle Hui, why don't you persuade him not to do something so stupid?

276
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,680
His temper is just as eccentric as his medical skills.

277
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,319
Who can persuade him?

278
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,200
But you, Miss Ye, why are you so agitated?

279
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,180
Don't forget, you brought Tang Huan here, and you begged Valley Master to save him.

280
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,319
If an antidote isn't developed, he will die.

281
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:54,960
Which is more important to you?

282
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:57,240
I...

283
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,680
Don't tell me. You should think it over yourself.

284
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Valley Master, allow me to say something I shouldn't.

285
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,519
If you aren't 100 percent sure, so what?

286
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,319
You've already been 100 percent sincere.

287
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,739
If you can't save that rascal, Miss Ye won't blame you.

288
00:21:55,739 --> 00:22:02,020
If anything were to happen to you, look at how she reacted last night. She would go crazy.

289
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,979
Uncle Hui,

290
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,359
are you very idle today?

291
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,760
No, anyone with eyes can see it.

292
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,860
I can tell.

293
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,720
Uncle Hui, since you are clear-eyed and careful,

294
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,019
will you consider helping me take care of that Flower of One Thousand Pains?

295
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:26,419
I'm getting old and someone thinks I'm nagging.

296
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,399
Is this your book?

297
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,459
Why do you have it?

298
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:08,359
I found it.

299
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,599
How did you know it's mine?

300
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,319
Only you would read this kind of cheap storybooks.

301
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:16,659
How can you call them cheap storybooks?

302
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:19,519
Just look at the book.

303
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,160
Besides, in the Fenghua Valley, we only have medical ingredients or medicine skills.

304
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,279
Only you would bring this kind of cheap storybooks here.

305
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,720
Let me discuss something with you.

306
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,079
Can you let me borrow the book again?

307
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,440
I'm not lending.

308
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,860
So stingy.

309
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,939
Why are you here?

310
00:23:42,939 --> 00:23:46,380
I found a cheap storybook. It belongs to Miss Ye, and I already returned it to her.

311
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,180
What cheap storybook?

312
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,820
I have no idea. She won't let me see.

313
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,119
Who gave you the permission to cook here?

314
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,820
You're the one who forbids me from entering the kidchen.

315
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,160
Well... Is your body better now?

316
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,279
Last night, you kicked me out without giving any reason.

317
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,439
I ended up worrying all night.

318
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:16,680
How do you feel now?

319
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,780
It's fine already.

320
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,200
Wait, wait, wait.

321
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,000
Wait a moment.

322
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,859
It's fine, but you should take some supplements to restore your primary energy.

323
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:28,419
I especially made that porridge for you.

324
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:40,259
It's for me?

325
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,440
I seriously studied that cookbook you gave me.

326
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,799
Yam, wolfberry, and prickly waterlily added together.

327
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:52,620
It's good for the stomach, liver, kidneys, and your face.

328
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,400
You must be terribly damaged by testing the poison yourself.

329
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,979
So eat more to supplement yourself.

330
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:57,440
And then look at this.

331
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,159
When gorgon is crushed, it's easier to soften when boiled.

332
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,100
How about it? Aren't I caring?

333
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,520
Supplement the kidneys?
(usually it refers to enhancing male vitality)

334
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,480
Did you read too many of Uncle Hui's cheap storybooks?

335
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,399
If you dare to read them again, I'll confiscate all of them.

336
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,200
What's the matter? Are you feeling bad?

337
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,759
Is the toxin still not cleaned up?

338
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:33,839
Valley Master!

339
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,160
Are you all right?

340
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,660
I'm fine.

341
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:41,900
Uncle Hui, is he all right?

342
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,940
What did you tell him just now?

343
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,079
I... I didn't say much.

344
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,200
I cooked porridge for him out of my kindness. He suddenly became that way.

345
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
Be careful that it's hot.

346
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,140
Miss Ye, these are for supplementing kidneys. What are you thinking?

347
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,100
Don't they also nurture the stomach?

348
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,839
Nurture the stomach...

349
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,920
Why don't you try Gingseng Porridge then?

350
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,240
If you don't have ginseng, you can use dangshen instead.
(Dangshen is aka Codonoposis Root)

351
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,900
And then add fuling and ginger. It's best to use short-grained rice.

352
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,179
Once it's cooked, you can take it to Valley Master's room by yourself.

353
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:21,980
I guarantee that he will drink it.

354
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,440
Oh yes, aren't you going to ask about Tang Huan?

355
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,720
He's already awake.

356
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,320
That’s right.

357
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,360
It's great that he's awake.

358
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,679
This porridge won't be wasted.

359
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,459
I'll give it to him.

360
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,940
Uncle Hui, do you want some?

361
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,519
No need. I've been having inflammation.

362
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,939
These medicine shouldn't be wasted either. I'll put them all in.

363
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,160
Thank you, Xiao Xi. You even cooked porridge for me.

364
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,500
Don't be so formal. Valley Master is the one who saved you.

365
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,400
I actually still haven't met Valley Master.

366
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,040
I've told Uncle Hui several times that I want to personally thank Valley Master for saving me.

367
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,440
But Uncle Hui always said that he's in seclusion.

368
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:25,019
To research and develop the antidote for you, he got hurt and needs to recuperate quietly.

369
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:30,019
Oh yes, Xiao Xi. Have you seen the valley master himself?

370
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:32,420
I heard that he never shows his face to people.

371
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,499
He doesn't want to see me, but I have to thank him.

372
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:37,160
Once I go back, I won't be able to express my gratitude.

373
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,859
I can only buy the best incense to pray for his health.

374
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:48,959
Actually, he is the miracle physician Bai Yue who is famous in the Martial Arts World.

375
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,759
I would have never guessed.

376
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,999
So they are the same people.

377
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:58,379
No wonder his medical skills are so fantastic.

378
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:05,359
What are you thinking?

379
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,459
You were in a daze.

380
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:09,580
I was thinking how much I worry about you.

381
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,619
It is said that to go through the traps in Fenghua Valley, you could easily die.

382
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:17,520
Xiao Xi, how did you manage to get through?

383
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,000
I... guess I'm lucky.

384
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,440
I heard that to get the valley master's help, you have to pay a huge price.

385
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,060
How did you manage to do that?

386
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,880
The demand he raised is not too hard to accept.

387
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
You don't need to worry about it.

388
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:40,060
Xiao Xi, how can I not worry?

389
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:44,400
I could never repay you for your benevolence in saving me.

390
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,480
I only want to understand fully the hardships that you've been through,

391
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,700
so that I can constantly remind myself not to ever forget your love for me.

392
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,980
Xiao Xi, can you tell me clearly how you found this place?

393
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,359
How did you enter this place?

394
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,199
And how did you persuade the valley master?

395
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:02,359
I want to know all the details.

396
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:07,199
Everything about you, and everything you've done for me, I want to know about them clearly.

397
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:08,819
There is no rush for that.

398
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:11,280
I'll tell you gradually when we get the time later.

399
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,839
You should get a good rest first.

400
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,939
Xiao Xi, you don't want to tell me anything.

401
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:18,079
Do you not trust me?

402
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,779
It's not that.

403
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,280
The condition that Bai Yu requests is for me to stay in Fenghua Valley to let him research for a year.

404
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,959
Research?

405
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:33,839
He suspects there's a reason for my amnesia.

406
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,580
Out of a physician's curiosity, he wants me to stay for his research.

407
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,659
Is this dangerous?

408
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,240
I don't think os.

409
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,040
You don't need to worry.

410
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,240
Xiao Xi, can you go back to Tang Sect with me first?

411
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,539
I want to announce to the world that I'm marrying you.

412
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,360
You...

413
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,440
You want to marry me?

414
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,140
Yes.

415
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,540
I've already pledged my heart to you.

416
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,519
Now that I've exacted my vengeance, and I'm alive.

417
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,820
What I want to do the most now is to marry you.

418
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,539
Xiao Xi, when we return to Tang Sect, I'll become the lord of the sect.

419
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:17,199
You'll be my wife and won't be the demoness that they talk about.

420
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:19,359
I am going to take good care of you

421
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,699
How about it?

422
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:26,199
But, I promised Bai Yue that I'll stay in the valley.

423
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,599
I know, you should fulfill your promise.

424
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:34,020
Let's do this. Once we are married, you'll return here. I can accompany you, too.

425
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:39,099
Xiao Xi.

426
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,739
I need to go back to cook the porridge. Let's talk more about it after you fully recover.

427
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:55,259
Xiao Xi...

428
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,759
Bai Yue, I need to discuss something with you.

429
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:46,799
I cooked another kind of porridge for you. Will you eat it?

430
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,299
No.

431
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,739
Tang Huan wants me to go back to Tang Sect with him.

432
00:31:59,739 --> 00:32:01,920
He just recovered and the journey is long.

433
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,359
It is probably dangerous for him to travel alone.

434
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:08,540
But once I've accompanied back to the Shu land, I'll return to Fenghua Valley.

435
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,400
Tang Huan also wants to announce to the world that he is marrying me.

436
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,800
Do you have to marry now?

437
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,639
Why can't you fulfill our one-year agreement first?

438
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:31,480
Haven't you wondered why Tang Huan wants to marry you?

439
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,959
Maybe it's to get the Storm Pear Flower Needle from you to revive Tang Sect?

440
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:38,160
Why not first find out if he is true to you? It won't delay you.

441
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,240
The Storm Pear Flower Needle was never mine to begin with.

442
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,179
Its rightful place is with Tang Sect.

443
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:48,880
Since you've made up your mind, why come here to discuss it?

444
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,879
I don't have the right to intercede on this matter.

445
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:53,879
But I really think I should ask you first.

446
00:32:53,879 --> 00:33:00,179
I dont' know why, but you seem to be more important than anyone else. I'm mindful of you the most.

447
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:07,940
Although you are always cold and mean to me, but I don't think that's all that you are, far from it.

448
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,780
That's why, if I don't understand the previous fate between us,

449
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:18,420
I seemed to have lost a large part of my heart, or I've missed out on something.

450
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,280
I'll say it again.

451
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,399
What happened between us was only when you begged me to save people.

452
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,419
Your feelings are all misplaced.

453
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:33,520
I saved Tang Huan only for my medical research, that's why I took the risk to try the poison.

454
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:40,700
As to my reminders to you, just think of them as I'm being petty.

455
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,760
Let me ask in a different way.

456
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,599
Do you not have any feelings for me?

457
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,339
Do you know why all of the successive Fenghua Valley Master never marry?

458
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:59,440
Because no mortal woman can match up to them.

459
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:06,400
It's like the fairies in Heaven and the insects on Earth can never be together.

460
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,319
Do you really have to describe it so harshly?

461
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:15,940
I am in my prime, there is probably no mortal woman who can match up to me.

462
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,280
♫ Leaving clues in the melody of the zither, no one can hear my thoughts  ♫

463
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,580
No one can match up to you.

464
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,939
Then, I'll wish you to live long and alone.

465
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,560
You are the fairy in Heaven, and you don't understand the hustle and bustle in the mortal world.

466
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,179
Of course, you don't care about this bowl of porridge.

467
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,839
But I am also not an insect that can be looked down by anyone.

468
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,980
I'm giving up on you.

469
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,879
Let's bid our farewells.

470
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:55,780
I will definitely find my soulmate to grow old with.

471
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:04,160
♫ Unrequited love leaps into reincarnation to pursue the beloved  ♫

472
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,820
♫ How can love be drawn like the moon but missing a piece from the circle? ♫

473
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:18,730
♫ I'll write a preface for you, a moment of fireworks ♫

474
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:25,110
♫ How do we stay together when you didn't come with me? ♫

475
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:31,970
♫ I'm willing to pledge my life for unwavering love in the unpredictable future  ♫

476
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:38,700
♫ Sadness and joy are silent in the vast sea while Mountains and rivers have you in their hearts ♫

477
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,960
♫ Even if love connects our hearts to keep you in my dreams ♫

478
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,660
Ye Xi...

479
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,900
The Fenghua Valley Master is cursed.

480
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:53,020
If I don't abstain from personal love, I will die of extreme pain.

481
00:35:53,939 --> 00:36:00,480
But inexplicably, whenever I am in pain, you also feel the pain.

482
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:08,179
I must break our ties because I don't want you to suffer because of me.

483
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:13,239
Furthermore, it's because you want to have a lifetime companion,

484
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,460
while I am fated not to be able to grow old with you.

485
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:29,640
♫ The years don't hold on to the memories  ♫

486
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,919
Why don't you get into the carriage first?

487
00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:36,180
Thank you.

488
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,419
You're welcome. Miss Ye, take it easy on the way.

489
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:39,919
All right.

490
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,920
Let's leave now.

491
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:53,760
It's really hard to leave Fenghua Valley.

492
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,159
Oh yes, Xiao Xi.

493
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,620
Will you regret leaving it in order to come with me?

494
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,679
Don't worry.

495
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,840
I always do what I've promised.

496
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:09,960
Although Fenghua Valley is nice, it doesn't suit me.

497
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,779
If I carelessly break something in there, I can't afford to repay it.

498
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,519
Even a chess board is made of a 1,000-year-old Torreya Grandis wood.

499
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:22,020
An acupuncture chart is drawn from the paper made in Chengxin Pavilion that's never shown to the world.

500
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,360
I don't want to stay indebted for my whole life.

501
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,260
Let's go.

502
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,739
Valley Master!

503
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,840
She is leaving now, but you are still here?

504
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,760
- You should hurry out to take a look.
- This is not my book.

505
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,079
Don't worry about it.

506
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,580
I just want to ask you, are you not going to follow this time?

507
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,400
Do you want her to take a risk?

508
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,219
- In the end, you'll still be the one who regrets it.
- Enough.

509
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:06,719
You're so nagging.

510
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,079
Send a letter to Chu Yao.

511
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,979
Inquire about his recent situation.

512
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:13,539
But... Why am I sending a letter to Young Master Chu?

513
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:15,539
Valley Master! Valley Master!

514
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,410
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

515
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:34,940
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

516
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:41,170
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

517
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,980
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

518
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,380
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

519
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:58,260
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

520
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:04,140
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

521
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:10,090
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

522
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:15,900
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

523
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,730
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

524
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:27,610
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

525
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:33,520
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

526
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,320
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

527
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:48,080
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

528
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:58,050
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
