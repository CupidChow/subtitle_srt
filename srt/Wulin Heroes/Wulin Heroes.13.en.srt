♫ I just came from the forest not yet awake looking like a ginseng fairy ♫

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,940
♫ I’m full of skills, I broke into the Martial Arts World alone ♫

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,600
♫ I believe in destiny, looked everywhere but nobody specified what it is ♫

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,770
♫ Once again, I have hope and expectation of love yet who is my destiny is unknown ♫

6
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,750
♫ See, turns out that destiny has always been waiting for me ♫

7
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,710
♫ I believe that love really exists ♫

8
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:52,050
♫ Take a look at me, I’m open and candid, careful, and never doubting love ♫

9
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:59,350
♫ Although I fan the flames and cause trouble everywhere, I came to the world just to ask about the whereabouts of love ♫

10
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,510
♫ How do I find the ripple effect of my destiny? ♫

11
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,790
♫ What are the consciences of the proud me? ♫

12
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,180
♫ Why bother worrying too much? ♫

13
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,180
♫ I just know that wherever I go, you will be there with me ♫

[Episode 13]

16
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,779
How dare you send men to steal poison!

17
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,280
You promised her that you wouldn't harm the innocent!

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,879
I promised not to raze Tang Sect to the ground, but I didn't say I'll spare them!

19
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,339
I'm just giving them a taste of their own medicine!

20
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:06,319
You don't know a thing!

21
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,359
Tang Huan consumes arsenic daily, so he must have the antidote.

22
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:18,739
If you do this, you'll just be harming innocent folks.

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,780
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

24
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,380
Who knew you would do it secretly?

25
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,400
You didn't even use your brain before you took action.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,760
Tang Sect excels in the use of poisons.

27
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,819
- Men!
- Present!

28
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,600
Stop!

29
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,260
- Xiao Shan.
- Present.

30
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,060
How are you? Is it...

31
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,759
Immediately deploy the Black Armored Guards to raze them to the ground!

32
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,159
- Yes!
- Your Highness!

33
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,199
Don't be impulsive. Calm down.

34
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,580
I also detest Tang Sect.

35
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,599
But when you are too quick to raze someone's place,

36
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,000
it's not good for the peace and harmony in the Martial Arts World.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,419
I know you care about all the people in the world.

38
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:07,880
Everyone sees how you treat the people.

39
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,439
It's not your style to kill indiscriminately.

40
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,779
It's an exception this time.

41
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:15,699
Be calm, Your Highness. You really don't understand women.

42
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,479
Ye Xi already said she wants to exact the revenge on her own.

43
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,360
She also has the capability to revenge.

44
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,360
How can you take away the chance for her to revenge by herself?

45
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,760
Don't you agree?

46
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,319
Forget it.

47
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,880
- All of you, stand down.
- Yes!

48
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,860
Miss.

49
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,020
Are you hungry?

50
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,780
Eat a little.

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,280
Here.

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,990
I'll do it myself.

53
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:15,120
- What is this?
- Ginseng and Bird's Nest.

54
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,839
I'm wrong. It's Panax Ginseng.

55
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,379
His Highness couldn't find ginseng anywhere. This is the best he could get.

56
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:24,859
Are you not used to it, Miss Ye?

57
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:29,339
- Take it away. Take it away.
- Yes.

58
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,439
Why didn't she eat it?

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,040
Miss Ye didn't want to eat it.

60
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,620
Do you dare to defy my order?

61
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,820
- We wouldn't dare.
- We wouldn't dare.

62
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,360
Why are you angry with them when I don't eat?

63
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,339
You are injured, and your primal force is exhausted.

64
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,439
You need to take supplements.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,960
From now on, you must watch Miss finish eating it for all three meals every day.

66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,500
- Yes.
- Yes.

67
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,600
What?

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,719
I have to eat this for all three meals every day?

69
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,339
That's right.

70
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,359
This would be even more unbearable than the food in Fenghua Valley.

71
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:23,839
- I'm not eating it.
- Don't be so willful.

72
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,560
If Miss doesn't eat it, you will keep kneeling and not even get up when your legs are broken.

73
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,527
Why don't you break my legs?

74
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:36,320
Don't say nonsense. I'm only doing it for your sake.

75
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,739
When I hear those words, I just can't stand it.

76
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:51,860
The way you are now, It really makes my heart ache.

77
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,519
Your body needs to be greatly supplemented.

78
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,000
Too bad here isn't any of the best old ginseng.

79
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,239
I'm experiencing backlash.

80
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,040
No supplement can help.

81
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,639
What... What backlash?

82
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,939
I...

83
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:18,839
Forget it.

84
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,620
I'm tired and want to sleep.

85
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,520
All of you can leave for now.

86
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,300
- You can leave.
- Yes.

87
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,399
A-Aren't you leaving?

88
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,700
You want to watch me sleep?

89
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,600
I'll watch you fall asleep.

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,179
I won't let you out of my sight.

91
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,200
When we, a single man and a single woman, stay in a room by ourselves, don't you think this is a bad idea?

92
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,448
It is just a room.

93
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:54,619
It's not like we didn't sleep in the same bed before.

94
00:06:56,679 --> 00:07:00,079
I'm afraid that other people will think differently.

95
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,899
Who would dare?

96
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,639
After you recover, I'll take you back to the capital.

97
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,219
I've already suppressed the turmoil.

98
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:12,660
The entire royal court is under my control now.

99
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,099
I am going to give you the grandest and most luxurious wedding in view of the whole world.

100
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:20,060
I'll make you the most powerful and noble woman in the world.

101
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,199
Wait. Stop, stop.

102
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:26,859
Do you mean you're going to marry me?

103
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:28,720
I used to always let you get your way.

104
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,077
I missed out too much already.

105
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:32,760
I've finally understood.

106
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,779
To keep you, I have to forcibly marry you.

107
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,543
You are taking advantage of my time of peril.

108
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,419
You are injured. No wonder you have a little temper.

109
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,700
It's fine.

110
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,760
It's all good as long as we are together.

111
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,980
You'd better shut up!

112
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,480
I don't want to be a princess consort.

113
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,360
Isn't it good to be the princess consort?

114
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,600
Unless, you want to be the empress?

115
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:08,480
If you want to be emperor, that's your business and has nothing to do with me.

116
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,979
Even if you want to make me Empress of Heaven, I still wouldn't be interested.

117
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:19,640
For me, I just want to be an ordinary, good woman.

118
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,900
Wrong.

119
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,820
Even if I'm married, I'll still be a good young woman.

120
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:30,739
I'll live the most ordinary married life.

121
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,559
About that, you understand, don't you?

122
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,420
In fact, no one likes to be forced.

123
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,820
For me, I only want the freedom to choose.

124
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,179
If this freedom must be used to exchange,

125
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:03,060
it's like putting my life on someone's blade.

126
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,000
Do you understand now?

127
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,399
Xiao Xi, don't worry.

128
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,819
Other than me, no one can force you to do anything.

129
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,020
You must be tired.

130
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,020
Sleep now.

131
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,939
I understand.

132
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:23,020
After going through those nightmarish experiences, you must be afraid of sleeping alone.

133
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,639
I'll stay with you.

134
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,900
You won't be afraid of anything then.

135
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,000
No, no...

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,919
Why don't you understand?

137
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,340
I'm not afraid, nor do I need you. Hurry and leave!

138
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,960
From this moment on, I will stay close to protect you, not even a step away.

139
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,600
I'll bring the best of everything to you.

140
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,300
But in your eyes and heart, there can only be one person.

141
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,820
That's me.

142
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,600
Let me tell you this. If it weren't for the fact that I can't fight over you—

143
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,619
Go ahead. You can hit me all you want. I won't fight back.

144
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,659
You aren't speaking, so you agree?

145
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,219
Go ahead and sleep.

146
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,920
I wonder how Ye Xi is now.

147
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:41,600
The wind is howling, so chilly is the Yi River!
(verse from ancient poem "Farewell by Yi River")

148
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,622
Ye Xi needs our help. Come, let's go take a look.

149
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:52,200
Why aren't you asleep yet?

150
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:59,600
You are pacing back and forth. How can I sleep?

151
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,579
I'll sit down to watch you sleep then.

152
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,740
[Speak and Act with Impartiality]

153
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,919
Our eldest miss wants to go in to see Miss Ye.

154
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,700
No one is allowed inside without His Highness' order.

155
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,279
That... sounds like Xiao Xiao.

156
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,319
She must need me on something. Let her in.

157
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,780
- Let her in.
- Yes.

158
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,760
- Hanzi, wait for me here.
- Yes.

159
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,459
Why did you come here?

160
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:38,259
I... I couldn't sleep.

161
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:42,940
Perfect! I can't sleep, either.

162
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,600
I want to take a bath first. I feel sticky all over.

163
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,960
You are covered in wounds, so you can't touch water.

164
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,200
Your Highness, you don't understand it.

165
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,700
For a woman, even if she's lost an arm or a leg, she still wants to take a bath.

166
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,199
All right. I'll get the water ready for you.

167
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:07,740
Wait, wait, wait...

168
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,259
I need flowing water so that my wounds won't get infected.

169
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,159
I happened to see a hot spring in the mountain out back.

170
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,120
- Really?
- Yes.
- Hurry and take me there.

171
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,640
- Let's go.
- I can't wait. Go, go, go.

172
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,120
No...

173
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,800
What's the matter? I'm taking a bath, and you'll still follow me?

174
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,759
- If anything happens to her—
- I'll be right there.

175
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,080
I guarantee nothing will happen to her. She wouldn't even lose one strand of hair.

176
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,480
Go.

177
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,560
Go slowly.

178
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,260
Stop, stop, stop! Put me down.

179
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,740
What's wrong? We aren't there yet.

180
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:20,159
This is good. Thanks.

181
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,200
What are you doing? We aren't there yet.

182
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,759
I think I hear the sound of water.

183
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,479
It should be nearby. I can walk on my own.

184
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:31,610
But... are you all right with your injuries?

185
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,039
- Are you really going to bathe?
- What else will I do?

186
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,100
All right then. When you go back after taking the bath, remember to let Bai Yue apply new medication on you.

187
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,520
Can you help me escape from Cang Qi?

188
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,859
My guards can't overcome the Black Armored Guards.

189
00:13:55,859 --> 00:14:01,119
Even if I use my Tyrant Shooter to hold him by surprise,

190
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,479
you still can't get away with such severe injuries.

191
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:08,199
It's best to wait for Bai Yue heal your injuries first, then you can make a plan.

192
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,300
What you say makes sense.

193
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,480
I'll go back in a while, then.

194
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,020
Then... why do you want to run away?

195
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,480
Unless, he wants to do something to you?

196
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:28,520
No. It's not that he isn't good to me, but he is too good to me.

197
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,620
I don't know if you understand how it feels.

198
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,820
It's like, you're not cold,

199
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,659
but someone thinks it's very cold at night and insists on putting a heavy coat on you.

200
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:40,960
Will you be touched?

201
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,919
I will slap him on the face. I don't need him to decide whether I feel cold.

202
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,059
Beautiful! You think exactly like I do.

203
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:53,100
Thank you, but you should go back first.

204
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,880
But, you really don't need my help?

205
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:03,419
Although we are both women, but it's still not convenient.

206
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:05,720
All right. You can go down that way.

207
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,659
Be careful by yourself.

208
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,259
Hanzi, wait here. Go there when she calls for you.

209
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,679
Yes.

210
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:34,720
[Speak and Act with Impartiality]

211
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,920
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

212
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,140
- Where is Bai Yue?
- He should be taking a bath in his room.

213
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,599
That Young Master Chu insisted on coming out and going back in several times already.

214
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:48,260
I've no idea what he was doing.

215
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,559
Forget about them.

216
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,679
Miss Lin and the others went to the hot spring in the back mountain. Should we get more guards to protect them?

217
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,100
Don't get too close! Wait at the foot of the mountain.

218
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,459
- Don't allow anyone to go in, either.
- Yes.

219
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,780
This water isn't deep. Why are you screaming for no reason?

220
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,480
Why are you here?

221
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,580
Can't you sleep without tempting death?

222
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,459
I should be asking you why you're here!

223
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:49,059
Isn't he at your side all day and all night?

224
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:52,919
When you sneak out here late at night, do you know how worried I'll be?

225
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,680
I'm worried sick that you'll choke to death on food or die from a scalded tongue when drinking water.

226
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,639
Look where you are now. Are you trying to drown here?

227
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:02,000
What's the point of being so frazzled? Why are you so worried about me?

228
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,179
That's because he'll pin your death on me if I can't cure you.

229
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:07,279
My medical skills aren't lacking.

230
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,380
You're just bent on torturing yourself.

231
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,039
The best method is to knock you out cold. Otherwise, even the best Miracle Physician can't cure you.

232
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,799
Wait, you're mistaken! I'm terrified of death.

233
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,300
I want to recover quickly, but I just need the right method.

234
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,780
Method? What method? Sneaking out here in the dead of the night?

235
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,499
Are you trying to absorb the spiritual energy of the world and the essence of the planets?

236
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:28,799
How did you know?

237
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,000
I reckon you should find a spot to bury your head. Let's see if you can sprout a new head.

238
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,419
Why are you so all-knowing?

239
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,419
I'm feeling cold.

240
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,899
That's because you lost too much blood.

241
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:46,119
Hold on!

242
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,160
What are you doing?

243
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,259
Bai Yue!

244
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,980
Is he angry or embarrassed?

245
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,920
Is his itch acting up again?

246
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,359
When I touched him back then, he had the same reaction.

247
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,100
Is his ailment really related to me?

248
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,780
What's wrong with you? Did you—

249
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,419
S-Stop! This tea...

250
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:46,220
That's good tea. Drinking more will do you good.

251
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,280
Should I get you a physician?

252
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,979
Let me take a look.

253
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,299
Y-You're fine? Are you sure?

254
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,940
What tea is this?

255
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,879
Longjing tea.

256
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,659
Why does it taste like this again?

257
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:24,620
What ginseng is this? There's even Bird's Nest in this.

258
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,419
If you refuse such fantastic supplements, I'll finish it for you.

259
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,259
I'm planning to hire someone to write a storybook.

260
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,700
It'll be based on you.

261
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,440
The story will narrate how you were manipulated by Tang Huan,

262
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,580
betrayed by him, and then almost killed by him.

263
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,830
The title should be

264
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:52,319
"Sobering from A Dream: A Romance in the New Chaotic Age of Tang".

265
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,279
After that, I'll distribute it widely

266
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:58,060
and warn our fellow women in the Martial Arts World. What do you think?

267
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,119
Are you trying to rub salt into my wound?

268
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,240
I'm trying to caution women in the Martial Arts World!

269
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,750
It's to help them identify the lies and ploys of men.

270
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:12,400
So, it's important to relate the process of how you were deceived.

271
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,640
As for revenge, not everyone is as capable as you are.

272
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,900
So, it's far better for them to keep their distance and be cautious.

273
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,000
But...

274
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,440
won't I seem very dumb?

275
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,059
Storybooks are all exaggerations.

276
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:35,400
In order to prevent more women from falling prey to devious men,

277
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,299
why don't you make a small sacrifice?

278
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:39,799
Why must I be the one to sacrifice myself?

279
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,000
That's because...

280
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,619
I've never encountered a devious man before.

281
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:47,680
Your luck is horrible.

282
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,540
You've met three scumbags one after another.

283
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,899
Can't you be gentler with your words?

284
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,160
I'm feeling unjust for you!

285
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:01,440
How unfortunate must one be to suffer such a fate?

286
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,119
Since you've survived such a bloody past, you should share your experiences.

287
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,920
Don't be so petty.

288
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,650
Lin Xiaoxiao! Are you even my good friend?

289
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,880
I am! I'm being so blunt because you're my friend!

290
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,060
Pleasantries are saved for strangers.

291
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,579
You...

292
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,480
Women are truly more vicious than men! Get out!

293
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,147
A quarrel always works best.

294
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,719
Even I'm feeling relieved.

295
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:38,900
Bai Yue said you've longed for a marriage celebration.

296
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,379
After such a traumatic experience, you didn't even cry or make a fuss.

297
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:45,839
Yet, you don't seem quite right either.

298
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,759
He's afraid that you're bottling up your anger.

299
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,959
This frustration will plague you and affect your recovery.

300
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,480
That's why he asked me to think of a solution

301
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,480
to help you vent your anger.

302
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,759
Look. You were bed ridden moments ago.

303
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,164
Now, you're sitting up!

304
00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:09,060
Do you feel better?

305
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:17,300
What's on his mind? Does he even understand what I feel?

306
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,259
Nonetheless, thank you.

307
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:22,240
There's no need to thank me!

308
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,490
Bai Yue... owes me another favor.

309
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,380
H-H-Hold on!

310
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,000
Can you eat outside? The smell is making me nauseous.

311
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'll be done soon.

312
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,920
Your Highness. Tang Sect has sent a letter.

313
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,380
The sect lord wishes to speak with you in person.

314
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,340
This concerns Miss Ye's secret.

315
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,379
I can't be blamed if he's digging his own grave.

316
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,920
Make sure you keep this a secret from the princess consort.

317
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,000
When I return to the capital, I'll marry her.

318
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,599
Congratulations to Your Highnesses and Princess Consort.

319
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,160
I'll make arrangements to ensure that he dies here.

320
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,380
- Leave.
- Before His Highness left, he ordered us to stay by Your Highness's side at all times.

321
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,960
Your Highness?

322
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,794
Don't call me what I'm not.

323
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,920
My head hurts! I can't breathe!

324
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,319
So many of you are surrounding me! You're blocking the ventilation.

325
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:59,880
Well, we...

326
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,559
Didn't you hear her? Her head hurts so badly, she can't breathe.

327
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:07,920
If she really loses her life, your prince won't spare you.

328
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,899
Is it easier to breathe now?

329
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,720
Can you undo this white cloth?

330
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,119
If you do so, I'll be able to breathe normally.

331
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:49,700
You soaked in the medicinal bath last night and applied medicinal ointment.

332
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,240
You have to wrapped up like this.

333
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,199
The medicine used on you is worth thousands of gold coins. Not a single bit should be wasted.

334
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,039
Did you help me change into these clothes?

335
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,019
I remember falling asleep in the bath.

336
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:09,919
Wake up from that nonsense.

337
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,680
You should thank Lin Xiaoxiao's guards for carrying you back.

338
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,160
As for the medicine, others were vying to help apply that.

339
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,640
No one could even intervene.

340
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,699
I have no desire to be the princess consort.

341
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,700
I much rather be a demoness.

342
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,380
They're driving me mad.

343
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,899
They force me to eat things I don't want to eat.

344
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,960
I'm starting to miss the food at Fenghua Valley.

345
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,159
You can't move right now, so you should resign to being a puppet.

346
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:48,300
I can't move right now, but you can't feed me medicine with your mouth.

347
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,979
I'm pretty sure you didn't hurt your organs. Your brain is the damaged part.

348
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,800
By the way,

349
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,380
your strange ailment acted up yesterday.

350
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,480
Does it still itch?

351
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,259
Keep an eye on her and make sure she finishes the medicine.

352
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,259
Yes.

353
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,000
- Your Highness!
- I need to speak to you!

354
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,960
- Your Highness, finish the medicine.
- Be good and finish it.

355
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,940
- You'll be fine after finishing the medicine.
- I don't want to! Get lost!

356
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,400
Your Highness, it's our honor that you're in Shu.

357
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,119
I haven't been a good host.

358
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,119
Cut the crap.

359
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:53,790
Your Highness, I heard that you were merciless in suppressing evil and opposition.

360
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,479
I'm willing to offer the Storm Pear Flower Needle and formula for making Thunder Bombs to you.

361
00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:02,360
With these two treasures, your Black Armored Guards are bound to be unbeatable.

362
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,419
Is that all you wished to say?

363
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:06,619
There is more about Ye Xi.

364
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:10,620
The assassination ploy in the guise of marriage wasn't my plan.

365
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,399
I was under the pressure of fellow martial artists.

366
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:17,140
I just stepped up as the sect lord, but there are millions of things waiting to be done.

367
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:21,759
As long as you're willing to support Tang Sect, I'll divulge some secrets to you.

368
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:28,039
The Miracle Physician, Bai Yue, who saved Ye Xi is the elusive valley master of Fenghua Valley.

369
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,539
Word has it that Fenghua Valley has fortunes equal to an entire kingdom.

370
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:34,440
Generations of valley masters have amassed treasures.

371
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,520
Ye Xi has a secret book titled Scripture of Materia Medica.

372
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm sure you've heard of it.

373
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,559
The previous crown prince coveted this scripture.

374
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,259
That's why he killed her.

375
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:50,019
Apparently, that scripture has the formula for longevity and energy nourishment.

376
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,020
I'll give you one last chance.

377
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,180
What do you want to say?

378
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,419
Ye Xi and Bai Yue must have an unspeakable relationship!

379
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:02,359
My guess is that the scripture comes from Fenghua Valley.

380
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,580
I heard that the valley has a idyllic underground palace.

381
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,499
Bai Yue has only taken Ye Xi in there.

382
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:10,720
They even spent a long time there.

383
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:16,610
Your Highness, don't you want those treasures and that scripture?

384
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,040
However, you just quelled an uprising and can't stir a fuss.

385
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,440
Tang Sect is willing to be your pawns and work in the shadows.

386
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,760
Your Highness.

387
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,100
Your Highness!

388
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,279
The Storm Pear Flower Needle is in here.

389
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,219
I'll present it to you first.

390
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,960
You're a resourceful man.

391
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,240
I believe that you'll have the capability to find the disciple of Lu Ban and open the box.

392
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,880
Take your pretentious face elsewhere.

393
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:56,639
I'm out of patience.

394
00:29:56,639 --> 00:30:00,940
Do the Storm Pear Flower Needle or Thunder Bombs belong to you?

395
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,500
You snatched those from others. Save your sincere act.

396
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,620
Even I can't find the disciple of Lu Ban, yet you want to find him?

397
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,520
Dream on.

398
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:19,719
Why are you here?

399
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:22,639
I couldn't sleep well last night, so I'm taking a stroll.

400
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,939
You hurt Ye Xi so terribly!

401
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:27,759
Even I want to seek justice and punish you!

402
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,679
Don't force my hand before His Highness!

403
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,960
His Highness can kill you with a snap!

404
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,799
You have no right to be negotiating.

405
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,820
Scram back to Tang Sect or risk getting killed!

406
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,819
Retreat.

407
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,580
I'm furious too.

408
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:06,619
Ruining his pretty face feels good, but let Ye Xi take his life.

409
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:14,380
You won't attack Fenghua Valley, will you?

410
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,459
The world is mine.

411
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:21,499
That puny Fenghua Valley is nothing.

412
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:23,960
Well, why did you...

413
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,860
Ye Xi and Bai Yue.

414
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,419
What is their relationship?

415
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,380
It's as what you've seen.

416
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:56,179
You've never gazed at me like this. I'll think you have feelings for me.

417
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,580
I-I'm talking about camaraderie!

418
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:05,240
T-Talk calmly. Please don't resort to violence.

419
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,160
I know you have loads of questions,

420
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,599
but I'm really clueless. This has nothing to do with me.

421
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,160
The tea you drank yesterday was just Longjing tea with chrysanthemum.

422
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,580
It's meant to cool the inflammation in the body.

423
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,340
Perhaps you just have a short fuse and a riled up spirit.

424
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,419
A physician should inquire into an ailment's roots.

425
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:24,519
I'm sure the source of your frustrations right now

426
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,580
is formulating the fastest method to get Miss Ye out of here.

427
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:36,180
In no time, Miss Ye will be donning marriage robes once more and becoming the princess consort!

428
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,040
You know quite a bit.

429
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,320
Do you have an idea in mind?

430
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,119
Well... I'm well aware of my abilities. Nevertheless, I can divinate a prediction for your future.

431
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:48,499
I might as well help you look into your future.

432
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:51,319
We shouldn't remain in this problematic place.

433
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:54,219
You should leave this place with Lin Xiaoxiao quickly.

434
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:58,539
Once we leave, you'll be left here alone.

435
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:01,019
What unspeakable secrets do you share with Ye Xi?

436
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,239
What did you two do in Fenghua Valley?

437
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:09,300
Your Highness! You can talk, but can you lower your sword first?

438
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,520
If you don't explain yourself today, I'll kill him!

439
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,400
Your Highness, aren't you mistaken?

440
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,666
I'm not involved in this!

441
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:23,239
Exactly, a threat with his life doesn't matter to me.

442
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,840
Darn you!

443
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,900
Your Highness!

444
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,720
T-Thank you.

445
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Why are they in another fight?

446
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,180
Don't ask! Let's run!

447
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,800
You are comrades with him to brave death together! How can you flee by yourself?!

448
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,280
Cang Qi has lost his mind! He's slashing everyone in his path!

449
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,639
Let's not cause more problems! Run and save ourselves from the bloodbath!

450
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,639
- Come on!
- Wait!

451
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,020
Bai Yue! What's that Scripture of Materia Medica? Why does everyone want it?

452
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,220
Stop asking! Let's go!

453
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,839
Miss Ye, you're awake.

454
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,499
- Where's Bai Yue?
- Young Master Bai is...

455
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,100
Fire the arrows!

456
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,180
♫ Day and night, I’ll protect you unconditionally ♫

457
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,600

00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,290

464
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,030

♫ After many upheavals, our love hasn’t diminished ♫
♫ Just like the day we first met ♫

470
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:59,970
♫ With every passing year ♫
♫ Our longings for each other are stacked into eternity ♫

471
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:07,679
♫ The road gradually becomes farther ♫
♫ We will abide by our long-ago promise to be together forever ♫

472
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,779
What did you give me?

473
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:12,079
Xiao Xi! Xiao Xi!

474
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,660
- Summon the imperial physician!
- Yes!

”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

476
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:37,960
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

477
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,270
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

478
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:49,960
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

479
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,400
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

480
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,160
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

481
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:07,060
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

482
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:12,910
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

483
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:18,740
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

484
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:24,660
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

485
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:30,570
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

486
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:36,410
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

487
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:42,430
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

488
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:51,100
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

489
00:37:51,100 --> 00:38:01,940
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
