♫ I’m full of skills, I broke into the Martial Arts World alone ♫

00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:26,470
♫ I believe in destiny, looked everywhere but nobody specified what it is ♫

♫ Once again, I have hope and expectation of love yet who is my destiny is unknown ♫

15
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,890
[Episode 16]

16
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,799
Didn't they say this wine...

17
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,280
Why can't I even find someone to drink the nuptial wine with?

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,339
Didn't they say when you drink this wine, we'll be together forever?

19
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,600
I don't want to drink medicine, I want to drink wine.

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,518
This isn't medicine. It's tea, sobering tea, for the hangover.

21
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,779
It looks like a bitter tea.

22
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:38,080
It doesn't taste bitter at all.

23
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
I still wouldn't drink it even if it isn't bitter.

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,470
I already said I want to drink wine.

25
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,190
I only have medicinal wine here.

26
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:50,060
It has orange peel, wolfberry, Lingzhi mushroom, Poria, and some rootlets from aged ginseng.

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Just stay lying down then.

28
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,130
What are you doing?

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,421
I'm not doing anything.

30
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,096
Your heart is beating so fast.

31
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:26,760
In the storybooks, when lovers secretly meet at night,

32
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,670
the little deer in the heart will jump around.

33
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,819
Is there a little deer in you?

34
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,619
Let go!

35
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,544
I won't let you move.

36
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,339
What drunken things are you saying?

37
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,679
I'm trying to do everything while I'm not sober yet.

38
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:49,879
- What do you want to do?
- Don't be nervous.

39
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,139
I'm doing it for your sake.

40
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,639
This way we can resolve our differences.

41
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,260
Valley Master!

42
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,020
- What are you ding?
- Valley Master is about to die!

43
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,580
Yang Ke, are you ill?

44
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,740
Haven't you learned anything from the storybooks?

45
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,199
You don't understand what happens in the stories?

46
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,620
Miss Ye is drunk. Isn't Valley Master a sheep going to the tiger's lair?

47
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,119
Nonsense. Isn't it just what he longs for?

48
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:24,559
You mean, Valley Master is the tiger?

49
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:27,380
How can you use these terms about tiger and wolf on the valley master?

50
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,040
Be warned that he may come out to beat up you. However,

51
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,820
with the way they are moaning, I think it will take a while before he comes out.

52
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,879
Stop!

53
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,546
Tolerate it a little longer, and I'll be sure.

54
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,339
I remember everything now.

55
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:55,139
You saved me, but I also saved you.

56
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,359
Because I had given you half of my rootlets, that's why I couldn't remember everything when I resuscitated.

57
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:05,539
It's because we have already merged into each other's life.

58
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:08,439
When I touch you here on your body, you'd itch.

59
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,640
When you are injured, I'd get a headache.

60
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,159
It's for the same reason, isn't it?

61
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,480
You are spouting nonsense.

62
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,760
Let go!

63
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:27,339
Are you still itching? Let's try another method.

64
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,759
Let's do this, hold it right there. Let the Qi flow to the core, and close your eyes to concentrate.

65
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,299
Don't make a sound. These are the mantras you taught me.

66
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:32,820
Shut up!

67
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,560
I always listen to you, why wouldn't you listen to me?

68
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,539
Get out!

69
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,079
Trust me. I really know the way to cure your itchiness.

70
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,859
- Here.
- What are you doing?

71
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:47,700
Trust me. It will cure the ailment.

72
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,120
Calm... Calm, calm down.

73
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,160
Calm down. Calm down. Calm.

74
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,439
Impulsiveness is the devil.

75
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,539
But, this...

76
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,240
What's the matter with the two of you? You got along fine just now.

77
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,580
You were even moaning, so why are you fighting now?

78
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,280
Go away!

79
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,339
Fine, fine, fine. Go, go, go.

80
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,739
Let's go.

81
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:12,399
Go, go, go, quickly.

82
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:38,219
Five Spirit Fat hates ginseng.
(dry droppings of flying squirrels)

83
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,279
So that's how it is. Whatever is incompatible with ginseng

84
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,639
can suppress the itching.

85
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,810
This, this tea...

86
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,940
Ginseng?

87
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:07,659
No wonder it's also related to her whenever I itch.

88
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,639
There are trees in the mountain and branches on the trees.

89
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,040
You are in my heart, but you don't know.

90
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,279
Miss Ye, what are you looking at?

91
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,120
You scared me. What are you doing?

92
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,160
Miss Ye, your face looks haggard, the eyes are dull, and there are dark circles around the eyes.

93
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,519
How about I give you the Fenghua Heart Supplement Pill to nourish you? It's a great pill refined by Vally Master himself.

94
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,809
I don't understand, and I won't take it.

95
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,879
By the way, weren't you going to the pagoda for your shift duty today?

96
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,199
Where are you going now?

97
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,419
I'm going to the rear mountain to hoe that plot of barren field.

98
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:59,839
Valley Master said he can go to the pagoda today.

99
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,520
I'm going now.

100
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,499
No wonder he's nowhere to be found. He is at the pagoda.

101
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,439
Get out!

102
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,299
I know you can't sleep.

103
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:32,840
You must have a million questions on your mind.

104
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,280
I'll get my answers in due time.

105
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,519
Get out, right now!

106
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,960
You always pestered me, asking me for my reasons.

107
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,200
Now that you have the chance, why aren't you asking?

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,040
What a fickle man.

109
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,900
Hey, wait!

110
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,039
Let me just say one thing.

111
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,400
There are trees in the mountain and branches on the trees.

112
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,479
You are in my heart, but you don't know.

113
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:00,319
Do you know this poem?

114
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:04,780
Hearing these words from you is leaving a sour taste in my heart and mouth.

115
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,779
Hold on. Think carefully. It's—

116
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,800
You've already uttered three statements.

117
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,320
Leave!

118
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,039
I won't leave tonight.

119
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,359
How can you be so insufferably audacious?

120
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,740
Do you really think you have the upper hand?

121
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,120
You're bent on staying here, aren't you?

122
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,800
I'll leave.

123
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,800
I didn't even do anything! Why did he lose his temper?

124
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,499
That's strange.

125
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:47,960
As the valley master of Fenghua Valley, how can he be clueless about the words on the jade coffin?

126
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,240
[For conscience, one would risk death to give advice.]

127
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,840
I wish I could be like you,

128
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,600
unable to recall a single memory.

129
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,640
How odd.

130
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,779
There's supposed to be an ancient tomb here.

131
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,739
Can it only be accessed with some mechanism?

132
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,120
What are you doing here?

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,720
Is there an ancient tomb in Fenghua Valley?

134
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,420
How do you know about that?

135
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,140
Fenghua Valley itself is a mausoleum.

136
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,640
Fenghua Valley is a mausoleum?

137
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:16,559
I've never seen such an elegant and magnificent mausoleum.

138
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,939
It's exquisite enough to be the imperial tomb of an emperor!

139
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:22,000
Doesn't that mean the valley masters are graveyard keepers?

140
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,160
No wonder you're insistent on celibacy.

141
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,819
If Fenghua Valley is a mausoleum, doesn't that mean there are coffins here?

142
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,360
That's a forbidden area.

143
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,500
It was sealed up after an accident in the distant past.

144
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,279
This underground palace was restored after I stepped up as the valley master.

145
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,000
You've been to that forbidden area, haven't you?

146
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,496
Do you remember a young lady...

147
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,720
Valley Master!

148
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,519
Martial artists are storming the place!

149
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,120
Miss Ye, Valley Master, leave at once.

150
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,320
They've gotten past the magic formations and traps.

151
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,859
They even used Thunder Bombs to demolish the pagoda.

152
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,539
Run! Leave!

153
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,479
Leave now!

154
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,159
Let's go.

155
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:45,919
- Who is it?
- It's Tang Huan.

156
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,759
He's barging in with many martial arts sects I've never heard of.

157
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,820
He's come knocking before I even sought revenge on him!

158
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,931
I'll kill him right now!

159
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,140
This time, they've come prepared to wreak havoc.

160
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,240
They are hollering about exorcizing the demoness,

161
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,939
claiming to be the hand of justice in the martial arts world. Utter bullshit.

162
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:07,579
They're just barbaric bandits.

163
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,920
I was the one who brought him here in the past.

164
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,340
That's how he knows Fenghua Valley's entrance.

165
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,720
Miss Ye, don't blame yourself.

166
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,360
These martial artists have been eyeing Fenghua Valley for ages.

167
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,300
Even without Tang Huan, others would've attacked us.

168
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,200
We have our ways to fend them off.

169
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,920
What methods? Yang Ke already...

170
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,140
You don't get it. This is all my fault.

171
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,559
I should've destroyed all the Thunder Bombs.

172
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,699
Without them, Tang Huan couldn't have demolished the pagoda.

173
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:38,399
Yang Ke wouldn't have...

174
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,479
I have to be responsible for my mistakes.

175
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,579
Yang Ke is fine.

176
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:48,659
It's safer for him to be in the ancient tomb with those injuries.

177
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,919
He'll come out once his injuries are healed.

178
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,719
Uncle Hui also made it clear.

179
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,599
This day was bound to arrive.

180
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,520
They've merely staked everything on this ambush.

181
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,600
Besides, I should face this, not you, as Fenghua Valley's valley master.

182
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,380
What is Fenghua Valley's first tenet?

183
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,399
Everyone should appreciate their lives.

184
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,519
What is the second tenet?

185
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,320
Fight when you can, flee when you can't.

186
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,859
Fine, you all can flee. I'll cover the flank.

187
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,539
I must kill Tang Huan.

188
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,799
A nobleman will get his revenge, even if it takes ten years.

189
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,000
- I'm not a nobleman! I—
- Look at the state we're in.

190
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,260
You have to abide by my instructions.

191
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,140
Fine, I'll let you take charge.

192
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,759
What should we do now?

193
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,320
Flee with the most precious treasures.

194
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,160
They might've blown up the pagoda, but they'll take some time to get in here.

195
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,200
You two can leave first.

196
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,240
I'll lead men to gather the most valuable secret books.

197
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,739
Proceed with great caution. If you can't take those with you, burn them.

198
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:52,740
Where are you going?

199
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,418
I'm going to get something. I'll be really fast.

200
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,140
Keep this in mind. Meet me by the green plum tree.

201
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,379
One more thing. You have to leave with me.

202
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:23,539
Why did you grab this?

203
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:26,240
Didn't you say that the disciple of Lu Ban made this? It's one of a kind!

204
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,519
We're fleeing for our lives, not moving houses!

205
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,515
Come with me.

206
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,860
Fenghua Valley sure is filled with strange contraptions.

207
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,880
Enough talk. Get moving.

208
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,400
Okay.

209
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,100
Move it!

210
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:07,239
Surround the place! Spare no one!

211
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,940
Chase after them!

212
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,220
This way!

213
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,720
I...

214
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,140
Close the door. Let's go.

215
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,200
Move!

216
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,800
Hurry up!

217
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,540
Over there!

218
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,459
Are we really leaving?

219
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,620
- Will Uncle Hui and the rest—
- They won't.

220
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,159
They'll escape through a different route.

221
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:35,239
Since we're fleeing, splitting up is a safer choice.

222
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:37,840
You aren't lying to me, right? We'll see them again, won't we?

223
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,240
I promise. Don't worry.

224
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,879
In that case...

225
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,580
I'll meet Yang Ke again, right?

226
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,659
I promised to have a serious duel with him.

227
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:53,099
Everyone has to reunite, like a family.

228
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,199
Not a single person can be missing.

229
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,299
They treat me really well.

230
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:01,160
In my heart, they're family to me.

231
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:10,279
I'm sorry.

232
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,620
I'm the reason Fenghua Valley is in this state.

233
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:19,359
Will those precious treasures be stolen and divvied up?

234
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,980
You said that you never had family or friends as a child.

235
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,659
Now that you're surrounded by family, shouldn't you be delighted?

236
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,759
Those treasures are just materialistic items.

237
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,480
The valley masters before me loved to squander money.

238
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,240
Now that I get to squander everything in one go, my heart is soaring.

239
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,919
So, don't take this to heart.

240
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,360
Let's go.

241
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,940
I'm just wondering... how I should make it up to you.

242
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,599
That's simple.

243
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,380
If there's an ambush when we get out, you can dash out and beat them up.

244
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,140
Okay.

245
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,680
Don't worry.

246
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,059
I'll definitely charge ahead of you this time.

247
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:03,480
Later on, let me leave first.

248
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,459
- If there's an ambush—
- I'm kidding.

249
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,420
I'm a man! How can I let a lady be my shield?

250
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,639
Didn't you say...

251
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:11,799
It's fine.

252
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,060
Those guys are probably ransacking the place for Fenghua Valley's treasures.

253
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,079
Internal strife might even break out over dividing the loot.

254
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,600
They won't come after us so quickly.

255
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,480
Let's cut the talk. Stay close.

256
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,700
Looks like we're still in the Changliu Mountain area.

257
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,580
You sure are familiar with Changliu Mountain.

258
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,119
What are you planning to do next?

259
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,819
Of course, it's to find some food first before making plans.

260
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,739
Oh, yes.

261
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:50,039
Uncle Hui said you've been following me.

262
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,019
Why won't you answer my question even now?

263
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:55,599
You quietly followed me and helped me a lot.

264
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,509
But you didn't get any thanks.

265
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:00,979
What does it mean that you did all this?

266
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,179
It doesn't need to mean anything.

267
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:06,180
I just wanted to do it.

268
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,419
I'll get a pheasant. You just wait here.

269
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,739
My roasted pheasant is really delicious.

270
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:35,479
Using this famous sword to roast the pheasant is really a sacrilege of treasure.

271
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:38,279
Why didn't you find a branch to be the skewer?

272
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,060
The leaves would also give off a fragrance.

273
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:46,940
Why do you mind what I use as the skewer? If it tastes good, that's good enough.

274
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,800
It smells all right.

275
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:04,479
The taste is not that great.

276
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,380
Next time, find some ginger to stuff into the pheasant's belly.

277
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,280
Before roasting, brash some honey on it.

278
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:19,339
Young Master, we are both down on our luck now. I advise you to be more flexible about what you can eat.

279
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,120
I'm teaching you. You should be humble in accepting the lesson.

280
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,440
Thank you for your guidance, Young Master.

281
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,060
- Are you eating or not?
- Don't you see I'm eating?

282
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,480
You built a pretty good shelter.

283
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,559
Did you build it for me?

284
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,518
Why don't you have a sip of water?

285
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:19,260
Why doesn't your complexion look good?

286
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,680
It's a little chilly at night.

287
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:25,979
This place is after all in Changliu Mountain.

288
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:28,340
It doesn't have the ghost heat in the unmarked burial mounds.

289
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,200
Thinking more about it,

290
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,719
one life is like a fleeting moment.

291
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,559
It's just an instant in time.

292
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,934
Are you cold? How about...

293
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,860
You don't seem to fear the cold.

294
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,739
My body doesn't fear it.

295
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:53,520
But, my heart fears it.

296
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,799
The heart fears the cold because there is no one to keep you warm.

297
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,559
Moreover, there isn't anyone to accompany you for your whole lifetime.

298
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,839
In our lifetime, we can only rely on ourselves.

299
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:17,059
What you say sounds right, but it feels a bit ominous.

300
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,880
But it's already much better than the first time we met.

301
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,019
At that time, you spoke like a poisoned blade.

302
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:26,420
Every word would pierce one's heart.

303
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,340
Uncle Hui said, you treated me harshly at that time

304
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:42,200
because you didn't want me to know that you like me.

305
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:47,019
At at time, I wasn't sure either.

306
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,619
Uncle Hui is really quite visionary.

307
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,820
I used to really want to find the woman in red who saved me in the ancient tomb.

308
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,679
She wore a red dress, and her hair was tied with a red ribbon.

309
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,519
From her back, she looked fragile.

310
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,520
But she turned back without regard to save me.

311
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,700
But I won't search for her anymore.

312
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,939
Why won't you search anymore?

313
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,856
Because the person I was searching for is already right next to me.

314
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,840
But...

315
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:39,199
don't you want to know my secret? Such as...

316
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:43,280
Such as there's an object inside your body.

317
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,520
It was a coincidence that it went from my body to yours.

318
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,349
Is it because of this object that I always recover fast whenever I'm injured?

319
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,279
It even detoxified the remaining toxin that remained in my body from testing medicine. And I never need to take ginseng.

320
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:00,480
And my itchiness is also because of it?

321
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,819
That's right.

322
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,400
It's been sleeping inside your body

323
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,680
until I accidentally touched it, and it started to revive.

324
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,040
Because it sensed my existence, it became energized,

325
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,740
that's why your body felt uncomfortable all over.

326
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,259
It's not what an ordinary person can endure.

327
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,660
So I see.

328
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,600
Since it's so amazing, I'll keep it then.

329
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,620
As long as you can't touch it, it can't do anything anyway.

330
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,419
Don't you want to know who I am?

331
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,079
Are you a monster that eats people?

332
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,359
Of course not.

333
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,059
There you go.

334
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,280
You are you. It doesn't matter who you are.

335
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,940
I want a companion to accompany me

336
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,119
to cherish the warmth and kindness in this world.

337
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,380
It's an ordinary kind of happiness that even immortality can't compare to.

338
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,640
I've been wanting to say this to you for a long time.

339
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,520
But you used to upset me a lot. You never would let me finish talking.

340
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,699
I actually don't have the kind of feelings to Tang Huan as you thought.

341
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,720
How do I explain this?

342
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,919
It's like when you see a little white kitten by the road.

343
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:21,900
It's injured and very pitiful.

344
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,239
So you kindly gave it medical treatment and food.

345
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:27,459
It happened to look cute.

346
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,280
So you couldn't help but pet it a little.

347
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,580
But who knew this cat...

348
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,800
Therefore, you shouldn't touch randomly anymore.

349
00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:46,619
When a cat bites, it's probably its instinct.

350
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:51,220
But in this world, some people are simply

351
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,700
ungrateful.

352
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,919
I know. But I just wanted to explain it clearly.

353
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,639
Are you explaining it to me?

354
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,720
I don't care about it.

355
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,828
You really don't care?

356
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:12,379
Didn't you ask me last time, why is it that the men I met had the word "Tree" in their names?

357
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:16,859
My guess is you must have an endless connection with ginseng.

358
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:19,880
That's why you wanted to get close to those with "Tree."

359
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:29,139
I don't have much wood here.

360
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:32,240
This is a hairpin that I made out of wood.

361
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,919
Hurry and put it on me.

362
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,099
Right now?

363
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,720
♫ A casual glance ♫

364
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,000
♫ has tucked my heartstrings ♫

365
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,150
♫ The fated connection between us ♫

366
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,090
♫ Our story continues on a new chapter ♫

367
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,390
♫ We are destined to meet ♫

368
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,200
♫ The fated red thread already connects us ♫

369
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,479
Does it look pretty?

370
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,900
I think this material doesn't seem to be regular wood.

371
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,220
It's made out of sandalwood. It can repel mosquitoes.

372
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,600
♫ You are the bright starry light ♫

373
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,880
We're fleeing for our lives.

374
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,839
Shouldn't you bring along gold and silver? Why do you have a wooden hairpin on you?

375
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,000
Aren't you already carrying crass things like gold and silver?

376
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,300
Besides, they're too heavy for me to carry around.

377
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,459
Fine, fine, fine. You're absolutely right, Young Master.

378
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,100
Still, this wooden hairpin is worth more than all the gold and silver in the world.

379
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,567
Actually,

380
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,939
you used to have a wooden hairpin.

381
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,139
You just don't remember.

382
00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:00,399
It was... broken.

383
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,839
The past isn't important.

384
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:08,560
I'll make sure to treasure this one.

385
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,800
That's good.

386
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,300
♫ Love continues to grow ♫

387
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,420
♫ My heart calls out for you thousands of times ♫

388
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,010
♫ I hope, in the years going forward ♫

389
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:31,400
♫ Our hearts are always linked ♫

390
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:59,279
This is a Scouting Bee of Five Poison Sect.

391
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,860
Didn't you say that they'll fight over splitting the loot?

392
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,580
Why have they caught up so quickly?

393
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,440
Perhaps they think that we've taken away all the valuable treasures.

394
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,119
Do you remember that scripture with a changed cover?

395
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:16,000
All of them think it can defy death and make one invincible.

396
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,480
For martial artists, something like this is far more tantalizing than wealth.

397
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,799
The book is filled with nonsense.

398
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,879
No explanation can save us now.

399
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:28,360
Let's go.

400
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,520
Stay back.

401
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,280
Leave this to me. You stay back.

402
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,419
Is this club your weapon?

403
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:15,739
How did you spark such a huge fire out of thin air?

404
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:17,440
It's a blessing from Heaven.

405
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,979
Why didn't you make your move earlier?

406
00:30:18,979 --> 00:30:21,420
You wasted my energy.

407
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,959
I'm born with several other godsent gifts that I've never shown to anyone else.

408
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:53,799
If you aren't afraid, let me do the fighting.

409
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,899
What's there for me to fear?

410
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:58,400
Life is pretty merry with your assistance.

411
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,340
From now on, I will risk everything to protect you.

412
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,280
Risk everything?

413
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:10,300
I haven't heard these words from you in a while.

414
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:16,199
Ye Xi, keep this in mind.

415
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:18,580
Never utter such words again.

416
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,420
Not to anyone else, and especially not to me.

417
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,340
You have to promise me this.

418
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,000
If you're ever in a situation

419
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,780
where even your godsent gifts are powerless,

420
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,800
don't be stubborn.

421
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,179
No one and no situation in this world is worth sacrificing your life for.

422
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:43,640
That includes me.

423
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,539
The one you should truly protect is yourself.

424
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:52,599
Don't worry, I have a blessed life of longevity.

425
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:55,420
Let's deal with these pests first.

426
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,799
All right.

427
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,299
Let's go.

428
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,940
By the way, isn't Five Poison Sect in the Miaojiang area?

429
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,500
Yes.

430
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,600
Tang Huan must've roped in many unorthodox sects.

431
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,979
With that many people, they're bound to catch up.

432
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:19,380
Actually, I have even greater abilities to conceal our tracks.

433
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,380
But...

434
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,259
Whatever godsent gifts have their limits.

435
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:28,119
Don't use them so casually.

436
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,660
Listen to me.

437
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,180
Unless you're desperate, don't reveal this ability to others.

438
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,839
If you do, you'll just incur more problems.

439
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,039
I got it.

440
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:45,500
I can defeat them with just my martial arts skills.

441
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,940
Let's go.

442
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,408
Demoness, hand over the Scripture of Materia Medica!

443
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,079
She must've relied on the Scripture of Materia Medica to improve her martial arts skills again.

444
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,779
We have to chase after her! We have an advantage in numbers.

445
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,239
Even the best martial artist will crumble in time.

446
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,599
We can't let this golden opportunity slip through our fingers.

447
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,719
She might really possess supernatural abilities.

448
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,199
Is she really a demon?

449
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,660
Are you an idiot? Who cares what she is?

450
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,308
We just have to make her give up the scripture!

451
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:24,780
Let's go!

452
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:35,979
I thought you'd never threaten to kill.

453
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,820
I rarely deliver lethal blows, but anyone who tries to hurt you will die in my hands.

454
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,540
Did you forget what I told you?

455
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,719
I told you never to reveal such powers to others.

456
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,610
You're bleeding terribly! I can't care about that!

457
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,039
Where is your medicine?

458
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:56,582
We left in a haste.

459
00:34:56,582 --> 00:34:58,940
I forgot to bring it.

460
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,139
Does your head hurt?

461
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,480
I have silver needles for acupuncture.

462
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,019
Don't bother about me.

463
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,180
Tell me the medicinal herbs you need. I'll gather them.

464
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,714
My spiritual powers will help me locate them quickly.

465
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:12,519
Forget it.

466
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,340
Five Poison Sect's poisons are more complex than Tang Sect's.

467
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,579
Even more medicinal herbs are needed, and they're far rarer.

468
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,253
Even if you manage to find them, the weeds at my grave might've already grown taller than you.

469
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:29,360
Stop fooling around.

470
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,380
I'm not.

471
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,700
Don't be too depressed.

472
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,740
Death comes for everyone.

473
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:44,619
Something's not right.

474
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,699
Your martial arts are equal to mine.

475
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:50,339
How did you get hurt so easily?

476
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,820
What's going on? Tell me, and I'll definitely be able to save you!

477
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,020
I'm a miracle physician.

478
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,220
- I know my body best.
- Nonsense!

479
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,999
Did you forget our conversation in the past?

480
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:11,140
Even if you have the power to defy Heaven, you'll find yourself helpless one day.

481
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,320
I won't know until I try.

482
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,380
Ye Xi.

483
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,700
While I'm still breathing, let me finish speaking.

484
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,080
I've always wanted to tell you—

485
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,439
I have no antidote for the poison, but I can purge it.

486
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:50,480
Even if you're on the brink of death, I'll save you as long as you're still alive.

487
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,620
Once you're well, I'll let you speak for three days and three nights.

488
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,250
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

489
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:24,680
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

490
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,930
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

491
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:36,690
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

492
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:42,080
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

493
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,980
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

494
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:53,840
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

495
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,720
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

496
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,510
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

497
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:11,480
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

498
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,220
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

499
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:23,180
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

500
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:29,030
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

501
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:37,810
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

502
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:47,960
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
