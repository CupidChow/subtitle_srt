“Martial Arts World Fairy” - Hen Meiwei”

00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:14,610
♫ I just came from the forest not yet awake looking like a ginseng fairy ♫

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,950
♫ I’m full of skills, I broke into the Martial Arts World alone ♫

4
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:26,580
♫ I believe in destiny, looked everywhere but nobody specified what it is ♫

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,770
♫ Once again, I have hope and expectation of love yet who is my destiny is unknown ♫

6
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,710
♫ See, turns out that destiny has always been waiting for me ♫

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,740
♫ I believe that love really exists ♫

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:52,020
♫ Take a look at me, I’m open and candid, careful, and never doubting love ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:59,390
♫ Although I fan the flames and cause trouble everywhere, I came to the world just to ask about the whereabouts of love

10
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,530
♫ How do I find the ripple effect of my destiny? ♫

11
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,830
♫ What are the consciences of the proud me? ♫

12
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,240
♫ Why bother worrying too much? ♫

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,320
♫ I just know that wherever I go, you will be there with me ♫

[Episode 14]

16
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,020
A bunch of useless trash!

17
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,359
Idiots!

18
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,439
- Men!
- Your Highness, please calm down.

19
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,600
- We are truly powerless.
- Drag them out!

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,380
Wait. Your Highness, I recalled something.

21
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,181
There's a mystical book called the Scripture of Materia Medica.

22
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,640
It may contain a method for curing such an illness.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,440
I only know about Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica
(Venerated founder of agriculture and herbal medicine in ancient China)

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,319
and the Compiled Annotations of the Materia Medica.

25
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,560
What is this Scripture of Materia Medica?

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,419
You're making up nonsense.

27
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:01,280
How could such elderly folks spout lies?

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,480
Scram!

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,080
Move it!

30
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:13,560
I don't care about scriptures.

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,516
As long as she can regain consciousness, I'll willingly pray to the gods.

32
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:24,259
Will she... never open her eyes again?

33
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:27,039
Didn't the imperial physicians already say so?

34
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,340
They're powerless to save her.

35
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,659
That's why they were blabbering nonsense to leave.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,619
These are symptoms of a stupor.

37
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:40,559
The cause is unknown, but it's definitely tied to her attempt to fight while being severely injured.

38
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:43,179
Why aren't you the slightest bit worried?

39
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,499
Life and death is up to fate.

40
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:49,120
What can I do?

41
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
Aren't you capable of curing all strange diseases in the world?

42
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,759
I can't make bricks without straw.

43
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,250
If I take her back to Fenghua Valley and use the medicinal herbs of Changliu Mountain, it's worth a shot.

44
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,319
Don't even think about taking her away.

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,859
You're the one asking me to save her.

46
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,560
Besides, have a close look.

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,700
She's the one gripping onto me tightly. I want her to let go.

48
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,719
How about this? You can chop off my hand.

49
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,800
Though, no one will ever be able to save her.

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,580
I can gather any medicinal herbs you desire.

51
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,239
I told you.

52
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,139
It's only worth a shot.

53
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:29,380
If I can't cure her, at least she can return to where she belongs.

54
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,680
You have to cure her!

55
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,163
If you don't, I won't spare you!

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,499
I've only saved the living and the dead.

57
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:42,619
She's on the brink of death. Even if I save her, she might just end up paralyzed.

58
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:45,839
But you're the reason she's in this state!

59
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:51,179
If you can't cure her, I'll paralyze you!

60
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,800
She owes me enough.

61
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,860
Even her life belongs to me.

62
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,159
When she begged me to save Tang Huan,

63
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,860
she promised me this.

64
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,659
She'd return to Fenghua Valley with me and stay there for a year to be my research subject.

65
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:12,860
That was why I let her return to Tang Sect for the marriage.

66
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,939
Alive or dead, she belongs to Fenghua Valley.

67
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:19,948
Why didn't you say so earlier?

68
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,979
You refused to believe me.

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,279
When she begged me to save those men who deceived her, she always paid the price for her error.

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,879
You were threatening me with someone else's life.

71
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,440
If I failed to retaliate, that'd make me a wimp.

72
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:46,560
Do you need the imperial physicians to tend to your wound?

73
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,320
Save it.

74
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,060
I can deal with it.

75
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,839
Your Highness! Please punish us for harming Her Highness.

76
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,839
That was my mistake.

77
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,659
- Rise.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

78
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:33,711
Your Highness, I know that you're worried about Her Highness.

79
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:36,900
However, this is a grave matter that requires your attention.

80
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,239
What is it?

81
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,839
There has been a collective report from the court officials.

82
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,219
Three years ago, the emperor and the crown prince died in the revolt.

83
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:49,759
Thankfully, you quelled the revolt, but you've insisted on overseeing the imperial court as the prince regent.

84
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,539
The world is at peace now, and you can return to the capital to ascend the throne.

85
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,200
Doing so will deter unrest and assure the common folk.

86
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,680
I never desired to be the emperor.

87
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,399
Your Highness is the only one capable of protecting the people!

88
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,487
Please return to the capital in haste and ascend the throne to govern the lands.

89
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:17,559
When we meet again, should I be addressing you as Your Majesty?

90
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:20,620
I have no wish to be the emperor.

91
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,480
All I ever wanted was her.

92
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,079
Yet, your notion of treating her well might not be what she wants.

93
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,319
Do you even know what she wants?

94
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,380
I may understand her, but what can I do?

95
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:43,359
If I hand her to you this time, will I be making an even worse mistake?

96
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,002
You can only hand her to me.

97
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:49,579
Though, I can guarantee this.

98
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,807
If she and I become lovers,

99
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,666
Heaven and Earth will condemn me with endless searing pain in my heart.

100
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,480
I'm still young.

101
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,043
I have yet to uncover the secrets to medicine.

102
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:05,879
So, I have no wish for an early death.

103
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,779
Fine.

104
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:10,501
I'll trust you one last time.

105
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:12,785
If you go back on your word,

106
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,465
I'll make sure you die miserably.

107
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,299
I'll offer the same warning to you.

108
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:25,200
If you're trying to kill me or someone else, don't utter a word before her.

109
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,756
She's has a one-track mind.

110
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:30,707
She thinks she's made of iron.

111
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:32,602
I can't cure that.

112
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,779
As long as you can cure her and let her return to how she was, I promise not to act recklessly.

113
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:47,044
Once matters in the capital are settled and the kingdom is at peace,

114
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:48,920
I will head straight to Fenghua Valley.

115
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,680
If there are any news, inform the Black Armored Guards at the posts.

116
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,439
They will deliver all messages to me at lightning speed.

117
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,291
Are you still taking the medicine I prescribed to you?

118
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,519
Here's a new prescription for you.

119
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,000
You're suffering an ailment of the internal organs.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,900
You'll only recover with medicine.

121
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,139
I'm of no concern, but you must cure her.

122
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,679
If you fail to do so, I'll lead the Black Armored Guards to destroy Fenghua Valley.

123
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,607
May we meet again.

124
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,480
- Send men to tail them.
- Yes.

125
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,780
- This is pretty cozy.
- Yes.

126
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,336
Why aren't they here yet?

127
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,679
How long must we wait here?

128
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,800
Let's wait a little longer. They have to pass through here to get to Fenghua Valley.

129
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,400
I believe that they'll escape Cang Qi's claws unscathed.

130
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,220
Are we just supposed to be sitting ducks here?

131
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,420
My silent support and patience will reach him somehow.

132
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,519
Your camaraderie sure is touching.

133
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,079
After we send them off, come to Flowing Water Manor with me to meet my father.

134
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,640
- Eldest Miss Lin!
- Call me Xiaoxiao!

135
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,679
I-I've never met such a prestigious martial artist like your father.

136
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,879
I... I'm a little scared.

137
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,279
What's there to fear?

138
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,859
I'll tell my father that I have my eyes on you.

139
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Has your mother ever taught you that ladies have to be more reserved?

140
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,679
My mother eloped with someone else soon after I was born.

141
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,408
My father almost died of anger.

142
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,120
Do you find me ugly?

143
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,999
Of course not! You're from a respected family, talented and beautiful beyond compare!

144
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:25,619
I'm not talented, but my looks are not bad!

145
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:27,459
Though, I'm not much better than others.

146
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:32,119
Whenever I see ladies prettier than me, I want to bury them.

147
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:34,459
Ye Xi is an exception.

148
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:38,904
She has all my respect and admiration.

149
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:44,200
Why don't you like me? Do you think my personality is horrible?

150
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,020
That's not it. You're candid.

151
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,539
You're so obnoxious that you don't spare a single thought about your family.

152
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:52,439
That's...

153
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:55,020
unbelievably unique.

154
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,010
Your praise sounds a bit insincere.

155
00:10:57,728 --> 00:10:59,420
I'll still accept it.

156
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,080
Stop pinching me.

157
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,519
Let me ask you this. You're rich and handsome.

158
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,000
Why haven't you gotten yourself a wife?

159
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,619
Must I answer this question?

160
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,240
I'm not sure if you'll understand this reply.

161
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,600
Relationships between men and women can be very complex.

162
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,160
Friendships are far more simple.

163
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,579
Got it.

164
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:30,620
But ever since I was young, I've only ditched things.

165
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,600
There isn't anything beyond my reach.

166
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,479
Bai Yue is an exception. If I can't get him, so be it.

167
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:39,080
Cang Qi isn't normal, so he doesn't count.

168
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,390
Eldest Miss, men aren't objects!

169
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,223
You don't have to feel so inferior!

170
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:48,018
You're lucky I'm a rather simple person.

171
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:50,305
Seems like we're a good fit for each other.

172
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,900
Young Master, a letter from Young Master Bai has arrived.

173
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,419
Read it out!

174
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,740
Ye Xi is injured and needs immediate care.

175
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,816
We've hurried back to the valley. Your kindness will be remembered.

176
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:08,640
May we meet again.

177
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,999
I really hope Ye Xi will stay in Fenghua Valley for the rest of her life.

178
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,620
- Is this a blessing or a curse?
- Of course, it's a blessing!

179
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,277
Don't you trust in Bai Yue's medical skills?

180
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:26,620
Ye Xi was supposed to stay at Fenghua Valley for a year.

181
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,200
If Bai Yue hadn't wavered and let her leave,

182
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
she wouldn't have gone to Tang Sect and almost lost her life!

183
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,951
Now, she has finally gotten rid of Cang Qi.

184
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,720
I hope the both of them can remain in Fenghua Valley until the end of time.

185
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:48,519
Young Master, should we write a reply to Young Master Bai?

186
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,220
There's no need. This is a pretty fat pigeon.

187
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,120
Let's roast it.

188
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,840
The previous one tasted quite good.

189
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,103
So, you're the one who ate that pigeon!

190
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:02,519
That's a thousand-mile pigeon worth an entire city!

191
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,939
We must not eat this one.

192
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:07,780
Young Master Bai gave it to me. It costs ten times more than that other pigeon.

193
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,779
- You can't eat it!
- It's just a pigeon. Don't be stingy.

194
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:17,600
You'll end up in my hands eventually.

195
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,400
- But...
- Hanzi!

196
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,859
- Roast the pigeon!
- Okay!

197
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,500
Valley Master, I've transported the medicinal herbs under the hot spring as instructed.

198
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,900
A medicinal bath is a good idea, but you have to keep an eye on her personally.

199
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,159
Right now, she's no different from a zombie.

200
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,780
Such misfortune. The Martial Arts World calls her a demoness.

201
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,819
Yet she's only been harmed by others while never harming anyone else.

202
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:52,420
You shouldn't have let her leave!

203
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,600
Uncle Hui, help me keep watch on the place.

204
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,989
Were you treating my injuries?

205
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,080
Do you feel unwell in any way?

206
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,819
Can you move your limbs?

207
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,661
By the way, weren't you shot by an arrow?

208
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:01,459
Are you all right?

209
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,540
Lower your hand or I'll drop you.

210
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,340
I feel so comfortable.

211
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,360
I can move now, but my body still aches.

212
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,447
Since you carried me in here, carry me out too.

213
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,960
I wonder who got me into this state.

214
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,119
Can't you be more benevolent to me as a physician?

215
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,759
I saved you from Tang Sect and prevented your lynching.

216
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,260
After that, I saved you from Cang Qi's toxic grip.

217
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,060
I made sure you didn't die of suffocation. Haven't I been benevolent enough?

218
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,279
Yes. You saved me from quagmires time and again.

219
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,640
You're my greatest benefector. But you refuse to let me repay you with my life.

220
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,099
I don't know how I should thank you.

221
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,680
♫ The bright moonlight against the red sunset in the sky ♫

222
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,200
♫ The boy in white and the heroine in red in the Mortal World ♫

223
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,220
Is that how you're thanking me?

224
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,316
Don't you like it?

225
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:06,799
Fine, I won't thank you.

226
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,699
But I'm still a little dizzy. My legs are numb too.

227
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:16,260
If you're unwilling to carry me out, I can only sit here.

228
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,800
When someone comes for a bath, I'll get him to carry me out.

229
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,399
Dream on.

230
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,980
Come in.

231
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,580
Miss Ye.

232
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,599
Uncle Hui, I feel much better.

233
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,079
I don't need two bowls of medicine every day.

234
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,459
These are the valley master's orders.

235
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:19,000
One is for your injuries, and the other is for your white hair.

236
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,319
Try something else.

237
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,359
I don't want to drink fallopia multiflora either.

238
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,359
There aren't any fallopia multiflora. It's a different prescription.

239
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,540
If you don't want them, I'll take them away.

240
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,432
However, he's bound to toss you into that pool again.

241
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:36,860
That medicinal bath is truly miraculous.

242
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,160
However, too many baths will make your skin turn green.

243
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,859
Even your hair might turn green.

244
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,840
Uncle Hui.

245
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,180
Uncle Hui!

246
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,359
Do you want the medicine back?

247
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,999
This is more like it.

248
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:24,979
Thank you, Uncle Hui.

249
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,759
Can you ask Yang Ke to bring the medicine tomorrow?

250
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,220
No. The valley master doesn't trust anyone else to take care of you.

251
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,079
Is that so?

252
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,299
Why do I feel that I'm the one he doesn't trust?

253
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,579
Oh yes, Uncle Hui, is there anything else the matter?

254
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:41,540
The valley master is...

255
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,340
What's the matter with him? Is he still upset?

256
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,279
How can he be upset with you?

257
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,699
I think he is still savoring your double medicinal bath.

258
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,039
Are the two of you already...

259
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,239
Uncle Hui, don't try to ask me anymore.

260
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,980
Actually, I don't understand it fully.

261
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,000
Doesn't a kiss mean a seal of love?

262
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,980
Both of us were not wearing clothes, but he's acting like nothing happened.

263
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,980
The romance in the storybooks is about like that, right?

264
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,860
Not so. Not so.

265
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,980
What you read are in the storybooks.

266
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,100
In the real world, why can't a woman take the initiative?

267
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,780
Uncle Hui, is it good that you keep pushing me like this?

268
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,519
Since I can't persuade him,

269
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,340
I still hope that he can live more comfortably and not be so repressed.

270
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:24,079
Miss, you didn't know this, but before you came here,

271
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,279
I never saw a different facial expression on him for many years.

272
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,750
But ever since you came,

273
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:33,110
he would sometimes smile, sometimes get upset, and even get embarrassed or enraged.

274
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,980
He seems more lively.

275
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,860
What's the use even if he gets more lively.

276
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,000
He still wouldn't tell me anything.

277
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,214
Even if you kill him, he's the kind who still wouldn't say anything.

278
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,066
Miss, allow me to tell you a story that you've never heard.

279
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,000
A long time ago, there was a young man.

280
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,920
He was extraordinarily handsome.

281
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,100
He was formidable in swordplay, and his medical skills were superb.

282
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,599
At a young age, he succeeded as Valley Master and possessed unimaginable wealth.

283
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,859
He reached the pinnacle in advance of what the rest of the wrold could reach.

284
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:15,709
No one could compare to him.

285
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:21,440
It also meant he was destined to live in a solitude that is incomprehensible to other people.

286
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,960
The young man waited at the summit for a long time,

287
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,039
but no one else could climb up there to laugh and chat about the world with him.

288
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,440
After he was disappointed year after year,

289
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,359
he began to play chess with himself, talk with himself.

290
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,920
He didn't like solitude, but he was used to it.

291
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,444
It's because he set his sights too high,

292
00:21:46,444 --> 00:21:50,959
so he didn't want to come down to try the different flavors in the Mortal World.

293
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,880
I think people have to try first before they understand the different flavors in life.

294
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,179
Even if they are sad, what's the big deal? It's better than being heartless.

295
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:07,480
That's right. It was like that until he met this girl.

296
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,079
How the young man and the girl met seemed to be by fate.

297
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,179
The girl save the young man and quietly disappeared.

298
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:19,520
After six months, he finally found her whereabouts.

299
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,939
When he heard that she was framed by villains to be a demoness in the Martial Arts World,

300
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:26,659
he hurriedly went down from the mountain to search, but she was already killed.

301
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:29,660
He could only bury her.

302
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,879
After he returned, he planted a flower and tied a red ribbon on it.

303
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,440
A red ribbon?

304
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,319
What does that mean?

305
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,040
What do you think?

306
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,459
Could it be to summon the soul?

307
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:51,880
I think he was praying for blessings for the girl,

308
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,840
in the hope that she wouldn't be cheated by men again in her next life.

309
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,930
- Was this girl still alive?
- Yes.

310
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:05,939
Later, she bought another man to ask the young man to save him?

311
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:08,920
The young man was surprised that the girl was still alive.

312
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,400
He deliberately obstructed because he didn't want her to repeat her mistake again.

After burying her, the young man returned

320
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,359
and planted another flower, and he also tied it with a red ribbon.

321
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,079
What do you think it meant again?

322
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,459
I think he was praying this girl would miraculously resurrect like the previous time.

323
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:05,640
From then on, he continued to devote himself to studying medicine and practicing swordplay.

324
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,259
The days seemed no different from before.

325
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:11,039
But he kept going to the unnamed burial mounds in the hope of another miracle.

326
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,040
Finally, on the girl's third death anniversary day, he saw the girl actually resurrect again.

327
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:22,159
What he wanted to know was, if he was the first person that she met this time, what would be the result?

328
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,320
Too bad the girl had amnesia again and didn't remember him anymore.

329
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,060
I'm so handsome, but you still didn't remember me.

330
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,920
The young man wanted the girl to leave with him, but he didn't know how to say it.

331
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,359
If she appeared in the Martial Arts World, he was afraid that she would be pursued again by killers,

332
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,640
and she would accidentally die again.

333
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
So he disguised himself and secretly followed her.

334
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,319
He accompanied her through mountains and rivers.

335
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:52,300
He came to know her habits in eating, and other preferences.

336
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,440
He even helped her deal with the martial artists who were hunting her down.

No scallions, coriander, and chili pepper.

I heard that the demoness they're after has left.

The young man still wasn't sure how to talk to the girl, but she was entangled and exploited by another man.

She begged him again to save the another man.

The young man was despondent.

But he's kindhearted, and let everyone go easy on her unnoticeably,

The young man asked the girl to stay in the valley for a year.

358
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,540
His original intent was that, if she could stay here, she would be safe without suffering any harm.

359
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,359
But the girl insisted on accompanying the man home first.

The young man inexplicably didn't try to ask the girl to stay.

He looked like he didn't care, but he actually cared a lot.

After he heard the girl was getting married, he immediately rushed over there.

If nobody probes for the truth, the girl would never know about the young man's sacrifices for her.

He should be frank about his concern, so she can understand.

He shouldn't keep her guessing.

I'm pretty sure majority of women wouldn't understand this.

00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:51,380
W-Well...

470
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,960
What else can I even say?

471
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,220
She was so traumatized at the marriage ceremony.

472
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,239
A broken heart is harder to heal.

473
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:04,640
The best medicine for that is to marry a good partner as soon as possible.

474
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,599
Look, both of you are unwed.

475
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,679
Let your passions take the lead, won't you...

476
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:13,299
- Is that so?
- I'm off to brew medicine.

477
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,150
[Xi]

478
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,741
Trying hard to stop myself from falling for her has already wrenched apart my heart.

479
00:37:55,741 --> 00:38:00,639
A reciprocated love might just kill me.

480
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,580
I can't even cure myself.

481
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,091
Perhaps I'm unfit to be a miracle physician.

482
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,770
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

483
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:30,390
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

484
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:36,600
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

485
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,380
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

486
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,800
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

487
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,630
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

488
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:59,580
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

489
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:05,470
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

490
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:11,240
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

491
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:17,110
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

492
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:22,920
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

493
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,900
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

494
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,680
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

495
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:43,520
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

496
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:53,800
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
