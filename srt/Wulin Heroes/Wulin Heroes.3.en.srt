♫ I’m full of skills, I broke into the Martial Arts World alone ♫

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,450
♫ I believe in destiny, looked everywhere but nobody specified what it is ♫

5
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:33,860
♫ Once again, I have hope and expectation of love yet who is my destiny is unknown ♫

♫ I believe that love really exists ♫

♫ Take a look at me, I’m open and candid, careful, and never doubting love ♫

[Episode 3]

16
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,140
Stop!

17
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,259
You're the demoness, Ye Xi!

18
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,360
How could you tell?

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,879
Only Demoness Ye Xi uses the Flying Frost Sword Play!

20
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,280
D-Don't spout nonsense!

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,319
Who are you insulting?

22
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,800
I'm just an ordinary woman trying to save them from bullies.

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,859
If you make false accusations of me, I won't show any mercy!

24
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:07,220
By the way, I have a score to settle with you guys!

25
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,540
You trampled over my chicken!

26
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,200
Besides, you're committing murder in broad daylight!

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,419
I'll avenge Seventh Uncle!

28
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,719
Just you wait! Tang Sect won't spare you!

29
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,019
Retreat!

30
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,080
Are you all right?

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,520
I'm fine.

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,960
Sorry for implicating you.

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,860
How are your injuries?

34
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,759
Tang Sect sent so many men to hunt me down.

35
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,199
Seventh Uncle lost his life for me.

36
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,280
- I...
- Answer me. Are you hurt?

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,479
I'm fine.

38
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,120
You can leave. Don't bother with me.

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Do I look like someone who'd leave you in the lurch?

40
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,560
These wounds look terrible, but they're just scratches.

41
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,859
He should be fine.

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,760
Y-You're awake?

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,000
Are your internal injuries all right?

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,679
I'm fine. I won't die.

45
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,700
Did you tend to my wounds?

46
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:49,399
Oh, by the way, a miracle physician gave these Jade Dew Pills.

47
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,759
They work wonders in healing wounds and relieving pain.

48
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,659
Consume them.

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,140
Miss Ye!

50
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,280
Are you leaving?

51
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,080
If I deny that I'm Ye Xi, will you believe me?

52
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,799
But your swordplay is distinctive of Ye Xi.

53
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,280
All the more reason to leave since the cat is out of the bag.

54
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,920
I saved you, so you won't betray me, right?

55
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,620
Of course not.

56
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,339
It's best if you leave anyway.

57
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,439
Otherwise, you might be implicated by me again.

58
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,160
Thank you for saving my life.

59
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,940
If I manage to survive, I'll repay this debt of gratitude.

60
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,960
But... why were they hunting you down?

61
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,279
Tang Yang has been eliminating all opposition ever since he obtained the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

62
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,739
Storm Pear Flower Needle?

63
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:52,960
Is that the rumored weapon that killed me?

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,759
I've heard about this before.

65
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,379
Forget it.

66
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,939
Miss, it's dangerous for you to stay with me.

67
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:01,840
You should leave.

68
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
Tons of people want me dead too.

69
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,500
It's hard to tell who's the real threat here.

70
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
Hold on, Miss Ye.

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,640
Can I ask one last thing?

72
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,940
Have you lost all memories of Tang Yang?

73
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,979
If I told you I'm suffering from memory loss, will you believe me?

74
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:26,540
I believe you.

75
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,939
Even since I reawakened in the burial mounds, I lost all memory of my own identity.

76
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,399
After that, I met a miracle physician.

77
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,219
He said my name was Wang Tieshuan, and I entered the city with him.

78
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:52,459
I hadn't even figured out my past when everyone started saying I'm Demoness Ye Xi.

79
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,279
That's how I became the public enemy of the martial arts world.

80
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,279
People have been hunting me down ever since.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,719
I have no explanation or any proof to clear my name.

82
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,260
They think I'm a monstrous criminal.

83
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,819
That's not true.

84
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,319
You knew that exposing your identity would be dangerous, but you still intervened to save us.

85
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,280
Such a kind lady like you can't be a monstrous criminal.

86
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,879
Moreover, you held back when opposing those men.

87
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,859
But those folks bent on killing the demoness won't show any mercy.

88
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,720
That's fine.

89
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,039
I've just been camping in the wild to avoid them.

90
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:42,360
I haven't had a good meal in ages.

91
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,260
It's a real pity.

92
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,699
Miss Ye, I know you're innocent.

93
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,220
They owe you an apology.

94
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:08,379
When I first heard about Ye Xi, I had just stepped up as the youngest of Tang Sect's ten elders.

95
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:14,360
At that time, I was the only one who had suspicions about the former sect lord's death.

96
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,940
Back then, Tang Yang was a prestigious figure in the martial arts world.

97
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,159
He was the respected young lord of Tang Sect and the celebrated son-in-law of Mo Sect.

98
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,599
Mo Sect was annihilated, and Mo Rou, his wife-to-be, died.

99
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,920
As for Ye Xi, she became the notorious demoness of the martial arts world.

100
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,559
I don't know what happened, but I heard Tang Yang say this himself.

101
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,920
Don't resent me for my cruelty.

102
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,519
I wanted to treat all of you well,

103
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,059
but I had no other choice.

104
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:51,980
As the lord of Tang Sect, I have to prioritize Tang Sect's might.

105
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,199
Attaining greatness always comes at a price.

106
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,000
I didn't want to deceive you, Xiao Xi.

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,900
You're my confidante.

108
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,520
You're so beautiful and capable.

109
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,979
You've been such a great help to me.

110
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:15,959
I can only thank you in my next life.

111
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,119
My feelings for you were genuine too, Xiao Rou.

112
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,639
You're the perfect wife for me.

113
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,100
It would've been great if you retained your innocence.

114
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:45,300
For Tang Sect to overshadow the rest of the martial arts world, I need the Storm Pear Flower Needle.

115
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
Old man.

116
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,079
Thank you for you persistent teachings.

117
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:59,600
Under my rule, Tang Sect will rise to unprecedented heights.

118
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,179
Rest in peace.

119
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,520
Accompany each other on your road to the other side.

120
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,459
I will offer more incense sticks to you.

121
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,399
So, he really deceived me.

122
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,520
Tang Yang not only murdered me, but he even killed his wife-to-be and her father.

123
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:50,799
How could he commit patricide?

124
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,760
Utterly inhuman!

125
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,599
I have no evidence.

126
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:59,460
However, Tang Yang learned that I overheard his secrets and sent men to kill me.

127
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,350
That's sufficient proof.

128
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:04,539
How did you survive the blow from the Storm Pear Flower Needle?

129
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,840
Have you really forgotten everything?

130
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,479
I...

131
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,679
really can't remember.

132
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,399
When I woke up, I was in the burial mounds.

133
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,279
After that, I met that miracle physician.

134
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,659
Fortune will shine upon kind ladies.

135
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,080
News barely spreads into the land of Shu.

136
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,820
Tang Yang is busy eliminating dissidents.

137
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,719
So, he doesn't know about your return to the martial arts world.

138
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:34,680
If he knows that you're alive, he'll be appalled.

139
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,519
I guess Tang Sect has one more person on their hit list.

140
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,540
Perhaps you're just lucky to have met me.

141
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,320
Even if he doesn't come knocking, I'm on my way to him.

142
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,300
Why the heck would I travel so far? Out of boredom?

143
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:02,599
I intended to look for him to clarify our past entanglements.

144
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:06,679
Now that I know the truth, I have to make sure justice is served, right?

145
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,679
Of course.

146
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:11,259
I have to avenge the deceased sect lord as well.

147
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,379
Since we're both seeking vengeance, how about we travel together?

148
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:24,119
Miss Ye, if I succeed in exacting revenge, I promise to clear your name.

149
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:26,600
You don't have to take such risks.

150
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,080
Are you worried that I'll implicate you?

151
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,559
Of course not.

152
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,659
I'm afraid of dragging you down.

153
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
You're thinking too much.

154
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,939
Presently, it's hard to tell who's the real encumbrance here.

155
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:46,759
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

156
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,879
By the way, I'm curious about something else.

157
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,579
Was I deeply in love with Tang Yang?

158
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,799
I only heard him say you're his confidante.

159
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,919
You made huge sacrifices for you.

160
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,659
A certain person was right in calling me foolish.

161
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:05,440
Miss, please don't say that of yourself.

162
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,659
You don't have to console me.

163
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,919
Besides, stop calling me "Miss".

164
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,380
Just call me by my name.

165
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,980
Sure.

166
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,140
Xiao Xi?

167
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,519
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

168
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,399
I just think that using your full name is a little formal.

169
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,260
Let's not talk about this anymore.

170
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,340
Well, I'm hungry. You must be, too.

171
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,759
I make excellent roasted chicken,

172
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,820
but... those guys chasing you ruined everything.

173
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,639
Wait for me. I'll capture another one.

174
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,720
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

175
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:01,900
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

176
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,940
I didn't see you when I woke up. Did you buy these horses?

177
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,760
We'll be able to reach Tang Fortress quicker.

178
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,800
Here.

179
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,439
How about we leave after your injuries heal?

180
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,360
It's fine.

181
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,039
Such scratches won't hinder me.

182
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,819
There may be ambushes along the official roads, so we have to take mountain paths.

183
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:44,200
Xiao Xi, you'll have to bear with this.

184
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,120
Have something to eat.

185
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:05,919
Why did you give me all the meat?

186
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,100
Eat this.

187
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,800
I can eat this.

188
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,980
My mother drilled this in me when I was little.

189
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,599
Men should care for the weak.

190
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,080
Xiao Xi, I'm not saying that you're weak.

191
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,519
You're far more impressive than I am.

192
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,900
I just think our journey to Thunder Sect will be arduous.

193
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,659
I hope to do my best in making this journey less taxing for you.

194
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,359
Let's share this.

195
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,360
By the way, how do you plan on convincing Thunder Sect to join forces with you in fighting Tang Sect?

196
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,340
I'm not confident of convincing him,

197
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,040
but I can only give it my all.

198
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,359
Sect Lord Yu of Thunder Sect is indebted to our sect lord.

199
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:01,720
So, he'll probably hear me out.

200
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,779
However, acquiring his help is a matter of luck.

201
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,779
Don't worry.

202
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:16,919
I'm with you.

203
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,380
Our luck won't be foul.

204
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:25,979
Have you gotten enough rest?

205
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,980
Let's get going then.

206
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,420
Okay.

207
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,659
I heard Tang Huan, the traitor of Tang Sect, has joined hands with Demoness Ye Xi.

208
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:43,320
She ruined Tang Sect so horribly in the past.

209
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,000
Birds of a feather sure flock together.

210
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,619
Tang Sect has many internal problems.

211
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:50,699
I heard the young lord of Tang Sect is a dictator.

212
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,499
He wants to kill all the elders.

213
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:57,039
It's not a surprise that Tang Huan sought out the demoness to defeat Tang Yang.

214
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,320
Whose side are you even on?

215
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,639
We have to enforce justice for the people.

216
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,100
Eldest Brother, you're right.

217
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,780
However, the imperial court has placed a bounty on her head.

218
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,639
We might receive money for capturing the demoness.

219
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,819
Capturing her is a matter of the martial arts world.

220
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:15,159
Once she's captured, we'll force her to cough up the martial arts secrets of the various sects.

221
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:18,419
In fact, when I was in Bailu City, I almost captured her.

222
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:20,320
It's a pity she fled.

223
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,399
If we manage to capture her this time, we can sell her to Tang Sect for a good price.

224
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,859
All right. Eldest Brother, let's take a break.

225
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,260
Sure.

226
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,440
Boss!

227
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,140
Bring us some premium green tea.

228
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,540
Okay.

229
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,480
Eldest Brother, stop harping over the price.

230
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,600
Our journey here has been spooky. Shadows of the demoness seem to be round every corner.

231
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,220
Yet, we just can't catch her. It's exhausting.

232
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,680
Demoness Ye Xi!

233
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,859
Chase after her!

234
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:58,799
You haven't paid for the tea!

235
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,120
That demoness is impressive! She vanished in an instant!

236
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,480
- Split up and look for her!
- Got it.

237
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,440
- Okay!
- Got it.

238
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,040
Let's go!

239
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,199
Xiao Xi, I passed by a fragrance pouch stall after I left Thunder Sect.

240
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:32,279
So, I bought one for you.

241
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,219
It can ward off evil and bring good luck.

242
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,499
The owner picked it for me.

243
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:43,059
- I...
- It's pretty. Why are you so nervous?

244
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,119
Anyway, did you visit Thunder Sect? How was it?

245
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,459
Sect Lord Yu agreed to help us.

246
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,620
- He's that agreeable?
- That's right!

247
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,400
With the support of Thunder Sect, we don't have to rack our brains over luring Tang Yang out.

248
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,059
We can attack Tang Fortress with Thunder Bombs.

249
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,740
This is a grave matter. Can he be trusted?

250
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,819
I witnessed the power of those Thunder Bombs when I first met you.

251
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,679
Will those explosions destroy the entire Tang Sect?

252
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,759
Xiao Xi.

253
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,319
They aren't that powerful. Don't let your imagination run wild.

254
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,499
Don't worry.

255
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:20,900
I'll think up an elaborate plan and prevent haphazard use of Thunder Bombs.

256
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,540
After all, these are disciples of Tang Sect.

257
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,640
I don't want them to be killed.

258
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,699
Our aim is to eliminate Tang Yang.

259
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:28,199
Okay.

260
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:35,359
If not for vengeance, I would've stayed away from killing and fighting.

261
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,639
I'd rather live a simple and free life.

262
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:43,199
Xiao Xi, do you think I'm useless for having such notions?

263
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,839
Not at all. Everyone has their own ideals.

264
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,019
Some people enjoy simplicity, while others love power.

265
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:50,400
They just chose different paths.

266
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,300
If we succeed in exacting revenge

267
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,600
and leave the entanglements of the martial arts world behind, that'll be wonderful.

268
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,259
Xiao Xi, will you be willing to live a simple life with me?

269
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:05,659
Live a simple life with me? What is he saying?

270
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:10,480
It's fine, Xiao Xi. I can wait.

271
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,180
I owe my life to you.

272
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,680
I just wanted to express my feelings for you.

273
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,820
Can I repay you with the rest of my life?

274
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,179
Repay me?

275
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:21,279
What have I done that requires repayment?

276
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,399
The rest of his life? Isn't that too much to offer?

277
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:27,499
Whatever, I don't know him well anyway. I'll just smile.

278
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,560
What did his speech during the day even mean?

279
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,640
Who is it?

280
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,139
Miss, it's me.

281
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,320
Coming.

282
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Miss, Young Master Tang asked me to bring these to you.

283
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,839
He said it's good for the body to eat more fruits.

284
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,639
Thank you.

285
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,319
He's given me a sachet and, now, oranges.

286
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,239
Has Tang Huan taken a liking to me?

287
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:31,599
But we've just met.

288
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,139
Something feels weird.

289
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,150
♫ Walk into the Martial Arts World pretending to be carefree ♫

290
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,290
♫ But emotions still make people unable to let go ♫

291
00:20:54,290 --> 00:21:00,410
♫ We love and want to kill each other, but yet it’s him who I can’t part with ♫

292
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,580
♫ After going through life and death several times, there is nothing more to worry about ♫

293
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,590
♫ But in the eyes, I can find my answer ♫

294
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:13,440
♫ Without you, without me, who will care about the world? ♫

295
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,630
♫ Our unwavering longing goes in full cycle a few times ♫

296
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,830
♫ Several times life and death in the Martial Arts World crushes like waves into the sand ♫

297
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:26,850
♫ Destined to meet you is destined to spend time with you ♫

298
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,599
So strange. What kind of dream was that?

299
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,519
I must have read too many romance novels.

300
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,200
We already went our separate ways. Why is he still haunting me?

301
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,900
After leading those people on a chase all night, I finally lured them away.

302
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,079
So bothersome.

303
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,340
Bai Yu, why are you here?

304
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,800
You're ignoring me?

305
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,540
You look lethargic. What's wrong? I...

306
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,040
Move aside.

307
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,240
What is this?

308
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,519
You weren't digging for herbs all night, were you?

309
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,259
You haven't given up on finding ginseng?

310
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:49,259
Let me tell you something.

311
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:52,219
Right now, I really want to scold someone. You're better off not talking to me.

312
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:53,480
Go away.

313
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,080
You're blocking my way.

314
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,560
I...

315
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,059
Be careful not to get mad at yourself!

316
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,599
- Miss.
- Is this medicine for Young Master Bai?

317
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:33,799
Yes, Young Master Bai wrote the prescription. He said it's for healing wounds.

318
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:36,359
He seems to be injured from last night. It sounded quite scary.

319
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,959
I wonder if the injury is serious.

320
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,240
By the way, Miss, can you watch over it for me for a while?

321
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,720
I need to do something and will be right back.

322
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,420
- All right.
- Thanks.

323
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,780
How strange.

324
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Why did he suddenly get injured?

325
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,140
Maybe he has an enemy in the martial arts world?

326
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:16,200
Forget it. Forget it.

327
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,640
It has nothing to do with me.

328
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,599
He was losing temper with me just now.

329
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,499
It should be fine.

330
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,759
Considering you gave me a lot of help before,

331
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:35,060
I'll help you this time.

332
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,820
[Warmth After Gentle Spring Breeze]

333
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,520
Wait a moment.

334
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,180
Young Master Bai, is anything the matter?

335
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,839
Is the temperature of the decoction not right?

336
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,739
It's not that. I only wanted to ask you.

337
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:14,439
When you were making the decoction, was there anyone else?

338
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:17,140
That young lady watched it for me for a while.

339
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,819
I see.

340
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,040
What's the matter?

341
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,759
Did you put the ginseng in the medicinal tea?

342
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,919
What ginseng? I know nothing about it.

343
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,519
People have searched everywhere and still can't find any ginseng.

344
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,960
But suddenly a lot of it showed up in this bowl of medicinal tea.

345
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,019
If other people saw it, how were you going to explain to them?

346
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:57,200
Why aren't you more cautious?

347
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,380
What is there to explain?

348
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,019
There are a lot of inexplicable things in this world.

349
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,640
Even if I put in the ginseng, it was meant to help you.

350
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,259
You don't think your demoness title is famous enough?

351
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:12,300
What do you mean by that?

352
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,679
How are you different from those who curse me as demoness?

353
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,119
Isn't a demoness an evil being that's different from normal people?

354
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,419
Since you insist that I know sorcery and suspect that I used sorcery to conjure up the ginseng,

355
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:24,980
and you even come here to accuse me, then, sure.

356
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,360
Wipe your eyes clean right now and see if I'm a demoness.

357
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,000
I'll let you see it all.

358
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,340
How about it?

359
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,340
What are you doing?

360
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,300
So inexplicable.

361
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,559
Inexplicable?

362
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,759
You suspected me first. I already gave you a chance.

363
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:51,179
You're blatantly playing tricks.

364
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:55,700
You see, when I reason with you, you say I'm playing tricks.

365
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,459
Such as it is, we should go our separate ways and become strangers from now on.

366
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,020
Xiao Xi, are you there?

367
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,799
Xiao Xi, Sect Lord Yu of Thunder Sect invited us to his manor for a chat.

368
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,000
Sure, that's fine. Wait for me in the main hall for a moment.

369
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,479
Sure.

370
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:19,259
Xiao Xi, are you all right?

371
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:22,139
I'm fine. I'll come in a moment.

372
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,200
Aren't you going to remove your hand from my body?

373
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,700
There was an insect.

374
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,840
When people are nervous, their hearts will beat faster. It's an instinct.

375
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,220
But when you were talking with Tang Huan, you were only a little bit nervous.

376
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,340
Your heart wasn't racing at all.

377
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,140
Is that right?

378
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,720
You only touched a little. How could you feel it?

379
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,399
- Do you want to touch again?
- Go away.

380
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:07,100
I wasn't nervous. I think you were nervous.

381
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,319
Wait.

382
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,559
You recognized Tang Huan just by listening to his voice.

383
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,799
You'd better give me a good explanation.

384
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,300
I don't believe that you knew him.

385
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,359
Did I say it was Tang Huan?

386
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,740
Don't pretend you don't remember.

387
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,540
Is it strange that I know Tang Huan?

388
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,620
I suspect that you've been following me.

389
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,499
Your suspicions are wrong.

390
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,739
But I still want to warn you.

391
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:31,000
It's not easy to live again.

392
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,920
You'd better open your eyes wide and see Tang Huan clearly.

393
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,419
Don't get cheated again.

394
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:37,739
If you misjudge again, you'll push yourself into the grave.

395
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:39,439
Thank you for your concern.

396
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:41,019
You are right about Tang Yang.

397
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,019
But I have my own plan with Tang Huan.

398
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,640
From now on, I'll definitely wipe my eyes clean and see clearly.

399
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:06,619
Enter.

400
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,979
Sect Lord Yu.

401
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,079
Miss Ye,

402
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,779
please.

403
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:31,000
Xiao Xi.

404
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,160
Don't worry. This is Thunder Sect's territory.

405
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:39,040
I heard from Tenth Elder that Miss Ye is skilled in martial arts.

406
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,060
Just good enough.

407
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,719
Sect Lord Yu, are you looking for highly skilled martial artists to lead the charge in fights?

408
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,980
Xiao Xi, I should be the one to go.

409
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,199
Although my martial arts skill aren't as good as yours, but with so much danger, how can I let you do it?

410
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:55,640
That won't do.

411
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,200
You and Sect Lord Yu need to be stationed in the rear to command the overall situation.

412
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,880
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

413
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,480
But I'm concerned about you.

414
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,580
Ccmpared to the revenge, I care more about how you feel.

415
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,159
Sect Lord.

416
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,380
Guests, I'm going to inspect the Thunder Bombs.

417
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,380
I'll return shortly.

418
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,380
Excuse me.

419
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,119
Xiao Xi.

420
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,740
I know that we've only been together for a short while.

421
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,680
It's too early to speak out on somethings.

422
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,280
But this battle is dangerous.

423
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,020
In case there's trouble, I'd like to express my feelings now.

424
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,180
Xiao Xi,

425
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:57,120
if it works out successfully this time, once it concludes, will you marry me?

426
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,020
Why are we suddenly talking about marriage?

427
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,659
You don't even know yet what kind of person I am.

428
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:10,359
No, I know very well what kind of person you are.

429
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,979
We've only just met, and you already know me?

430
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,359
Xiao Xi,

431
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,640
although I can't give you anything now,

432
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,199
nor do I know if I can succeed in the revenge in this trip,

433
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:31,200
but regardless of the result, I don't want to regret it later.

434
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,580
That's why I'm making my promise to you now.

435
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,340
Xiao Xi,

436
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,239
my heart will stay true to you forever.

437
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,600
Your words are too serious.

438
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:49,079
It's fine, Xiao Xi.

439
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,239
You don't need to rush to answer me.

440
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:54,219
Be careful!

441
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
Xiao Xi!

442
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,319
Are you all right?

443
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:41,280
- Chase after them!
- Yes!

444
00:32:42,739 --> 00:32:45,539
Miss Ye, are you both all right?

445
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,219
Someone!

446
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:49,800
- Hurry and get the physician.
- Yes!

447
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,859
This is...

448
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
It is a hidden weapon from Tang Sect.

449
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,459
You mean they are from Tang Sect?

450
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,060
But their swordplay was more powerful than their hidden weapons.

451
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,519
Luckily Miss Ye is highly skilled in martial arts.

452
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,019
Tenth Elder

453
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:19,040
was so desperate to protect Miss Ye.

454
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,680
If this wound had gotten deeper, you would have lost your life.

455
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,900
Xiao Xi, I'm fine.

456
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,800
Are you all right?

457
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:32,300
You didn't need to rush to cover me.

458
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,040
Oh, yes.

459
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,419
I have this. You can take all of it. It can stop the pain.

460
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:52,299
Guests, I don't think you should stay here. Come to my place to recuperate.

461
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:55,580
Miss Ye, let's go together.

462
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,440
All right.

463
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,660
I'll go back to the inn to pack. Wait for me for a little while.

464
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,440
Please take care of Tang Huan, Sect Lord Yu.

465
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,940
Don't worry.

466
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,240
Young Master Bai, can you please help save my brother?

467
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,699
I didn't come here to save people.

468
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,300
The two of you are no match for her at all.

469
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,920
Why go there to give up your life?

470
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,360
Who did you say that we are no match for?

471
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,979
We, Black and White Double Phantoms, are reputed in the martial arts world.

472
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:39,639
If the demoness Ye Xi weren't protected by Tang Huan today,

473
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,300
we would have surely poked a big hole in her body.

474
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,760
Tang Huan is injured?

475
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,199
We almost disabled his right hand.

476
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:51,920
What do you want?

477
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,720
Still lying?

478
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,839
Who sent you on this mission?

479
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,139
You know the answer very well.

480
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,720
Young Master Bai, wait!

481
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:06,639
I beg you, please save my brother.

482
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,280
If you want me to help, there's a condition.

483
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,079
What is the condition? Just say it.

484
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,960
Tell me honestly who sent you to assassinate?

485
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,880
It's... Sect Lord Yu.

486
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,719
I'm busy now.

487
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,839
Take him to the inn to wait for me there.

488
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,960
Thank you, Young Master Bai.

489
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,700
I'm so hungry.

490
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,800
I should eat a good meal before going back to the inn.

491
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,440
Boss.

492
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,800
Bring me a pot of wine and a plate of meat.

493
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,500
Sure, coming up.

494
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,300
Just now, Tang Huan was very weak in his martial arts.

495
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,779
I can run into you when I'm just casually strolling around.

496
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,760
It's a kind of fated connection.

497
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,380
Not discerning the truth, not knowing good from bad,

498
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,879
there can't be a second person like you in this world.

499
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:08,919
Did you come on purpose to say I'm dumb?

500
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:11,120
Am I in your way?

501
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,159
There are many ways to live in this world.

502
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:16,060
A thousand pieces of gold won't make me happy.

503
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:20,059
However you want to live, that's indeed your own business.

504
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,680
But to drink so thoughtlessly here, it's easy to be schemed against.

505
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,119
A big battle is looming.

506
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,780
If I don't eat, how will I have the strength to kill?

507
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,400
Someone scheming against me?

508
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,659
I'll kill them, too.

509
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:50,400
”Waiting” - Li Hongyi

510
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,940
♫ How many stories have you heard of the Mortal World? ♫

511
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:02,200
♫ Dressing in light clothes, I've become forgotten in the horizon ♫

512
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:08,010
♫ I can’t bear to go home again ♫

513
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:13,460
♫ And I can’t seem to find your voice to accompany me ♫

514
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:19,230
♫ The sound of the melodious song leisurely stirs up the past ♫

515
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:25,190
♫ My long-cherished wish has not been fulfilled, how can I leave you? ♫

516
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:31,070
♫ How could destiny take me back to that city? ♫

517
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:36,820
♫ To find the warmth you left behind ♫

518
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:42,740
♫ A gentle dream becomes reality magnifying the roads I’ve taken ♫

519
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:48,610
♫ Laughing and sighing in this life, why bother asking if I’d be interested in it again? ♫

520
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:54,520
♫ Why is there someone willing to wait without knowing the pain and resentment? ♫

521
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:00,430
♫ It’s hard to tell stories of the past ♫

522
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:09,100
♫ Unintentionally, like the trees and grass, I’m foolishly hoping for true love ♫

523
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:19,060
♫ I will wait for you for the rest of my life ♫
