00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,673
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

2
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,719
I'm a widow.

3
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,636
I know.

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,013
And you're the Grand Prince.

5
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:55,930
Who cares?

6
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,392
People will call it immoral and mock us.

7
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,351
Let them.

8
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,989
Let's go.

9
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,082
Don't take that hand.

10
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,214
You're not allowed to leave.

11
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,632
You can't leave this house

12
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,551
until you die.

13
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,638
Move.

14
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,016
Unlike the noble Grand Prince,

15
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,352
I can become petty very easily.

16
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,103
She belongs to this family,

17
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,148
so she can't leave this house
until she dies.

18
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,777
If I were to be petty,

19
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,237
everyone in this house,

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,406
except Hong Eun-jo, would leave dead.

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,868
Dae-chu, my sword.

22
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,124
Bring it on.

23
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,625
Drop the titles.

24
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,835
Drop the ranks.

25
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,836
Drop the honorifics.

26
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,507
- You know how to fight?
- You're still talking?

27
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,884
What are you doing? Let's just go.

28
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,470
I never turn down a challenge.

29
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,146
I like that.

30
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,773
Officer Seo, are you just
going to stand there and watch?

31
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,317
Boys grow up fighting.

32
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,904
If I win, Hong Eun-jo will die
a natural death in this house.

33
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,198
And if I win,

34
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,284
she will live
a long, healthy life in my house.

35
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,161
You're acting like children.

36
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,078
Look, both of you,

37
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,622
I decide where I die!

38
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,583
Agreed?

39
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,335
- Agreed.
- What?

40
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,713
If either of you
can actually wield a sword--

41
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,767
You're good with a sword.

42
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,394
And you've got some strength.

43
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,731
What are you doing?

44
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,776
My lord.

45
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,987
How did you…

46
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,160
Eun-jo, follow me.

47
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,249
Oh, dear.

48
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,710
What do I do?

49
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,921
What's this sound?

50
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,047
Did you say Father's back?

51
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,217
Could you go and stop him? Please.

52
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,933
Father!

53
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,684
Father!

54
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,021
You…

55
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,272
I knew you would do this.

56
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,608
You really made Father…

57
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,611
No, Father!

58
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,114
Please! Enough already!

59
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,783
As her father, this is my fault.

60
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,285
Her father?

61
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,330
You keep saying that
to a concubine's daughter.

62
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,874
That's why she thinks
she can get her way in everything!

63
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,752
She lied to all of us about her marriage!

64
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,295
But it's not too late.

65
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,631
I will discipline her properly.

66
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,508
As a slave.

67
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,886
You, come out.

68
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,514
Come out!

69
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,208
You think I can't do it, right?

70
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,678
Move.

71
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,684
How pathetic.

72
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,144
I'm sick of this!

73
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,847
How long have you been here?

74
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,057
The whole time.

75
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,142
Leave.

76
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,435
I don't want us to look close.

77
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,187
Same here.

78
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,105
Leave, will you?

79
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,523
This is where I live.

80
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,276
Think about for whom
it would make more sense

81
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,944
to stand here by this wall.

82
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,573
Think about who would look cooler

83
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,657
standing by this wall.

84
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,119
The battle isn't over yet.

85
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,122
The judge will decide the winner,
not the sword.

86
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,707
You picked the wrong opponent.

87
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,376
I don't think so. My skills never fail me.

88
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,712
And I never give up.

89
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,799
Sorry to interrupt you
in the middle of a fight,

90
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,302
but you're not just going to stand there
until one of you leaves, right?

91
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,263
This isn't about your ego, right?

92
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,181
Not at all.

93
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,474
Never.

94
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,268
You've been standing like that
over an hour. Your leg must be numb.

95
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,105
Your back must hurt.

96
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,235
All right. How about this?

97
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,738
I'll count to three,
and then you'll go your separate ways.

98
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,658
All right. One.

99
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,660
Two.

100
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,911
Three!

101
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,287
Three and a half!

102
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,789
Four!

103
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,419
Wow, you had to go on four
so you wouldn't lose.

104
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,339
When it comes to childishness,
you two are tied.

105
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,590
My arm hurts.

106
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,595
I found out everything the day
before the wedding, and still let her go.

107
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,682
You should blame me.

108
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,601
Where is Eun-jo?

109
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,481
I told her to get some air.

110
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:27,530
<i>I told her to go outside and cool down.</i>

111
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,325
Hello!

112
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,077
Come and take a look at our ornaments.

113
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,454
Come on, Lady.

114
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,498
Come here.

115
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,374
Oh, my.

116
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,667
How about something like this?

117
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,669
Let's just see how it looks on you.

118
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,005
Oh, my.

119
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,175
It really brings out your features.
This is perfect for you.

120
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,762
How pretty.

121
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,473
Your face is glowing.

122
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,976
It's out-of-this-world beauty.

123
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,536
Do you want to try it?

124
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,538
Swing high

125
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,124
and leave all your worries in the sky.

126
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,544
I don't want to.

127
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,227
Hong-si seems fine.

128
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,146
She probably isn't.

129
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,981
<i>It's because you buried everything</i>

130
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,859
beneath the words "I'm fine."

131
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,319
You buried your heart.

132
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,904
She must be hiding her feelings again,

133
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,407
behind her calm face,

134
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,075
burying them all.

135
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,638
- Let's check out other places too.
- Sure.

136
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,032
Why are you following me around?

137
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,372
Well…

138
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,123
So I could pull you out

139
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,167
if you get lost in thought
and fall into a ditch,

140
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,961
pour you another drink
if you feel like one,

141
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,964
and pat your shoulder if you cry.

142
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,434
When did you notice?

143
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,731
It's hard to miss someone that tall.

144
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,901
I tried my best not to stand out,

145
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,902
but you got me.

146
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,450
The reason I sent the letter
to Lord Hong was…

147
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:45,955
What was the reason?

148
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,458
As the Grand Prince of this kingdom,

149
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,961
I meant to set right the wrongful marriage

150
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,630
and correct misguided customs.

151
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,173
I see.

152
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,301
And someone like that
sent a letter in my name.

153
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,054
I did?

154
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,224
I was in your body
when I wrote the letter.

155
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,810
I must have written your name by accident.

156
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,103
I see.

157
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,522
My name was written by my hand.

158
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,733
I know.

159
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,235
I was being rash again.

160
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,530
Hit me. I can take a hit.

161
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,157
Be gentle.

162
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,368
I'm not doing that.

163
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,330
I understand.

164
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,625
You were about to live as a widow,
not knowing when it would end.

165
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,503
Of course you wanted to find a way
to escape that family.

166
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,092
It had to happen at some point.

167
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,678
I'm relieved we switched back

168
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,929
before it was too late.

169
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,058
Are you all right?

170
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,317
Then it's fine.

171
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,862
<i>This is</i>

172
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,363
my proposal.

173
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,781
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

174
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,370
And…

175
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,538
You said you're all right.

176
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,665
That's all I need to hear today.

177
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,220
I'm sorry I couldn't be of help.

178
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,515
I'm the one who should apologize
for asking such a big favor.

179
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,024
Look here, Min-jik.

180
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,820
Why, if it isn't my cousin!

181
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,743
I was actually thinking
about visiting you after work.

182
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,329
Funny running into you here.

183
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,466
I should be on my way, or I'll be late.

184
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,346
I'm truly grateful.

185
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:11,016
As I said, it's because
he saved my life on the battlefield.

186
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,106
You must be Eun-jo.

187
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,774
Yes, sir.

188
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,777
Don't trouble yourself to see me out.

189
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,614
Please tell Min-jik
that I enjoyed my visit.

190
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,574
Yes, sir.

191
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,748
Eun-jo,

192
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,918
it's over now.

193
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,213
What do you mean?

194
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,090
As Your Highness commanded,

195
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:46,760
I said that it was easy money
from selling the land.

196
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,848
Let's keep this between us.

197
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,517
May I ask why?

198
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,397
I just hope
it will make things a little easier.

199
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,274
Pardon?

200
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,360
I heard that in the Gyeongo Year,

201
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:07,406
Lord Hong Min-jik had all his property
confiscated by the royal court.

202
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,409
Consider this its return.

203
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,925
My lord,

204
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,803
where are you coming from?

205
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,477
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,437
Did you…

207
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,650
Did you give all the land we received
from the lord from Naju

208
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,611
to the Chief Secretary's family?

209
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,659
Please take it back.

210
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,035
That marriage was my choice--

211
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,536
It was neither your choice

212
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,914
nor your responsibility

213
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,166
nor

214
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,627
your marriage.

215
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,505
It was my mistake.

216
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,052
With that land, we could live
the rest of our lives comfortably--

217
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,220
Enough.

218
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:15,057
Do not disgrace yourself anymore.
I have never treated you that way.

219
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,227
If you

220
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,521
truly wish to do good to me,

221
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,232
treat yourself with respect.

222
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,197
Whatever happened in that family,

223
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,117
forget it all.

224
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,248
And please forgive

225
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,251
your foolish father.

226
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,222
As you wished,

227
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,808
I've left it all behind me.

228
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,647
You must be hungry.

229
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,817
I will help my mother
and prepare the meal.

230
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,392
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

231
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,029
My Grand Prince Dowol
is a grown-up now, but has no spouse.

232
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,280
Thus, a formal marriage proposal is made
according to tradition. Please accept.

233
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,244
"Grand Prince Dowol"?

234
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,795
<i>It was Your Highness</i>
<i>who sent for Lord Hong?</i>

235
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,214
He was the Minister of War
of this kingdom.

236
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:14,259
I hear he led countless battles to victory
in the north.

237
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,513
As a man of virtue
living upon the land he has protected,

238
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,139
it is only right to wish him well,

239
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,600
and for his family

240
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,352
to live comfortably.

241
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,479
Are you sure it wasn't for Hong-si?

242
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,983
She only happens to be the daughter
of the man I wish well.

243
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,195
So it was for Physician Hong.

244
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,280
What? What's wrong?

245
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,074
Lord Hong Min-jik

246
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,618
was dismissed by His Majesty
in the Gyeongo Year.

247
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,871
The royal family
is practically the enemy of his family.

248
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,217
HYEMINSEO

249
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,848
Thank you.

250
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,477
You came back just in time.

251
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,520
Go back to work.

252
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,313
Yes, sir.

253
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,862
I'm so glad
that stupid marriage fell through!

254
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:19,032
I can finally enjoy a drink
when I'm on night duty.

255
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,118
That's what you're happy about?

256
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,870
I was going to drink with you too, dear.

257
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,121
What? "Dear"?

258
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,873
What, you boor?

259
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,124
- Dear?
- Boor?

260
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,667
- Dear?
- Boor?

261
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,877
- Dear?
- Boor?

262
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,794
- Dear?
- Boor?

263
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,087
Be quiet!

264
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,341
Eun-jo, I'm so happy for you.

265
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,014
Have you two already seen a physician?

266
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,724
Yes.

267
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,645
My stomach's been aching a little,
so I came to see if it was the plague.

268
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,856
But it turns out it was only constipation.

269
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,902
My head was spinning,
so I thought it was the plague…

270
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,820
You're just hung over.

271
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,363
You saw it too, right?

272
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,116
These days,
half the patients are like this.

273
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,368
I blame the false rumors
spreading through the capital.

274
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,040
I'm worried about the people
outside the capital.

275
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,833
I can't believe there's a plague.

276
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,468
<i>If the plague spreads into the capital,</i>
<i>it will unsettle the people.</i>

277
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,554
Plague comes every year.

278
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,557
If we let it be,
it will die down on its own.

279
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,312
My concern is that whenever His Majesty
goes hunting to Onyang,

280
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,773
the court is left unattended for too long.

281
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,361
Perhaps we should establish
a hunting ground closer to the capital.

282
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,657
There are people's dwellings and farmlands
around the capital.

283
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,200
That will not be allowed.

284
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,372
You should have made an appointment.

285
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,415
His Highness is out of the palace
at the moment.

286
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,879
Please inform him that I wish to see him
regarding my daughter.

287
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,512
I can't stop coughing today.

288
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,764
You should go to the Royal Pharmacy.

289
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,394
My physician has left to accompany
His Majesty on his hunting trip.

290
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,022
I've had asthma since I was young.

291
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,860
I've lived in your body,

292
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,362
and there was no lingering illness.

293
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,197
You have a perfectly healthy body.

294
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,865
It started a few days ago.

295
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,624
Did you get hurt
in the fight the other day?

296
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,209
- Let me see.
- I'm not hurt.

297
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,377
It merely tickles.

298
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,004
I'm more worried about him.

299
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,006
If I have a small injury like this,

300
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,258
he must have nearly died.

301
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,510
Why did you even fight?

302
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,679
The only way to deal
with those bent on bullying you

303
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,264
is to ignore them.

304
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,059
He's so twisted.
I almost feel sorry for him.

305
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,229
Do you think
that's why he didn't let you go?

306
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,107
What else could it be?

307
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,775
You don't want to know.

308
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,652
Shall we go eat?

309
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,155
All of a sudden?

310
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,573
You've been working all day.

311
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,326
You have no patients, no family,

312
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,037
and no husband.

313
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,164
I'm sure you have nothing
in your stomach either.

314
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,458
<i>He knows that my marriage fell through.</i>

315
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,338
By any chance…

316
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,672
Your Highness?

317
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,301
It's really you.

318
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,887
What an unexpected place to meet you.

319
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,557
How many other women were you seeing
while you were in my body?

320
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,559
It wasn't me.

321
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,146
I knew you wouldn't remember me.

322
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,274
I'm Chief State Councilor
Han Seung-rok's daughter, Ji-yeon.

323
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,111
Right, we've met before, at the palace.

324
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,113
Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,656
I've heard that

326
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,077
Your Highness has rejected
every lady in the capital.

327
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,748
What brings you here?

328
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,375
There's a plague going around.

329
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,046
My father sent me to deliver
some medicinal herbs to the Hyeminseo.

330
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,882
That's typical of him.

331
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,967
Please give him my regards.

332
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,345
Yes, Your Highness.

333
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,313
This thing is full. What's inside?

334
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,649
Give it back.

335
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,776
Come on.

336
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,071
We're going in the same direction.

337
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,241
Maybe I should ask her
to cook the broody hen today.

338
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,951
What?

339
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,830
Are you going to see my mother?

340
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,039
Right.

341
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,291
I called her "Mother" for a while,

342
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,501
in a way, she's my mother.

343
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,546
About your marriage proposal--

344
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,047
This isn't the place for that talk.

345
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,298
Later.

346
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,175
Let's eat first.

347
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,969
No.

348
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:49,886
Listen to me.

349
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,808
You should be with someone
who befits your title as Grand Prince.

350
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,768
Why should I, when I have you?

351
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,020
Someone who?

352
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,773
Don't act like you don't understand me.

353
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,068
Someone like
the Chief State Councilor's daughter.

354
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,195
Are you jealous?

355
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,113
No, I'm not.

356
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,158
My mother forced me to meet her.

357
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,200
And it was only once.

358
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,203
I didn't ask.

359
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,289
Could you at least pretend to be curious?

360
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,959
I'm saying this for your sake.

361
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,128
If you really want what's good for me,

362
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,880
cook the broody hen for me.

363
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,925
Why don't you ask the Chief Royal Cook?

364
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,261
Wait, where are you going?

365
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,221
You forgot this.

366
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,516
Keep up this bickering

367
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,436
and your families won't just be enemies,
they'll be archenemies.

368
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,773
Well, I guess most people in love
end up enemies.

369
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,233
That's very natural.

370
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,861
Is that what you're hoping for?

371
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,323
Jealous?

372
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,450
That's nonsense.

373
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,912
If this is about the broody hen again,
go away.

374
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,039
I really…

375
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,165
Goodness gracious!

376
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,958
Physician Hong, it's me.

377
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,835
It's you. You scared me.

378
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,422
I needed the headscarf
to get into the capital.

379
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,674
If anyone recognizes me,
I'll be in trouble.

380
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,971
Who are you?

381
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,433
He's someone I know.

382
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,727
Why are you dressed like a woman?

383
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,563
Something happened at the leper camp,

384
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,234
so I came to ask Physician Hong for help.

385
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,196
Leper camp?

386
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,618
So, the plague started at the leper camp?

387
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,535
Plague?

388
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,996
That's what the physician
from Hwalinseo said

389
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,331
when he came by yesterday.

390
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,626
Some have been vomiting
and also running high fevers.

391
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,835
What's the diagnosis?

392
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,587
We don't know.

393
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,548
So they haven't even been
properly examined.

394
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,760
The Hwalinseo was established
to deal with plagues and provide relief.

395
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,639
Most people avoid the leper camp,
even physicians.

396
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,350
And I'm no different,
even though I have to live there

397
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,352
because of my ill family.

398
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,356
Physician Hong is the only one
willing to help us.

399
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,234
Shall we hurry?

400
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,573
Wait, give us a moment.

401
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,497
What's the matter?

402
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,085
This is where we treat patients.
There's a risk of infection.

403
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,337
I'm a physician who treats people,

404
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,965
and it's my responsibility
to control who enters this place.

405
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,759
Please follow her advice.

406
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,098
I'll get going.

407
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,566
Dae-chu,

408
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,986
go and find out
which physician came by the leper camp.

409
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,070
Yes, Your Highness.

410
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,953
We grouped those
with the same symptoms together.

411
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,331
Let me take a look.

412
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:13,757
It's tasty.

413
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,801
Stop.

414
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,386
It's dirty.

415
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,013
Spit it out.

416
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,683
It's our food.

417
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,269
Are you hungry too?

418
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,146
Do you want some?

419
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,740
I…

420
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,562
I saw the man you came with
on that hill over there.

421
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,066
Thank you.

422
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,667
To the right.

423
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,919
- To the right?
- Yes.

424
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,129
There.

425
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,880
There are so many here.

426
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,132
Good.

427
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,003
Geum-dol, come down.

428
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,383
How did it go?

429
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,760
I'll explain on the way.

430
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,428
I'll be right back.

431
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,389
Brother, are you coming back too?

432
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,390
Yes.

433
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,476
"Brother"?

434
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,731
<i>So, the water</i>
<i>they drew from the valley went bad?</i>

435
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,357
They drank it without knowing,

436
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,985
and now they've all come down
with dysentery.

437
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,737
It'll take a while to notify the Hyeminseo

438
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,155
and secure the necessary herbs.

439
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,868
My lord.

440
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,748
It seems you have urgent business
at the Hyeminseo.

441
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,750
Eun-jo, go ahead.

442
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,710
In the meantime,

443
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,296
I'll have a word with this gentleman.

444
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,718
I won't cause any trouble.

445
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,762
There are patients waiting for you.

446
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,973
I'll go ahead then.

447
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,696
I thought I might land a post at court

448
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,615
through your brother's connections,

449
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,951
but my father messed it up.

450
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:32,497
I can't believe he broke off her marriage
and let her work at the Hyeminseo again.

451
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,082
She works at the Hyeminseo?

452
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,836
She must be getting nosy again,
playing physician and all.

453
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,839
She'd better worry about me
rather than some random people.

454
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,091
What a wench.

455
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,593
Isn't it a good thing?

456
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,513
What?

457
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,307
Worrying about others.

458
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,239
My lord, you're back.

459
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,616
Yes.

460
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,410
Could you prepare some tea?

461
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,536
Yes, my lord.

462
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,209
It'll be ready shortly.

463
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,421
I failed to recognize

464
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,592
Your Highness the other day,
now that you are fully grown.

465
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,969
Please forgive my discourtesy.

466
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,805
You may speak freely.

467
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,775
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

468
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,446
Please stop visiting Eun-jo.

469
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,575
If it's because of His Majesty--

470
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,577
Do not try to persuade me.

471
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,871
I apologize
for what happened with His Majesty.

472
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,749
- I've been nothing but sincere--
- That's exactly what I don't like.

473
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,502
Whoever you're with
will be at His Majesty's mercy.

474
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,254
Your sincerity is

475
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,299
exactly what makes her useful
to His Majesty.

476
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,384
I will not send Eun-jo

477
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,888
to the palace
where nothing but death awaits her.

478
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,890
And especially not

479
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,059
through marriage.

480
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,270
If that's the reason,

481
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,522
I can leave the palace to protect her--

482
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,815
No.

483
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,651
Please do nothing.

484
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,278
That is the only way

485
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,529
to protect Eun-jo.

486
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,662
What if I must do it anyway?

487
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,375
What if I push for it despite everything?

488
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,377
If you persist, despite everything,

489
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,837
I will tell Eun-jo

490
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,923
her marriage would mean my death.

491
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,593
And if you go so far
as to actually carry out this marriage,

492
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,887
I will truly take my own life

493
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,139
to stop it.

494
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,898
I don't want to hurt Eun-jo either.

495
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,901
Please, I humbly ask for your help.

496
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,257
You're still here.

497
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,806
How was it at the leper camp?

498
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,225
I took care of the urgent cases.

499
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,061
The Hyeminseo was kind enough
to supply me with plenty of herbs.

500
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,354
That's great to hear.

501
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,273
The Superintendent said

502
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,861
the herbs were bestowed
by the Grand Prince,

503
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,197
and that I should thank the royal court.

504
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,241
Thank you.

505
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,374
By the way,

506
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,754
what did you talk about with my lord?

507
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,341
Just exchanged greetings.

508
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,260
He saw me at the palace when I was young,

509
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,678
although I don't remember it.

510
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,931
So he knows you're the Grand Prince?

511
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,518
He knew.

512
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,897
I see.

513
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,775
Right.

514
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,277
Geum-dol was looking for you,
calling you "brother."

515
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,987
What did you do to him?

516
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,991
I guess my charm slipped out.

517
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,412
Do you always leave your charm
everywhere you go?

518
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,498
Yes, just so you can pick it up.

519
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,292
Why don't you pick it up yourself?

520
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,919
You're the one who left it behind.

521
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,337
I'm not sure if I could.

522
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,755
There's just too much charm.

523
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,177
Where does your confidence come from?

524
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,930
I learned it.
It's part of the royal education.

525
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,808
So that self-praise is learned.

526
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:04,811
Why are you smiling?

527
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,606
Why do you keep smiling?

528
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,816
Nothing.

529
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,776
I just want to keep smiling with you.

530
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,822
Today, I'll do it as much as I can.

531
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,179
Young Master, you're here again.

532
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,268
What is it?

533
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:50,064
The First Young Master ordered me
to burn everything in this room.

534
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,276
Leave it.

535
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,195
It's still

536
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,115
warm in there.

537
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,159
Yes, Young Master.

538
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,067
What? The marriage proposal…

539
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,285
Where did I drop it?

540
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,454
I'm so clumsy.

541
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,251
Did you lose something?

542
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,795
No, my lord.

543
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,590
I heard that

544
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,968
you met the Grand Prince at the Hyeminseo.

545
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,223
His Highness has a kind heart,

546
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,350
and has helped me on several occasions.

547
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,978
He's only fulfilling his duties
as a member of the royal family.

548
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,482
Yes, my lord.

549
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,194
Do you remember what you said?

550
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:22,323
I wish to live here with you and Mother
for the rest of my life.

551
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,159
I have never wanted a woman's life.

552
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,703
Do you still feel that way?

553
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,795
Yes, my lord.

554
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,715
Then do that.

555
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,027
My lady, I'm coming in.

556
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,740
A letter from the palace?

557
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,701
Is it Her Majesty the Queen Consort?

558
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,542
What?

559
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,045
The Queen Dowager wishes to see me.

560
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,092
Where's the Grand Prince?

561
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:26,095
We sent a man to his residence,
so he'll soon…

562
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,723
His Highness is here.

563
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,858
What is it you wish to say?

564
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,031
You look well put together.

565
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,741
This will suffice.

566
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,369
Are we expecting someone?

567
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,207
I'm not in the mood to meet anyone today.

568
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,876
It's not just anyone.

569
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,755
It's your impetuous companion
from the other day.

570
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,966
Lady Hae-rim of the Shin family is here.

571
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,968
From now on, remember that name.

572
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,347
It's the name of the woman
you had a night's fun with.

573
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,187
Hae-rim of the Shin family is present,
Her Majesty.

574
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,815
I believe I don't need
to introduce my son to you.

575
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,484
Yes, Your Majesty.

576
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,070
Have a seat.

577
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,704
I apologize for what I'm about to say.

578
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,665
Your Majesty,
there was a misunderstanding.

579
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,085
I hear you're the Queen Consort's niece.

580
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,797
We're in-laws?

581
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,967
I though Your Highness knew.

582
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,720
Kids, mind yourselves.

583
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,351
I heard your engagement
fell through recently.

584
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,563
Was it perhaps
because of the Grand Prince?

585
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,235
- Pardon?
- No need to answer that.

586
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,655
That is an improper question.

587
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,782
Even words of comfort
could be too much for her now.

588
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,283
How could you ask her that?

589
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,994
What I said the other day
was nothing but a bluff.

590
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,124
I'm afraid I have dishonored you.

591
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,251
I will explain in private.
Please stand up.

592
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,089
Yes, Your Highness.

593
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,174
Sit down.

594
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,342
Yes, Your Majesty.

595
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,220
I'll keep it short.

596
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,222
You both enjoyed what you were doing,

597
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,182
so no need to talk about who is to blame.

598
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,100
Just get married.

599
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,396
It makes us double in-laws,
a great blessing for the royal family.

600
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,278
I'm saying this now

601
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,698
only because I don't want you to persist

602
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,868
in troubling this lady
of the Queen Consort's family.

603
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:55,995
I have

604
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,205
someone I hold dear.

605
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,088
Forget her and move on.

606
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,215
I can never forget her.

607
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,136
That is my answer.

608
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,236
Find out when Hong-si
comes back from sick leave.

609
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,655
If she's recovered,
send her to me at once.

610
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,334
When you said
you stained my name the other day,

611
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,712
is this what you meant?

612
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,464
Probably.

613
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,092
What happened that day

614
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,428
and today are my fault.

615
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,638
I apologize.

616
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,229
<i>His eyes are on another woman.</i>

617
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,731
I wonder who she is.

618
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,234
Who is the woman

619
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,402
reflected in his shining eyes?

620
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,541
I'm seeing improvements.

621
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,210
That's wonderful.

622
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,711
Thank you for your help.

623
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,422
Eun-jo!

624
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,553
What is it?

625
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,597
Over there!

626
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,559
What's there?

627
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,310
What's that?

628
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,778
The rice grew on our food tree.

629
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,117
This is enough to feed us
for a whole year.

630
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,077
Who gave us precious rice?

631
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,206
FILL THE LEPER CAMP'S GRANARY WITH THIS

632
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,126
<i>Was it the Grand Prince?</i>

633
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,962
I'm not sure if we can really take it.

634
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,965
You need to eat well to regain strength.

635
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,925
That must be
what whoever sent this hoped for.

636
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,927
Gil-dong!

637
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,971
What? Gil-dong?

638
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,681
It must be him.

639
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,559
It seems like Gil-dong
is looking after us as well.

640
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,521
They said he stole
thousands of rice sacks, and it was true.

641
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,897
It was true.

642
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:33,360
No, you're all completely mistaken.

643
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,614
Gil-dong was a petty thief
who stole small things.

644
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,908
And Gil-dong is dead already.

645
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,536
Hello?

646
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,747
Can you hear me?

647
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,878
Eun-jo, did Gil-dong come back to life?

648
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,798
I'm a physician, and I'm telling you,

649
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,842
once you're dead, it's over.
You can't come back.

650
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,928
No, Gil-dong never dies.

651
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,057
Now he's immortal?

652
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,434
Oh, dear.

653
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,645
<i>Is this going to start another rumor?</i>

654
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,979
I thought

655
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,566
everyone in this world wanted us dead.

656
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,860
But it seems this person
wants us to keep living.

657
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,571
Just like you, Physician Hong.

658
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,656
What?

659
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,491
I didn't do anything.

660
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,047
<i>Leper camp?</i>

661
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,549
If we move this leper camp here,

662
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:41,053
and make this entire area
a hunting ground, including the forest,

663
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,763
hardly any homes will be affected.

664
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,139
I agree.

665
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,183
Does the king really need
a new hunting ground?

666
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,811
Every time he goes hunting,

667
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,522
Father has to accompany him
to the Onyang Royal Villa.

668
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,564
And it's a hassle.

669
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,276
Because it makes it harder for you
to manage the court.

670
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,530
Look at you, all grown up.

671
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,451
By the way,
why did Hong Min-jik have to appear

672
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,079
and cause trouble when Father is away?

673
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,292
He cleared the debt with land.
Where did he get it from?

674
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,335
It's his cousin's land.

675
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,548
That lowly girl
should have stayed with our family.

676
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,550
Why is that?

677
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,511
Father is keeping an eye on Hong Min-jik.

678
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,431
That girl would've made a hostage,
in a way.

679
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,101
If it's not our grandfather,
it should be fine.

680
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,020
What do you mean?

681
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,232
We can give her what she was expecting.

682
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,359
What was she expecting?

683
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,488
That vile girl as my concubine?
Are you crazy?

684
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:46,743
Wait.

685
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,163
If not me,

686
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,665
what about you?

687
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,588
You won't be able
to see His Highness for a while.

688
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,965
He can't leave the palace
because of the Royal School.

689
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,302
I see.

690
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,639
His Highness sent rice
to the leper camp, right?

691
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,520
I came to offer my thanks.
Please pass them along.

692
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,481
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

693
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,150
Gil-dong came back to life!

694
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,194
Did he really come back from the dead?

695
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,778
He's immortal!

696
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,530
Wait.

697
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,907
- Is that rumor true?
- What?

698
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,034
That he took rice to the leper camp.

699
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,538
Leper camp?
Eun-jo's been going there a lot lately.

700
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,081
I wonder if she saw Gil-dong.

701
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,666
I told you.

702
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,668
There is nowhere in Joseon

703
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,005
that Gil-dong's hands cannot reach!

704
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,926
Gil-dong is incredible!

705
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,554
I see you came to offer your prayers.

706
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:36,270
The lord returned safely,
so I came to offer my prayers of thanks.

707
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,774
This is my daughter
whom you've always wanted to see.

708
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,904
I'm Hong Eun-jo.

709
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,618
Could you give me the names
of your family members?

710
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,328
I would like to offer prayers for them.

711
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,958
That is so generous of you.

712
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,092
HONG MIN-JIK, HONG DAE-IL
HONG EUN-JO, CHUN-SEOM

713
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,353
I appreciate your kindness.

714
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,606
They say, before Gyeongo Year,

715
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:24,401
Lord Hong's benevolence
reached everyone in the capital.

716
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,278
I was one of them.

717
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,284
Do you know

718
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,787
what kind of person the current king is?

719
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,500
I do not know much

720
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:44,504
about the affairs of those in high places.

721
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,424
I'm a mere commoner,
struggling to get by every day.

722
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:48,884
You should know.

723
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,096
That man held a blade

724
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,848
to Lord Hong's throat.

725
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,143
A blade?

726
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,937
That was in the Gyeongo Year,

727
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,899
the bloody year.

728
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,069
Punishing them based solely on the appeal

729
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,946
would bring great misfortune
upon Your Majesty in the future.

730
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,826
<i>Lord Hong nearly lost his life</i>
<i>for offering frank counsel.</i>

731
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,996
Punishing immoral writings

732
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,165
is right and necessary.

733
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,210
<i>And Im Sa-hyeong,</i>
<i>who was a mere censor at the time,</i>

734
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,961
<i>saved his life with honeyed words.</i>

735
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,131
<i>Encouraged by those honeyed words,</i>

736
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,885
<i>the king ruthlessly purged all officials</i>

737
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,887
<i>who would not bend to him,</i>

738
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:39,226
<i>and oppressed the late king's concubines</i>
<i>and his own half-brother</i>

739
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,188
<i>under the pretext</i>
<i>that they threatened the throne.</i>

740
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,524
I will not live in disgrace like this!

741
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,278
Mother!

742
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,702
<i>That year,</i>

743
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,995
<i>the king stained the court with blood</i>

744
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:02,249
<i>and filled the court</i>
<i>with his puppet Im Sa-hyeong</i>

745
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,421
<i>and officials who were his extensions.</i>

746
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,757
And now,
he's leading Joseon toward its doom.

747
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,428
I knew that

748
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,097
his frank words had angered His Majesty,

749
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,726
but I didn't know
he went through all that in the palace.

750
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,769
There's no way you could've known.

751
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,314
The royal family
and the court officials covered it up.

752
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,527
And my lord also…

753
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,164
Why are you telling me this?

754
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,041
A child must know

755
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,377
their father's history.

756
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,136
Now, Lord Hong is at peace,

757
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,388
after enduring that ordeal.

758
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,141
So I'm telling you this story
out of joy and respect.

759
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,437
I see.

760
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,626
I met Gil-dong myself.

761
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,421
CATCH GIL-DONG

762
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,598
Word is spreading among the people

763
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,184
that Gil-dong has come back to life.

764
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,273
HONG EUN-JO

765
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,484
A godlike hero.

766
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,069
Perhaps…

767
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,572
we could use a god.

768
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:03,286
Bring me every rumor about Gil-dong.

769
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:14,881
<i>It may not be wise</i>
<i>to ask the lord about the Gyeongo Year.</i>

770
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,391
Let's eat.

771
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,771
Chicken soup?

772
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,483
You said you wanted to eat
the broody hen I cook.

773
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,693
What?

774
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,237
You scared me.

775
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,281
What's wrong?

776
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,575
Because you got only half
after the lord was served?

777
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,996
It's the broody hen again.

778
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,041
When did I ask you
to cook the broody hen for me?

779
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,295
Last time.

780
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,213
You're talking like a different person.

781
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:56,965
It was a different…

782
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,427
Never mind.

783
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,307
You've been looking upset.

784
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,808
Is everything all right?

785
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:10,770
I'm fine. Don't worry.

786
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,065
I know. I won't.

787
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,650
You told me

788
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,611
not to worry about you at all.

789
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,530
Did that person say that? Not to worry?

790
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,532
What else did you hear?

791
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,451
That person is you.

792
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,661
Did you forget?

793
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,333
You promised
that you would never lift a finger.

794
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,001
You promised that yourself.

795
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,338
Did you accept that promise?

796
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,971
Why are you sitting on the roof
every night these days?

797
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,848
Because I keep hoping

798
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,975
it will look smaller from here.

799
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,853
Why did you lie about the Royal School
just to turn Hong-si away?

800
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,775
Please do nothing.

801
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,860
That is the only way

802
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,778
to protect Eun-jo.

803
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,321
Do nothing.

804
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,531
You must protect your mother.

805
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,908
MARRIAGE

806
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:08,787
I forgot my place for a moment.

807
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,624
Are you not going to visit the leper camp?

808
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:21,925
I heard that you saw plague
spreading in the leper camp.

809
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,593
- Is that true?
- Yes.

810
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:28,223
So the plague spreading outside
started in the leper camp?

811
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,850
No, it is hard to say.

812
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,310
I'm the one to decide.

813
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,232
A plague.

814
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,402
It's a good pretext.

815
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,618
He said
I would never have to lift a finger?

816
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,412
As if.

817
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,622
He put all kinds of words in my mouth.

818
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,106
Eun-jo.

819
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,028
Did you forget something?

820
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,905
I thought you should know…

821
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,534
Well,

822
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,912
I overheard something while
I was drinking with Hwalinseo's slaves.

823
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,789
Overheard what?

824
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,835
<i>They're shutting down</i>
<i>the leper camp tonight.</i>

825
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:42,172
<i>The order was</i>
<i>to pull it all down and burn it.</i>

826
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,132
<i>I feel so bad.</i>

827
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,682
Physician Hong?

828
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,184
She said if I asked you for help,

829
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,853
you would know who to go to.

830
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,772
All right.

831
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,611
Everyone, wake up!

832
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,404
Wake up. Hurry.

833
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,739
Physician Hong?

834
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,450
We must get all the patients out now.

835
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,703
Geum-dol, go outside and wake everyone up.
Tell them they must all leave.

836
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,801
Should we really do this?

837
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,554
I'm an animal. Animals don't judge.

838
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,264
They only follow orders.

839
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,642
Do you think you can move?

840
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:36,893
Come with me.

841
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,394
What is going on?

842
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,897
I'll explain later.
We must get the patients…

843
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,441
Sir, your leg…

844
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,276
I got injured while hunting yesterday.

845
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,319
It's all right.

846
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,741
The soldiers are here already.

847
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:52,659
Wait here.

848
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,626
What's going on?

849
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:05,296
<i>They've given the order to kill</i>
<i>all the sick here and shut the place down.</i>

850
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,050
Run!

851
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,064
Run to the gate in the back!

852
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,500
Sun-dol!

853
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,377
Sun-dol!

854
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,799
- Wait there.
- It's too dangerous!

855
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,895
Finish it.

856
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,508
- Hold my hand.
- Go!

857
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,800
Just let my boy live.

858
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:33,968
Hold my hand now!

859
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,803
We could all die!

860
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,889
Please just go.

861
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,808
I'll come back. Wait here.

862
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,464
Physician Hong!

863
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,999
Hong Eun-jo.

864
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,391
<i>Is this funny?</i>

865
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:49,187
<i>So many people nearly died,</i>
<i>all because of your family's greed.</i>

866
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,189
<i>You know where we are.</i>

867
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,774
<i>How could you do this?</i>

868
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,192
<i>I can't help it.</i>

869
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,778
<i>When I'm with you, I become fearless.</i>

870
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,863
<i>Gil-dong is alive.</i>

871
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,115
<i>You go to such lengths to protect him.</i>

872
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,077
<i>Gil-dong must be someone dear to you.</i>

873
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,621
<i>Make sure nothing about Gil-dong</i>
<i>is spoken of.</i>

874
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,206
<i>Please take care of it.</i>

875
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,374
<i>What about Your Highness?</i>

876
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,458
<i>Leave?</i>

877
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,876
<i>Where?</i>

878
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,712
