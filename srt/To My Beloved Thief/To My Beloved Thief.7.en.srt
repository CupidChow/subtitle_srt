1
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,475
I'm back.

2
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,436
I'm finally back…

3
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,237
Who are you…

4
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,533
Are you Gil-dong?

5
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,411
<i>Someone held a blade to my throat.</i>

6
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,580
Does that mean…

7
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,540
Dae-chu, the sword.

8
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,264
Holding a blade to my throat

9
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,434
won't get you the answer you want.

10
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,561
I don't think so.

11
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,357
A blade is the quickest way
to carve out what lies in a human heart.

12
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,070
If you think I'm Gil-dong,

13
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,571
report me to the constabulary.

14
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,407
That is all I can say.

15
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,961
If this single blade

16
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,589
were enough to make you confess
who you are,

17
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,383
I might truly have taken your head.

18
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,471
Why did you put me to the test?

19
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,307
I'm not taking anything
to the constabulary.

20
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,393
Come with me.

21
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,395
We need Gil-dong's name.

22
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,857
Gil-dong's name?

23
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,533
Hong Eun-jo!

24
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,910
Where is she?

25
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,870
Hong Eun-jo!

26
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,416
Is that you?

27
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,984
All the way here,

28
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,778
I prayed that
I might never return to my own body,

29
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,698
if only I could let you return to yours.

30
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,458
I was waiting for you.

31
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,793
I thought that if I moved,

32
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:35,048
we would miss each other like last time.

33
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,594
Did you get hurt anywhere?

34
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,972
No, I'm fine.

35
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,145
Just for a moment.

36
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,898
I have no hidden intentions.

37
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,525
I just want to see
if this is a dream or not.

38
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,747
You can wake up from the nightmare now.

39
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,959
I didn't say this before,

40
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,795
but I was afraid I might never come back.

41
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,130
I was scared

42
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,216
every night.

43
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,227
Though it must have been worse for you,

44
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,645
becoming a widow all of a sudden.

45
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,025
It's good to see you again, Hong Eun-jo.

46
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,778
Every second, I was afraid

47
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,863
I might never be able to say this.

48
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,621
So

49
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,207
who held the sword to your throat?

50
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,919
Gil-dong turned me down on the spot.

51
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,171
He said that he was different
from what the rumors say,

52
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,841
and that he didn't kill the Chief Censor.

53
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,181
I SHALL MEET HER MYSELF

54
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,686
Yourself?

55
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,483
<i>If I tell him the truth, he'll be worried.</i>

56
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,152
A bandit.

57
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,320
A bandit?

58
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,073
You always travel with guards,
so you probably never run into them.

59
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,451
But someone like me,
who goes around alone,

60
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,954
runs into them as often
as you run into wild animals at night.

61
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,956
Did the shock mess with your head?

62
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,126
How could you be so calm
about running into a bandit?

63
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,922
The first couple of times
surprised me too.

64
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,924
Also…

65
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:48,014
Wouldn't it be strange for a thief
to be scared of a bandit?

66
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,268
If you think about it,
we're in the same line of work.

67
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,645
This is no time for jokes.

68
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,107
I'm just trying to reassure you.

69
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,487
Are you really all right?

70
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,280
Look.

71
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,407
My neck's still attached here. See?

72
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,910
No, you can't see it.

73
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,621
You can't see
how shattered my heart is from the shock.

74
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,290
How great is that?

75
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,418
If I could feel it,
it'd mean I'm not in my body.

76
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,509
I'm standing on my own feet,

77
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,260
speaking with my own mouth

78
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,181
and seeing with my eyes.

79
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,892
I can't believe how happy this makes me.

80
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,115
The hoofprints lead into that alley.

81
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,783
Follow them.

82
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,368
Yes, sir.

83
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,245
- Follow them.
- Yes, sir.

84
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,583
Your Highness!

85
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,673
How did you two already…

86
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,299
Well…

87
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,594
We happened to run into each other.

88
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,138
I sent out a carrier pigeon.

89
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,055
What?

90
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,849
It's this way, sir!

91
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,226
The soldiers are chasing Your Highness.

92
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,352
Already?

93
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,189
Right. The State Tribunal's soldiers
were blocking the way.

94
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,566
What's going on?

95
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,651
You're talking as if you saw it yourself.

96
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,738
Someone described it so vividly

97
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,116
that it feels like I saw it myself.

98
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,826
Right?

99
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:36,289
<i>Only His Majesty and the Chief Secretary</i>
<i>can order the State Tribunal to act.</i>

100
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,540
<i>And His Majesty</i>

101
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,376
<i>has no reason to break his promise</i>
<i>from the Gyeongo Year.</i>

102
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,129
<i>So it must be the Chief Secretary.</i>

103
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,424
<i>But why?</i>

104
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,134
Dae-chu,

105
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,970
when have I been acting
out of character recently?

106
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,349
When you punished the Chief Censor
and saved the people?

107
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,812
Don't you think it was kind of random
how I carried out justice?

108
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,690
Wait here.

109
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,650
Can we have a word?

110
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,280
Do you remember the ledger
you gave me as Gil-dong?

111
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,157
Is it from the Chief Secretary's place?

112
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,533
No.

113
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,745
<i>The Chief Censor meant to have it burned,</i>
<i>and I happened to find it.</i>

114
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,748
The Chief Censor tried to burn it?

115
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,585
Now I'm seeing the big picture.

116
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,212
What picture?

117
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:26,964
The portrait.

118
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,884
Why are you asking me this now?

119
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,305
I'll explain later.

120
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,765
You just keep your promise

121
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,809
that you wouldn't be caught
by anyone but me.

122
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,145
Something happened, right?

123
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,230
Answer me first.

124
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,399
Fine.

125
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,278
In any case, don't worry about me.

126
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,447
What's all this about?

127
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,532
Dae-chu.

128
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,078
Yes, Your Highness.

129
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,120
Escort her home.

130
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,289
And if you run into any bandits,

131
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,874
crush them on my behalf.

132
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,217
Hey, over here.

133
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,309
It seemed like
you were hurrying somewhere.

134
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,022
Only I, the Grand Prince,
can ask questions.

135
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,566
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

136
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,610
I'm questioning a suspect now.

137
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,738
Your Highness is suspected
of freeing Gil-dong, the thief.

138
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,739
<i>Gil-dong?</i>

139
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,950
You're pretty good.

140
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,952
You found out.

141
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,289
Are you admitting to doing it?

142
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,040
I have no reason to hide it.

143
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,048
Take me to the State Tribunal.

144
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,758
Yes, Your Highness!

145
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,806
Stay out of it for now.

146
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,391
I understand you're concerned,

147
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,351
but there is nothing you can do.

148
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,022
<i>He said he had no reason to hide it.</i>

149
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,733
He can't afford to lose face
as a member of the royal family.

150
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,654
It's almost embarrassing that

151
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,617
the dirt you dug up on the royal family,
as a so-called virtuous scholar,

152
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,995
was merely the freeing
of a righteous thief helping the people.

153
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,961
It seems I have served my purpose.
I shall take my leave.

154
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,213
I just can't bring myself

155
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,216
to side with any of you in this fight.

156
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,517
The soldiers are chasing Your Highness.

157
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,437
Your Highness is suspected
of freeing Gil-dong, the thief.

158
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,730
Take me to the State Tribunal.

159
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,078
Did you hear some sad news or something?

160
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,705
Something like

161
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,625
the Grand Prince
being detained by the State Tribunal?

162
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,711
I have nothing more to add, Young Master.

163
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,965
Why are you using honorifics
all of a sudden?

164
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,634
I see.

165
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,844
You're scared now.

166
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,263
You're scared I might disclose everything.

167
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,766
I have no reason to be scared,

168
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,685
even if you disclose it.

169
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,647
I'm thinking about when to disclose it

170
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,273
for the greatest impact.

171
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,655
You could've at least told me
that he was the Grand Prince.

172
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,783
Then I wouldn't have given you
that stupid advice

173
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,119
that no one was coming to your rescue.

174
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,997
You can mock me all you want.

175
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,999
I can endure your mockery
a thousand times over.

176
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,335
But please don't speak of him

177
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,878
so lightly.

178
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:58,008
Not once has he done anything
deserving mockery.

179
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,060
Do you really think so?

180
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,441
Why don't you worry
about the cloud over yourself first?

181
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,029
No one is coming
to rescue the lady of the annex.

182
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,824
The Grand Prince
will soon meet his downfall.

183
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,511
I escorted her to the front gate.

184
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,429
How did she look?

185
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,306
She seemed quite baffled.

186
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,228
By the way,

187
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,315
where was I going on horseback
at this late hour?

188
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,859
Did you forget already?

189
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,820
You said you were going to save Hong-si
from Lim Jae-i.

190
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,071
I did?

191
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,324
Your Highness, you're scaring me.

192
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,450
All you say lately is,

193
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,743
"I did that?"

194
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,244
And, "Oh, I did that!"

195
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,746
Do you realize that?

196
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,419
She was almost saved
by her Prince Charming.

197
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,213
Too bad.

198
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,422
What are you…

199
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,842
Your Highness, at this point,

200
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,553
it's safe to say your memory is gone,
not just deteriorating.

201
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,765
Dae-chu,

202
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,184
I've been pretty nice
to you lately, right?

203
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,272
Do you have a way
to escape this situation?

204
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,107
One way I know for sure is

205
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,192
a honey trap.

206
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,860
No chance.

207
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,404
Pardon my interruption.

208
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,573
By order, I can't give you much time.

209
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,911
Just insist that it was a mistake.
There's no other way.

210
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,748
They made their move,

211
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,793
so I might as well respond accordingly.

212
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,465
<i>What?</i>

213
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,553
The Grand Prince was detained
by the State Tribunal?

214
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,972
And the person
who arrested the Grand Prince

215
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,431
happens to be…

216
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,810
Hae-rim.

217
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,645
My lady, you're here…

218
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:16,981
Go and tell them.

219
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,698
My lady wishes to see Grand Prince Dowol.

220
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,533
His Highness is detained now.

221
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,743
Tell your lady that she cannot.

222
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,204
It will only take a moment.

223
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,330
What?

224
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,624
It will feel much longer for me.

225
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,459
Why don't you count it?

226
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,045
Sir.

227
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,133
You'll need to leave soon,
so make sure it's enough.

228
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,843
Right.

229
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,303
You're only taking half of it

230
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,555
because it's the cost of two heads.

231
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,308
My lady.

232
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,362
You are the State Tribunal's secretary,

233
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,032
so you must know
what happened to the Grand Prince.

234
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,868
Who on earth arrested His Highness
and caused all this trouble?

235
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,078
Actually, it's obvious.

236
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,581
Must be some ignorant, thoughtless man.

237
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,584
You have seen him many times already,

238
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,127
and you're seeing him right now.

239
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,923
And you're right about the man.

240
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,218
I'm playing the villain here.

241
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,223
I saw you with the Grand Prince
in the palace before.

242
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,184
How close are you?

243
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,854
By family order,

244
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,148
His Majesty is my great uncle,

245
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,069
so His Highness and I are in-laws.

246
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,072
Not by family ties, but emotionally.

247
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,576
A young lady from a noble family,
who has never done anything unlawful,

248
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,454
tried to bribe a soldier

249
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,498
to meet her so-called in-law?

250
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,710
Is it an uncharacteristic lapse?

251
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,921
Or unspoken feelings?

252
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,173
That's not…

253
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,262
Go to the palace.

254
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,057
His Highness
must have headed to the Main Hall.

255
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,979
Though our engagement is to be broken off,

256
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,523
let me say one thing as your fiancé.

257
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,193
Those feelings of yours…

258
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,861
I support them

259
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,614
with all my heart.

260
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,877
<i>The Grand Prince</i>
<i>will soon meet his downfall.</i>

261
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,226
Boo!

262
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,020
Hey, Eun-jo.

263
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,064
You haven't eaten anything.

264
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,694
Are the men's quarters empty now?

265
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,530
Yes, nobody is there.
Everyone left this morning.

266
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,742
I must step out for a moment too.

267
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,330
His Highness sends word

268
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,291
- that you need not worry--
- Nonsense!

269
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,419
This petty thief dishonored
a noble scholar by feigning death.

270
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,630
The scholars and officials of this realm
will not let this pass.

271
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,301
Please, Your Majesty!

272
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,721
Please, Your Majesty!

273
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,059
I ordered them to stir things
just enough to give us a pretext.

274
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,562
There has never been such a thing

275
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,733
as a royal siding with thieves!

276
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,485
Your Majesty!

277
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,528
Is it not Dae-il?

278
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,697
I ordered him to do it.

279
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,242
He lives off our family,
so he must earn his keep at least.

280
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,952
Let us make haste.

281
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,163
The officials are waiting
in the Main Hall.

282
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:06,376
Please, Your Majesty!

283
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,932
Your Highness.

284
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,064
You seem glad to see me.

285
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,525
Are you glad to see your target?

286
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,654
No one could have plotted
something like this against me

287
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,156
other than you

288
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,116
and His Majesty.

289
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,995
<i>Why does he suspect me first,</i>
<i>not the King?</i>

290
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,705
Chief Secretary Im,

291
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,876
His Majesty may keep me in check,
but he would not attack me.

292
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,921
That bloody year of Gyeongo,

293
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,841
we swore an oath as brothers.

294
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,094
It's an oath bound by blood
that is thicker than water.

295
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,388
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

296
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,015
There is no reason
I would dare do that to Your--

297
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,308
I think I know it.

298
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,686
The reason.

299
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,275
Whether to threaten him, extort him
or demand his submission,

300
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,403
for whatever reason,
you passed the ledger to the Chief Censor.

301
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,655
And that's the moment

302
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,451
I happened to find that ledger
and brought it to His Majesty.

303
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,663
It seems that's how
I ended up getting in your way.

304
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,295
I was wondering who had kept

305
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,922
such extensive and in-depth records.

306
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,425
It was you.

307
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,971
Your Highness,

308
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,599
I'm afraid I don't quite follow.

309
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,853
Of course, all of that is only assumption.

310
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,730
But now, I'm giving you a command.

311
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,733
From this moment on,

312
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,277
keep your hands off
anything related to Gil-dong.

313
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,365
Does that mean,

314
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,409
from this moment on,

315
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,829
Your Highness will refrain
from making assumptions about the ledger?

316
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,708
The deal…

317
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,296
is sealed.

318
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,048
As you wish, Your Highness.

319
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,597
Right.

320
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,725
You should teach your two sons
some manners.

321
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,685
Like father, like son.

322
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,281
<i>Chief Secretary Im arrested Yeol?</i>

323
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,286
Without my permission?

324
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,040
I hear it all happened during the night.

325
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,168
He was just being a loyal official,
trying to ease your worries

326
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,586
as quickly as he could.

327
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,589
This is a great chance
to remove the thorn in our side.

328
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,134
Your Majesty,
the Chief Secretary requests an audience.

329
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,595
It seems
he's already brought some good news.

330
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,848
It must be bad news.

331
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,810
It seems my brother
had quite some words with you.

332
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,523
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

333
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,608
Regarding the Grand Prince Dowol,

334
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,486
it seems there was a mistake
at the State Tribunal.

335
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,446
Chief Secretary Im,

336
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,407
your loyalty went too far.

337
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,451
Do not take unnecessary action
without my command.

338
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,414
Yes, Your Majesty.

339
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,670
It feels like the medicine
is working better every day.

340
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,464
I haven't felt this light in a long time.

341
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,926
We're going hunting at the Royal Villa.
Make the necessary preparations.

342
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

343
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,610
What I thought was a winning move
turned against me.

344
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,863
We swore an oath as brothers.

345
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,615
Do not take unnecessary action
without my command.

346
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,119
They may be half-brothers,
but they still share blood.

347
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,871
I realize that now.

348
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,789
I'll find another pretext soon enough.

349
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,876
And this time, Grand Prince Dowol
will be struck properly.

350
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,713
Now is the time
to let the waters settle and clear,

351
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,925
until His Majesty's blood

352
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:28,221
fully belongs to our family.

353
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,348
<i>Stop the investigation?</i>

354
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,727
Wait.

355
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,646
What will happen to you now?
You arrested His Highness.

356
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,357
I will be punished
for arresting the Grand Prince in haste.

357
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,778
If I were them, I would just kill me.

358
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,571
And that shall be done, of course.

359
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,118
Pay your respects to Her Majesty.

360
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,662
Your Majesty.
I am Seung-baek of the Kim family.

361
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,372
I'm Jae-i of the Im family.

362
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,626
You must be
Chief Secretary Im's second son.

363
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,378
I will remember your name
and your father's

364
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,922
for threatening my son's life.

365
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,678
His Highness is heading to his residence.

366
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,622
Is there anything interesting to see
in my residence?

367
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,124
Your Highness.

368
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,584
- Grim Reaper?
- What?

369
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,002
Right.

370
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,755
Have you been released
by the State Tribunal?

371
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,881
As you can see.

372
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,008
That's a relief!

373
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,761
Were you just passing by?

374
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,222
Well…

375
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,766
I was worried,
so I came to see how things were.

376
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,482
So we're close enough now
to worry about each other?

377
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,985
I have overstepped.

378
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,653
That's not what I meant.

379
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,280
Let's say it's a formality.

380
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,741
Are you all right?

381
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,951
Do I not seem all right?

382
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,704
There's no way my handsomeness has faded.

383
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,540
Not at all. You're overflowing with it.

384
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,666
Anyway,

385
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,293
I appreciate your kind heart.

386
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,143
Court Lady Kim.

387
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,730
Find out who that lady is, discreetly.

388
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,356
Yes, Your Majesty.

389
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,864
<i>This is the only way.</i>

390
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,074
<i>I'm the one at fault.</i>

391
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,910
You look like you're about to confess.

392
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,244
Yes.

393
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,787
I'm going to tell the truth and…

394
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,792
Don't be so hasty.

395
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,045
Don't worry.

396
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,130
This matter will cause no further trouble.

397
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,465
Really?

398
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,884
All thanks to the combination

399
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,678
of my status as Grand Prince
and my sharp mind.

400
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,139
Of course.

401
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,391
I was hasty indeed.

402
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,769
I told you to keep our promise,
and you're already…

403
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,107
Why did you come to the constabulary?
You're a thief.

404
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,488
I tried to act like I didn't know,
but that's just not me.

405
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,031
Or maybe you were worried about me?

406
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,076
Absolutely not.

407
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,410
Just think about it.

408
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,495
A petty thief…

409
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,623
A petty thief nearly got you punished.

410
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,958
How could I just sit and watch?

411
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,961
You clearly look like
you can't take a beating.

412
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,629
Me?

413
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,840
I doubt a Grand Prince
has ever taken a single lash.

414
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,385
I would rather be punished for you.

415
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,806
I have a body forged by harsh training
and the royal martial arts.

416
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,558
You should know that.

417
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,978
Your Highness.

418
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,027
Shoo!

419
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,613
Shoo!

420
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,616
It wasn't exactly a prison,

421
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,287
but you came from a harsh place.
We must burn the negative energy.

422
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,247
Are you trying to burn me too?

423
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,458
It's all my fault.

424
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,128
I didn't know the State Tribunal
was targeting you,

425
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,046
and I gave them all the records.

426
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,008
And why is that your fault?

427
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,592
I'm the Grand Prince. It's my fault.

428
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,929
Your Highness is so generous.

429
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,975
Aide Kang.

430
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,311
- Here. Mugwort.
- Great.

431
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,021
I got some more.

432
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,063
Give it to me.

433
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,023
Stop. It's enough.

434
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,983
You burned away all the bad energy.

435
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,528
Should we burn the bad energy
from the future in advance?

436
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,988
No.

437
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,615
I appreciate your effort, Physician Hong.

438
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,201
Right. I wanted to ask you something.

439
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,953
What's your relationship with Gil-dong?

440
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,123
What?

441
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,333
What? Why?

442
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,129
It seems like
there's still some bad energy left.

443
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,213
Fire.

444
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,466
We must burn some more.

445
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,551
I'll put it here. Now, fire.

446
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,719
Now, fan it.

447
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,099
Am I the only one who feels like
you're changing the topic?

448
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,188
Why do you ask that question?

449
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,440
Physician Hong was the one

450
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,817
who checked Gil-dong's body.
That's why I asked.

451
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,154
Right!

452
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,949
I did that.

453
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,702
Gil-dong hasn't been identified yet.

454
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,204
It seemed like you knew him.

455
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,290
No, I don't know him at all.

456
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,460
But when you checked his body,

457
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,587
you acted like the world was ending. Why?

458
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,966
Did I…

459
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,718
act like that?

460
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,346
Enough of that.

461
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,392
Her eyes were moist,
so I thought they were very close.

462
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,601
Could you just…

463
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,104
I was talking to Physician Hong.

464
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,024
I'm not sure.

465
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,110
I wonder why.

466
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,821
It was sweat.

467
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:18,947
She ran there.

468
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,323
I see!

469
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,408
Running makes you hot.

470
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,618
And when you're hot, you sweat.

471
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,495
It sounds like

472
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,123
you two are talking about each other.

473
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,125
That day,

474
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,294
I was quite emotional.

475
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,588
Like everyone else,

476
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,298
I felt Gil-dong was my neighbor

477
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,175
and my brother.

478
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,137
Right. Neighbors are
as close as your family.

479
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,805
Certainly.

480
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,689
I've always known you have a kind heart.

481
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,736
I'm sorry I couldn't be of much help.

482
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:05,535
I was just cleared of the charge
of aiding a thief,

483
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,787
and now I've hidden the thief.

484
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,080
Thanks.

485
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,332
I'm sorry I made you an accomplice,

486
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,920
but it was your moist eyes when
you saw Gil-dong that raised suspicion.

487
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,048
And that's clearly on you.

488
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,508
Really?

489
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,926
So it's my fault?

490
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,386
You may be right.

491
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,055
I shouldn't have let Gil-dong go
in the first place.

492
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,974
When I first met him,

493
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,185
I should've unmasked him
and checked his face first.

494
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,982
Then, I would've been able to protect you
without all this trouble.

495
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,491
You're getting sidetracked.

496
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,493
No, we're finally back on track.

497
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,205
We haven't even gotten
to the main point yet.

498
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,791
Follow me.

499
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,503
<i>So I'm telling you in advance.</i>

500
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,547
From now on,
I will be even more relentless.

501
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,800
I will not hesitate even for a moment.

502
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,810
Are you heading to the capital?

503
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,978
It'd be better to stay the night
and leave tomorrow.

504
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,897
I received a letter telling me to hurry.

505
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,273
I'll stop by on my way south.

506
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,153
Why do you think

507
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,780
we returned to our bodies?

508
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,616
Did you do anything special?

509
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,870
No, what about you?

510
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,580
Me neither.

511
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,961
What if…

512
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,004
We didn't do anything special
to cause it either.

513
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,048
Don't think too much. Just accept it.

514
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,716
That's what I'm trying to do.

515
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,469
Did something happen
when you were in my body?

516
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,555
If there's anything I should know,
tell me now.

517
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,016
I may have made some mistakes,

518
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,601
but nothing major.

519
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,811
What about you?

520
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,437
I have a warning for you.

521
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,528
A latch?

522
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,115
There are

523
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,366
wolves around the annex.

524
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,410
Wolves?

525
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,954
Not wild boars? Where do they come from?

526
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,082
It seemed like
they were from Bugak Mountain.

527
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,669
Anyway, make sure
the doors are closed at night.

528
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:23,006
I'm telling you this for the sake
of your body, which used to be mine.

529
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,966
Thank you.

530
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,760
And sorry.

531
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,558
You were arrested because of Gil-dong.

532
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,685
I was so sorry

533
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,396
that I couldn't say it was me.

534
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,066
Let me make this clear.

535
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,276
What happened was

536
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,694
a petty thief got mixed up

537
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,196
with a scoundrel at the constabulary

538
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,157
and ended up being a political pawn.

539
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,074
Why?

540
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,036
Because that scoundrel
happened to be a Grand Prince.

541
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,579
So all you need to do

542
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,916
is complain about
getting dragged into this damn mess

543
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,043
because of me.

544
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,465
Now, shall we return to our lives?

545
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,136
Is that all you wanted to say?

546
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,221
Do you have anything else to say?

547
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,264
No, I don't.

548
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,624
<i>What's driving me crazy right now</i>

549
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,542
is that I'm not in my own body,

550
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,046
so I can't even just go and drag you
out of that family like a tyrant.

551
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,009
He said all kinds of things
while wearing my face.

552
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,513
He must've gone through

553
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,890
all kinds of things
while wearing my face too.

554
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,353
He must have realized,

555
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,397
that with me,

556
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,361
that's just how things should be.

557
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,968
Keep a low profile
until things quieten down.

558
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,348
You're not someone
who normally backs down this easily.

559
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,518
Does Grand Prince Dowol
have something on you?

560
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,317
I will just lie low
and wait for your command.

561
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,779
You want us to secretly
track down Gil-dong on our own?

562
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,197
But he's dead.

563
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,033
The Grand Prince is alive.

564
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:59,120
I feel like
he's pretty close with that thief.

565
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,580
So?

566
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,540
That's why.

567
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,458
Come on.

568
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,127
You're supposed to stay away
from anything related to Gil-dong.

569
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,255
Your father gave you that order.

570
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,548
That's why.

571
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,091
"That's why?"

572
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,509
I feel like this case

573
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,429
could destroy one of the two
once we dig into it.

574
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,432
It would be best if it destroyed both.

575
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,060
<i>I hear he's Jae-i of the Im family.</i>

576
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,313
That insolent son of the Chief Secretary

577
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,523
will have to face my punishment.

578
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,151
I hate everything about him,
but his eyes are the worst.

579
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,653
When you look at me,

580
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,447
I see turmoil in your eyes.

581
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,492
Those eyes were full of desire.

582
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,704
What are you saying?

583
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,916
Shall we take this chance
and exile him tomorrow?

584
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,335
He insulted the royal family,

585
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,088
so he will be beheaded.

586
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,131
That should prevent any fallout.

587
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,925
Eliminating a political rival.

588
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,551
What do you mean?

589
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,221
Mother, you need not
get blood on your hands.

590
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,348
I will take care of this.

591
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,517
What will you do?

592
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,143
Just a latch won't do.

593
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,728
A latch?

594
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:10,149
Even now, he must be prowling
around the annex like a wolf.

595
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,915
<i>There are</i>

596
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,416
<i>wolves around the annex.</i>

597
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,464
So he was right?

598
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,930
Oh, dear!

599
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,440
Those herbs are for my mother.
Can I get a little extra?

600
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,692
Come on.

601
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,777
I was going to give you a little extra.

602
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,573
Move! Make way!

603
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,574
This way!

604
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,118
- Move!
- Make way!

605
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,412
This way! Move!

606
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,250
Did something happen at the Hyeminseo?

607
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,918
HYEMINSEO

608
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,429
Jeom-baek!

609
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,388
Eun-jo!

610
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,308
Why is everyone wearing a face covering?

611
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,435
- Is there a plague?
- Yes.

612
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,228
A plague is spreading outside the capital.

613
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,690
Everyone insists
they've caught the plague.

614
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,442
It's a mess.

615
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,943
Let me help.

616
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,820
I need to ask the Superintendent first.

617
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,738
Where is he?

618
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,118
No man of any respectable family

619
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,079
would accept a woman
cast off by a broken engagement.

620
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,998
You must have also heard

621
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,959
that the Chief Secretary's second son
had the Grand Prince arrested.

622
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,879
Who do you think was behind it?

623
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,589
It was the Chief Secretary.

624
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,841
The moment His Majesty changes his mind,

625
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,385
he could be cast off at any time,
just as in the Gyeongo Year.

626
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,473
Must you really marry Hae-rim
into that family, knowing the risk?

627
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,602
I will convey Your Majesty's will.

628
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,859
Brother,

629
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,947
you said the Hyeminseo is busy
because of the plague outside the capital.

630
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,448
Let me help.

631
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,285
We do not need you.

632
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,381
Just as Your Highness suspected,
Gil-dong's body is gone.

633
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,549
Who did this?

634
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,885
As a matter of fact,

635
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,429
on the day Gil-dong's body was buried,

636
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,391
I saw someone suspicious around here.

637
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,142
- What?
- I know.

638
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,143
I saw them too.

639
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,103
- What?
- What?

640
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,232
I mean, I can vividly picture
what I just heard.

641
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,859
Why are you reporting that only now?

642
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,819
I apologize.

643
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,530
I thought it wouldn't be a big deal.

644
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,615
I knew it.

645
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,617
It's just as bad as I expected.

646
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,498
Find a warrior with a scar like this.

647
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,043
If you find him, don't arrest him.
Report it to me discreetly.

648
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,841
Will you track down the fake Gil-dong?

649
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,175
Yes.

650
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,678
I need to know who it was so I feel…

651
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:27,972
"Fake Gil-dong"?

652
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,516
Hong-si is the real Gil-dong.

653
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,518
Hong-si?

654
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,854
What are you talking about?

655
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,647
She's a woman.

656
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,233
How could a woman
possibly steal things in Joseon?

657
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,985
I couldn't believe it at first either.

658
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,654
Your Highness is suspected
of freeing Gil-dong, the thief.

659
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:47,074
<i>Even when Hong-si</i>
<i>flinched at the name Gil-dong,</i>

660
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,367
I just brushed it off.

661
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,036
What's your relationship with Gil-dong?

662
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,079
What?

663
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,247
What? Why?

664
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,333
<i>Even when she turned pale and panicked,</i>

665
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,376
I thought it didn't make any sense.

666
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,086
And?

667
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,672
Seeing you bristle
at a mere probing question,

668
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,924
without even asking why,

669
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,384
convinced me.

670
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,057
You won't report her, will you?

671
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,226
I take the law seriously.

672
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,686
Dae-chu, think about it.

673
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,647
If she gets arrested,
I, your lord, will get arrested too.

674
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,149
Then you will lose your job,

675
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,776
and your parents will be furious.

676
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,528
They both passed away when I was ten.

677
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,821
Their souls will be sad.

678
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,490
Let me ask you one question.

679
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,242
What are you going to do with Hong-si
from now on?

680
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,414
We're partners in crime now.
We'll have to share the same fate.

681
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,166
You must be excited to be her accomplice.

682
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,125
Excited?

683
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,668
I'm stuck with her now.

684
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,379
So you're thrilled to be stuck with her.

685
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,380
Thrilled?

686
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,632
It's such a burden. I'm dead tired.

687
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,634
If Your Highness dies,

688
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,427
I will lose my job

689
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,304
and my parents' souls will be sad.

690
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,725
Shall I take care of it?

691
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,310
Before that,

692
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,355
shall I take care of you first?

693
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,408
I was told to go to the constabulary
to find Your Highness.

694
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,415
I've been awaiting your command for days.

695
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,959
There has been no command, so I came.

696
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,044
It was your father's order,

697
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,254
so it's your father's doing.

698
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,133
His son doesn't
have to bear the consequences.

699
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,722
It would be petty to punish the son.

700
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,975
So just live.

701
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,689
An order to live
sounds harsher than an order to die.

702
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,774
Then live a harsh life.

703
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,030
Hong Eun-jo

704
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,949
is a married woman.

705
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,743
It seems
you don't quite understand the situation.

706
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,496
I don't understand what?

707
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,999
In this game,
it's the woman who bears the stigma

708
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,586
of being toyed with by royalty.

709
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,130
And she will be despised for life.

710
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,678
Your family married her off
to a dying man.

711
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,515
That is what toying with someone
looks like.

712
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,309
You people knew it.

713
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,227
So

714
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,438
it must be turned back.

715
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,957
The water to brew the tonic
for the patients?

716
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,709
Yes.

717
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,632
Are you new here?

718
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,509
Well…

719
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,928
I…

720
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,262
Hae-rim!

721
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,556
I mean…

722
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,682
Lady Hae-rim.

723
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,434
Do you know me?

724
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,938
You're the Superintendent's sister.

725
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,482
I think I've seen you in passing
a few times.

726
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,571
Right.

727
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,323
We met at the palace, right?

728
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:18,369
Wait, you were wearing
a court lady's dress then.

729
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:19,870
Oh, that.

730
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,789
That day…

731
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,917
I had my reasons.

732
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,211
I see.

733
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,839
And why are you wearing

734
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,925
a physician's uniform?

735
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,511
Right.

736
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,597
I have my reasons too.

737
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,308
The man you broke off your engagement with

738
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,143
was the Chief Secretary's second son?

739
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,190
If you are
his dead grandfather's concubine,

740
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,401
does that make you his grandmother?

741
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,530
A concubine's name
is not even entered in the family records.

742
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,700
I was taken in merely as a caretaker.

743
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,871
You may think it's a luxury

744
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,999
for a noblewoman to complain,

745
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,376
but I feel marriage
is a tricky matter for women.

746
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,049
Our problems may seem different,

747
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,093
but, in essence, they might be the same.

748
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,394
How strange.
Somehow, it feels like we have met before.

749
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,313
You probably don't know what I mean.

750
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,693
I might understand more than I know.

751
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,529
How strange.

752
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,740
It feels like we've known each other
for a long time.

753
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,076
Maybe it isn't just a feeling.

754
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,207
Actually, I lost my friends
when my engagement was broken off,

755
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,168
and I've been pretty upset lately.

756
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,380
Don't be so upset.

757
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,592
Sometimes, one misfortune
chases away another.

758
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,888
Would you be my friend?

759
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,521
Hasn't he arrived home yet?

760
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:14,652
What are you doing?

761
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,779
You're home early today, Young Master.

762
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,032
Why do you call me Young Master?

763
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,495
I'm here to meet Lord Hong Min-jik.

764
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,539
My father is away in the provinces
at the moment.

765
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,625
He won't be back till next year.

766
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,169
He'll be home in a few days.
I'll come back then.

767
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,381
What…

768
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,133
Who are you?

769
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,427
Why were you peeking into my house?

770
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,262
"You"?

771
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,683
I'll say this nicely, for old times' sake.

772
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:46,725
Let go of me.

773
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,896
What are you doing?

774
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,649
Eun-jo, report this man
to the constabulary.

775
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,317
I caught a thief.

776
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,318
What?

777
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,154
This scoundrel was peeking into our house.

778
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,239
- "Scoundrel"?
- See?

779
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,533
That's the look of someone
caught red-handed.

780
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,410
I'm sure that's someone else's look.

781
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:07,871
Young Master,

782
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,708
why would a thief come to our place?
There's nothing to steal here.

783
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:16,380
Everything our family owns would be
worth less than what he's wearing.

784
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,468
You're right.

785
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,182
I've been really patient today.

786
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,185
My apologies.

787
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,063
I'm a little sensitive
because people say there's a thief around.

788
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,567
What's his name? Was it Gil-dong?

789
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,820
That thief?

790
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,239
I know him well.

791
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,367
What a world we live in.

792
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,787
They say even the Grand Prince
took the thief's side.

793
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,998
What was he even thinking--

794
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,628
What?

795
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,131
PATIENCE

796
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:02,384
Just know that I saved your life.

797
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,767
As I said earlier,

798
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,480
Young Master is not a mean person.

799
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,815
He's not a mean person?

800
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:17,858
He's a mindless person.

801
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,110
How could he mistake
someone like me for a thief?

802
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,363
So, why did you peek into my house…

803
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,283
I mean, what brings you here?

804
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,327
Perhaps…

805
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,455
Were you waiting for me?

806
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,505
You cannot just show up
without notice like this.

807
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,340
I have a family.

808
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,759
Don't get me wrong.

809
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,260
I was only passing by.

810
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,679
And they were my family too.

811
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,849
So you happened to pass by
my family's house.

812
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,187
Is your family doing all right?

813
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,648
Maybe they grew on me
after we lived together.

814
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,775
I wonder how they're doing.

815
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,109
Who?

816
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,111
The doorkeeper?

817
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,697
Seok-sam?

818
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:06,823
No.

819
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,368
Im Jae-i.

820
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,371
How generous of you.

821
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,541
You wonder how the man
who arrested you is doing.

822
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,877
That's how generous a Grand Prince is.

823
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,507
I'm afraid
I can't pass along your regards.

824
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,717
I haven't seen him around
these past few days.

825
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:26,927
Really?

826
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,888
If you're that curious,
I'll see if I can meet him today.

827
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,765
Curious, my foot.

828
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,560
I would banish him to a deserted island,

829
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,979
but I'm holding back
because I don't want to be petty.

830
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,362
You're using the latch, right?

831
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,957
The Shin family
broke off the engagement in writing.

832
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,208
Was it you?

833
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,420
I'm too proud

834
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,256
to be sold off as a breeding horse,

835
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,716
and I'm so greedy

836
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:10,095
that I can't let go of the name, wealth
and fame you've given me.

837
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,305
Do I have any choice

838
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,683
but to cling to my soft-hearted fiancée?

839
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,561
After all,

840
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:21,273
the blood you carry
is unfit for human duties.

841
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:23,900
You acted like an animal,

842
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,613
so you will be treated like one.

843
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,702
At this rate, he will die!

844
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,829
Find the First Young Master! Now!

845
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:37,039
- Hurry!
- Come on!

846
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,084
- Ma'am.
- Eun-jo!

847
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,502
Where is everyone going?

848
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,755
Something awful is happening
in the men's quarters.

849
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,049
I must find the First Young Master.

850
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,181
What's going on?

851
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:58,185
The Lord has been beating
the Second Young Master all day.

852
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,274
There's no one in this house
who can stop him.

853
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,070
I will go and see.

854
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,754
Get lost.

855
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,774
Lock Jae-i in the storehouse
and don't give him any food or water.

856
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,723
It's a tonic.

857
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,226
If you'll excuse me.

858
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,994
Oh, dear.

859
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,832
You are permitted to come out.

860
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,258
Are you all right?

861
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,303
Yes, thanks to you.

862
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,514
You should thank Eun…

863
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,935
I mean, the lady of the annex.

864
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:32,339
<i>She brewed the tonic</i>
<i>the whole night last night.</i>

865
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:36,009
<i>And she's been brewing another one</i>
<i>since early this morning.</i>

866
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,345
What are you doing?

867
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,097
How are you feeling?

868
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,265
I said, what are you doing?

869
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,687
You shouldn't be moving around yet.
It'll worsen your wound.

870
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,198
Are you pitying me?

871
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,867
Why are you so twisted?

872
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,077
I was just worried--

873
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,995
Whether out of pity or worry, don't do it.

874
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,539
Do you think we're really family?

875
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,959
I'm not trying to act like your family.

876
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,502
Why are you even doing this?

877
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,837
No matter who you are,

878
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,589
if you're sick, you get treated,

879
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,966
regardless of personal feelings.

880
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,933
If you don't like
that I'm the one brewing the tonic,

881
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,852
I can ask the doorkeeper to do it.

882
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:31,189
What a waste.

883
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,661
What is your problem?

884
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,413
That's what I want to ask you.

885
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,831
What is your problem?

886
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:55,797
Let go of me.

887
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,259
I said, let go of me.

888
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,138
This is a warning.

889
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:06,016
Don't try to spread warmth in this house.

890
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,810
In this house,

891
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,938
keep that worry

892
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,108
to yourself.

893
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,068
Don't make me care

894
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,323
about this damned family.

895
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,992
What do you…

896
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,380
Eun-jo.

897
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,049
What happened?

898
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,678
I accidentally knocked it over.

899
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,139
I'll go and buy more herbs.

900
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,394
I trust Your Highness
will keep peace in the palace

901
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,229
while we are away.

902
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,440
It will be at least a month.

903
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,776
Let us set off.

904
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,042
Wait.

905
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,879
The Chief Secretary and his eldest son
are joining this trip too.

906
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,089
That means

907
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,508
he'll be alone with Eun-jo in that house.

908
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:26,388
I will join the king's procession
at the palace gate.

909
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,765
Wouldn't it be better if I joined you?

910
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:32,227
I want you to stay here
and take care of what I asked you to.

911
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:33,937
Yes, Father.

912
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:38,984
You must be setting out on a long journey.

913
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,068
Yes.

914
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,570
I'm going to the Onyang Royal Villa.

915
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,531
I wish you a safe trip.

916
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:46,992
Let's go.

917
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,464
My lord.

918
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,885
Why did you come back?

919
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,054
I received Eun-jo's letter.

920
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,556
Eun-jo sent a letter?

921
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,518
I met her yesterday,
but she didn't mention any letter.

922
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,729
It was sent the day after the wedding.

923
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,647
She wrote that it was urgent.
What happened?

924
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,151
Are you sure it was from Eun-jo?

925
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,486
<i>You earned this.</i>

926
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,159
Because of your lack of virtue,
my grandfather passed away.

927
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,245
So accept it as what you deserve.

928
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,543
And now,

929
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,128
this is for your father.

930
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,964
He earned a big one.

931
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,801
Did you just grab me?

932
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,344
Let go.

933
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:56,102
I can take a beating.
You can beat me if you want,

934
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,021
but in my lord's name,

935
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,148
I will not accept a single blow.

936
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,692
You must have really lost your mind.

937
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,638
Your Highness.

938
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,889
Sorry.

939
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,391
My hand slipped.

940
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:36,810
That was a mistake.

941
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,729
I was aiming for your head.

942
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,780
Why are you doing this?

943
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:49,906
Stand up.

944
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,242
There will be no more mistakes.

945
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:00,750
Stop it.

946
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:04,671
Please stop.

947
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,919
I was going to give you this
once you left this family,

948
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,464
but I changed my mind.

949
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,860
This…

950
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,197
What is it?

951
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,033
Something I should have done
the moment I returned to my body.

952
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,242
It's my declaration of war.

953
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,162
It is my determination

954
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,873
to face the long
and exhausting fight that lies ahead

955
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,543
between two enemies,
the old customs and the gap of status.

956
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,339
It's the only justification I have

957
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,132
to save you

958
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,509
from this damned Im family.

959
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,263
I'm going to marry you.

960
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,141
This is

961
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,268
my proposal.

962
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,149
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

963
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,703
I'm a widow.

964
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,621
I know.

965
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,164
And you're the Grand Prince.

966
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,123
Who cares?

967
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,627
People will call it immoral and mock us.

968
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,795
Let them.

969
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:21,599
Let's go.

970
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,072
Don't take that hand.

971
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,879
You're not allowed to leave.

972
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,340
You can't leave this house

973
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:56,884
until you die.

974
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,277
<i>The battle isn't over yet.</i>

975
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,195
<i>Bring it on.</i>

976
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,196
<i>Drop the titles.</i>

977
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,572
<i>Drop the ranks.</i>

978
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,531
<i>Drop the honorifics.</i>

979
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,492
<i>You picked the wrong opponent.</i>

980
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,993
<i>Grand Prince Dowol?</i>

981
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,745
<i>Please never come back.</i>

982
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:09,082
I don't want to hurt Eun-jo as well.

983
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,625
<i>Please do me a favor.</i>

984
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,542
<i>Why are you smiling?</i>

985
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,252
<i>Why do you keep smiling?</i>

986
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,546
Nothing. I just want
to keep smiling with you.

987
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,215
<i>Today, I'll do it as much as I can.</i>

988
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:21,386
<i>They've given the order to kill</i>
<i>all the sick here and shut the place down.</i>

989
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,762
<i>I can never forget her.</i>

990
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:23,971
<i>That is my answer.</i>

991
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,057
