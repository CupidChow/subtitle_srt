00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:50,000
[Episode 3]

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,100
Got you.

3
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,567
A whole bush of flowers.

4
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:57,167
<i>He didn't come after Gil Dong.</i>

5
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,300
<i>How on earth did he...</i>

6
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:03,367
<i>Notice board!</i>

7
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:06,200
[Searching for this man]

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,900
<i>Anyone who recognizes this person,
please report to Physician Hong at Hyeminseo.</i>

9
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:16,333
<i>How he got here isn't what matters.</i>

10
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,100
<i>Let's not panic.</i>

11
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,933
<i>He is a royal aide.</i>

12
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:21,533
<i>If I look flustered, I'll only seem
more suspicious to him.</i>

13
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:25,633
You look flustered from behind,
or is that just my imagination?

14
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:32,267
Oh, my!

15
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:33,800
It is you, isn't it?

16
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,533
No wonder your voice sounded familiar.

17
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:40,267
You reacted awfully fast for someone
who supposedly didn't recognize me.

18
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:45,800
Oh, please. Do you think I'd recognize you
and pretend not to know you?

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,467
It was too dark to recognize you.

20
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:51,600
Though the moon is shining bright tonight.

21
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:55,467
That's what I'm saying.

22
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:58,000
The moon was bright, but when a man burst in,

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,867
I moved aside instinctively.

24
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:04,933
Besides, it's late for men
and women to be mingling.

25
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,400
Now you care about propriety?

26
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:11,667
What about that night?

27
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,867
That night was...

28
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,933
- I mean...
- A minimal explanation,

29
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:28,633
maximum persuasion,

30
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:31,867
or even a feeling that emerged by chance?

31
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:33,700
Any of those would be fine.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,667
As you can see,

33
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:48,733
there's no excuse for lying about my status.

34
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,248
So,

35
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:53,800
the offense of insulting a nobleman

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,167
cannot be talked away.

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,267
Most of all, toying with you that night...

38
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,000
Toying?

39
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:07,560
I know

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,333
that can't be forgiven

41
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,033
with words alone.

42
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,733
You actually call us a madam and a laborer.

43
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:20,100
Then, did you run away that night
knowing who I was?

44
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,233
No.

45
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,867
I was wearing silk the first day
we met at the market too.

46
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:26,333
- Why?
- Pardon?

47
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,584
Just tell me why you did it!

48
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,176
Oh.

49
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,032
Well...

50
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:35,144
Well...

51
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:38,233
That's...

52
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,667
That was driven by tangled impulses...

53
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,400
A mistake?

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,967
Yes, that sums it up.

55
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:49,033
Don't you think a mistake alone
doesn't fully explain it?

56
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,272
I'll accept any punishment you give

58
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:57,200
without complaint.

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,900
What should I do?

60
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,000
What I wanted to ask wasn't about guilt.

61
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:06,867
You're saying the first step is
to report it to the Police Bureau?

62
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:08,133
Yeah, aren't you leaving now?

63
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,900
I was just on my way.

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,233
Even if it was a misunderstanding,
you saved the life of that fool, Eon Nom.

65
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:20,100
Consider today as settling that debt.

66
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:25,033
Actually, that was my fault too...

67
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:28,600
What's wrong with your arm? Are you hurt?

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,633
It's nothing serious.

69
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:31,567
Let me take a look.

70
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:35,833
Hey, you said you'd just take a look.

71
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,600
Well, a look doesn't seem
to be working, though.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
Just stop the bleeding for now.

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,033
That's why I came in the first place.

74
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,467
So, you didn't come because of the notice?

75
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:00,700
What notice?

76
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,433
It's nothing.

77
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:09,433
Then, was today another coincidence?

78
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:13,200
Well, a coincidence is an unintended meeting.

79
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,000
But I was too earnest for this.

80
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:19,300
Perhaps my wish reached the heavens.

81
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,767
What do you mean?

82
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,100
Try thinking about it from my side.

83
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,267
I couldn't help being so serious
about catching you.

84
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:46,152
You ran away after all, didn't you?

85
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:48,328
Oh.

86
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,467
It's a cut. How did you get hurt?

87
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,333
An arrow grazed me.

88
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,933
Got shot by an arrow at this hour?

89
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:05,500
I was helping someone escape.

90
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,933
Helping someone escape?

91
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:12,833
Things got complicated
and made someone a target.

92
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,600
Anyway, judging by how
quiet the night still is,

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
it seems that person got away safely.

94
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:20,616
Only as far as

95
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:22,933
I can embrace.

96
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,700
<i>Did I misunderstand?</i>

97
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,833
Stop right there!

98
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,567
<i>Maybe he said that
to the guards, not Gil Dong.</i>

99
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:32,600
<i>Then, this wound</i>

100
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,900
<i>was because of me.</i>

101
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,733
What's wrong?

102
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,067
Huh? What?

103
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,933
You've been staring since earlier.

104
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,933
It's because I can't see the wound.

105
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,833
Move a bit.

106
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:52,667
Well, I don't know the full story,

107
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:57,633
but the one you helped must be very grateful.

108
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,333
No.

109
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,567
By now, that person is probably thinking
I tricked him, and blaming me.

110
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,567
The resentment won't last long, right?

111
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,264
No,

112
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:10,600
I can faintly hear it.

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,400
Just endless streams of filthy curses.

114
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,233
No, I truly didn't curse...

115
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,867
Probably?

116
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:21,800
If it were me, I don't think
I would have cursed.

117
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,867
You don't have to comfort me like that.

118
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:28,367
He got hit by an arrow?
Did you actually see it happen?

119
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:31,600
Well, a soldier apparently
loosed his bow by mistake.

120
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,000
This is serious!

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,400
Go find His Highness at once!

122
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,133
- Yes!
- Yes!

123
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:42,000
The wound isn't deep, but it could fester.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,033
Once morning comes,
you must see a private physician.

125
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:48,067
Hyeminseo doesn't have a lot of herbs,

126
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,033
so I can't use them generously.

127
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,833
How many do you still need?

128
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,567
There are patients every day,

129
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:59,967
and herbs are perpetually scarce.

130
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,300
Is that so?

131
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,300
Looking at your expression,
anyone would think I'm gravely ill.

132
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,100
<i>Examining you thoroughly is
simply the least I can do.</i>

133
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,700
Well, yes.

134
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,533
My concern for you is no less profound.

135
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:25,300
Not that it seems kind though.

136
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,933
For a moment, I thought,
'I might get hurt even more.'

137
00:08:29,512 --> 00:08:31,033
Ouch.

138
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,133
'Hurt even more'?

139
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:35,600
We don't allow jokes like that at Hyeminseo.

140
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,667
I was sincere all along.

141
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,067
That night,

142
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,833
even when waiting for you,
which wasn't like me...

143
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,500
You seemed confused.

144
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,567
So, I got a bit curious.

145
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,867
Part of me even wanted to go along
with that confusion.

146
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:07,100
Never dreaming it was
all a meaningless mistake.

147
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,267
About that day, I'm
once again deeply sorry...

148
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,700
Enough.

149
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,800
You must've been very angry.

150
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,367
I'm not angry.

151
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:24,633
But, you seem very angry.

152
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,633
I'm really not angry...

153
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,900
What angers me is your apology.

154
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:37,400
I can see myself out.

155
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,267
It seems our coincidence ends today.

156
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:50,400
He looks furious, even from behind.

157
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:54,533
Did I fail to apologize properly?

158
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:58,500
Argh, where on earth is she?

159
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,933
Your Highness.

160
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:05,633
I still haven't located
this woman. I'm deeply sorry.

161
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,667
What did you mean by that apology?

162
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,200
I truly meant that I'm sorry.

163
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,467
I will find her by tomorrow.

164
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:15,800
So, it's a mistake big enough
to apologize for twice, right?

165
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Pardon? Should I apologize a third time?

166
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,900
No, apologies are banned from now on.

167
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,867
Have you been here all along?

168
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:25,733
Is your injury alright?

169
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,133
Yes, as you can see.

170
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,333
Were you injured? Who did it?

171
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,833
Put that away.

172
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,367
What happened to Gil Dong?

173
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,016
He ran off without even looking back.

174
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,833
Cold-heartedly.

175
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:42,833
How many times have we met already?

176
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,767
I might grow attached at this rate.

177
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,233
Eun Jo.

178
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,648
Hurry up and come here.

179
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,167
Oh.

180
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,000
It's chilly. Why are you out here?

181
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,367
I was questioned at the Police Bureau
today over something related to Gil Dong.

182
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:57,100
What? Let me see. Are you alright?

183
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,300

Yeah.

No, I meant he seems like a good person.

00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,600
If you reveal you're the Grand Prince...

363
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,433
Quiet.

364
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:12,500
If you're not here to inspect,
why did you come?

365
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,567
Inspect? That'll just get
in the way of their work.

366
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,800
Hey, there, are you okay?

367
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,984
What's going on?

368
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,367
Is she alright?

369
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:22,184
Are you okay?

370
00:22:22,184 --> 00:22:25,167
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

371
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,200
Mister!

372
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,900
Eun Jo.

373
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
Should we lift her?

374
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,267
No, calm her down first.

375
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,267
Moving her now will only worsen the seizure.

376
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:34,367
Please fetch the physician quickly.

377
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:35,700
Alright.

378
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,633
Ma'am.

379
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:40,533
Can you hear me?

380
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:43,867
Don't tense up trying to endure it.

381
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:47,033
Relax your body and lean on me completely...

382
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:57,267
She just needs to hold on
until the physician arrives, right?

383
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,167
Ma'am.

384
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:03,933
Breathe with me.

385
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,367
Alright.

386
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,700
One.

387
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,867
One.

388
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,400
You're doing well.

389
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,367
Again! One!

390
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:18,000
One.

391
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,400
One.

392
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:26,433
- One.
- What happened?

393
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:27,833
She had a seizure.

394
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,233
And she just calmed down.

395
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,300
Move her inside.

396
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,600
Yes.

397
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,067
She'll die at this rate.

398
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,600
Let's go.

399
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:43,592
Is she going to be fine?

400
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,800
Is he gone?

401
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:12,800
I guess you're looking for me, huh?

402
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,333
Oh.

403
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,733
Thanks to you, I managed to hold on.

404
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,800
I did shake off all the dust,

405
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,200
but I'm worried I might have
ruined this delicate fabric.

406
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,100
If you need compensation...

407
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,967
No need for that.

408
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,867
This one is making trouble again.

409
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,733
I know.

410
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:37,200
Your hands weren't made just
for tying your own robe, were they?

411
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:58,367
What are you doing?
I just finished tying it up.

412
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,167
Leave it.

413
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,467
My hands can at least help with your wound.

414
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,184
I'll take care of it

415
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:11,833
later.

416
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,133
Consider this as repayment
for tending to my wound the other day.

417
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:21,367
I can't go around owing anyone favors.
That's why I'm doing this.

418
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,867
Tsk.

419
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:27,100
Fine, let's call it even.

420
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,800
You don't even realize you're hurt.

421
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,667
Are you always this dense?

422
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,133
You saw how flustered I was, didn't you?

423
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,867
Once the tension's gone,
that's when it hurts and all that.

424
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,033
What's your name?

425
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:42,233
Eun Jo from the Hong family...

426
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:43,967
yes.

427
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,933
Why do you ask?

428
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:48,633
Just curious.

429
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:52,600
Why did you come here?

430
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:57,567
I'm curious about that too.

431
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,567
Are you here to get an apology from me...

432
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:02,467
No.

433
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:05,700
I said I wouldn't be curious
about impulsive things anymore.

434
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,433
Okay.

435
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,833
It looks like expensive silk.

436
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:13,033
I'll return it later.

437
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,352
[Inventory record of medicinal herbs]
What is that?

438
00:26:17,352 --> 00:26:20,700
I have medicinal herbs
bestowed by Prince Do Wol.

439
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,600
So, I was organizing the inventory.

440
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,467
Oh.

441
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:26,267
Prince Do Wol?

442
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,200
Actually, I came for that.

443
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:42,333
Dig up every possible
weakness of Im Sa Hyeong.

444
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,100
Yes, my lord.

445
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:03,467
What's upset you so much to cause all this?

446
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:06,333
This is all worth a fortune!

447
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,700
Tell me why.

448
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:13,167
I'm not done yet.

449
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:16,200
Where are you going?

450
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,267
Oh, dear.

451
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:19,467
- Ah, my head.
- Madam.

452
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,733
Clean it up.

453
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:23,433
Yes.

454
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:41,567
Everything up there is
medicinal herbs sent by Prince Do Wol.

455
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:44,900
I'll inform the Grand Prince
they arrived safely.

456
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,667
Go back to your work.

457
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,933
You must be quite close to the Grand Prince.

458
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:53,867
Close enough to conduct
a secret inspection on his behalf?

459
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:56,400
I could say we're extremely close.

460
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,967
Rumors say he's handsome?

461
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:00,900
What do you think?

462
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,567
About what?

463
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:05,300
The rumors are remarkably accurate.

464
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,267
What else have you heard? Tell me everything.

465
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:13,000
They say he's a worthless loafer
who's always out gallivanting.

466
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:17,067
Or perhaps he's observing the world
and broadening his horizons.

467
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:18,633
And what else did they say?

468
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:22,100
That he's a womanizer who changes
women every other day?

469
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,667
That's really not true.

470
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,367
It's my first time!

471
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:29,700
Your... first time?

472
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,933
I'm making excuses now, aren't I?

473
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:37,192
Oh.

474
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:39,300
I was careless.

475
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,867
I should've minded my words.

476
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:46,033
Making excuses means I care, doesn't it?

477
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:48,300
He's someone close to you.
Of course, you care.

478
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,567
No, I never cared before.

479
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,700
No matter what anyone said.

480
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,200
What?

481
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,900
What's happening?

482
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:02,867
Is everything sorted?

483
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,033
Jeez.

484
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:08,867
It's the Prince's sincere regard,
so they mustn't be used carelessly.

485
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:10,500
Yes, my lord.

486
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,833
You have deeply understood
the Grand Prince's intentions.

487
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,933
The Grim Reaper?

488
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,567
Who are you?

489
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:23,233
Oh, this person is...

490
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:24,900
Never mind.

491
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,733
I won't greet a playboy who parades
another family's precious young lady

492
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,133
around in broad daylight.

493
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,600
A playboy?

494
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,500
You might not know,

495
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,333
but there was a hidden detail

496
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,867
you weren't supposed to find.

497
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,233
Simply put, it's a misunderstanding.

498
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:48,567
What misunderstanding?

499
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,267
Didn't the woman cover her face

500
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:52,767
because your relationship wasn't proper?

501
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:57,167
His misunderstanding is none of my concern.
And there's nothing between her and me.

502
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:59,200
Yes, yes.

503
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,267
I know that look.

504
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:01,300
I've seen it many times.

505
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,067
You don't believe me, do you?

506
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
That's not what matters right now.

507
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,600
It became important moments ago.

508
00:30:09,384 --> 00:30:11,080
What?

509
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:17,533
I don't know about his affairs with women,

510
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:20,533
but I hope you won't judge him
based solely on what you've seen.

511
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:23,233
I myself have received his help just now,

512
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:24,900
and even if I hadn't,

513
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,867
his position at the Police Bureau
ensures his honor.

514
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,200
Jeez.

515
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,767
Ah, I wondered where you'd gone.

516
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,032
Huh?

517
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:40,233
They say seeing one thing reveals ten others.

518
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,767
You are banned from entering Hyeminseo.

519
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:48,967
Banned?

520
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:51,767
[Hyeminseo]

521
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,800
Banned?

522
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:59,400
How did you manage to
put up with me all this time?

523
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,600
This, I cannot endure.

524
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,167
I'll inform him and demand
accountability for this matter.

525
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:07,133
Just leave it.

526
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,867
- Pardon?
- If I intervene now,

527
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,067
it'll only look like two playboys
causing a scene.

528
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:13,800
Yes.

529
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:19,700
But about that court physician earlier,

530
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,300
her face seems strangely familiar.

531
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:27,600
His position at the Police Bureau...

532
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,267
Did I mention the Police Bureau?

533
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:42,400
The detox tonic sent by the envoy
should be effective.

Your skin disease is quite chronic.

00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:09,667
Right after leaving Hyeminseo.

540
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:12,040

00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:25,967
Oh, Seok Sam, come here quickly.

724
00:45:25,967 --> 00:45:29,600
Oh my, Seok Sam is here.

725
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,200
- Chil Seong, what are you doing?
- Come on, sit down.

726
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,967
Here, Seok Sam, take this.

727
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:38,233
- Let's drink.
- I'll drink it all.

728
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,840
Come, let's all share a drink.

729
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,100
- Alright.
- Let's drink.

730
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,467
Please just stop by briefly
and raise a glass.

731
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:48,500
Believing Your Highness to be the royal aide,

732
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,033
despite their humble means,
they've prepared food, waiting for you.

733
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:56,667
Showing a bit of credit is my usual rule,

734
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:58,667
but tonight is busy.

735
00:45:58,667 --> 00:46:00,867
- Busy?
- I don't know.

736
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,900
Dae Chu, go in my stead.

737
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,733
- Me?
- Meet at the palace gate at Sul hour.

738
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:10,133
And you.

739
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:12,367
Starting tomorrow, track
Gil Dong's movements again.

740
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:13,833
Why is that?

741
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:16,667
The Chief Inspector's crimes
detailed in the document

742
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:19,333
aren't information a petty thief
could easily gather.

743
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:22,567
Do you think Gil Dong has a backer?

744
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:24,200
We need to check whether there's someone

745
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,500
behind him or if it really
happened by chance,

746
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,000
as the letter says.

747
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,300
Understood.

748
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,700
And I've grown curious

749
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,533
about that punk's face.

750
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:05,600
She wasn't sold to me, but to Grandfather.

751
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,100
Just to nurse him in his illness.

752
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:13,167
Looks like you've got nothing to do, huh?

753
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:17,567
Oh.

754
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:22,267
I was unaware that you were
the second son of this family the other day.

755
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:24,033
My apologies.

756
00:47:28,633 --> 00:47:30,433
That Lord Hong's wench.

757
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:34,200
If she sets foot in our house,
I'll trample her thoroughly.

758
00:47:35,867 --> 00:47:38,667
I'll take it that you've accepted my apology.

759
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,400
Then, I'll take my leave.

760
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,567
Decline the marriage.

761
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,733
My marriage?

762
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,500
Why should I do that?

763
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,400
It's unbearable

764
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,767
having an inhuman thing like you wriggling
around and living in this house.

765
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,633
I'll keep that in mind.

766
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:06,100
In Joseon, a concubine's
child is disqualified.

767
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,533
That means someone like you
in this house is half-beast.

768
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:13,267
I know that well enough.

769
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:14,833
No.

770
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,767
You don't know.

771
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:18,967
Remember today's humiliation.

772
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:22,833
The moment you set foot here again,
it'll be ten times worse.

773
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:27,267
Remember, my brother has
a fiercer temper than anyone.

774
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:31,067
Is that a warning?

775
00:48:31,067 --> 00:48:32,933
It's charity.

776
00:48:32,933 --> 00:48:35,833
One must pretend to be kind sometimes.

777
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:36,967
Why me?

778
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:40,000
Because Lord Hong seems surprisingly sincere

779
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,333
even toward an eolnyeo,
enough to return the marriage gifts.

780
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,856
You mean His Excellency?

781
00:48:46,856 --> 00:48:48,067
Jeez.

782
00:48:48,067 --> 00:48:50,933
You and your father
seem very affectionate indeed.

783
00:48:50,933 --> 00:48:52,900
What a mess your family is.

784
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:58,167
I must see His Excellency.

785
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:59,467
Eun Jo.

786
00:48:59,467 --> 00:49:01,333
Don't go acting like this, even you.

787
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,867
Young master is right.

788
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:04,667
It was fine to accept them all.

789
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,900
What's wrong with having no shame?

790
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,500
If we pretend not to know
and accept them, we could live comfortably.

791
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,933
Is that so hard?

792
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:18,200
'I won't have her enter this house
with an even heavier heart.

793
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:22,567
Her heart is already weighed down simply by

794
00:49:22,567 --> 00:49:25,367
recovering her mother's servant documents

795
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:28,300
and maintaining this household.

796
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,533
I'll repay even that little by little.'

797
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:34,567
He told the Chief Secretary this
and returned.

798
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:39,133
Don't say anything.

799
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:41,967
Blame only your frivolous mother

800
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:44,900
who was happy receiving your wedding gifts.

801
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,567
It's late. I should go prepare dinner.

802
00:49:53,633 --> 00:49:56,600
I can't handle this, really.

803
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,267
How am I supposed to hold
the wedding like this?

804
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,167
Are you there?

805
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,100
Where is she?

806
00:51:08,267 --> 00:51:09,967
What are you doing there?

807
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:14,000
Why are you here?

808
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,067
I happened to be passing by.

809
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:17,967
The moon was out.

810
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:20,167
And

811
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:21,600
I also have something to get back from you.

812
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,800
Ah, right. The robe string.

813
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,933
I washed it and left it at home.

814
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:28,767
Wait a moment. I'll come down.

815
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:31,500
No, stay there.

816
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,633
What were you looking at?

817
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:43,367
Just... the night.

818
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,900
I hate the night.

819
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,300
It sits there peacefully,
as if nothing ever happened.

820
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,767
That's why I like the night.

821
00:51:57,267 --> 00:52:02,233
Especially, the night I see
from atop the roof.

822
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:03,800
From here,

823
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,633
people look small, houses look small,

824
00:52:08,633 --> 00:52:11,867
even the distant palace looks small.

825
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:15,133
And my worries seem to
shrink along with them.

826
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:17,633
What worries?

827
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:20,400
I could share them out of kindness.

828
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,333
I'll decline.

829
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:29,600
If someone supported me,
I might want to quit everything.

830
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,633
Then, quit.

831
00:52:31,633 --> 00:52:35,433
Whatever it is, it seems like
you could quit at least once.

832
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:41,600
If needed, I'll make you quit.

833
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:50,633
You talk like you know something.

834
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,433
Even if I don't know anything,

835
00:52:53,433 --> 00:52:57,333
I'm someone who can make
you quit, whatever it is.

836
00:53:00,968 --> 00:53:02,920
Oh.

837
00:53:04,067 --> 00:53:08,567
Do I have a powerful backer now?

838
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,567
It shrank a little more than before.

839
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:15,967
Just that?

840
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:19,233
It should shrink by everything
except that little bit.

841
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,433
By the way,

842
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:31,133
I heard something about
the Chief Inspector's household.

843
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:33,967
I heard the Police Bureau investigated.

844
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:38,033
I've been curious since last time.

845
00:53:38,033 --> 00:53:40,933
How did you know I'm with the Police Bureau?

846
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,800
I don't remember saying anything.

847
00:53:49,832 --> 00:53:51,667
Oh.

848
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:53,367
Well...

849
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,667
Oh, sweet! So sweet!

850
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:04,000
What? You said you wouldn't see me
until you pass the state exam.

851
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,167
Congratulations on topping the exam.

852
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:08,033
Let's forget the past, like men.

853
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,600
Seems nothing's amiss at home?

854
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,700
What's wrong?

855
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,833
That eolnyeo from your house.

856
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:16,500
Ugh, don't bring her up. It sours the wine.

857
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,833
Jeez.

858
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:22,233
Weren't you singing 'our Eun Jo,
our Eun Jo' just a while ago?

859
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,533
Why the grim face?

860
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:35,600
Nine out of ten patients who come to
Hyeminseo after being shot by arrows at night

861
00:54:36,267 --> 00:54:39,933
are patrol officers from the Police Bureau.

862
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:40,967
That makes sense.

863
00:54:40,967 --> 00:54:44,467
So, I naturally assumed
you were with the Police Bureau.

864
00:54:46,267 --> 00:54:50,033
I also know you sent rice to Lady Dong Ju.

865
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:52,867
You know that widow too? How?

866
00:54:52,867 --> 00:54:55,533
Because the former Chief Inspector
was often violent,

867
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:59,700
the servants from there had no choice
but to come to Hyeminseo frequently.

868
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:03,333
Predictably, it's the same old story.

869
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:06,767
Thank you.

870
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,767
Why are you thanking me?

871
00:55:09,767 --> 00:55:14,233
Well, I know them fairly well too.

872
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,767
It's not gratitude someone
as idle as me deserves.

873
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:21,667
There's someone else you should thank.

874
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:22,867
Who?

875
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:24,767
There is

876
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:28,500
a meddlesome fool, just like you.

877
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,467
<i>You mean Gil Dong, huh?</i>

878
00:55:30,467 --> 00:55:34,567
I only passed along his message.

879
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:42,433
Even your resolve to convey
his message counts too.

880
00:55:42,433 --> 00:55:44,600
No, really, it does not.

881
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:48,000
From what I can see,
you seem like a decent person,

882
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,733
but you don't seem to realize it yourself.

883
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,467
Or are you just pretending not to be?

884
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,500
How can you be so sure just
from seeing me a few times?

885
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:03,033
It's intuition honed through
years of social experience.

886
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:06,400
Anyway, about this,

887
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,300
it's truly fortunate that
you resolved this matter.

888
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,367
Fortunate?

889
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:15,967
What exactly do you mean?

890
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,667
I mean...

891
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,133
You're intelligent,

892
00:56:21,133 --> 00:56:23,467
and accomplished in many ways,
that sort of thing.

893
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:25,600
Don't say that so lightly.

894
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,233
- What?
- Poverty,

895
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:29,967
misery, wretchedness, tears.

896
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:32,967
It sounds like I might be one of the few

897
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:35,667
fortunate things amid all that misery.

898
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,567
I simply meant it was fortunate.

899
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,033
Follow me.

900
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:49,800
Instead of returning your robe string,
I'll change your dressing.

901
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,000
Before the Chief kicks us out.

902
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,133
Who's getting kicked out?

903
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,300
Hey, hey, Jae Yi.

904
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,733
Let's have just one more drink.

905
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,133
Let go.

906
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:14,300
[Hyeminseo]

907
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,233
It's Hyeminseo.

908
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:23,867
Perfect! I'll finish off this wench today!

909
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,900
I've said it many times,

910
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,400
but prohibitions, orders,
permissions, relief,

911
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,133
those are usually my domain.

912
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:37,800
I was joking.

913
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,033
Even if you come again, he won't
chase you away, so don't worry.

914
00:57:41,033 --> 00:57:43,200
That's not what I worry about.

915
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,467
Imagine how appalled the Chief
would be if he knew who he banned.

916
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:49,567
That's what worries me.

917
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,033
Since earlier, you...

918
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:54,467
You must be the offspring
of a very distinguished family, huh?

919
00:57:54,467 --> 00:57:56,267
One of the most distinguished in Joseon.

920
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:57,933
Just know that much for now.

921
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:02,167
I'm sparing you the shock
by not telling you all at once.

922
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:05,667
And I treated such an esteemed
person like a fool.

923
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:07,967
You must've found it terribly unfair, huh?

924
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:09,767
It was strange.

925
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:14,767
A strange woman not even half my size

926
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:16,800
standing defiantly before me.

927
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,900
His mind seems unsound and prone to mistakes,

928
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,167
so please show a gentleman's forbearance.

929
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,567
That's why I became curious.

930
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:32,200
Was that when it began?

931
00:58:38,133 --> 00:58:40,300
That's ridiculous.

932
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,467
That really exists?

933
00:58:43,733 --> 00:58:45,533
What does?

934
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:58,500
Why are you looking at me
like that? It's embarrassing.

935
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,800
Same here.

936
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,900
I'm embarrassed by myself too.

937
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,200
What?

938
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,600
What I'm about to say will be
even more embarrassing.

939
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,667
Do you have a man you like?

940
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:14,300
W-Why do you ask?

941
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,033
Even if there is, it's none of my concern.

942
00:59:16,033 --> 00:59:19,067
You have time tomorrow, right?
Make time for me.

943
00:59:19,067 --> 00:59:21,133
What are you doing now?

944
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:23,033
I'm making a move on you.

945
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:29,133
And starting now,

946
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:31,433
I intend to do it properly.

947
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,733
Oh.

948
00:59:39,733 --> 00:59:41,933
That... That is...

949
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:49,100
I'm soon to be married...

950
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,000
How did you get in here?

951
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,000
What is this?

952
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,967
Late at night,

953
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,333
a man and woman alone?

954
01:00:13,233 --> 01:00:14,400
Who is this man?

955
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,867
You should introduce yourself first.

956
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,100
Wait a moment.

957
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,433
What's the matter?

958
01:00:31,733 --> 01:00:35,067
You look flustered. Amusing, isn't it?

959
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,167
I must have seen something
I shouldn't have, huh?

960
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:42,867
What?

961
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,900
It looks exactly like a secret rendezvous.

962
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,767
And a meddler shows up
at just the right moment, right?

963
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:55,067
Does that guy know?

964
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:58,100
That you're marrying a seventy-year-old man.

965
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,767
Wow.

966
01:01:07,767 --> 01:01:10,667
Your expression keeps
getting more interesting.

967
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:15,200
It'd be even more amusing
if that fellow knew.

968
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,200
Hey.

969
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:32,167
You tell him.

970
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,728
Who do you think

971
01:01:34,728 --> 01:01:36,633
I am exactly?

972
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,067
<i>♫ I want to hold you, loving you ♫</i>

973
01:01:49,067 --> 01:01:54,267
<i>♫ I don't want to let you go
for even a moment ♫</i>

974
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:58,600
<i>♫ Staying just like that dreamlike image ♫</i>

975
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,733
<i>♫ Will you stay forever,
even as time passes ♫</i>

976
01:02:02,733 --> 01:02:08,300
<i>♫ Now, come to my side, loving you ♫</i>

977
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,900
<i>♫ If you come one step closer ♫</i>

978
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:19,333
<i>♫ Every day filled with you and me ♫</i>

979
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:23,833
<i>♫ Will shine beautifully, I believe ♫</i>

980
01:02:34,267 --> 01:02:36,900
I hope we don't meet again after today.

981
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,933
Shall I take her?

982
01:02:37,933 --> 01:02:39,333
I'm the Grand Prince of this nation.

983
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:40,900
Do you think I can't take her if I want to?

984
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,600
Is heartbreak really that painful?

985
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,800
Reject the marriage.

986
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,367
Do you really want to be sold off?

987
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:49,133
As you said, it's just the desperate struggle

988
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:52,000
of an eolnyeo trying to survive.

989
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,133
Why not be honest?

990
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:55,067
You're running away from me right now, right?

991
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:56,600
How many times have you even met me?

992
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,267
How many more times do you need?

993
01:02:58,267 --> 01:02:59,767
To make you understand this behavior.

994
01:02:59,767 --> 01:03:01,167
Just one word is enough.

995
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:04,100
Just say you'll accept me.
