1
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,426
<i>Why am I in the market?</i>

2
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,553
Gil-dong is here!

3
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,305
Find Gil-dong!

4
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,389
Gil-dong?

5
00:00:58,933 --> 00:00:59,809
What?

6
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,069
What happened to my voice?

7
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,280
Is something wrong with my ears?

8
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,213
What?

9
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,386
Why is your face…

10
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,265
Why is your voice…

11
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,395
Why am I…

12
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,280
What on earth is happening?

13
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,922
How much longer should I wait?

14
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,258
Why won't I wake up?
Why isn't this a dream?

15
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,384
Why on earth

16
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,262
am I in the aide's body?

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,225
Let's go to where I was.

18
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,476
I must go to where I am.

19
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,522
But where am I?

20
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,943
Tell Her Majesty that

21
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,863
it's an urgent matter
relating to my marriage arrangement.

22
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:35,822
Yes, my lady.

23
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,787
May I ask you a question?

24
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,374
We meet again.

25
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,919
<i>Again? It seems like</i>
<i>I'm supposed to know her.</i>

26
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,921
Nice to see you again?

27
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,465
You remember me this time.

28
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,676
<i>Did he not recognize her before?</i>

29
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,803
Of course, I do.

30
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,265
I'm a little lost right now.

31
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,516
Where are we?

32
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,102
We're in the palace.

33
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,021
Palace?

34
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,397
Yes, palace.

35
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,358
Palace? I'm in the royal palace?

36
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,985
The palace where the king lives?

37
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,487
<i>Why the palace, of all places?</i>

38
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,365
<i>I'm not familiar with this place.</i>
<i>I don't know how to get out of here.</i>

39
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,783
You said you knew me.

40
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,410
Can you help me?

41
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,623
Sure.

42
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,667
You helped me last time.
Let me know if there's anything I can--

43
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,668
Thank you.

44
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,551
Where's the next gate?

45
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,136
Hyeopsaeng Gate is over there.

46
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,846
My apologies, but could we make haste?

47
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,889
I must hurry.

48
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,806
Sure.

49
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,775
What a pair of impetuous young things.

50
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,194
But how strange.

51
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,198
The man looks just like my son.

52
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,784
It is unfortunate, Your Majesty.

53
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,829
Send for Magistrate Seo.

54
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,631
Thank you for guiding me out.

55
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,384
And my hands…

56
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,721
Pardon my discourtesy. I was in haste.

57
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,266
Seeing that Your Highness
returned so late,

58
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,351
something must've happened
at the constabulary.

59
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,687
It seems so.

60
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,814
I can go alone from here.

61
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,065
Thanks for today.

62
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,609
Hae-rim!

63
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,861
That's my name.

64
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,325
Hae-rim of the Shin Family.

65
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,160
And my brother is

66
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,038
the Superintendent at the Hyeminseo.

67
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,750
You're the Superintendent's sister?

68
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,295
You don't look like him.

69
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,005
You're beautiful.

70
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,173
If you'll excuse me.

71
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,184
Next time,

72
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,729
please remember my name too.

73
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,781
How did you…

74
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,159
Has my message already reached you?

75
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,036
No, sir.

76
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:28,953
Pardon?

77
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,580
I mean…

78
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,623
I was passing by on other business.

79
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,297
<i>I threw those into the well.</i>

80
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,840
<i>They found them already.</i>

81
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,300
They're Gil-dong's.

82
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,511
The Chief Censor was

83
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,263
killed by Gil-dong today.

84
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,807
Is that so?

85
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,477
About four hours ago,

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,229
he came to spy
on the Chief Censor's residence.

87
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,901
And it seems he was injured around here.

88
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,154
<i>Was I bleeding this much?</i>

89
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,864
It seems his injury slowed him down,

90
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,116
so he discarded his mask and robe

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,037
and fled with his true face exposed.

92
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,248
<i>I must've been unconscious for a while.</i>

93
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,625
<i>I wonder if I woke up myself</i>

94
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,211
<i>or someone moved me.</i>

95
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,756
Aide Kang, listen carefully.

96
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,008
Gil-dong

97
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,760
has been framed.

98
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,386
He's been framed?

99
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,638
Do you remember

100
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,015
when the ruffians around Unjong Street

101
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,226
were caught with the silk
they had stolen last winter?

102
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,478
They claimed it was
what Gil-dong had stolen.

103
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,646
I remember that.

104
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,607
Someone from the merchant guild
remembered one of the ruffians,

105
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,609
so Gil-dong was able to clear his name.

106
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,777
There was another case.

107
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,779
There was a rumor
that Gil-dong carried off

108
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,781
the Inspector General's daughter-in-law.

109
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,325
It turned out that she had eloped

110
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,202
with the writing tutor.

111
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,872
So someone used Gil-dong's name again?

112
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,667
I never imagined his name
would be used in a murder.

113
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,085
In any case,

114
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,045
just focus on finding evidence.

115
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,214
Don't be fooled
by the blood-written message.

116
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,382
Yes, Your Highness.

117
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,678
But I haven't reported

118
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,013
those cases to you.

119
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,933
You already know a lot of details,
including the blood-written message.

120
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,936
I happened to hear it in passing.

121
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,355
Is that so?

122
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,065
Right.

123
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,986
Was there any report
of someone found collapsed nearby?

124
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,195
No, Your Highness.

125
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:27,989
By the way…

126
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,911
Have you been drinking?

127
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,081
I guess I have.

128
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,251
I heard that today
was Physician Hong's wedding.

129
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,836
That may explain it.

130
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,214
I must go now.

131
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,757
Where?

132
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,800
Later!

133
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,510
You can't just go without Officer Seo!

134
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,678
Your Highness!

135
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,747
There you are.

136
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,543
A physician was here too.

137
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,213
Who brought me here?

138
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,132
Let's keep this to ourselves.
Don't tell anyone.

139
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,219
If the elders learn the new bride
was found unconscious outside the house,

140
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,553
it would reflect poorly on her.

141
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,013
All right.

142
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,057
Good thing you found her.

143
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,060
What on earth was she doing there?

144
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,649
Was she trying to run away
because her husband died?

145
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,566
What?

146
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,110
Shut your mouth.

147
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,112
Hey.

148
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,822
Wake up.

149
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,075
Why won't she wake up?

150
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,203
Her heart's still beating though.

151
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,208
Is anyone in there?

152
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,586
Is this body empty?

153
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,131
Anybody here?

154
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,300
Are you there?

155
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,765
What?

156
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,934
Am I back now?

157
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,853
I knew it.

158
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,939
It was just a dream.

159
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,107
If you were really back,

160
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,150
you wouldn't be seeing this face.

161
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,406
Who are you?

162
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,200
Whoever is speaking there,

163
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,660
are you the owner of this face?

164
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,162
Eun-jo of the Hong family?

165
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,998
How is this…

166
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,876
Are our souls really switched?

167
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,837
This doesn't make any sense!

168
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,299
Does it hurt a lot?

169
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,176
How did you hurt your head?

170
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,015
I tripped and fell outside
because it was dark.

171
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,642
How did you get here?

172
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,563
I passed out again
as soon as I opened my eyes.

173
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,648
Just before that,
the Chief Censor's slaves came.

174
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,651
<i>He doesn't know I'm Gil-dong.</i>

175
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,946
Goodness.

176
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,742
How can my own face look so unfamiliar?

177
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,368
Same here.

178
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,829
First, we must find a way to switch back.

179
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,082
We should get out of here.

180
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,834
Can you move?

181
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,055
The sun is up.

182
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,973
Go get some sleep.

183
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,059
Father will be out soon.

184
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,236
<i>I delivered the dinner as you ordered.</i>

185
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,530
I told her to get some sleep after dinner.

186
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,117
Please excuse me.

187
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,290
She looked like
she could die at any minute.

188
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,292
Poor Eun-jo could fall seriously ill.

189
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,253
She might as well just die.

190
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,766
If you just disappear,
it might stir up trouble.

191
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,936
Tell the doorkeeper
that you're visiting your mother.

192
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,854
My mother?

193
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,398
Then, where am I now?

194
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,818
Is this your in-law's place?

195
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,406
Blast.

196
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,990
Why did they have to move you here?

197
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,202
As of yesterday, this is where I live.

198
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,458
By the way, why did they put
the mourning dress on me?

199
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,044
Did someone in this family die?

200
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,964
That…

201
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,925
Well, that's…

202
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,762
Someone's coming.

203
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,682
They might see me, so I'll hide.

204
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,565
Great.

205
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,191
<i>Why that wretch, of all people?</i>

206
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,571
What are you doing here this early?

207
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,239
I mean…

208
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,159
what brings you here, sir?

209
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,206
I came to move the body,
but I guess I came too early.

210
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,291
<i>Oh, no.</i>

211
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,584
<i>The second son?</i>

212
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,003
The body?

213
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,047
Why would the body be here?

214
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,424
Young Master?

215
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,178
Isn't the body supposed to be placed
behind the incense table?

216
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,346
Go check in the men's quarters.

217
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,639
Young Master.

218
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,558
Are you joking?

219
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,684
Not at all.

220
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,519
Young Master.

221
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,063
You've come to the wrong place.

222
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,440
Now, go back, Young Master.

223
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,442
You almost disappointed me.

224
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,824
Because you can't die before I ruin you.

225
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,743
Look…

226
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,333
You see,

227
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,920
I don't quite follow you.

228
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,338
How could a husband

229
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,633
say such things to his new bride?

230
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,469
Husband?

231
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,930
<i>Oh, no…</i>

232
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,724
You're supposed
to love and cherish your bride.

233
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,267
And you said what? Ruin her?

234
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,981
If you had a fight
with your wife last night…

235
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,316
Who is this husband?

236
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,526
What are you saying?

237
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,486
It's you, obviously.

238
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,905
<i>This is getting out of hand.</i>

239
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,617
Enough joking around.

240
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,077
What makes you think I'm joking?

241
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,411
Have you lost your mind?

242
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,081
The husband you keep talking about
passed away last night.

243
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,834
Passed away?

244
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,800
So I'm in this mourning dress
because of my husband?

245
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,011
Then, who are you?

246
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:09,890
Answer me.

247
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,518
The grandchild of the deceased.

248
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,437
Grandchild?

249
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,317
What brings you here at this hour?

250
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,279
To keep my family under control.

251
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,991
<i>Is that why…</i>

252
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,704
Wait.

253
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,623
If he had a grandchild,

254
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,460
he must've been well over 60, 70, even.

255
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,797
This marriage makes no sense.

256
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,304
Have you really lost your mind?

257
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,140
Or did you finally come to your senses?

258
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,474
Well, obviously…

259
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,520
It's the latter.

260
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,479
Young Master.

261
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,651
I guess

262
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,445
I wasn't thinking straight for a moment

263
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,655
because of the shock.

264
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,075
Thanks for helping me understand
what's going on, grandchild.

265
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,829
By the way,

266
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,749
I would appreciate it
if you could erase from your memory

267
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,460
that I just mistook you for my husband.

268
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,046
To have thought so, even for a moment,

269
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,506
is deeply dishonorable to me.

270
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,593
You've come to your senses,

271
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,387
but what's with this attitude?

272
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,513
Young Master.

273
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,392
Some mourners have arrived from the east.

274
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:36,977
Go ahead.

275
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,355
The chief mourner
shouldn't be away for too long.

276
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,272
Young Master.

277
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,154
You there, wait.

278
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,451
How are you feeling, my lady?

279
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,495
Do you remember
being carried in yesterday?

280
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,998
Vaguely.

281
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,709
Since I'm a woman,

282
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,045
I don't have to receive mourners.

283
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,924
Please make sure no one enters here
during the mourning period.

284
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,969
I will be visiting my mother.
Don't let anyone know.

285
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,679
Yes, my lady.

286
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,857
You can come out now, Hong Eun-jo.

287
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,372
Climb over the wall.

288
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,916
I don't want to stay here
even for a second.

289
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,970
Where are we going?

290
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,889
No one passes through this path.

291
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,141
We can talk here.

292
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,816
About my wedding, what you heard is true.

293
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,485
The old master was my husband,

294
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,280
and he passed away
right after the wedding.

295
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,908
I know this may sound absurd to you,

296
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,161
but this is common
for people of my status.

297
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,627
I'm sorry for saying
I was to marry their second son. I lied.

298
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,464
I just thought it was for the best.

299
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,592
Because it would help you move on faster

300
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,261
and ease my mind.

301
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,480
Why are you staying silent?

302
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,566
Say something.
We need to find a way to fix this.

303
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,361
I just don't know what to say.

304
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,449
I've been thinking about it
the whole way here,

305
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,701
and there's nothing I can say.

306
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,040
Since I'm nobody to you,

307
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,502
I can't even be angry with you.

308
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,047
And I know how difficult
your choice must have been,

309
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,590
so I can't even blame you.

310
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,510
But I don't want to pretend
that I accept or support what you said.

311
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,928
That this is common.

312
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,932
What's driving me crazy right now

313
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,601
is that I'm not in my own body,

314
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,979
so I can't even just go and drag you
out of that family like a tyrant.

315
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,363
So I must get my body back first.

316
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,325
It sounds like
you will actually do what you just said

317
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,786
once you get your body back.

318
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,287
That is exactly what I meant.

319
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,125
I'm also thinking about
how I should destroy this family

320
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,752
that let this wedding happen
so I can ease my anger.

321
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,592
But what makes me most angry is

322
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,387
that I was completely unaware of this

323
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,223
and gave you the silk shoes,

324
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,017
wishing you happiness.

325
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,519
I'm so mad at myself.

326
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,857
So I'm telling you in advance this time.

327
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,734
From now on,
I will be even more relentless.

328
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,487
I will not hesitate even for a moment.

329
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,449
Let us leave it at that.

330
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,580
You could have

331
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,957
avoided it.

332
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,003
You could have told me about it.

333
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,088
I didn't feel the need to avoid it.

334
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,674
And it's nothing so pitiful
that I should need help.

335
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,886
It is unfortunate that

336
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,054
the ill man passed away
on the day of the wedding,

337
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,474
but I was to live
the rest of my life comfortably,

338
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,935
in their annex as the mistress.

339
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,688
That was until our bodies were switched.

340
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,567
All the more reason
to switch our bodies back.

341
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,528
You have a comfortable life to live,
and I have tyranny to exercise.

342
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,697
We each have duties to fulfill.

343
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,241
That will be our agreement for now.

344
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,536
Madam, are you all right?

345
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,790
The old master has passed away?

346
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,418
Then, what happens to Eun-jo?

347
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,462
She's a young widow now.

348
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,506
Can we bring her back?

349
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,925
She's married now.

350
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,509
She's part of their family.

351
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,221
That means she must live with them
for the rest of her life.

352
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,350
Unless she runs away somewhere far away.

353
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,645
Runs away?

354
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,903
I've never read a story like this
in any book.

355
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,323
I've never heard a myth
or folk tale like this either.

356
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,158
I've been thinking about it,

357
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,327
and this isn't the work of a human.

358
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,538
So this was done by something greater?

359
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,790
As a punishment?

360
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,541
Well, it's clearly not a blessing.

361
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,382
I won't be mad at you,

362
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,384
so please be honest with me.

363
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,719
Have you done something bad lately?

364
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,138
No.

365
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,726
And even if I have,
why would you be punished with me?

366
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,939
The question is
why it's you and me, of all people.

367
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,278
What's your date of birth?

368
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,530
Gyehae day, Gyeongja month, Byeongo year.

369
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,032
That's different from mine.

370
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,162
So are we turning to superstition?

371
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,372
Then, follow me.

372
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,428
You're a physician.
Can't you approach it scientifically?

373
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,138
Quiet. You'll bring bad energy.

374
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,058
There is

375
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,893
a virgin ghost in your body.

376
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,980
Do you see it?

377
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,774
Are you really seeing something?

378
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,903
That's why he knows
what women want better than women.

379
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,823
You.

380
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,826
You're a philanderer, aren't you?

381
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,372
Get up. Let's go.

382
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,126
Let's do a ritual.

383
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,961
I will exorcise the ghost.

384
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,296
Listen,

385
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,174
I have no intention
of letting this lady leave my body.

386
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,801
Why don't we try the ritual?

387
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,345
Once the spirit is out of the body,

388
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,097
we can see what we can do.

389
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,849
What if it never comes back?

390
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,726
I have no interest
in seeing the other world.

391
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,981
What if it wasn't our souls
that were switched,

392
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,524
but our bodies?

393
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,234
What?

394
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,528
In that case, we must use our bodies.

395
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,250
Take my hand, sincerely and solemnly.

396
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,279
Do you feel anything?

397
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:27,823
Not at all.

398
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,451
You said we should use our bodies.

399
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,286
Just holding hands won't do anything.

400
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,205
So what do you suggest we do?

401
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,165
Don't take this the wrong way.

402
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,708
Take what?

403
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,020
Could you try to meet me halfway?

404
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,147
What?

405
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,064
Right.

406
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,508
Do you feel anything?

407
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,094
Yes, it's quite loud.

408
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,224
I didn't know my heartbeat was so loud.

409
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,101
Is this a joke to you?

410
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,562
I like the sound of it.

411
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,481
Listen to it all you want
when you're back.

412
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,942
So it's not our bodies either.

413
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,906
What time was it when we were switched?

414
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,825
Around the curfew hour yesterday.

415
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,123
Is that when we will switch back?

416
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,750
Is this just a nightmare?

417
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,169
It's the curfew hour!

418
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,385
It seems like the nightmare…

419
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,889
…will be a long one.

420
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,644
Blast.

421
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,148
Earlier, you said it couldn't be
the work of a human.

422
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,526
That means nothing a human does will help.

423
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,320
Can we even continue to live like this?

424
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,197
Without knowing
when we'll be switched back?

425
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,116
Your Highness, there you were!

426
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,497
Your Highness's quarters
are in great uproar.

427
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,624
It's you again.

428
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,751
I will say no more.

429
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,004
Your face said it all.

430
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,339
What?

431
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,716
It's obvious
that I'm the one being dragged out.

432
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,677
And you look like
you're about to blame me.

433
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,345
Blame this wretch. He clung to me.

434
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,930
This wretch?

435
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,432
Remember whose mouth
you're using to speak now.

436
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,977
If it's right, does it matter
whose mouth says it?

437
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:04,938
Look.

438
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,482
Ignore him and talk to me, sir.

439
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,317
- Pardon?
- I mean, talk to me.

440
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,527
Yes.

441
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,280
The palace is in an uproar right now.

442
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,698
Why?

443
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,242
Her Majesty has ordered you
to return at once.

444
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,743
Her Majesty? Why?

445
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,538
Tell Her Majesty that

446
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,416
he can't go right now
due to the circumstances.

447
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,584
It is not your place to meddle.

448
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,212
He only listens to you. You say it.

449
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,213
You?

450
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,757
Her Majesty stopped eating last night

451
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,010
and says she will not eat
until you're there.

452
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,511
Because of me?

453
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,596
Who else could it be?

454
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,225
What trouble did you get yourself into?

455
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,230
There's no dignity,

456
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,607
grace or any pretext whatsoever.

457
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,319
Why does it have to be revealed
when I'm in this body?

458
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,452
Go and tell Her Majesty
that he's coming back.

459
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,208
So…

460
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,338
It seems like you must go back,

461
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,840
Your Highness.

462
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,968
Your Highness?

463
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,389
Yes, that's you.

464
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,516
The Grand Prince.

465
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,369
So, you're saying

466
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,830
you're the late King's second son?

467
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,500
Yes.

468
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,170
And the young brother
of His Majesty, the current king.

469
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,963
That's right.

470
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,173
In other words,

471
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,550
you're the prince of Joseon.

472
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,805
You seem pretty surprised.

473
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,556
'Cause I'm handsome, like the rumors say?

474
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,523
You woke up in a palace.

475
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,776
I thought you'd guess that much.

476
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,493
You've become really quiet.

477
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,331
I don't know what to say either.

478
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,585
I can't help but hold my tongue

479
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,131
under the weight
of the Grand Prince's name.

480
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,258
Don't be like that. It's not like you.

481
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,554
I'm trying to remember
everything I've said so far.

482
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,431
Would any of that
be considered high treason?

483
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,808
If that is the case,
would I be granted time to atone?

484
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,560
Just act as usual.

485
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,229
Act as usual and get my head chopped off?

486
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,897
Is that a joke?

487
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,443
All my life,

488
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,154
I've never been anywhere
near the royal family, ever.

489
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,448
Then, all of a sudden,
I'm here with someone

490
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,159
at the very center of the royal family,
at its very top.

491
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,452
Imagine how shocked I must be.

492
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,370
That is exactly why I didn't tell you.

493
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,999
Because I knew it would make anyone
feel pressured and uncomfortable.

494
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,335
I didn't hide it
because it was impressive or anything.

495
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,298
This is my royal command.

496
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,967
Treat me like before.
And I tolerate no disobedience.

497
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,471
When I woke up in the palace,

498
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,765
I thought you were here on work
because you're an aide.

499
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,433
Who'd think the palace is your home?

500
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,102
There are probably no more
than a dozen people who live there.

501
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,231
There are more than ten, at least.

502
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,442
I'm not in a position to say this,
because I lied too,

503
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,235
but this is just not a good time.

504
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,654
You can refuse if you want.

505
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,864
What?

506
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,159
How could you say something so unfilial
when your mother is refusing to eat?

507
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,661
The owner of that body

508
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,163
isn't exactly a filial son anyway.

509
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,582
So do you want me

510
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,752
to starve the Queen of this country
to death?

511
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,172
I'm not refusing to go.
I'm asking what I should do.

512
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,132
Come on. It's almost dawn.

513
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,967
Just do as I say.

514
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,847
First, put your hands behind your back.

515
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,433
Keep your back straight at all times,

516
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,977
and look as arrogant as possible.

517
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,854
What?

518
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,774
<i>Didn't you say he was coming?</i>

519
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,192
There comes His Highness.

520
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,165
<i>She must be Her Majesty.</i>

521
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,590
<i>Don't be nervous. Just do as I was told.</i>

522
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,302
<i>Whatever I say, it doesn't come from me.</i>

523
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,556
It seems Your Majesty's stubbornness
deepens with age.

524
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,016
Why did you stop eating?

525
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,018
It'll only ruin your fair face.

526
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,479
Where did you sleep the last two nights?

527
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,147
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

528
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,233
<i>My harsh words didn't surprise her at all.</i>

529
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,569
Somewhere where the sky is my roof

530
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,529
and the wind is my blanket.

531
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,658
With that lady as your companion?

532
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,742
That lady?

533
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,495
Hey, you didn't mention any lady.
Who is she?

534
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,830
I don't know either.

535
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:14,914
Then, who knows?

536
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,376
Last night, I saw you
frolicking around the palace,

537
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,962
hand in hand with this lady.

538
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,720
Your Majesty, it's a misunderstanding.

539
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,638
There is nothing between that lady and me.

540
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,432
I only met her once.

541
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,809
No, I didn't meet her only once.

542
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,727
I met her twice.

543
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,395
Don't look so flustered.

544
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,438
Dignity.

545
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,857
I will ask her myself.

546
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,567
Which family does she belong to?

547
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,068
Play innocent.

548
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,695
I don't know. I really don't.

549
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,073
Must I question all ladies in this country
to get you to talk?

550
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,412
Tell her it was just one night's fun
so you don't know her name.

551
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,915
It was just one night's fun
so I don't know her name.

552
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,458
What?

553
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,002
Are you saying you indulged in
so-called free love,

554
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,087
like the rabble?

555
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,547
- I'm one of them.
- I'm one of them.

556
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,259
What?

557
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,512
How dare you?

558
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,765
I apologize for making your son like that.

559
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,684
No, I mean…

560
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,603
I apologize for acting like the rabble.

561
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,814
You're the Grand Prince.

562
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,609
You are to be virtuous
and serve as an example.

563
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,950
Send for the royal physician at once.

564
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,952
You're unwell as it is.

565
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,037
Why did you stop eating
and make things worse…

566
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,214
That's what His Highness said

567
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,842
over and over
because he was so deeply concerned.

568
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,719
So it just rolled off my tongue.

569
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,222
Right. I did do that.

570
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,307
Are you all right?

571
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,101
Get your hands off me.

572
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,435
What a scoundrel.

573
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,647
How dare you treat a precious young lady
as a mere one-night stand?

574
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,191
That is not how I raised you.

575
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,987
If you have any respect for me,

576
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,863
at least pretend to obey the confinement.

577
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,032
I will do so.

578
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,499
You're a court lady I haven't seen before.

579
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,459
Me?

580
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,047
I'm the new court lady
appointed to His Highness' quarters.

581
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,633
What is your name?

582
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,223
My name is Hong-si, Your Majesty.

583
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,822
Hong-si?

584
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,199
What's wrong with that?

585
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,369
CONDOLENCES

586
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,917
My condolences
on your grandfather's passing.

587
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,837
It's because the wrong woman
married into this family.

588
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,719
If you want a drink, come out.

589
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:17,930
Jae-i,

590
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,433
I'll pass on the drink.

591
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,769
Look over there.

592
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,440
She's Eun-jo's mother.

593
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,151
Could you let her see Eun-jo briefly?

594
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:45,041
I kept it secret
'cause she said she'd visit her mother.

595
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,173
It's my fault.

596
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,675
I caused Her Majesty's displeasure.

597
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,678
Don't worry. This isn't the first time.

598
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,349
We can't continue to stay together.

599
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,975
I must take your body

600
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,520
to your mother's place
by tomorrow morning.

601
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,357
Staying in the annex during mourning
isn't suspicious,

602
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,775
but tomorrow is the funeral.

603
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,902
You should at least show your face.

604
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,280
Could you do that for me?

605
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,116
You said you must keep it.

606
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,245
I don't understand what you must
keep through that marriage, though.

607
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,958
What about you?
Do you think you can be by yourself?

608
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,918
I should be able to.

609
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,213
We must find a way to go back
without disrupting our everyday lives.

610
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,971
Then, we need to pull another all-nighter.

611
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,270
Who is she?

612
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,438
Why does she act like a court lady?

613
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,274
What are they doing in there
for six hours?

614
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,358
Tell me about it.

615
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,568
As His Highness has ordered,

616
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,612
if this gets out,
everyone will be punished severely.

617
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,384
I think I've learned enough
about the people around you.

618
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,429
I'll handle the rest with my quick wits.

619
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,309
By the way…

620
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,854
Anything else you'd like to add?

621
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,357
I wasn't sure how to bring this up, but…

622
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,234
What is it?

623
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,570
Our bodies.

624
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,488
Let's say we didn't see anything.

625
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,199
I see.

626
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,034
Now you want privacy?

627
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,161
But we already saw everything.

628
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,538
No, I didn't see anything.

629
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,582
I'm not the one who saw it.

630
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,418
I saw it through your eyes,
so you're the one who saw it.

631
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,129
It sounds like you saw it very closely.

632
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,548
It's the same with my body.

633
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,300
You didn't touch my body.

634
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,010
It's my hands that touched my body.

635
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,346
Well…

636
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,723
Those are my memories, though.

637
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,641
Look here.

638
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,100
I'm confident.

639
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,728
You know what I mean.

640
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,105
I didn't see it.

641
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,690
I didn't see it through my eyes.

642
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,652
Now, call Dae-chu in.

643
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,946
What?

644
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,739
Are you avoiding my question?

645
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,871
I will walk from here.

646
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,872
People might see me.

647
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,083
Do as you please.

648
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,754
Dae-chu…

649
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,381
I mean,

650
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,049
Officer Seo.

651
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,637
Make sure you stay
by His Highness' side at all times.

652
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,472
See if he trembles with fear,

653
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,307
runs about flustered,

654
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,351
keeps to his meals,

655
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,311
or cries alone

656
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,481
at night.

657
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,858
Keep a close eye on him.

658
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,695
I don't need the advice. That's what I do.

659
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,405
Great then.

660
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,243
I know I should not meddle in matters
between a man and a woman…

661
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,080
I mean, I know it's beyond my concern,

662
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,540
but if you ever

663
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,042
hurt or take advantage of His Highness,

664
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,503
then I will step up.

665
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,755
Have you been always this cool
behind my back?

666
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,132
What?

667
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,175
You're one charming man.

668
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,523
Wait!

669
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,150
Stop what you were thinking.

670
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,654
YOUNG MASTER

671
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,572
MOTHER

672
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,203
Mother, Young Master.

673
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,831
What brings you here?

674
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:57,001
You little rascal.
Where have you been running around?

675
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,879
Young Master speaks before he thinks.

676
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,130
So ignore his harsh words.

677
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,965
<i>He's kind by nature.</i>

678
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,762
You could get kicked out for this.

679
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,555
That's exactly my wish.

680
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,639
What?

681
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,934
What matters is that she came back safely.

682
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,230
I went to tend to a sick patient.

683
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,859
That was very thoughtful of you.

684
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,278
You and your nosy nature.

685
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,155
Did you have to do this now?

686
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,157
The one who has passed is gone,

687
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,658
but the living must go on.

688
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,285
You don't even sound sad.

689
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:36,082
It's almost like you were waiting
for the Old Master to pass.

690
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,294
Look at her, Madam.

691
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,879
She didn't even answer.

692
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,923
I get it.

693
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,842
This is why you lied
about who you were marrying.

694
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,928
You must've been counting the days.

695
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:52,515
I should have known when you insisted,
despite Madam's objections.

696
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,851
Did I

697
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,312
hide it

698
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,773
even from my family?

699
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,942
Are you playing innocent now?

700
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,986
Be honest with me.
You just wanted a higher status.

701
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,741
Yes, apparently.

702
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,661
Madam.

703
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,954
Let's go.

704
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,664
We don't have to worry about her.

705
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,507
Can we talk for a moment?

706
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,719
All she cares about is me and my family.

707
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,976
So I married into this family

708
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,602
against your wishes.

709
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,899
Once you decide to do something,
you do it no matter what.

710
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,195
I didn't try to stop you again
because I knew you wouldn't listen.

711
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,031
I know that too well.

712
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,617
You raised one stubborn girl.

713
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,663
But now that I look back,

714
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:01,542
I may have used that
as an excuse to let you go.

715
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,004
I truly have no shame.

716
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,845
I really don't understand.

717
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,223
How is your daughter

718
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,643
supposed to feel right now?

719
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,189
You poor thing.

720
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,400
Of course, you don't understand.

721
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,612
It's because you buried everything

722
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,989
beneath the words "I'm fine."

723
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,283
You buried your heart.

724
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,335
Your Highness.

725
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,050
I watched her go in.

726
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,762
You must be tired. Get some rest.

727
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:56,931
By the way,

728
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,726
I learned something
while searching for Your Highness.

729
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,353
Do you know

730
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,481
who that woman

731
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,858
was wed to?

732
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,321
I ended up finding out

733
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,157
without meaning to.

734
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,579
I wish I'd never found out.

735
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,665
Your Highness,

736
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,708
are you all right?

737
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,169
I'm fine.

738
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,255
I will be fine.

739
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,134
<i>Does this mean</i>
<i>she always puts others before herself?</i>

740
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,179
It's all my fault.

741
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,307
All I ever taught her

742
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,351
was to endure and hold on.

743
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,357
I'm sorry, Eun-jo.

744
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,823
It seems like my mother is the one

745
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,367
I must protect.

746
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,204
No, don't.

747
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,792
Take this.

748
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,378
I borrowed it from the Director
of the Office of Royal Decrees.

749
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,674
What's this money for?

750
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,469
As you said,

751
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,764
you're a concubine in a powerful family,
so you'll live comfortably

752
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,934
without worrying about food or money.

753
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,020
But listen, Eun-jo.

754
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,606
If you ever

755
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,941
come to regret

756
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,320
your comfortable life
and want to run away,

757
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,363
take this.

758
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,576
I hear that no one can find
those who flee to the Ming.

759
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,041
Don't think about me or the lord

760
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,376
and go wherever you wish.

761
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,047
Could you give your mother
that one promise?

762
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,392
The beautiful daughter you know

763
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,186
would have made the promise.

764
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,356
But right now,

765
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,733
I can promise you this.

766
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,778
What is it?

767
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,910
I'll make sure
she never has to lift a finger.

768
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,426
<i>How is that thing going?</i>

769
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,012
I used the name
of a thief called Gil-dong.

770
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,851
Gil-dong?

771
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,187
He's the one who robbed
the Chief Censor's storehouse.

772
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,857
The Chief Censor spoke bitterly about him,
even to his last days,

773
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,651
so no one will find it suspicious.

774
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:03,909
Black Sword.

775
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,332
How are things at the constabulary?

776
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,501
They're investigating
those around the Chief Censor.

777
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,505
Keep a close watch over it.
Do not delegate this.

778
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,006
Yes, sir.

779
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,013
<i>Is it this country</i>

780
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,057
<i>that you covet?</i>

781
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,267
How dare you?

782
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,978
Do you have no fear of consequences?

783
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,271
If His Majesty finds out,

784
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,859
your entire family,
all three generations, will be quartered.

785
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,695
If you wish to live,

786
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:43,365
give me half of Joseon.

787
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,329
Greed

788
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,458
leads only to destruction
in the hands of the foolish.

789
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,838
<i>Engrave these words upon your heart,</i>

790
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,923
<i>though that heart will soon rot away.</i>

791
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,226
<i>I can run into other royal family members</i>
<i>during the day,</i>

792
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,812
<i>so I will learn my way around the palace</i>
<i>while everyone's asleep.</i>

793
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,740
Lady Jang.

794
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:09,493
She must be Geum-nok.
I've heard many rumors about her.

795
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,849
I smell medicinal herbs.

796
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,394
Where is it coming from?

797
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,698
<i>I've never smelled anything like this.</i>

798
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:52,452
<i>The smoke from burning medicinal herbs</i>
<i>can ease certain symptoms,</i>

799
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,289
<i>but filling a room with so much smoke</i>
<i>that it spills outside</i>

800
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,790
<i>can be dangerous.</i>

801
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,333
<i>Who is getting this treatment?</i>

802
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,712
"Gangnyeong Hall."

803
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,798
His Majesty's bedchamber.

804
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,677
Avoid His Majesty at all costs.

805
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,346
<i>No.</i>

806
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,099
<i>Wrong time to be nosy,</i>
<i>wrong person to be nosy with.</i>

807
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,687
GANGNYEONG HALL

808
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:25,902
Your Highness.

809
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,530
Quiet.

810
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,040
No one must know that I'm here.

811
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,126
Yes, Your Highness.

812
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,172
About the treatment
His Majesty is receiving…

813
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,767
The sound.

814
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,144
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

815
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,146
He suffers from skin affliction?

816
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,230
Yes, Your Highness.

817
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,025
What's the matter?

818
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,111
I said be quiet.
You'll awaken His Majesty.

819
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,092
Your Majesty?

820
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,022
You wanted to check the medicinal herbs?

821
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:46,942
Yes, Your Majesty.

822
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,860
I was going for a walk and…

823
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,154
Your Majesty,

824
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,864
we need to get the smoke out first.

825
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,617
Help me air the room.

826
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,911
You too, now.

827
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,128
What are you doing?

828
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,256
Your Majesty,

829
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,259
when overused,
any treatment can cause side effects.

830
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,761
Are you questioning
the royal physician's treatment?

831
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,762
I wouldn't dare.

832
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,556
But in my experience,
for skin afflictions,

833
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,766
a tonic brewed with cattle gallstones
and honeysuckle,

834
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,394
along with ointment and fresh air,
are most effective.

835
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,271
I meant you shouldn't rely
only on new herbs,

836
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,606
but use these proven treatments as well.

837
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:30,527
You seem to know
quite a bit about my condition.

838
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,365
You seem disappointed.

839
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,576
Because it isn't fatal enough to kill me.

840
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,077
Pardon?

841
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,246
That's not what it is.

842
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,416
In the thick smoke,
I could see Your Majesty's suffering.

843
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,169
What?

844
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,882
This skin affliction may appear
as small scars on the surface,

845
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,302
but it slowly erodes
the patient's everyday life.

846
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,263
And when prolonged,
it erodes their life as a whole.

847
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,266
The scar on the patient's body

848
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,020
scars their hearts as well.

849
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,648
So in hopes of easing that burden,
even a little,

850
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,276
I forgot my place and spoke out of turn.

851
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,830
You sounded pretty sincere.
I was almost moved.

852
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:25,957
Go now.

853
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,126
Yes, Your Majesty.

854
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,221
That was His Majesty?

855
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,183
Is he not on good terms
with the Grand Prince?

856
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,656
I should go back to my chamber now.

857
00:51:58,573 --> 00:51:59,741
It's already the curfew…

858
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,292
<i>Things have been so hectic</i>
<i>that I completely forgot about Gil-dong.</i>

859
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,337
<i>I wonder if they caught</i>
<i>the actual murderer.</i>

860
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,466
<i>I can't leave the palace</i>
<i>because I'm under confinement.</i>

861
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,760
<i>What do I do?</i>

862
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,138
What do you mean, it's not Gil-dong?

863
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,474
His name was written in blood.

864
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,352
We're investigating those
who may have grudges against the offender.

865
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,437
Did you just call my husband

866
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,982
"offender"?

867
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,818
He died an unjust death!

868
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,903
How dare you call him an offender?

869
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,655
How dare you?

870
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,073
Escort her home.

871
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:40,991
Yes, sir.

872
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,410
Let go of me!

873
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:54,588
Gil-dong?

874
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,673
Get him!

875
00:52:56,756 --> 00:53:00,260
Gil-dong, this wretch!

876
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,392
Don't kill him. We must take him alive!

877
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,322
Sir.

878
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,490
Inform His Highness of this at once.

879
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,450
Yes, sir.

880
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,740
<i>Chief Secretary Im Sa-hyeong's family.</i>

881
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,660
<i>Somehow, I'm peeking into</i>

882
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,162
<i>the most private family affairs</i>
<i>of Joseon's greatest schemer.</i>

883
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,380
<i>Lady Jang?</i>

884
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,853
What are you doing here,
dressed like that?

885
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,321
It seems Grand Prince Dowol
found out about the herbs.

886
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,700
Grand Prince Dowol?

887
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,077
Yes.

888
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,954
All the incense was removed.

889
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,677
What was that?

890
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,888
Why would my name
even come up in their conversation?

891
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,182
- Oh, no. He's caught?
- They caught Gil-dong.

892
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,436
- Gil-dong?
- Gil-dong was taken to the constabulary.

893
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,772
This is so frustrating.

894
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,192
Eun-jo!

895
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,194
Eun-jo.

896
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,321
Are you coming from the burial rites?

897
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,407
How are you feeling? Are you all right?

898
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:28,783
Yes.

899
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,910
By the way, Gil-dong was caught?

900
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,746
I just heard about it too.

901
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,749
Gil-dong was shot with an arrow yesterday.

902
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:37,876
What?

903
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,254
Eun-jo.

904
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,215
<i>His Highness has disappeared again?</i>

905
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:48,011
I didn't hear any cough so I checked,
and he was already gone.

906
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,265
The case is closed.

907
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:53,266
Yes, sir.

908
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,978
Wait!

909
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,481
Physician Hong.

910
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,705
<i>This was Gil-dong?</i>

911
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:24,964
His Highness folded the bedding
and the clothes this neatly?

912
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:26,841
That's not the only thing.

913
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:30,011
He was cleaning!

914
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,013
This is a grave matter.

915
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,766
Find His Highness!

916
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:35,767
Did something happen?

917
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,851
You scared me.

918
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,270
Where have you been?

919
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,605
I went to the Royal Pharmacy.

920
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,565
To have the tonic prepared
for Her Majesty.

921
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,525
Pardon?

922
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:47,028
I think I should do that much
to ease my guilt.

923
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,156
Why did you fold the bedding
and the nightclothes?

924
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,325
Because I woke up.

925
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:53,785
You could have summoned us.

926
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,913
Did Your Highness
put on your clothes yourself as well?

927
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,624
Yes, so you could sleep longer.

928
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:05,130
Please tell us if we have done
anything wrong, Your Highness!

929
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,131
You did nothing wrong.

930
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,174
Bring in the royal physician at once.

931
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,884
Why are you doing this?

932
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:10,969
Your Highness,

933
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,556
Officer Park has reached the constabulary.

934
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,142
Have they already received the message?

935
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:23,064
He was struck by an arrow
and died on the spot.

936
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:27,360
<i>Gil-dong has died?</i>

937
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,238
<i>And the fake Gil-dong?</i>

938
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,073
It's taken care of.

939
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,492
Take care of the rest with your own hands.

940
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,452
Yes, sir.

941
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,671
It's finished.

942
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,508
Farewell, Gil-dong.

943
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,343
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

944
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,020
<i>Someone might come to collect</i>

945
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,022
<i>the fake Gil-dong's body.</i>

946
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,261
<i>They were stored carefully.</i>

947
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,387
Those…

948
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,346
<i>I did that?</i>

949
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,764
<i>I kept them carefully?</i>

950
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,308
<i>Give me a break.</i>

951
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,934
<i>What am I to do with this?</i>

952
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:08,313
Should I have read the room
and waited before entering?

953
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,940
Yes. From now on,
count to ten before you enter.

954
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:14,110
<i>When you look at me,</i>
<i>I see turmoil in your eyes.</i>

955
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,236
What are you trying to do?

956
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,363
I'm trying to say nothing should be done.

957
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,366
<i>The Grand Prince keeps getting in the way.</i>

958
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,452
<i>You there, Grand Prince's court lady.</i>
<i>Halt.</i>

959
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,537
