1
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,227
How long have you been here?

2
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,146
For about an hour.

3
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,526
But shouldn't you be asking

4
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,529
why I came here in the first place?

5
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,369
You knew, didn't you?

6
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,248
Ever since that day.

7
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:26,878
Why am I…

8
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,304
What on earth is happening?

9
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,271
I must go to the palace.

10
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,160
Is that…

11
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,579
a <i>Baekjeong</i> mask?

12
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,500
Black clothes.

13
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,382
Physician's robe.

14
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,302
<i>Actually, Eun-jo must have seen him</i>
<i>better than me.</i>

15
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,012
Physician Hong was there too?

16
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,098
How did you know
I was at the constabulary?

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,641
Well…

18
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,059
In any case,

19
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,186
I'm so glad that you solved this case.

20
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,313
How fortunate.

21
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,247
It was you.

22
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,083
Gil-dong.

23
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,502
Where's Gil-dong?

24
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,670
He's not here.

25
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,796
Let's go that way.

26
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,387
He might have gone this way.

27
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,807
Come on.
Gil-dong would've gotten away just fine.

28
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,058
That would be a relief.

29
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,856
- Is that Eun-jo?
- What?

30
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,567
Hello, my body…

31
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,861
- Eun-jo!
- Eun-jo!

32
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,279
- Oh, dear!
- Eun-jo!

33
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,156
- Eun-jo! Oh, dear.
- Eun-jo!

34
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,369
Why didn't you ask me sooner?

35
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,206
Because you would've tried to hide it.

36
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,668
That night,

37
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,963
I heard from the soldiers
why they were chasing Gil-dong.

38
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,217
Gil-dong's name was written in blood,

39
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,677
but you couldn't have murdered
the Chief Censor

40
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,930
during your own wedding.

41
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,014
And

42
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,307
even if it was you,

43
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,684
you would've hidden it anyway.

44
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,730
But seeing that you're here,

45
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,273
it couldn't have been you.

46
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,735
It seems like
we're here for the same reason.

47
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,614
We're both here to see
if someone would come collect

48
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,907
the fake Gil-dong's body.

49
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,743
I'm sorry

50
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,662
I've been lying to you.

51
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,413
No need to apologize.

52
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,708
For a woman to step forward
and offer help to those people,

53
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,877
that's something that deserves praise.

54
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,551
So don't make a face like that.
It's my face.

55
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,797
He's buried over there.

56
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,384
I just want to pay my last respects.

57
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,096
Who's there?

58
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,139
What's going on?

59
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,765
What's happening?

60
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,809
It is a wild animal?

61
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,894
Lady Dong-ju, don't worry!

62
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,521
You're the one acting wild.

63
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,231
Are you trying your luck with me?

64
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,416
Do you know why he stopped there?

65
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,252
Wild animals, like tigers, roam that path.

66
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,546
That person framed you for murder.

67
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,922
I must know who this person is.

68
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,175
Let's stop chasing. It's too dangerous.

69
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,092
I don't care.

70
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,343
I care.

71
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,846
I don't want you to get hurt
because of this.

72
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,642
In case you forgot,

73
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,061
you're in my body.

74
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,188
What if you go
and get mauled by an animal?

75
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,314
It's my body.

76
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,232
Right.

77
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,068
I forgot.

78
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,240
Do you have anyone in mind

79
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,493
who might have killed the Chief Censor?

80
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,415
That man was hated by half the capital.

81
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,754
That means half the capital
would have wished him dead.

82
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,257
It might be difficult
to catch the culprit now.

83
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,843
After tonight, they will stay in hiding.

84
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,638
Why did they show up
at the constabulary as Gil-dong?

85
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,640
They wanted to stage Gil-dong's death

86
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,475
and bring the case to an end.

87
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,019
They needed a suspect
the people would believe,

88
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,604
and that was Gil-dong.

89
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,400
People would think
Gil-dong was really dead.

90
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,405
For a mere petty thief,

91
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,159
he gained far too much fame
and stirred up too many rumors.

92
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,829
I don't mean to dishonor the dead,

93
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,873
but perhaps it's best
that Gil-dong is forgotten like this.

94
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,668
Wait.

95
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,678
Are you saying

96
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,180
you will keep stealing?

97
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,060
Your silence says yes.

98
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,022
I just can't say

99
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,941
that I won't.

100
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,112
The reason I pretended
not to know you were Gil-dong

101
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,615
was because you wouldn't be able to steal
while our bodies were switched.

102
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,577
And I won't, so don't worry.

103
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,454
Do you think I'm worried about myself?

104
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,499
As I said, for a woman to step forward

105
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,126
and help those in need is admirable.

106
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,879
But I can only say that
because it already happened.

107
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,172
Things are different now.

108
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,632
That woman is you.

109
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,219
The theft, the fall,
being framed for murder,

110
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,638
all that dishonor falls upon you now.

111
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,809
Do you know how I felt on my way
to see the fake Gil-dong's body?

112
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,769
I blamed myself, and hated myself

113
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,355
for hiding you and not stopping you,

114
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,107
thinking I had brought you to that end.

115
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,859
You don't need to think that way.

116
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,110
I was never caught and--

117
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,653
You were already caught,

118
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,071
by me.

119
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,662
I'm warning you,

120
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,123
it doesn't matter whose body you're in.

121
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,000
If you ever steal again,

122
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,960
you will get caught again.

123
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,046
And just like last time,

124
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,214
it'll be by me.

125
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,142
<i>Once again, he caught me.</i>

126
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,739
I'll get going.

127
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,241
Halt.

128
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,327
What's that woman doing here at this hour?

129
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,247
A man?

130
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,707
Unbelievable.

131
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,674
INSTRUCTIONS FOR WOMEN

132
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,054
My lady!

133
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,764
The lord is arriving soon.

134
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,682
Hurry!

135
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,225
Oh, on my way.

136
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,103
My lady.

137
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,688
You have returned, Brother.

138
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,027
I told you to see to your appearance,
even for a brief outing.

139
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,571
- Pardon?
- My lady.

140
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,030
Your shoes.

141
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,785
I was so excited to see you.

142
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,954
Don't put this on me.

143
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,125
Here.

144
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,918
Take this to your fiancé.

145
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,963
The funeral must have worn him out.

146
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,675
About my marriage--

147
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,386
Your wedding will be postponed.

148
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,889
Holding two major family affairs
in the same year would be

149
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,017
too great a burden for his family.

150
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,560
<i>You don't look like him.</i>

151
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,686
You're beautiful.

152
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,522
My lady.

153
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,653
Did you laugh?

154
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,239
No, it's because I don't look like you…

155
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,909
No.

156
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,120
I mean…

157
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,455
What I meant was…

158
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,957
My lady!

159
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,340
<i>You don't look like him.</i>

160
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,091
You're beautiful.

161
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,720
Why did it come to mind at that moment?

162
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,557
Am I really that beautiful?

163
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,268
Or was it an exclamation?

164
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,312
Just like saying mountains are high

165
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,981
and flowers are pretty?

166
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,154
How long have you been standing there?

167
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,907
Since you started talking to yourself.

168
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,742
So you heard everything.

169
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,038
Here.

170
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,082
It's from my older brother.

171
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,417
He still thinks you're my fiancé.

172
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,259
I will bring up
our broken engagement today.

173
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,552
As you please.

174
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,474
You still seem to be in low spirits.

175
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,020
The fight for survival
that you mentioned on the rainy day

176
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,398
must still be ongoing.

177
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,319
Most definitely not.

178
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,529
If you'll excuse me.

179
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,452
That can't be true.

180
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,081
Oh, my.

181
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,835
Dressed like that, you really
do look like a lady of the annex.

182
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,046
How do I tie this?

183
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,342
I'm in no mood to see anyone.
Who is looking for me?

184
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,766
<i>The Chief Secretary's eldest son?</i>

185
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,438
Why did you want to meet me,

186
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,022
Young Master?

187
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,025
Were you with a man last night?

188
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:15,943
<i>A man?</i>

189
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,779
<i>Did he see her with me last night?</i>

190
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,158
I don't understand
what you're talking about,

191
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,117
Young Master.

192
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,455
Look at that shameless face of yours,
just like your father's.

193
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,501
What is all this noise about?

194
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,589
Father,

195
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,842
I saw this woman with a man last night.

196
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,262
Is that true?

197
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,806
<i>Even the Chief Secretary…</i>

198
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,100
<i>Wait.</i>

199
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,270
<i>The Chief Secretary's eldest son</i>
<i>comes to the palace every day.</i>

200
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,481
<i>There is no way he didn't recognize me.</i>

201
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,862
Must I even answer such a vulgar question?

202
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,988
What did you just say?

203
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,156
A truly virtuous man

204
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,200
asks for the full circumstances first,

205
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,869
even if he has his doubts.

206
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,916
The man I met yesterday
was the young master of my natal family.

207
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,001
Who did you think he was?

208
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,254
Did you not see his face?

209
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,965
I didn't get a look at it.

210
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,469
But the mere fact that a girl was out
at such a late hour…

211
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,762
A girl?

212
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,432
I may not be of a high status,
but I'm your senior by family order.

213
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,477
Choose your words carefully.

214
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,898
Above all, to dishonor me

215
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,776
is to dishonor your late grandfather,

216
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,654
which is something
a scholar-official must know.

217
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,408
Even when the royal family

218
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,827
takes in a concubine of low status,

219
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,872
she's granted a rank befitting
her position and treated with due respect.

220
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,333
And look at your attitude.

221
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,876
What? Have you forgotten your place?

222
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,795
Watch your words.

223
00:13:59,129 --> 00:13:59,964
Father.

224
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,639
He's not wrong.

225
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,724
Observe proper decorum.

226
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,730
The devotion you should have shown
in serving my father

227
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,609
shall now be devoted
to honoring him for the rest of your life.

228
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,446
Seung-jae, follow me
once you're ready to go to the palace.

229
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,031
Yes, Father.

230
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,578
I'll see you later.

231
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,497
If I must.

232
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,710
<i>Lay a finger on this body,</i>

233
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,337
<i>and you'll be beheaded at once.</i>

234
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,238
What is it?

235
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,034
I thought I would have a word
with my grandchild.

236
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,871
The men of this family
seem to have never learned

237
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,416
how to treat their elders,
so I was teaching them.

238
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,376
Mark my words,

239
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,213
from now on,
you'd better not say things like,

240
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,632
"a mere lowly girl,"

241
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,091
"a mere concubine,"

242
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,470
or anything about ruining or killing me.

243
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,348
If you say any of those things,

244
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,599
you'll be in serious trouble.

245
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,894
I was going to ruin you completely,

246
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,480
but it no longer seems worth it.

247
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,066
What?

248
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:43,859
I get it.

249
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,820
This is why you lied
about who you were marrying.

250
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,572
You must've been counting days.

251
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,740
Be honest with me.

252
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,117
You just wanted a higher status.

253
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,244
Yes, apparently.

254
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,829
It turns out that

255
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,248
you were not a filial daughter
who cared for her family,

256
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,960
but someone who only wanted

257
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,420
the title, wealth and higher status

258
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,631
that came
with the Chief Secretary's family.

259
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,300
It's so typical.

260
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,802
It's boring.

261
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,762
Look, Grandchild,

262
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,306
I wasn't speaking of status,

263
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,809
but of basic respect for human beings.

264
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,145
Was it too hard for you to understand?

265
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,315
Well,

266
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,152
I'm not interested
in your worldly way of thinking,

267
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,530
much less in lecturing you.

268
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,574
So let's just stick to basic courtesy.

269
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,873
You are no different from others.

270
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,585
Why don't you show that man
this side of yourself?

271
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,422
It would make a much stronger impression.

272
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,883
"That man"?

273
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,139
What?

274
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,391
There's another man?

275
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,193
Deliver this to Her Majesty.

276
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,945
And convey my regards.

277
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,613
Her Majesty has ordered that

278
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,615
Your Highness pay his respects
in person today.

279
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,047
You should eat jujubes,
instead of sweet snacks like yakgwa.

280
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,341
Your Majesty has a cold constitution,
so it's good for your body.

281
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,177
Open wide.

282
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,608
I hear you go to the Royal Pharmacy
every morning to have the tonic prepared.

283
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,276
Yes, Your Majesty.

284
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,531
What wicked scheme are you plotting?

285
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,159
I want to clear up that misunderstanding.

286
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,827
Misunderstanding?

287
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,912
Your son…

288
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,872
I mean, me.

289
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,917
I am not the scoundrel
or idler you think I am.

290
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,669
I mean, I know I'm mischievous,

291
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,588
arrogant at times, stubborn,

292
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,174
occasionally act entitled, and…

293
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,220
Well, I'm a prince,
so I guess I am privileged.

294
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,180
Anyway,

295
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,933
I know how to give to those in need,

296
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,602
and at times show great generosity.

297
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,357
<i>I can accept rejection with grace,</i>

298
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,903
<i>and even wish them happiness.</i>

299
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,324
I can hide others' weaknesses and--

300
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,452
You have a knack for praising yourself.

301
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,374
Praising myself is, after all,
praising Your Majesty.

302
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,793
And this is

303
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,587
all thanks to Your Majesty's
gracious guidance.

304
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,007
It took you long enough.

305
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,926
How silly of you.

306
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,930
<i>Her Majesty is just like any mother.</i>

307
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,058
You're relieved of your confinement.

308
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,396
So I can come pay my morning respects
from now on?

309
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,197
Court Lady Kim.

310
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,617
Tell Officer Seo to bring that girl.

311
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,494
Which girl, Your Majesty?

312
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,413
Court Lady

313
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,039
Hong-si.

314
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,133
How about we tell her she was cast out?

315
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,218
What if she asks
the female officials to find her?

316
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,595
It will complicate things.

317
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,763
I'll go and take her to the palace.

318
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,848
No.

319
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,850
This is urgent, so I'll come with you.

320
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:49,938
Your Highness.

321
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,649
It seems she's not in the annex.

322
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,943
Where did she go?

323
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,946
Dae-chu, could you go
and check at the Hyeminseo?

324
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,864
Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,791
The Young Master won't be home until 8:00.

326
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,169
Are you sure
you can stay here till that late?

327
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,922
It's all right. Everyone's out.

328
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,090
I have something to talk about
with the Young Master.

329
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,509
Hello?

330
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:21,887
This voice…

331
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,103
What are you doing here?

332
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,897
May I ask who you are?

333
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,981
Right.

334
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,526
I'm Dae-il's friend from the academy.

335
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,445
I see.

336
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,365
The Young Master is out at the moment.

337
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,284
Well…

338
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,744
I think he's here to see me.

339
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,372
Why did you come here?

340
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,790
Eun-jo.

341
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,750
He's the Young Master's friend.
Mind your tone.

342
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,795
It's fine.
We're past formalities, in every sense.

343
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,088
What?

344
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,257
You're startling her.

345
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,301
I have some business at the Hyeminseo,

346
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,761
so we talk sometimes.

347
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,263
I see.

348
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,807
So? What is it?

349
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,017
Sir?

350
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,727
Someone's looking for Hong-si.

351
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,604
Who's Hong-si?

352
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,399
Court Lady Hong-si?

353
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,859
Yes, that's why I came all the way here.

354
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,987
That should tell you
who's looking for you.

355
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,951
I'm afraid I must go.

356
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,245
All right.
I'll cook the broody hen another time.

357
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,956
Wait.

358
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,416
Eun-jo, wait here.

359
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,542
You should take these.

360
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,882
Why is Mother looking for me?

361
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,676
How would I know?

362
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,595
And why are you making my mother
cook the broody hen?

363
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,433
Mother insisted.
What was I supposed to do?

364
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,977
Could you please not call her "Mother"
like that?

365
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,440
Why did you leave these beautiful things
in your drawer?

366
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,066
They were stored carefully.

367
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,486
No.

368
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:03,905
Wait.

369
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,282
Is this…

370
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,329
All right.

371
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,707
I did that? I kept them carefully?

372
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,833
Mother…

373
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,751
I mean…

374
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,545
Your daughter must've left them
for a reason.

375
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,005
You didn't need to bring them out.

376
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,256
Pardon?

377
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,424
I'm glad you did.

378
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,176
Give them to me. I'll put them on.

379
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,888
My! Whoever picked out these shoes

380
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,681
has excellent taste.

381
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,516
What about this lotus leaf?

382
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,934
It was next to them.

383
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,567
You even dried this and kept it?

384
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,944
I could tell they were precious to you,
so I kept them.

385
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,159
You can tell, right?

386
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,243
They look

387
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,662
quite precious, even to you, Mother.

388
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,580
No, they're not.

389
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,582
It just came with the silk shoes.

390
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,542
Why are you yelling like that?

391
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,169
Look, you startled my mother.

392
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,295
Apologize now.

393
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:01,922
I apologize.

394
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,882
It's all right.

395
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,425
What's wrong with you?

396
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,512
I'll leave the lotus leaf here.

397
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,264
It seems too precious.

398
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,434
Why don't you go on ahead?

399
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,519
Mother,

400
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,145
can we have a moment?

401
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,066
Did you want to say something to me?

402
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,194
I know we just met

403
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,279
and this could sound baffling,

404
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,951
but I think you should keep some distance
from your daughter for now.

405
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,330
Because she's married now?

406
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,498
What?

407
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,042
Yes, exactly.

408
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,628
Her husband's family won't be happy

409
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,755
to see her visiting you so often.

410
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,216
You're right.

411
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,593
I was being selfish.

412
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,014
I didn't realize it when she was here,

413
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,101
but now that she's gone,
I miss her so badly.

414
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,938
Same here.

415
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:01,898
Pardon?

416
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,609
I mean, that's what
your daughter would think.

417
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,405
Anyway,

418
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,282
I will follow your advice

419
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,909
and try to keep some distance.

420
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,624
It won't be too long.

421
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,168
Just for a bit.

422
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,338
I apologize.

423
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,132
I was reminded of my mother.

424
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,593
I see.

425
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,387
And don't cook the precious broody hen

426
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,181
for your daughter.

427
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,108
Give them back. They're mine.

428
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,069
What's mine is yours,
and what's yours is mine.

429
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,279
It's you and me.

430
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,156
Look here,

431
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,240
what does that mean?

432
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,117
That's just how it is now.

433
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,535
What's mine is yours,

434
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,078
and what's yours is mine.

435
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,166
Ever since our bodies were switched,

436
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,959
I feel like I'm on a scavenger hunt.

437
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,461
One by one, I'm uncovering

438
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,088
the things this body's owner hid.

439
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,926
What's next?

440
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,594
Nothing.

441
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,887
About the silk shoes…

442
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,764
I just didn't want to waste them.

443
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,350
I can totally believe that.

444
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,895
I'm heading to my quarters now.

445
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,939
You can go to the courtyard by yourself.

446
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,407
Lower your head.

447
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,076
- Blast.
- Your Highness.

448
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,747
Chief Secretary Im. It's been a while.

449
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,333
Have you been in good health?

450
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,378
I heard about your father's passing.

451
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,090
I sincerely hope that his body,

452
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,801
long wearied by illness,
has now found rest.

453
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,806
Have you ever met my father,
Your Highness?

454
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,937
I heard that he had been gravely ill.

455
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,856
I appreciate
Your Highness' gracious words.

456
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,611
I heard that you visited
His Majesty's bedchamber last night

457
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,322
and cautioned him against
the overuse of medicine, Your Highness.

458
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,907
Yes, I did.

459
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,951
As the Vice Superintendent
of the Royal Pharmacy,

460
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,953
- I'll question the royal physicians--
- Don't.

461
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,204
It's not that serious.

462
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,999
Why press them
when we could just exchange opinions?

463
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,669
As you command, Your Highness.

464
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,212
Good.

465
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,589
I must get going.

466
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,765
You there, Grand Prince's court lady.
Halt.

467
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,331
His Highness dropped this. Take it.

468
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,834
Give it to me.

469
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,544
How dare she…

470
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,712
You there,

471
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,213
did you not hear us?

472
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,146
Court Lady Kim, go to Her Majesty at once.

473
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,272
She sent for you urgently.

474
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,815
Yes, sir.

475
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,446
Let's go to your residence.

476
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,906
Yes.

477
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,797
The Grand Prince doesn't seem
to know much about the incense.

478
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,216
Chief Secretary Im.

479
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,058
Can you tell me the name
of that herb from the Ming?

480
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,895
May I ask the reason
for Your Highness's inquiry?

481
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,856
It would be useful to know,
for my studies.

482
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,442
I might want to use it later too.

483
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,529
It is the seed of a flower called Gokdu,

484
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,989
a medicinal herb found only in the Ming.

485
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,366
Gokdu?

486
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,285
Thank you.

487
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,593
I heard that Your Majesty had sent for me.

488
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,139
Because I wanted to commend you
for your recent service as well.

489
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,849
That you added "as well"

490
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,394
probably means
there's something more important.

491
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,478
I'm impressed.

492
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,940
You're not only agile,
but also quick-witted.

493
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,775
From now on,

494
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,861
observe the Grand Prince closely.

495
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,780
Observe?

496
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,494
I am indeed the most suitable person

497
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,079
for that task.

498
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,542
And look more discreetly
into matters concerning women.

499
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,920
His Majesty's women.

500
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,506
I will look into that matter closely,
as Your majesty commands.

501
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,135
This recent incident worries me.

502
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,512
I worry he may be roaming the market,

503
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,807
associating with some girl
of no name or standing.

504
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,937
Your Majesty,

505
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,231
regarding you said just now…

506
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,859
such worries should never be voiced

507
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,694
in His Highness' presence.

508
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,863
What?

509
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,452
You're right.

510
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,455
He always tends to do
the opposite of what I say.

511
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,916
If I tell him not to do something,
he'll do it even more.

512
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,630
You sure know the Grand Prince well.

513
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,174
There's one more thing.

514
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,552
Find out which woman
was holding his hand in the yard.

515
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,390
If I told Brother about this,

516
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,601
he would fault me for my rashness.

517
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,647
I beg Your Majesty's help.

518
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,694
I dreaded the idea that we would be
tied to the Chief Secretary's family,

519
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,863
so this is for the best.

520
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,282
I will speak to him of it in due time.

521
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,826
I appreciate it.

522
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,996
Hae-rim, are you certain
about this decision?

523
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,666
Rumors of a broken engagement
are harsh on women.

524
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,709
They will cling to you for a while.

525
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,465
I will bear it.

526
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,016
What's taking him so long?

527
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,437
Your Highness, Hong-si is here.

528
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,856
Let her in now.

529
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,993
What did Her Majesty say?

530
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,580
Later. I'm tired.

531
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,290
You didn't make any mistake, did you?

532
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,125
You have no idea

533
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,711
how tiring it is to get around

534
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,087
in this small body.

535
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,214
It's my body. I know that very well.

536
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,551
Stop being a crybaby and get up.

537
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,895
Did he fall asleep?

538
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,150
He must've been really tired.

539
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,792
Let me

540
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,086
keep this.

541
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:17,870
Stay there.

542
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,832
I didn't know I had such a handsome face.

543
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,083
I'm appreciating it.

544
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,013
At this moment at least,

545
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,890
it doesn't seem all that bad
our souls were switched.

546
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,938
About last night…

547
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,274
I didn't mean it

548
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,652
when I said I would catch you.

549
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,614
No.

550
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,075
I actually wish you meant it.

551
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,663
I did what I did

552
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,582
because

553
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,460
I followed my heart.

554
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,965
I just couldn't stand by and watch
patients who were so malnourished

555
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,969
that even medicine no longer worked.

556
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,056
I know it's hard to understand

557
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,183
why I'm doing this.

558
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,018
Even I don't understand it myself.

559
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,105
"What's wrong with me?
Why am I like this?"

560
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,275
I kept thinking about it,

561
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,402
but I couldn't find the answer.

562
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,613
So I concluded

563
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,532
that this nosiness
is something I was born with.

564
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,367
I concluded that must be it.

565
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,120
Once I no longer needed a reason,

566
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,623
I felt at ease.

567
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,125
It wasn't for anyone else,

568
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,711
but for my own peace of mind.

569
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,880
Selfish, right?

570
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,633
Perhaps,

571
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,302
it's my vanity.

572
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,513
It's your heart.

573
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,016
And your sincerity.

574
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,273
About what you promised the other day…

575
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,025
From now on,

576
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,028
stay within my expectations.

577
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,155
Just stay within

578
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,907
what I can handle.

579
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,368
"But if you go beyond my forbearance

580
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,870
and threaten the foundations of Joseon,

581
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,914
I will arrest you."

582
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,378
That day should never come.

583
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,798
No way.

584
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,384
A petty thief stealing trifles,

585
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,970
could never threaten
the very foundations of Joseon.

586
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,684
Let me promise one thing too.

587
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,146
If I were ever to be caught,

588
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,566
it would be by you.

589
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,331
Your Highness, Officer Seo is here.

590
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,167
Let him in.

591
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,586
The seats.

592
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,267
Should I have read the room
and waited before entering?

593
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,936
Yes. From now on,
count to ten before you enter.

594
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,193
What did Chief Secretary Im mean earlier?

595
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,944
Did you go to His Majesty's bedchamber?

596
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,862
Right.

597
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,031
I forgot to tell you about it

598
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,033
when I met you a couple of days ago.

599
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,500
Do you think the Grand Prince
was sounding you out, Father?

600
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,252
To me, it didn't seem like that.

601
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,254
It didn't to me either.

602
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,465
Then what is bothering you?

603
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,426
Grand Prince Dowol…

604
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,805
That name bothers me.

605
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,807
You made him stop the medicine?

606
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,270
So that's why
the Chief Secretary and Lady Jang

607
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,314
mentioned my name the other day.

608
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,566
His Majesty wasn't upset about it,

609
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,193
so I thought it ended well.

610
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,694
That's my life.

611
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,906
People will find meaning in even
the most meaningless things you say.

612
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,285
Living as a Grand Prince
isn't easy after all.

613
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,038
Simply folding the bedding
can cause an uproar,

614
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,539
and asking for the name of an herb

615
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,625
can lead to the royal physicians
being questioned.

616
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,462
The Grand Prince
can't speak or act freely.

617
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,091
Right.

618
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,719
I forgot that you were now
living as a young widow.

619
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,638
Well,

620
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,100
your in-laws are actually nicer
than I thought.

621
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,434
Really?

622
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,561
That's strange.

623
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,315
I'm living a decent life
as the lady of the annex.

624
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,942
Don't worry about me.

625
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,445
By the way,

626
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,156
His Majesty must've been baffled

627
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,159
to see his brother show such concern.

628
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,248
What's the name
of that medicinal herb again?

629
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,708
They said it's Gokdu.

630
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,255
Is His Majesty getting old?

631
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,216
It seems like his illness
is getting serious.

632
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,518
Are you feeling unwell?

633
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,064
My body has been feeling heavy lately.

634
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,108
I wonder why.

635
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,694
There's been nothing
out of the ordinary lately.

636
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,699
Except that you haven't burned the incense
these past few days.

637
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,786
The incense…

638
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,164
bring it.

639
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,461
His Majesty is showing
strong symptoms of addiction.

640
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,796
If the Grand Prince visited him,

641
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,548
he would not stand by and do nothing.

642
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,760
Ever since the ledger
was handed to His Majesty,

643
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,471
the Grand Prince keeps getting in the way.

644
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,181
Should I have him quietly removed?

645
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,020
If things go wrong…

646
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,859
If things go awry, we will be wiped out.

647
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,114
Pretext.

648
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,533
We need a pretext.

649
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,372
We must scour
the Grand Prince's every move.

650
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,624
Everything, down to the smallest rumors.

651
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,125
Yes, Father.

652
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,211
That was not an order given to you.

653
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,006
This will pressure the Grand Prince.
Keep out of harm's way.

654
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,841
Then, who will do it?

655
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,278
I was posted to State Tribunal
instead of Office of Inspector General.

656
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,532
I heard the Chief Secretary
pulled some strings.

657
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,784
Office of Inspector General?

658
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,955
Was it to scrutinize the corruption
of high officials there?

659
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:16,997
Or did you wish

660
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,417
to seize the nobles of this country

661
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,211
and stand above them?

662
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,506
Perhaps that's what I should have done.

663
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,591
You do not have the right

664
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,427
to do that.

665
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,348
Because I have never given it to you.

666
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,102
Do not waste words on an animal.

667
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,854
State its use.

668
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,570
What do you think it is?

669
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,238
State Tribunal.

670
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,703
The royal court?

671
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,496
Is that it?

672
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,304
Take everything to the State Tribunal.

673
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,305
Yes, sir!

674
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,808
What are you doing?

675
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,897
Tell me what this investigation is about.

676
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,149
Then, I will submit the report
accordingly.

677
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,442
You don't need to know.

678
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,735
It's confidential.

679
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,490
Wrap it up by 4:00.

680
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,574
Yes, sir.

681
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,508
Gil-dong?

682
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,678
Interesting.

683
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,851
What's that procession over there?

684
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,562
Gil-dong has died.

685
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,648
People have been coming
to offer their condolences

686
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,608
for over ten days now.

687
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,949
Place it there.

688
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:20,454
This is real money.
The beggars will take it.

689
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,664
Let them.

690
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:27,711
Gil-dong would've shared
what he'd received with the starving.

691
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,588
A memorial?

692
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,508
It's taking place in the market.
Shouldn't you go?

693
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,010
A memorial?

694
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,223
Gil-dong does not deserve
something like that.

695
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,906
I mean no disrespect to the dead,

696
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,242
but I hope his great name and the rumors

697
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,702
will be buried with him.

698
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:25,769
DEAD

699
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,432
CATCH GIL-DONG

700
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,396
We both serve the State Tribunal,

701
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,274
but you're a secretary,
and I'm an inspector.

702
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,526
It's because your father
is the current Chief Secretary

703
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,029
and mine's the former Director
of the Office of Royal Decree.

704
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,405
That's not what it is.

705
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,532
I placed first in the exam,

706
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,951
and you got that position
through family connection.

707
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,789
Why do we keep going in circles here?

708
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,542
I want to see what the Grand Prince
of this country looks like

709
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,710
before I go and fetch him.

710
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,171
But he's been in his bedchamber for days.

711
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,339
Now I want to see him more.

712
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,174
Go and see him.

713
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,718
You can just do it.

714
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,346
Apparently, a secretary
of the State Tribunal is not permitted

715
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,348
a free audience with the Grand Prince.

716
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,771
He hasn't been going to the constabulary
these last few days?

717
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:54,525
His Highness started reading
<i>Four Books and Five Classics</i> again.

718
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,484
<i>Four…</i>

719
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,613
He has not opened a single book
since he was ten.

720
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,532
Could he be ill?

721
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,785
It's not that he didn't read books,
he just pretended…

722
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,789
I wonder if he only pretended

723
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,499
that he didn't read, which is absurd.

724
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,961
I shall look into his condition.

725
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,435
<i>Does she look like her?</i>

726
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,123
What are you doing here?

727
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:39,004
Her Majesty the Queen Consort
is expected to arrive by noon.

728
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:43,050
Until then, please remain here
and converse among yourselves.

729
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,384
Yes, ma'am.

730
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,809
It's been so long since we last met.

731
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,478
It's lovely to see you all.

732
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,687
Yes.

733
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,648
Right.

734
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,234
Let us offer comfort to Lady Shin.

735
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,444
Her engagement is soon to be broken off.

736
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,822
I told you it was a secret.

737
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:09,368
In times of misfortune,
we must comfort one another.

738
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,869
Oh, dear.

739
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:11,787
What happened?

740
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,372
You must be deeply upset.

741
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,876
I'm fine.

742
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,503
So, tell us.

743
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,463
Why was it broken off?

744
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,631
That's…

745
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,092
If you can't explain yourself
in a situation like this,

746
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,969
all the blame will fall on you.

747
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:29,137
People will say that you had another man,

748
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,056
that you're unattractive

749
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,850
or that your skin was flawed.

750
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:34,851
Am I right?

751
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,693
His Highness, Grand Prince Dowol, arrives!

752
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,701
<i>He's the Grand Prince?</i>

753
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,787
An engagement is a promise,

754
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,581
not a vow that must never be broken.

755
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,166
Just because a promise is broken

756
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,960
does not mean there is wrongdoing.

757
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,630
Pardon me
for interrupting your conversation.

758
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,633
It was too irritating to simply pass by.

759
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,388
It has been a while, Your Highness.

760
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,015
Do you know me?

761
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,643
We met the other day
at Her Majesty's residence.

762
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,644
Well…

763
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,479
I don't remember.

764
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,857
I apologize.

765
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:23,859
Not at all.

766
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,905
Lady Hae-rim of the Shin family?

767
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,824
Yes, Your Highness?

768
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,159
If it would not trouble you,

769
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,244
may I ask for a moment of your time?

770
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,289
Were you addressing me?

771
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,217
That was a classic folk-tale moment.

772
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,387
Prince Charming coming to the rescue
when the heroine is in danger.

773
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,264
Pardon?

774
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,683
So this is how it feels.

775
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:57,851
I think I'm a natural.

776
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,520
Maybe I should rescue more people.

777
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,065
Pardon.

778
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,108
I guess you don't read folk tales much.

779
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,653
No, I love them.

780
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,946
<i>The Tale of Seodong,</i>
<i>Princess Pyeonggang,</i>

781
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,908
<i>The Pheasant, The Tale of Sukhyang,</i>
<i>Yi Chunpung, Kim Sangseo…</i>

782
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,201
<i>The Tale of Kim Sangseo?</i>

783
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,119
That's a really rare book.

784
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,247
When Seolbing parted ways
with the man she was pledged to for life,

785
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,791
I cried my eyes out.

786
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:25,253
When Seolbing was reborn
and returned to his house,

787
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,297
I screamed in joy.

788
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,216
But the true charm of this book is that…

789
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,094
Seolbing leads a war to victory
disguised as a man!

790
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,553
You're an avid reader.

791
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,472
- You really enjoyed the book.
- Yes.

792
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,020
Are you really the Grand Prince?

793
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,530
Apparently, with this face.

794
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,572
Surprising, isn't it?

795
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,913
I didn't know Your Highness
was the Grand Prince.

796
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,748
I apologize.

797
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,791
Don't worry.

798
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,710
I was just passing by.

799
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,004
You seemed to be in trouble,
so I wanted to help you.

800
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,631
Did I overstep?

801
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,216
No.

802
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,802
Your Highness stepped in

803
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,638
at the right moment, to the right degree.

804
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,520
Actually, I wanted to apologize to you.

805
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,816
I stained your name,
though I did not mean to.

806
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,612
Will you not ask what it was?

807
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,073
I'm sure you will tell me

808
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,492
when the right time comes.

809
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,496
I appreciate your understanding.

810
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,957
I will tell you everything in due time.

811
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,501
Let go of me.

812
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,837
I said, let go!

813
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,762
Look who's here.

814
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,430
Blast.

815
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,182
We meet again.

816
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,352
Are you acquainted
with Master Jae-i as well, Your Highness?

817
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,146
Well…

818
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,230
I…

819
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,108
Your Highness?

820
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,990
Now I get why you're here
dressed like that.

821
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,868
It's a misunderstanding.

822
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,870
You're a secretary of junior fourth rank.

823
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,747
How dare you stand before the Grand Prince

824
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,041
and not pay your respects?

825
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,375
Shut your mouth.

826
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,504
If I weren't wearing this face,
you'd be dead now.

827
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,759
What is…

828
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,891
I am Jae-i of the Im family,
a secretary of the State Tribunal.

829
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,559
I pay my respects, Your Highness.

830
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,358
Soon,

831
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,069
we shall meet again.

832
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,494
I must be on my way.

833
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,037
I must keep my family under control.

834
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,164
You, follow me.

835
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:13,922
Stay here.

836
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,465
Don't make it worse.

837
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,142
Your Highness,

838
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,727
is that man next to Hong-si…

839
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,543
You proved yourself useful.

840
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,264
Your Highness,

841
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,226
Hong-si must have arrived
at the Chief Secretary's residence by now.

842
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,103
Things will get more complicated

843
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,605
if I intervene.

844
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,274
It's better that I stay out of it.

845
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:16,943
Stay out of it?

846
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,448
I'm sure Hong-si will understand,
but it'll hurt her feelings.

847
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:23,992
It will.

848
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,120
She will certainly be beaten.

849
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,665
Given that temper of his,
he could do something even worse.

850
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:35,003
They will break all her limbs,
perhaps more.

851
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,385
It seems your feelings have changed.

852
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:43,970
Are you the same man

853
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,140
who chased Hong-si's carriage
on her wedding day?

854
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,770
I did?

855
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,897
Did you forget?

856
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,821
<i>Because of the rain,</i>

857
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,074
<i>in case Hong-si's carriage tipped over,</i>

858
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,410
<i>at every turn of the road</i>
<i>the bridal carriage would pass,</i>

859
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:12,082
<i>you had dry sand, straw</i>
<i>and gravel laid out.</i>

860
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,043
<i>That's no different</i>
<i>from chasing the carriage.</i>

861
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,588
<i>You were deeply concerned</i>

862
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,716
<i>about how upset she would be</i>
<i>if her silk shoes got wet.</i>

863
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,594
Seriously, what is wrong

864
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,429
with your lord?

865
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,306
You were so worried

866
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:32,018
that the bridal carriage
might sway or tip over.

867
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,689
Give me a break.

868
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,067
What am I to do now?

869
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,330
Are you going to Hong-si?

870
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:53,790
Dae-chu,

871
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,583
bring a horse from the Royal Stables.

872
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,673
From here, go in on your own.

873
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,093
I've been wondering something
the whole way.

874
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,096
Why are you so angry, Grandchild?

875
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,472
What?

876
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,641
I hate to say this again,

877
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:15,020
but you're acting
like this woman's husband.

878
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,896
Did you forget? It's to keep my family--

879
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,064
I know.

880
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,109
But it sounds like an excuse to me.

881
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,622
When you look at me,

882
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,291
I see turmoil in your eyes.

883
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,630
What are you trying to do?

884
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,341
I'm trying to say nothing should be done.

885
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,678
This is a warning.

886
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,057
Sir.

887
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,977
The Chief Secretary
orders you to come at once.

888
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,605
Go.

889
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,690
It seems like your father
needs you urgently.

890
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,331
That wretch's gaze towards me
is thick with desire.

891
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,376
Has he been harboring those feelings
all this time?

892
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,754
Whatever it is,

893
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,215
he'd better not try anything with me.

894
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,426
Eun-jo.

895
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,844
Eun-jo.

896
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,598
Your Young Master was waiting for you
for quite some time.

897
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:35,975
Is that so?

898
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:01,709
What is this?

899
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,711
They seem like soldiers
from the State Tribunal.

900
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,089
What's this about? Make way.

901
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,559
We meet again,

902
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,519
Your Highness.

903
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,734
He could have waited a little longer.

904
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,403
He didn't even have a little patience.

905
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,407
I'm so tired.

906
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:41,916
Who are you?

907
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,504
Are you Gil-dong?

908
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,508
<i>As of this moment,</i>

909
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:54,512
Your Highness is under arrest
for freeing the murderer Gil-dong.

910
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:24,918
<i>What's happening?</i>

911
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:40,892
I'm back.

912
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,647
I'm finally back…

913
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,236
<i>Does this mean</i>

914
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,154
Hong Eun-jo is now…

915
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,535
Who are you…

916
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,620
Dae-chu, the sword.

917
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,961
Your Highness!

918
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,430
<i>There has never been such a thing</i>

919
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:04,225
<i>as a royal siding with thieves!</i>

920
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,893
<i>You look like you're about to confess.</i>

921
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:08,771
<i>I should've unmasked him</i>
<i>and checked his face first.</i>

922
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,025
Then, I would've been able to protect you
without all this trouble.

923
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,776
<i>Why are you so twisted?</i>

924
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,278
<i>I was just worried…</i>

925
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,196
<i>Don't make me care</i>

926
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,032
<i>about this damned family.</i>

927
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,576
Hong Eun-jo is a married woman.

928
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,703
<i>It seems you don't quite understand</i>
<i>the situation.</i>

929
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,456
<i>So it must be turned back.</i>

930
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,541
