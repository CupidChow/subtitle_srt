00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:49,864
[Episode 4]

2
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:53,533
Does that guy know?

3
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:56,633
That you're marrying a seventy-year-old man.

4
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:03,333
Wow.

5
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,200
Your expression keeps
getting more interesting.

6
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,233
It'd be even more amusing
if that fellow knew.

7
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:13,767
Hey.

8
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,100
You tell him.

9
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,264
Who do you think

10
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:26,300
I am exactly?

11
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,800
You said I'm the one meddling, right?

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,533
Then,

13
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,967
let's do it properly.

14
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,800
This is

15
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:54,033
the man I love.

16
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:01,067
We'll soon hold our wedding.

17
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:10,467
Oh, he is a royal aide at the Police Bureau.

18
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,700
Still, I don't know his name...

19
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,867
Yeol.

20
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:19,767
That is my name.

21
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,040
If what you're saying is true, I'm not
exactly in the mood for formal introductions.

22
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,800
Then, let's end the introductions here.

23
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:36,900
What brings you all the way
here at this hour?

24
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,967
Would it make sense if I said
it's to oversee the household member?

25
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,967
Hey! Hong Eun Jo!

26
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,112
Did you come with young master?

27
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:52,167
Uh.

28
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:54,333
Young master.

29
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,264
How much did you drink?

30
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:57,900
Jeez.

31
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,567
What's that blood on your face? Are you hurt?

32
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,533
First, get up.

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,152
Has Jae Yi already left?

34
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,433
Huh.

35
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:10,800
My in-law.

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,633
Stop it, stop.

37
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:14,933
Just get up first.

38
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:18,933
Hey, when is Eun Jo coming?

39
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,333
She said she'd come after her duty shift.

40
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,333
Is she late again because she's
tending to another patient?

41
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,667
Ah, probably.

42
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,712
How could Eun Jo miss this joyous occasion?

43
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:29,736
- Right?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:34,167
Including me, there's no one here
who hasn't received help from Eun Jo.

45
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:37,640
- Ah, that's right.
- Exactly.

46
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,367
Alright, alright.

47
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:40,616
Who is Eun Jo?

48
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,833
Oh.

49
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,267
Physician Hong.

50
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,900
- From the Hyeminseo's...
- Hyeminseo?

51
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:52,567
His Highness is probably there too.

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,533
You there.

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,833
The word 'oversee' is

54
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,933
for someone like me, upholding the law,

55
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:08,467
not for a man to use on the woman
he's to marry, don't you think?

56
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,567
Oh, dear.

57
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,333
I wasn't keeping an eye on that woman.

58
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:18,267
I was watching the way
you looked at her, you know?

59
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,267
If that's what you meant, you saw it clearly.

60
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:24,133
Unfortunately, she just made it clear
I shouldn't cross a line with her,

61
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:28,667
which basically says she's never done
anything to deserve discipline,

62
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,133
and likely never will.

63
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:32,433
You should know that.

64
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:36,133
If you're truly her fiancé,
you should know better.

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,467
I keep wondering when you'll
finally throw a punch.

66
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:44,033
You look like you're about to,
so I'm dodging in advance.

67
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,067
I matured a bit early.

68
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,433
I'm past the age for fistfights.

69
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,567
Besides, given my position,
I usually use a sword.

70
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:58,700
For convenience, I might just order poison.

71
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,367
How terrifying.

72
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,567
Should I be scared?

73
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,300
Well, if necessary.

74
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,500
Why do so many men care about a mere eolnyeo?

75
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,733
Your choice of words
has been grating for a while now.

76
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,667
Because it's the truth.

77
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,567
That girl is nothing but
a concubine sold to our family...

78
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,333
I can't take this anymore.

79
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,767
I only showed you courtesy
because you're Eun Jo's man.

80
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,867
What are you doing?

81
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,333
What on earth are you doing?

82
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,100
- Move aside.
- Why are you doing this?

83
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,633
How entertaining.

84
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,633
Please leave now.

85
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:36,433
I appreciated your help until now.

86
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:40,700
I hope we don't meet again after today.

87
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,500
- Eun Jo.
- Hong Eun Jo.

88
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,867
- Where's Eun Jo?
- Eun Jo.

89
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,167
What do you think of that love triangle?

90
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:59,500
Doesn't it feel like we should step aside?

91
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,000
Everyone, take ten steps back together.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,133
One, two, three...

93
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm here too.

94
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,967
I knew you'd be here.

95
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,000
No, no.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,133
Why are you doing this? He's over there.

97
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,136
Wait a moment.

98
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:13,992
Huh?

99
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,800
The royal aide says he'll leave now.

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,333
Yes, I will.

101
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,967
No, you should ask him.

102
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:47,033
Aren't you the closest to him?

103
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,867
Aren't you his trusted aide?

104
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:53,900
Your Highness.

105
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,367
What happened between you and Physician Hong?

106
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:04,767
Your High...

107
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:14,267
I'll apologize on your behalf for earlier.

108
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,900
It seems I didn't interfere,
but rather helped.

109
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,567
Somehow, both are true.

110
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:22,233
Then, you should look happy.

111
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:27,367
You've preserved your last bit of pride,
keeping it hidden from the man you like.

112
00:07:30,888 --> 00:07:35,833
'And so they lived happily ever after.'

113
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:39,233
Even an eolnyeo

114
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:42,033
would want to be remembered that way.

115
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,400
There was no other meaning,
and that was all there was to it.

116
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,167
Go tell him now.

117
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,667
If you must trample even that.

118
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,867
I'll make you pay dearly
for you've done today.

119
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:01,567
Do as you wish.

120
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:17,768
[Hyeminseo]

121
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:31,567
Those two young masters had a showdown
over Eun Jo in between, didn't they?

122
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:32,633
Yes.

123
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:34,567
Who was the young master beside her?

124
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,104
That

125
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:37,333
remains a mystery.

126
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,367
You're here.

127
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:40,900
He carried himself like a nobleman's son.

128
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,967
Didn't Physician Hong say who he was?

129
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:45,033
She kept her lips tightly sealed.

130
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:48,233
Her face looked somber this morning.

131
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,133
How does our royal aide look?

132
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:52,133
He's absent today.

133
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:57,067
By the way, have you heard
any more about Gil Dong?

134
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:59,467
Gil Dong again?

135
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:03,500
Is it because of that rumor, by any chance?

136
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,200
Rumor?

137
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,367
Please be quick.

138
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,267
Have you investigated?

139
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:18,967
The Chief Secretary's eldest son
is importing this from Ming to the palace.

140
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,267
What, seeds?

141
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:24,667
Where do they intend to use this?

142
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,067
Lately, I've been unusually weary.

143
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:40,967
Isn't it just that the weather is getting
milder and you're feeling lazy?

144
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:42,133
Right.

145
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:45,767
Where did Prince Do Wol obtain that document?

146
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,880
He claims he picked it up
while fooling around.

147
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,800
You're not seriously believing that, are you?

148
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,664
Well, as long as my stepmother lives...

149
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:59,833
Perhaps you have amusing old stories
about you brothers to share?

150
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,533
I'm exhausted.

151
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,433
Chief Secretary.

152
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:07,733
It's already settled. Is there anything more?

153
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,200
No, Your Majesty.

154
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,633
It seems my concerns were unnecessary.

155
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:22,100
The position
of the Chief Inspector is vacant.

156
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,533
Whom should we appoint?

157
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,600
Hong Min Jik.

158
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,033
Isn't he your close friend?

159
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,167
His Majesty wants Hong Min Jik now?

160
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,700
I don't understand His Majesty's intentions.

161
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,233
He wants everything.

162
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:46,100
The might of a tyrant
and the accomplishments of a wise ruler.

163
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,067
But if Lord Hong argues, even if it's
frank advice, it will threaten you, Father.

164
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,733
If you cannot do it, Father,
I will make the decision.

165
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:59,133
Lord Hong fell ill in Gyeongo Year
and has been bedridden ever since.

166
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:01,567
He only recovered a year ago, didn't he?

167
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:04,600
Even if he dies today or tomorrow,
no one would suspect...

168
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:08,233
Be careful with your words.

169
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,800
He is my closest friend.

170
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:17,733
Tell His Majesty that I still
cannot move about properly.

171
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:19,667
Is this a refusal?

172
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,267
If I return to the Chief Inspector position,

173
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,133
it's like Gyeongo Year

174
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:27,800
all over again for my family.

175
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,500
I cannot let Eun Jo

176
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,367
endure such hardship again.

177
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:37,033
Why assume the worst?

178
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:39,067
I'm...

179
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:41,667
I'm someone who doesn't easily yield.

180
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,433
What about a teaching
position at the academy?

181
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:53,300
I'll write you a recommendation.

182
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,067
The salary from such a post

183
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:57,992
should suffice to support your family.

184
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:59,600
Well...

185
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,900
You always help me like this.

186
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,860
Thank you,

187
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,467
Pyeongam.

188
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,600
<i>I'm the grateful one.</i>

189
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:21,667
<i>You spared me the shame of losing a friend.</i>

190
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:35,067
Shall I take these away?

191
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:38,300
I heard you have been
tossing and turning at night.

192
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,833
I have long given

193
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:45,333
my night's sleep to my only child.

194
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:51,667
Even you, the Queen,
have a shadow over your face.

195
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,933
My only husband also...

196
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,533
I'll stop there.

197
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,067
I'm glad you are here
in this bleak and lonely palace.

198
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,400
Some time ago,

199
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,867
you must have heard that the Grand Prince
went to Gangnyeongjeon Hall, right?

200
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:13,992
Yes.

201
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:15,200
Jeez.

202
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,900
What on earth was he thinking,
to meet with His Majesty alone?

203
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,267
We don't know the details,

204
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:26,933
but didn't the brothers
unite to catch a corrupt official?

205
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,300
Just think of it that way.

206
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,400
His Majesty is unpredictable, isn't he?

207
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,000
Have you forgotten the Gyeongo Year?

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,100
How could I ever forget

209
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,900
that dreadful incident?

210
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:43,833
Alas.

211
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,067
I shouldn't have brought it up.

212
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48,867
Let's not discuss state affairs here.

213
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,400
By the way,

214
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,533
I'm also seeking a suitable match
for the Grand Prince.

215
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,267
Is that so?

216
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,800
Queen Dowager.

217
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:08,233
Is the Grand Prince inside?

218
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:10,733
Today, I must settle things
about his marriage...

219
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,333
Why is the royal physician...

220
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,700
Is Yeol unwell?

221
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,667
There's nothing serious,
but his mood has been

222
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,267
unsettled these past few days.

223
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:28,328
[Got turned down]

224
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:41,267
Ugh, doesn't the tune feel sorrowful?

225
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:43,067
Play something lively!

226
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,333
Ah, my stomach hurts,
don't you find it funny?

227
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,833
Why should I laugh?

228
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:51,900
Because I'm laughing.

229
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,967
I want to laugh, and yet you can't join in?

230
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,167
Shall I take her?

231
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:59,267
Mark, tempt, then take revenge.

232
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:00,567
What do you think?

233
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,733
Your Highness!

234
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,467
I'm the Grand Prince of this nation.

235
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:06,700
Do you think I can't take her if I want to?

236
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,700
I will show her what absolute power is.

237
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:16,300
It seems she won't be swayed.

238
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,833
My wealth, power, status,

239
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,967
elegance, looks...

240
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:26,233
Usually, just one of those
is enough to sway anyone.

241
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,967
That's simply how she is.

242
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:33,233
She isn't swayed by any of them.

243
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,933
This is the document from the royal physician
detailing His Highness' symptoms.

244
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:39,400
The Queen Dowager has ordered that

245
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,300
this information be shared with physicians
across the nation to determine the illness.

246
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,500
- Stress-induced illness?
- It can't be madness, right?

247
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:49,032
Jeez.

248
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,267
What do you think it is?

249
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,700
Are you asking me?

250
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,433
We need every help we can get right now.

251
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:03,567
Speak freely without hesitation.

252
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,567
Joy, anger, sorrow, fear,
love, hatred, and desire.

253
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,000
[Seven emotions: Human's seven feelings]
Since the seven emotions are disordered,

254
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,567
I suspect it might be depression.

255
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:21,333
Doesn't the Grand Prince's condition
resemble someone heartbroken?

256
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,533
Heartbroken?

257
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,467
Well, maybe.

258
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:36,667
I hope we don't meet again after today.

259
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,400
Yes, I will.

260
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,400
Heartbreak...

261
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:45,933
Could it really be that painful?

262
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,433
What did you say?

263
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,633
Ah, no.

264
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,000
Who would dare reject the Grand Prince?

265
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:58,312
[Daeseongjeon Hall]

266
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:07,167
I believe the court physician
made a wise choice with you.

267
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,033
What good would it do her

268
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,933
to meet and part ways in a casual manner?

269
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,900
Who says it was casual?

270
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,367
Then, are you saying
she'd become a concubine?

271
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:18,433
Before the wedding is even held,

272
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,500
if the Queen Dowager were to find out,
it would be utter chaos...

273
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,367
You're counting your chickens already.

274
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,300
I haven't even begun, let alone made a move.

275
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,333
Exactly.

276
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,433
If it never began, there
should be nothing to forget.

277
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:32,267
It keeps lingering.

278
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:34,696
Her face...

279
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:36,600
Wow.

280
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,233
Your expression keeps
getting more interesting.

281
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,367
To tell the truth, I don't like
that court physician much.

282
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:45,533
She's engaged, yet why did she act
like that before Your Highness that night...

283
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:50,867
Here we go again. Seriously.

284
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,333
What is that?

285
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:58,167
[Pa: To break]
The character 'pa.'

286
00:17:58,167 --> 00:17:59,400
Break?

287
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,552
[Hyeminseo]

288
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,033
Your Excellency.

289
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:14,800
Heading home after work, I assume?

290
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,467
Shall we walk back to the house together?

291
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,133
Were you waiting for me?

292
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,144
Is that not allowed?

293
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,667
Okay, let's go.

294
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,033
What are you thinking about?

295
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:40,433
This scenery feels unfamiliar.

296
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:43,600
Just a year ago, when you were
confined to your sickbed,

297
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
I never imagined walking like this with you.

298
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:52,567
Pyeongam has recommended a position to me.

299
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,967
An academy in Namwon needs a teacher,

300
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:59,167
so I accepted.

301
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
That far?

302
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,933
But, your body might not handle it.

303
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,933
I won't overexert myself.

304
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:14,733
It seems less agonizing
than idly wasting time here.

305
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,333
Then, when do you leave...

306
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:22,367
I must depart within days
to arrive by the start of classes.

307
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:26,400
So, you'll leave before the wedding?

308
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,467
Regrettably.

309
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:33,267
<i>It must have troubled him
enough to bring him all this way here.</i>

310
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:36,733
<i>Perhaps, it is for the best that
he leaves before my wedding.</i>

311
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:41,767
I had wished to see your face
adorned with bridal rouge.

312
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,967
I will conduct the wedding

313
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:50,600
spiritedly and properly.

314
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:02,333
Then, I must prepare
the medicinal herbs for your journey.

315
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,067
No need to rush.

316
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:08,467
To find good herbs,
I need to start searching now.

317
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:11,464
Come inside.

318
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,700
Even an eolnyeo would
want to be remembered that way.

319
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,100
Plotting to break the engagement again?

320
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:29,733
Enough with this nonsense about romance.

321
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:32,833
What's the real reason
you want to cancel the wedding?

322
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:40,500
Where are you going?

323
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,233
To break it off.

324
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:49,233
The Grand Prince mingling with
some court physician?

325
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:51,667
There were no other suspicious movements,

326
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,867
but the young master met the Grand Prince
at Hyeminseo and returned.

327
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:06,567
Now I can finally see you, Father.

328
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:10,267
I had felt neglected since you were
never home when I came by.

329
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,767
Who did you meet on your way back?

330
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,233
What's with that intimate question?

331
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:23,467
I shouldn't be worthy of such attention.

332
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:26,367
Right.

333
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:31,200
Knowing your place is your only virtue.

334
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:36,133
Father.

335
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:40,100
I accidentally overheard
your conversation with Mother.

336
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,700
Am I not Mother's child,

337
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,967
but the offspring of some lowly gisaeng?

338
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,900
How foolish.

339
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,100
Had you pretended ignorance,
you'd be deceiving yourself only.

340
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,600
Why did you raise me as the legal wife's son?

341
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,200
Because you only had one legitimate heir?

342
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:59,100
Don't be disappointed.

343
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,433
I paid dearly to silence your gisaeng mother.

344
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:08,033
Your value isn't meaningless.

345
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:11,533
'The beast I bought was quite expensive.'

346
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:14,167
Are you flaunting?

347
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,733
I secured the top honors
this household longed for,

348
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:26,400
and I will claim the post you desire as well.

349
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,133
I should flaunt something too.

350
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:32,567
Call off my engagement to the Queen's niece.

351
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:34,667
I will not be your breeding stallion.

352
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,267
That is where you'll be useful.

353
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,633
I won't allow such a blemish
to see the light of day.

354
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:43,733
Unlike you or anyone else.

355
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,600
So,

356
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,667
that's why you interfered with my affairs?

357
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:58,367
Judging by how furious you are,

358
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:02,700
it seems I succeeded.

359
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:07,867
Are you hurt?

360
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:09,700
That insolent punk...

361
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,700
What happened?

362
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:23,500
Was it you who told Jae Yi
about the secret document?

363
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,667
No, didn't you say it wasn't time yet?

364
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:38,833
Please prepare these medicinal herbs
carefully for His Excellency.

365
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,967
Yes, of course.

366
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,767
She's smiling again?

367
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:46,800
Huh?

368
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,033
What is it that makes you so...

369
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:52,488
Mister, I'll take a pound
of astragalus root as well.

370
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,200
What are you doing?

371
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,333
I told you I'd make you pay.

372
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,067
Let go! I said let go!

373
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,800
Is this because of that night?

374
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,067
It irritates me.

375
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,133
What does, exactly?

376
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:20,400
An eolnyeo like you
daring to play the sister,

377
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,867
caring for your sick father like Sim Cheong,

378
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:26,100
and dreaming of some
'living happily ever after.'

379
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,233
It all gets under my skin.

380
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:31,733
You'd be better off utterly miserable.

381
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:34,433
Instead of smiling foolishly,

382
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:37,267
you should weep, rage,
and wallow in resentment.

383
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:41,200
Because there's no king in the real world
to save a Sim Cheong like you.

384
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,033
What's your point?

385
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:51,133
Are you telling me to reject
my marriage again?

386
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,867
Marriage, no,

387
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:57,933
it's more accurate to call it a transaction.

388
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,067
That transaction,

389
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:03,467
as you said, it's just the desperate struggle

390
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:07,833
of an eolnyeo trying to survive.

391
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:09,700
So, I can't cancel it now.

392
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:13,567
I appreciate your charity.

393
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,267
What a mess.

394
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
What? What's that look?

395
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,700
I'm asking you.

396
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,467
Something happened, right?

397
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:04,800
You just caught me off guard, that's all.

398
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,500
What brings you here...

399
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:11,200
Did you come here looking for me?

400
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,533
Don't be mistaken.

401
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:16,833
That's what I wanted to say, but yes.

402
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:19,533
I went to the Hyeminseo and heard
you'd gone to the herb market,

403
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:21,633
so I pathetically followed you here.

404
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:40,067
Why did you want to see me?

405
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:41,233
When is the wedding?

406
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,300
Next year? The year after?

407
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,500
<i>Running into each other
like this will do no good.</i>

408
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,700
<i>Let's not leave room for misunderstanding.</i>

409
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,233
In ten days.

410
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,300
Ten days...

411
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,133
Looks like there won't be
any time for teasing, joking,

412
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,967
or getting to know each other.

413
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:57,633
What?

414
00:26:57,633 --> 00:27:01,733
What do you like? Food, scenery,
jewelry, art, music preferences.

415
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:04,500
No, what should I start with?

416
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,633
Well, where's the nearest silk shop?

417
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:07,933
We should stop there first.

418
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:10,367
Wait! Hold on!

419
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:14,033
You're joking, right?

420
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:17,900
Do you think I'd cling to you
disregarding my pride just to joke around?

421
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,100
Am I the only one finding
this situation rather sudden?

422
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,533
Same here.

423
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:25,864
This? It's practically the act of a madman.

424
00:27:25,864 --> 00:27:27,167
Jeez.

425
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:30,967
I wasn't wrong about you
the day we first met.

426
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:33,867
Perhaps, it was the foresight
of a foolish sort.

427
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:35,400
But you seem to have forgotten already.

428
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,533
I...

429
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:38,967
I only have my betrothed.

430
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,967
That punk is...

431
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,633
Why do so many men care about a mere eolnyeo?

432
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,500
He's disgusting.

433
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:53,100
Repulsive.

434
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:56,533
Are you really the same person
as the other day?

435
00:27:56,533 --> 00:28:01,033
Or were you always this reckless?

436
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,800
If I truly acted recklessly,
there'd be no stopping it.

437
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,133
The reason I didn't ask
about your betrothed's family

438
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:07,967
is because I wanted to reserve

439
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:10,067
the force I could wield until the very end.

440
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,767
I endured with the utmost patience,

441
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,633
trying not to be petty,

442
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:16,300
all this just to see if
I could change your heart.

443
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm asking because I truly don't understand.

444
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,300
How many times have you even met me?

445
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,167
How many more times do you need?

446
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,267
For you to understand why I'm doing this.

447
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,833
No, no.

448
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:35,233
I just won't understand.

449
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:36,904
I'm leaving.

450
00:28:36,904 --> 00:28:38,700
Take care.

451
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,800
Why don't you be honest?

452
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,467
You're running away from me right now, right?

453
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,100
Because you're afraid.

454
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:03,700
Afraid?

455
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:05,867
What do you mean?

456
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:07,567
You know what I mean.

457
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,467
I'll say it again.

458
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,667
My betrothed...

459
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:15,567
You don't love him, right?

460
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,267
If you did,

461
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:19,967
that night, you wouldn't have...

462
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:28,067
I considered playing along
with your lame lie,

463
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:31,533
and when you shut me out and pushed me
away, I considered walking away.

464
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:33,267
But, I don't want to anymore.

465
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,267
- So...
- Alright.

466
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:40,267
I'll be honest.

467
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:45,233
You're right. It was that night.

468
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:49,267
That was the night I agreed to
a marriage like most in Joseon,

469
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:52,067
one befitting my status.

470
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:56,133
For me,

471
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:59,367
wealth, success, honor,

472
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:01,300
family, and even myself.

473
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,000
Of all the things the world deems important,

474
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,233
I believed love had

475
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,467
the least to do with me.

476
00:30:10,467 --> 00:30:15,400
But that night, deciding on marriage,
I asked myself for the first time.

477
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:18,167
'What if

478
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:22,133
I've let something important slip away?'

479
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:26,133
That question made me uneasy.

480
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:30,800
I felt unhappy too.

481
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,467
That's when I saw you.

482
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,433
Seeing a man waiting for me
for over four hours,

483
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:47,567
I felt like I'd become the protagonist
in an old folktale.

484
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,300
That's all.

485
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:55,800
Running away from reality

486
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,233
and rushing to you,

487
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,967
blinded by self-pity,

488
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:04,167
spilling my misery

489
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,700
to a strange man on a whim.

490
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:20,700
And now, I don't want to be
trapped in a fairy tale.

491
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,433
You are lying.

492
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,867
Don't follow me.

493
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:43,467
I'm the one who got rejected,
but why are you angry?

494
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:45,367
Just one word is enough.

495
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,933
One word from you saying you'll accept me.

496
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:52,500
<i>Why is he this serious?</i>

497
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,433
I'm different from my father.

498
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:57,667
If it'd been me, on the day
of the Gyeongo Year Purge,

499
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:01,000
I would have killed
even the rats in your house.

500
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:08,267
<i>I don't want to hurt him,
but I have to be harsh.</i>

501
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,400
I've already given my answer.

502
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,433
Since my status is insignificant,
is my refusal also insignificant?

503
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,433
That's not what I meant.

504
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:21,867
Are you twisting my words, or pretending to?

505
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:23,033
I'm not

506
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:25,768
someone who can speak any thought freely,

507
00:32:25,768 --> 00:32:28,867
nor am I able to display any emotion

508
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:31,033
as I please.

509
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,367
Everything I feel or think must be
measured, restrained, and hidden,

510
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:39,400
never to be revealed to anyone.

511
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:41,672
So,

512
00:32:41,672 --> 00:32:44,167
I won't be swayed

513
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:46,433
by passing whims.

514
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,633
That is

515
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:54,367
the gap

516
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,967
between you and me.

517
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:05,000
Whims.

518
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:07,733
You are right.

519
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:11,633
As you said, I grew up without
watching my step or holding back.

520
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:14,967
I admit my rambling was a confession
that didn't consider the others,

521
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:17,733
and a love without respect.

522
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:21,200
I wasn't even curious
about that gap you mentioned.

523
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,500
Because I didn't need to know.

524
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:26,867
I don't want to pretend I understand now.

525
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:28,900
But,

526
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,667
even for someone of my status,

527
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:34,867
it takes dozens, hundreds of rehearsals
before appearing before the woman he loves,

528
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:38,100
each step heavy and hesitant.

529
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:41,067
People usually call that

530
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:43,133
courage, you know.

531
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,767
How cold of you.

532
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,233
I'll be going.

533
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:55,933
<i>♫ That pulled me in ♫</i>

534
00:33:55,933 --> 00:34:03,367
<i>♫ The great sunshine that is you, to me ♫</i>

535
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:07,033
<i>♫ The moment I saw you again ♫</i>

536
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:12,367
<i>♫ My heart calls out to you ♫</i>

537
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:17,933
<i>♫ Once again, we are again ♫</i>

538
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:21,833
<i>♫ You're my everything to me ♫</i>

539
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:25,467
<i>♫ That pulled me in ♫</i>

540
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:32,767
<i>♫ The great sunshine that is you, to me ♫</i>

541
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:36,567
<i>♫ You're my everything to me ♫</i>

542
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:40,300
<i>♫ The moment I saw you again ♫</i>

543
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,967
<i>♫ As if dreaming, together with you ♫</i>

544
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:48,133
<i>♫ Again ♫</i>

545
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,333
A Meom, I'm a bit peckish.

546
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,433
Okay, please stay here.

547
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:57,867
I'll bring some snacks.

548
00:34:57,867 --> 00:34:59,567
Yes.

549
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:02,867
Tsk.

550
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,967
You wretched girl, get out
of this house at once.

551
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:07,967
For me, that's also...

552
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:09,033
Wait.

553
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:13,500
Eun Jo is marrying your grandfather?

554
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,400
What kind of nonsense is that?

555
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,367
What kind of memory is this?

556
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:22,344
Scraping by by selling your lowborn sister,
you drink as if the wine were sweet.

557
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:24,968
Darn it.

558
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,367
A Meom, when is Eun Jo's wedding again?

559
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,733
Ten days from now.

560
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:34,767
And when is Father leaving?

561
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:36,232
In five days.

562
00:35:36,232 --> 00:35:38,200
Jeez, I don't know.

563
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,833
Ugh, whatever.

564
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:42,733
It's none of my concern.

565
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:44,400
I heard you were looking for me.

566
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,467
The engagement to the Queen's niece
will not be called off.

567
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:51,100
Then, since husband and wife are
said to be of one heart and body,

568
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,433
I suppose I should make
my existence known to my wife.

569
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,333
When she learns that I am half a beast,

570
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:03,867
how the tears must pool in
the eyes of this esteemed noble lady.

571
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:08,767
Even an eolnyeo spares
no effort for her father,

572
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:12,667
not even refusing to become
the old man's concubine.

573
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:15,300
Why would you mention her?

574
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,500
Take Eun Jo as an example.

575
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,767
You mean I should keep my mouth shut
and be sold off, just like that girl?

576
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,967
As you say,

577
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:31,333
do you think your pride will be safe if you
refuse to become the breeding stallion?

578
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,100
Eun Jo knows.

579
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,467
Lowly creatures like them were never
meant to possess anything like pride.

580
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:39,167
The Queen's niece, no.

581
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:41,867
You can't reveal yourself to anyone at all.

582
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:45,700
The name I gave you, wealth, and honor.

583
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,233
You can't abandon

584
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,333
a single one.

585
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,952
That is who you are.

586
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,800
Take care on your way.

587
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,900
I heard the waters and scenery are beautiful,
so enjoy them while you can.

588
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:06,300
But, um...

589
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:13,033
Why not stay for Eun Jo's wedding?

590
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:17,767
You are now the head of this household.

591
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:20,333
Take good care of her in my stead.

592
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,167
Why are you pushing this onto me?

593
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,567
You too, now...

594
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:25,833
Oh, for goodness' sake!

595
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,933
Hey!

596
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:28,867
Don't you have anything to say?

597
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,200
You handle your own life.

598
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:39,133
He carries on like that
even on the very day I depart.

599
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:43,067
I apologize in his stead.

600
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:45,667
No, not at all.

601
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:50,533
Please have the innkeeper brew
the medicinal herbs I prepared for you.

602
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:58,500
I'm sorry to leave you
to hold the wedding alone.

603
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:02,120
Don't worry,

604
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,600
just arrive safely.

605
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:25,567
[Royal Investigative Bureau]

606
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:28,200
I heard you've been asking for me?

607
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,600
Are you sure we are alone here now?

608
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,500
I cannot afford to give you much time.

609
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:45,333
Does His Majesty know?

610
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:50,700
About the true nature of the incense
you brought into the royal chamber.

611
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,733
If one smells that incense continuously,

612
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:01,267
their mind becomes clouded.

613
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:04,533
They lose the ability to reason,

614
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:09,067
and finally become a shell
no different from a corpse,

615
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:13,033
a puppet under your control.

616
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:19,867
His Majesty believes it to be a painkiller.

617
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:26,667
Tell me if he shows signs of addiction.

618
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,167
Chief Secretary.

619
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:32,200
Is this the Joseon you want?

620
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,900
You wretch!

621
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,767
Aren't you even afraid of heaven?

622
00:39:57,992 --> 00:39:59,432
Jeez.

623
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,033
Has he really been fishing
like that for days?

624
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,400
Did His Highness once dream
of becoming a fisherman?

625
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,767
Unable to catch a woman,
he decided to catch anything at all...

626
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:09,767
Wouldn't that be roughly his state of mind?

627
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:13,033
If you talk only behind someone's back,
does that make it gossip?

628
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:16,033
Do it without being seen, heard, or a bother.

629
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:18,500
Show some sincerity
when you gossip about others.

630
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,900
This is nagging disguised as gossip.

631
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,600
How long do you intend to go on like this?

632
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,267
I should know that.

633
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,700
If you find out, let me know.

634
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,067
Well, Your Highness.

635
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:32,600
I came because I have something to report.

636
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,767
Rumors about Gil Dong
are circulating in the streets.

637
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,767
About what?

638
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:42,567
They say Gil Dong delivered the document
exposing the Chief Inspector.

639
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:44,367
Isn't that a fact rather than a rumor?

640
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:47,300
That's exactly what puzzles me.

641
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,700
Weren't we the only three who knew this?

642
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,267
There is one more.

643
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:54,000
- Who?
- Who?

644
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,800
Gil Dong.

645
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:02,033
Wasn't he the one who asked us
to conceal the origin of the stolen goods?

646
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:05,667
As the situation escalated,
his ambition may have grown.

647
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:10,133
Or perhaps he intended to use
His Highness from the start.

648
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,067
We need to reverse our approach
to track him down.

649
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:15,700
Reverse?

650
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,608
Trace the secret document.

651
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:21,533
Oh, if we find the owner of the document,
we'll likely spot Gil Dong too.

652
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:23,733
Since it contained details of
the Chief Inspector's corruption,

653
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:24,867
the person who wrote the secret document

654
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:27,967
was likely someone seeking
leverage over the Chief Inspector.

655
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:29,800
You go meet with
the Chief Inspector and probe him.

656
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,533
His hostility toward me
would make him keep his mouth shut.

657
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:43,600
Today's examination is over,
so come back next time.

658
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,267
Hey, kids from Gwangtong Bridge.

659
00:41:45,267 --> 00:41:47,067
Come here.

660
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:49,867
Tomorrow's your wedding, isn't it?

661
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:52,233
Rest up, and rotate the night shifts.

662
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,167
What's wrong with you lately?

663
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:57,400
I'll clean up the rest. You go inside.

664
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,367
When did you last eat?

665
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:19,867
Wow.

666
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:24,433
If you were born as rice weevils,
we'd have famine every year.

667
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:35,567
Oh.

668
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:38,700
I have nothing worthy to offer right now.

669
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,533
Would this be alright?

670
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:57,167
You're giving this to me?

671
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:06,333
This is too much.

672
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:22,067
It's lovely.

673
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,700
I offer this as alms.

674
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,200
Little monk, you're shrewd.

675
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,400
This will cover new
floor stones for the shrine.

676
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:11,067
What about me?

677
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:12,900
A big-donor bracelet.

678
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,000
A humble-offering donor
shouldn't be getting it.

679
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:18,300
Don't kids even answer back these days?

680
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,933
I was in silent meditation.

681
00:44:39,033 --> 00:44:41,033
It rains now of all times.

682
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:53,400
Your Highness, you'll
catch a cold if you keep this up.

683
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,667
It doesn't look like it'll stop
by tomorrow, does it?

684
00:44:57,967 --> 00:45:00,100
It seems likely.

685
00:45:07,528 --> 00:45:09,096
But

686
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:11,500
what are you staring at?

687
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,367
Muddy water.

688
00:45:46,967 --> 00:45:50,167
Rain on the day of the wedding?

689
00:45:51,176 --> 00:45:55,867
Even the heavens are being
utterly miserable, really.

690
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:02,333
It stopped at dawn though.

691
00:46:04,867 --> 00:46:07,167
Do you think it'll rain again?

692
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,833
Darn it.

693
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:13,433
Why? Is something wrong?

694
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:15,433
Why are you so darn pretty?

695
00:46:15,433 --> 00:46:18,233
Even the Queen's appointed match
would feel like a loss.

696
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,700
- What?
- Darn it.

697
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,400
Hey!

698
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,800
If you're this pretty,
what am I supposed to do?

699
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:29,400
A Meom!

700
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,367
Get out here now!

701
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:40,767
Don't even think about calling off
the marriage, let alone mention it.

702
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:42,667
I'm going to live boldly now too.

703
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:45,033
Playing the role of
a powerful family's concubine.

704
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:48,767
With some seventy-year-old
who may die any day?

705
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:50,433
What a fortunate twist of fate.

706
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:53,900
He'll just lie there like that
and die without saying a word.

707
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,800
I won't need to cater to his whims.

708
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,300
Won't even need to assist his movements.

709
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,967
And next?

710
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:02,667
Do you intend to live your life as a widow?

711
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:05,433
Without ever finding true love?

712
00:47:08,467 --> 00:47:09,767
What good is that?

713
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:12,433
Does it bring rice? A house?

714
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:14,300
It only stirs the heart,

715
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,067
turns the insides to turmoil,

716
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:19,200
leaves one anxious all day.

717
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,833
I despise it. I don't want it.

718
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,367
Shut up!

719
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:25,733
His Excellency also...

720
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:27,528
No!

721
00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:29,700
I won't allow it!

722
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,567
Call off this wedding immediately!

723
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,933
You expect our family to get kicked out
of this house and end up on the streets?

724
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:40,400
Then, who bears all the burdens?

725
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,533
You, the one who's sick? The young master?

726
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:50,167
And you expect me

727
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:53,067
to struggle alone in that pit?

728
00:47:53,067 --> 00:47:55,400
Isn't that too cruel?

729
00:48:07,733 --> 00:48:09,767
I'll go off to my marriage in peace.

[Timely Wind, Overflowing Rain]

731
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,733
It's my fault.

732
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:27,900
It's all my fault...

733
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:31,567
I'm sorry.

734
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,067
Eun Jo, I'm sorry.

735
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,488
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

736
00:48:40,488 --> 00:48:42,000
<i>I too am at fault.</i>

737
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,733
Eun Jo.

738
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,100
What brings you here?

739
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:05,767
I apologize for my impropriety
for summoning an unwed maiden as a stranger.

740
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:07,533
Please come inside.

741
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:10,267
You are my fiancé,
so you're not exactly a stranger.

742
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:13,300
Soon you'll be calling me exactly that.

743
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,467
Because we're going to
break off the engagement.

744
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:22,067
What are you talking about?

745
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,000
The reason for breaking the engagement is...

746
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,633
Do you think your pride will be safe if you
refuse to become the breeding stallion?

747
00:49:36,067 --> 00:49:38,333
- The reason is...
- The name I gave you,

748
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:40,933
wealth, and honor.

749
00:49:40,933 --> 00:49:43,272
You can't abandon

750
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,833
a single one.

751
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:47,600
That is who you are.

752
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:55,533
You cowardly punk.

753
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:02,167
If it's about your affection
for that gisaeng No Eul,

754
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,467
it doesn't bother me.

755
00:50:05,233 --> 00:50:09,933
If you keep saying 'it's fine,'
you'll end up in real trouble.

756
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:18,100
You should initiate the annulment
to spare you future consequences.

757
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,600
Wait.

758
00:50:26,567 --> 00:50:28,867
Is it such an urgent decision

759
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:32,633
that you came through the rain for it?

760
00:50:34,867 --> 00:50:37,367
Let's call it thrashing in desperation.

761
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:44,333
Looks like heavy rain's coming.

762
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,200
Let's depart soon.

763
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,933
Yes.

764
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:52,667
What's this?

765
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:54,800
Embroidered shoes.

766
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,333
Ugh.

767
00:50:56,333 --> 00:51:00,367
I said I wouldn't wear
the embroidered shoes in all this mud.

768
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,967
But they're not even mine.

769
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,167
Some young gentleman left it
earlier with the shoes.

770
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,700
He must have worried you'd
wear wet shoes to the wedding.

771
00:51:25,733 --> 00:51:27,600
No way...

00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:46,567
The raindrops

774
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:51,267
seem to wash away some of my sorrow.

775
00:51:51,267 --> 00:51:53,000
Impossible.

776
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,633
It's true.

777
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,467
That can't be.

778
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:54,300
Eun Jo knows.

779
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,400
Lowly creatures like them were never
meant to possess anything like pride.

780
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,500
You stubborn thing!

781
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:23,100
What are you doing?

782
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,933
- What're you...
- Treating you like the beast you are.

783
00:53:27,933 --> 00:53:30,200
It's far too extravagant
for someone like you.

784
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:39,933
Do you really want to be sold off?

785
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,400

- Just liquor.

Eat this.

How did you get here?

803
00:56:01,467 --> 00:56:03,767
How? I was sold, of course.

804

We're the property
of the nobility, aren't we?

805
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:09,367
The master's household was destroyed,
so everything was confiscated

806
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:12,168
and I was sold to this house yesterday.

807
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:14,024
I see.

808
00:56:14,867 --> 00:56:18,900
The Chief Inspector will
soon leave for exile, right?

809
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:23,567
He's no longer with us.

00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:28,567

00:56:28,567 --> 00:56:30,767
I'm totally shocked too.

812
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:34,967
But, what's truly shocking
is the rumor in the street.

813
