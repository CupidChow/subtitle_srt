DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,545
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,966
EPISODE 10

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,177
(soft music)

6
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,387
(exhales shakily)

7
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,016
There seem to be
fragments of sand still in the wound.

8
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,769
Let's clean up the wound first.

9
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,187
(yelps)

10
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,563
It hurts.

11
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,774
Does it hurt anywhere else?

12
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,109
Were you hit in the head or chest
for example?

13
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,070
No.
(cries)

14
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,656
Would you stop crying?

15
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,618
-You're driving me crazy.
-(student 1 sobbing)

16
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,578
STUDENT 1: What if they're all dead?

17
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,748
Bumjae and our teacher are still
under there.

18
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,209
Gosh, this is so annoying.

19
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,629
(sighs)

20
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,887
AREUM: Painful, hard times began…

21
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,642
for both the people
who couldn't make it out,

22
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,520
and the people who made it out.

23
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,939
(students continue crying)

24
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,774
Nurse, could you finish this up for me?

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,778
Nurse Eom.

26
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,656
Do you think the students reached
their guardians?

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,494
Nurse Eom.

28
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,745
Dr. Areum.

29
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,497
What do we do?

30
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,625
Why? What is it now?

31
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,046
(tense music)

32
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,508
REPORTER: Along with the first two victims
of the initial collapse,

33
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,010
two paramedics
and two members of the medical team

34
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,763
are now buried under the rubble.

35
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,391
It is not yet known
whether they are alive or not.

36
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,811
As it is difficult to maneuver
heavy equipment in old concrete

37
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,729
that may collapse at the slightest touch,

38
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,691
-search and rescue has been slowing down.
-(dial tone ringing)

39
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,278
He's not answering.

40
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,531
Why aren't you answering?

41
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,658
(breathes shakily)

42
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,285
DR. JANG DONGHWA

43
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,537
(dial tone rings)

44
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:46,916
Dr. Jang Donghwa.

45
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,127
What's going on out there?

46
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,378
Dr. Jung.

47
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,255
What do we do?

48
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,716
(cries)

49
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,135
(voice breaking)
What are we going to do?

50
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,891
(Insu gasps)

51
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,103
2 MEDICAL STAFF, 2 PARAMEDICS
BURIED IN SECOND COLLAPSE

52
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,771
STATUS OF THEIR SURVIVAL UNCERTAIN

53
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,407
What do you mean it collapsed again?

54
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,994
Then what about Seo Woojin
and Park Euntak?

55
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,538
They say they're still in there,
Master Kim.

56
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,763
EUNJAE: Right-angle clamps, please.

57
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,647
(tense music continues)

58
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,499
-INSU: Master Kim!
-What's the current situation?

59
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,000
Did you speak to anyone at the site?

60
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,377
I can't get a hold of Chief Jang.

61
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,046
I think he's too busy handling
the situation with Disaster Headquarters.

62
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,173
I talked to Dr. Jang just now,

63
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,633
but he just keeps crying.

64
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,592
(door opens)

65
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,178
(pants)

66
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,304
Dr. Yoon Areum.

67
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,931
AREUM: It can't be.

68
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,767
The news is wrong about…

69
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,687
Nurse Euntak and Dr. Woojin.

70
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,272
AREUM: Right?

71
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,109
Master Kim.

72
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,611
Return to your station.

73
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,450
There's no need to be uneasy.
Go back to your station, Dr. Yoon.

74
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,452
(cries)
Master Kim.

75
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,413
SABU: Nothing is official yet,

76
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,456
so don't assume anything.

77
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,875
Don't jump to conclusions
and discourage yourself.

78
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,670
Not until…

79
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,048
I go check it out myself.

80
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,217
Until then,

81
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,680
go back to your stations
and do your jobs, got it?

82
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,808
(exhales shakily)

83
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,894
(Areum cries)

84
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,027
(sighs)

85
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,161
-MINGUK: All right, cut.
-EUNJAE: Cut.

86
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,416
MINGUK: I've taken care of the spleen,
so we'll temporarily close the stomach.

87
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,130
Are you able to take care
of the hemothorax alone, Dr. Cha?

88
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,381
EUNJAE: Yes, of course.

89
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,472
MINGUK: All right, I will be leaving now.

90
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,223
EUNJAE: Thank you for your work.

91
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,144
(tense music)

92
00:05:58,983 --> 00:05:59,942
EUNJAE: Scalpel, please.

93
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,451
MUNJEONG: Hemovac, please.

94
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,329
Nurse Oh.

95
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,458
-MYEONGSIM: What did you say?
-MUNJEONG: Hemovac, please.

96
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,626
MYEONGSIM: Yes, Doctor.

97
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,378
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,630
Something seemed to be going on outside.

99
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:23,966
MUNJEONG: Kelly.

100
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,888
-All right, cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

101
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,820
(sighs)

102
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,332
DEFENDANT

103
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,251
BU YONGJU

104
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,586
Pick up the phone, you bastard.

105
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,047
(phone vibrating)

106
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,802
BU YONGJU

107
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,054
OPERATOR: The person you are calling--

108
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,393
JINMAN: The complaining party
should put up

109
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,978
with the shortage of medical staff

110
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,355
due to useless lawsuits like this.

111
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,239
MINGUK: Master Kim.

112
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,740
Don't say a single word!

113
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,701
I won't listen to you.

114
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,871
You may throw stones
at my decision right now,

115
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,581
but I'll just take them.

116
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,249
I have to go.

117
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,959
My car is waiting outside.

118
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,753
I'm still the Director.

119
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,673
I'll take care of the hospital,

120
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,009
so go, Master Kim.

121
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:49,969
Go…

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,389
and bring the two doctors back.

123
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,559
(hopeful music)

124
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,364
(upbeat music)

125
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,331
VOLUME 10
THE ABUSE OF JUSTICE

126
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,833
EUNTAK (muffled): Dr. Seo.

127
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,543
Dr. Seo!

128
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,129
(clearly)
Dr. Seo, wake up!

129
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,756
Dr. Seo!

130
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,716
Can you hear me, Dr. Seo?

131
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,930
(coughs)

132
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,806
EUNTAK: Are you conscious?

133
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,186
(grunts, yelps)

134
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,022
EUNTAK: Don't move.

135
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,485
(gasps)

136
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,695
Nurse Euntak.

137
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,322
What's wrong with my hand?

138
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,075
Don't move. Don't even flinch.

139
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,368
Wait one moment.

140
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,619
(Woojin grunts)

141
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,414

(pants, groans)

147
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,693
Why are you guys here?

148
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,987
Is there another patient to operate on?

149
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,113
Well…

150
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,325
Try not to freak out.

151
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,955
There was another accident
at the collapse site.

152
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,834
And Dr. Seo Woojin and Nurse Euntak…

153
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,754
(sighs)

154
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,342
…were inside the building.

155
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,220
(dramatic music)

156
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,359
NURSE PARK EUNTAK

157
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,157
OPERATOR: The person you are calling is
unavailable--

158
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,366

159
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,494
(sighs)

160
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,128
MYEONGSIM: Excuse me.

161
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,921
Yes, what kind of patient…

162
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,132
(soft chuckle)

163
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,509
I stopped by because I was worried.

164
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,181
Are you okay, Dr. Yoon?

165
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,850

166
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,018

(Areum crying)

168
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,873
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,710
I know I shouldn't do this in the ER.

170
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,754
No, it's okay.

171
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,257
Doctors are humans too.
They're allowed to cry as well.

172
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,385
It's okay.

173
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,638
It's going to be okay.

174
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,314
WOMAN 1: It collapsed and the kids--

175
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,565
SABU: Excuse me.

176
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,567
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

177
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,652
Let me through, please.

178
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,529
-POLICE: Master Kim?
-Yes, it's me, Master Kim.

179
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,203
SABU: Hey, Mr. Jang!

180
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,830
Master Kim.

181
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,249
What is going on?

182
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,375
GITAE: I'm really sorry.

183
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,087
I couldn't stop
the two of them from going in.

184
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,006
This is all my fault.

185
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,928
(somber music)

186
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,181
Chief Park.

187
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,350
Master Kim.

188
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,686
How is the rescue going?

189
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,897
We've been trying to get in contact
with them since the accident,

190
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,232
but we got no response yet.

191
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,278
So we don't know
whether they're alive or not?

192
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,573
It may take some time
before we can determine that.

193
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,367
Due to the risk of further collapse,

194
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,786
the outer and right walls
are under inspection.

195
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,789
I'm planning to make an entry route
as soon as it's secured.

196
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,334
For now, you should
go back to the hospital and wait.

197
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,883
(somber music continues)

198
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,695
Nurse Euntak.

199
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,114
Dr. Seo Woojin.

200
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,617
Nurse Park Euntak.

201
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,745
Dr. Seo Woojin.

202
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,414
Nurse Park Euntak!

203
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,459
SABU: Dr. Seo Woojin.

204
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,379
Nurse Park Euntak!

205
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,593
(grunts)

206
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,347
SABU (faintly): Dr. Seo Woojin.

207
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,105
SABU (louder): Nurse Park Euntak.

208
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,909
(grunts)

209
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,161
SABU (loudly): You guys are okay, right?

210
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,746
Master Kim.

211
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,623
Come on.

212
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,125
Answer, you guys!

213
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,795
Seo Woojin.

214
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,880
Park Euntak!

215
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,216
(grunts, pants)

216
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,804
Seo Woojin!

217
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,807
Park Euntak!

218
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,936
(sighs)

219
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,607
(solemn music)

220
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,586
Master Kim.

221
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,689
EUNTAK: Master Kim.

222
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,692
(dramatic music stings)

223
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,360
Nurse Euntak? Dr. Seo Woojin?

224
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,738
Dr. Seo--

225
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,573
Who is this?

226
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,283
Is this Nurse Euntak?

227
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,243
Yes, Master Kim. It's Euntak.

228
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,287
Are the other people with you?

229
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,626
How are the other people?
What about Seo Woojin?

230
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,169
SABU: What about the rescuers?

231
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,046
(pants)
Everyone is alive.

232
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,130
(all cheer)

233
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,882
-They're alive!
-Yes!

234
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,175
Thank goodness.

235
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,429
(pants)

236
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,513
But…

237
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,933
there are three injured.

238
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,645
Tell me the situation.

239
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,316
EUNTAK: There's a REBOA patient

240
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,943
and an unconscious male student.

241
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,278
His level of consciousness
doesn't look good.

242
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,030
Vitals are 100/70. Heart rate 110.

243
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,658
The male student has been losing
consciousness

244
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,992
right after the second collapse.

245
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,243
Any signs of trauma?

246
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,416
There are no signs or symptoms of trauma.

247
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,795
The torso is fine too.

248
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,505
Oh.

249
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,216
EUNTAK: There are signs
of acanthosis nigricans in the neck area.

250
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,176
Check the blood sugar level first.

251
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,391
Also, didn't you say
that three people were hurt?

252
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,017
Who's the last person?

253
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,104
It's Dr. Seo Woojin.

254
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,524
(somber music)

255
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,905
EUNTAK: Rebar
in the fallen structure pierced

256
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,657
the back of Dr. Seo's left hand and wrist

257
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,410
while he was trying
to protect the REBOA patient.

258
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,090
(sighs loudly)

259
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,396
Is he conscious?

260
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,233
Dr. Seo is conscious,

261
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,485
but the REBOA patient
is still unconscious.

262
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,487
Put Seo Woojin on the phone.

263
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,617
SABU: Can you respond, Seo Woojin?

264
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,287
Yes, Master Kim.

265
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,289
How is the pain?

266
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,375
I think the nerves were struck.

267
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,170
(grunts)
It hurts a lot.

268
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,089
(somber music continues)

269
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,343
(Sabu sighs)

270
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,766
And the person below you?

271
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,935
(grunts, pants)

272
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,730
He's not conscious yet,

273
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,108
but it looks like the rebar

274
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,152
that pierced my wrist

275
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,196
has pierced the patient's chest.

276
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,576
(sniffles)

277
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,914
Stay where you are for now.

278
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,334
SABU: One wrong move and you might
damage your nerves even more.

279
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,879
Stay as still as you can.
Don't try to do anything.

280
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,639
Wait until I get down there.

281
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,477
No, Master Kim!

282
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,979
What if things become worse
while you're down there?

283
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,106
Chief Park.

284
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,442
-How fast can you open up a path?
-Master Kim!

285
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,027
I understand how you feel,

286
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,404
but it's dangerous for you to go yourself.
I can't allow it.

287
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,989
Weren't you listening?

288
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,411
A rebar that pierced a doctor's wrist
is stuck in a person's chest.

289
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,788
One wrong move

290
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,499
and a surgeon might lose his hand

291
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,001
and a patient might lose his life.

292
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,920
To save them both,

293
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,006
I have no choice but to go down myself
to take care of them.

294
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,009
Still, you can't go down yourself,
Master Kim.

295
00:18:56,093 --> 00:19:00,222
Is the reason why I can't
be more serious than saving their lives?

296
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,642
All right.

297
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,894
Give me an answer.

298
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,939
Are you going to save them or not?

299
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,068
(tense music)

300
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:24,454
GANGWON-DO JEONGSEON-GUN JUNGHA-RO
REDEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE

301
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,754
ALL: Hello, sir.

302
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,260
-He's here.
-Hello.

303
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,096
-AIDE: Hello, sir.
-Where's Assemblywoman Ko Kyungsook?

304
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,182
She's still in the collapsed building.

305
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,184
Have you heard from her?

306
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,228
We haven't heard from her
since it collapsed again not too long ago.

307
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,813
What is the rescue team doing?

308
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,315
That's what I have been asking.

309
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,941
It's this way, sir.

310
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,696
-GUARD 1: Please make way.
-GUARD 2: Out of the way.

311
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,909
POLICE LINE - UNDER INVESTIGATION

312
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,376
(indistinct chatter)

313
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,259
He's the commanding officer.

314
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,557
Hello, sir.

315
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,852
Is Assemblywoman Ko still in there?

316
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,395
Yes, we're still searching right now.

317
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,608
We're currently trying to rescue
the male student, the academy teacher,

318
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,236
and the medical staff
after they were confirmed to be alive.

319
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,571
Don't you know your work priorities?

320
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,744
You should have rescued
Assemblywoman Ko as soon as possible.

321
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,704
What do you people think you're doing?

322
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,456
There are young students

323
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,667
and a teacher
who tried to save the students down there.

324
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,087
CHIEF JANG: The medical staff that ran in
to save them are also down there.

325
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,090
Where is the priority there?

326
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,132
Hey, Chief!

327
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,134
Are you lecturing me?

328
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,469
There are reporters nearby.

329
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,930
CHIEF JANG: They'll hear you
if you speak too loud.

330
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,351
(sighs)

331
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,770
Thank you for your hard work.

332
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:15,065
Well, report the situation.

333
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,900
Wait, sir.

334
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:17,818
AIDE: Sir!

335
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,528
CONGRESSMAN: Thank you for your hard work.

336
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,154
Keep up the good work.

337
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,782
RESCUE AND CONTROL TEAM
ON-SITE COMMAND POST

338
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,037
Shouldn't rescuing come first
instead of reporting in these situations?

339
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,540
PARAMEDIC 1: He should stay behind a desk
if he wants a report.

340
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,501
PARAMEDIC 2: Why the heck is he coming
to the site and asking for a report?

341
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,629
PARAMEDIC 1: It's not like we have time
on our hands. This is an abuse of power.

342
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,466
PARAMEDIC 3: Are you okay?

343
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,803
-Please help me with this.
-PARAMEDIC 4: Okay.

344
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,764
One, two…
(grunts)

345
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,315
(clanging)

346
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,526
Paramedic Heo.

347
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,902
Master Kim.

348
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,779
Did you check the blood sugar level?

349
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,032
It was at 60 earlier,
but I'll check again.

350
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,408
Master Kim.

351
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,660
Is that you, Nurse Euntak?

352
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,040
There, there.

353
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,542
-(pants, cries)
-SABU: All right.

354
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,379
How are your injuries?

355
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,549
I'm fine, but Dr. Woojin is really hurt.

356
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,426
Where is he?

357
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,680
(grunts)

358
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,311
Woojin.

359
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,897
(pants)
Master Kim.

360
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,523
Yes.

361
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,608
WOOJIN: This patient…

362
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,986
It's been an hour since the REBOA.

363
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,446
(Woojin grunts)

364
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,867
It was a partial REBOA,

365
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,204
but we can't delay any longer.

366
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,914
(Woojin pants)

367
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,874
(grunts, pants)

368
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,209
(grunts)

369
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,879
As of now, there's only one option.

370
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,134
We have to pull

371
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,720
the rebar out of your wrist.

372
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,519
What if something happens
to Dr. Seo's nerves?

373
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,024
Please take it out.

374
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,318
Dr. Seo.

375
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,737
He could die

376
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,989
if we delay any longer.

377
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,908
Then all of this…

378
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,746
would become meaningless.

379
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,706
(Woojin breathes heavily)

380
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,257
Please take it out, Master Kim.

381
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,721
(yelps)

382
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,723
Darn it.

383
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,184
(Donghwa groans)

384
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,394
PARAMEDIC 5: Are you okay?

385
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,981
Hey, Jang Donghwa.
Why did you come down here?

386
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,316
(Donghwa pants)

387
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,068
To see if I could help…

388
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,196
(grunts, pants)

389
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,449
SABU: Hey.

390
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,826
If you're going to stand there
with that look, go back up.

391
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:14,619
I don't want to.

392
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,537
Go back up!

393
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,913
No, I will not go back up.

394
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,206
You little--

395
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,209
PARAMEDIC 6: This student's blood sugar
level is too low, Master Kim!

396
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,546
He's in hypoglycemic shock.

397
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,797
SABU: Jang Donghwa,

398
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,342
hurry up and grab an IV with 50 DW.
You can do that, right?

399
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,886
-Yes, Master Kim.
-Hurry up and go!

400
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,767
Master Kim.

401
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,228
(Woojin pants)

402
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,774
Woojin.

403
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,653
It will be unbearably painful.

404
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,574
I understand.

405
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,371
When this rebar is cut,

406
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,418
the vibration can cause more damage
to the already damaged nerves.

407
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,755
Yes.

408
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,925
In the worst-case scenario…

409
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,889
the nerves could be completely severed.

410
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,685
I understand.

411
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,023
(dramatic music)

412
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,153
-SABU: Paramedic Heo.
-MR. HEO: Yes, Master Kim.

413
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,821
Prepare cutters, please.

414
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,532
Yes, Master Kim. Cutters!

415
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,701
Nurse Euntak.

416
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,247
Give Dr. Seo Woojin 50 mg of tramadol.

417
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,040
Prepare a tourniquet too.

418
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,458
Yes, Master Kim.

419
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,884
-Tourniquet.
-Here you go.

420
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,471
-Paramedic Heo!
-Yes, Master Kim.

421
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,265
Remove the patient underneath

422
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,350
as soon as the rebar is cut.

423
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,520
Be careful not to dislodge
the rebar in the chest as well.

424
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,648
If it dislodges,
it'll lead to massive bleeding

425
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,817
and the patient will die immediately.

426
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,818
Yes, Master Kim.

427
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,404
Nurse Euntak.

428
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,364
SABU: As soon as the rebar is cut,

429
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,283
help them transport the patient.

430
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,035
We'll need to operate
as soon as he arrives at the hospital,

431
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,331
so let Dr. Nam, Director Park, and Eunjae
know about the patient's condition.

432
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,291
Yes, Master Kim.

433
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,001
The cutters are ready.

434
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,503
Where should I cut the rebar?

435
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,260
(pants)

436
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,595
(grunts)

437
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,685
(pants)

438
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,229
-Please hold this up.
-Yes, Doctor.

439
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,027
(Woojin pants)

440
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,536
No, please don't do this.

441
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,413
All right.

442
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,457
It's all ready.

443
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,131
No.

444
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,591
Cut it.

445
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,135
-(cutter buzzes)
-(groans)

446
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,350
(grunts, gasps)

447
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,354
Cut it!

448
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,773
-(cutter buzzes)
-(screams)

449
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,319
(Woojin grunts)

450
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,528
(gasps)

451
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,823
(groans, pants)

452
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,827
(yells, gasps)

453
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,121
(Woojin shouts in pain)

454
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:50,669
(gasps in pain, cries)

455
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,879
It's okay, Woojin.

456
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,590
It's all over!

457
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,717
-You did well.
-(Woojin continues crying)

458
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,428
(cries)

459
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,182
(Woojin crying)

460
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,905
(grunts)

461
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,957
-(Woojin cries)
-SABU: It's over.

462
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,875
You did well.

463
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,795
(gasps in pain)

464
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,380
Let's move the patient!

465
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,298
PARAMEDIC 7: Yes, Doctor.

466
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,050
Carefully.

467
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,768
(Woojin continues gasping)

468
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,736
REPORTER: There is an update
on the collapse

469
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,195
of a public building in Jeongseon.

470
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,613
We have just received word

471
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,242
that the academy teacher
and the male student who were trapped

472
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,369
in the basement
due to the second collapse,

473
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,247
as well as the two medical staff
and paramedics who went in to save them,

474
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,208
were all rescued.

475
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,252
REPORTER: Please allow me to repeat this.

476
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,795
We have just received word

477
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,965
that the academy teacher
and the male student who were trapped

478
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,217
in the basement
due to the second collapse,

479
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,095
as well as the two medics
and paramedics who went in to save them,

480
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,973
were all rescued.

481
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,157
MYEONGSIM: Dr. Cha.

482
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,785
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

483
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,790
They say Dr. Seo and Nurse Euntak
are both safe and have been rescued.

484
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,043
Really? They're safe?

485
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,961
(Eunjae exhales)

486
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,130
They're safe?

487
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,425
They're on their way
from the site of the accident.

488
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,593
(exhales loudly)

489
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,346
This is what they
call a "close call," right?

490
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,766
It really felt
like my life was fading away.

491
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,477
Same here. I was really afraid this time.

492
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,062
YEONGMI: Oh, what a relief.

493
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,939
But…

494
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,192
I think Dr. Seo is a little hurt.

495
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:21,861
Hurt?

496
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:27,283
Seo Woojin is hurt? Where…

497
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,410
MINGUK: Nurse Oh! You got the call, right?

498
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,081
A hemoperitoneum patient with a rebar
in his chest is coming in right now.

499
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,917
There are suspected spleen
and liver damage,

500
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,544
and REBOA was used to stop the bleeding,

501
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,256
but a penetration wound in the chest
may cause massive bleeding.

502
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,467
(sighs)
Have you ever removed a foreign body--

503
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,344
Yes, I have.

504
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,887
Can you do another combined surgery?

505
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,014
Yes, I can. But I…

506
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,434
I heard Dr. Seo Woojin had an injury.

507
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,729
He hurt his hand.

508
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,524
(tense music)

509
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,317
What?

510
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,821
Master Kim is also on his way.

511
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,116
Master Kim said
he'll be arriving in five minutes

512
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,951
and he'll be operating on Dr. Seo himself.

513
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,584
He's asked us to prepare an OR at Doldam
and for you to join the operation.

514
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,795
Yes, I heard. May I go now?

515
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,213
Yes, go.

516
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,133
Don't worry too much.

517
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,218
I'll be back, Dr. Cha.

518
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,181
All right.

519
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,225
(sirens wailing in the distance)

520
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,518
(exhales shakily)

521
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,314
(sirens wailing)

522
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,818
-(door opens)
-PARAMEDIC 8: We have a patient!

523
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,529
(intense music)

524
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,949
(Woojin grunting)

525
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,495
(grunts, pants)

526
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,043
To the hybrid OR, quickly!

527
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,419
(grunts)

528
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,963
Dr. Yoon, there's another patient as well.

529
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,256
Yes, Doctor.

530
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,050
Carefully.

531
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,136
MUNJEONG: Let's move the patient.

532
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,347
-One, two, three! Careful!
-(groans)

533
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,848
-(pants)
-MUNJEONG: One, two, three!

534
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:14,933
All right, carefully.

535
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,771
(pants)

536
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,567
Did you take out the rebar?

537
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,528
It was stuck in the chest
of another patient, so I had no choice.

538
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,572
SABU: Doil,

539
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,116
there was a lot of bleeding
when we took it out.

540
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,744
I understand.
I'll hang up some blood first.

541
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,245
Bring the packed RBC!

542
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,499
Get a CT and X-ray and run OP labs.

543
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,167
Doil,

544
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,462
I'm just going to go change,
so set up an OR for me.

545
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,381
Don't worry. I'll have one prepared.

546
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,216
Nurse Eom, let's run the labs.

547
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,384
Yes, Nurse Oh.

548
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,762
(pants)

549
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,598
Dr. Seo.

550
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,725
(pants)

551
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,814
(grunts, gasps in pain)

552
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,816
Take him to Bed Four.

553
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,575
Let's move the patient.

554
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,827
One, two, three!

555
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,665
He's a hypoglycemic patient.

556
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,834
He regained some consciousness
after getting glucose.

557
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,298
What about Nurse Euntak?

558
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,842
He went to the Trauma Center.

559
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,677
Nurse Euntak got hurt too? Where?

560
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,429
He's okay.

561
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,806
He went over there
because of another patient.

562
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,517
(exhales in relief)

563
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,448
Oh, Dr. Yoon, the patient
is becoming conscious.

564
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,575
Sir?

565
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,202
-AREUM: Sir, are you conscious?
-(sirens wailing in the distance)

566
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,245
(weakly) Mom…

567
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,831
PARAMEDIC 9: We have a patient!

568
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,876
This way!

569
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,965
Take the patient to Trauma Bay!

570
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,301
This way, quickly!

571
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,595
Darn it.

572
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,722
Nurse Euntak!

573
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,099
Are you okay?

574
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,435
I'm okay. I'll go get ready.

575
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:23,770
EUNJAE: It's fine.

576
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,688
Leave this to us.
You should get some rest.

577
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,566
I'm staying by the patient's side
until the surgery is over.

578
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,610
That patient…

579
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,280
is the patient Dr. Seo
protected until the very end.

580
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,366
(tense music)

581
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,840
Darn it.

582
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,347
(Insu sighs)

583
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,183
There's massive bleeding
and a lot of fluid.

584
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,143
(Insu groans)

585
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,855
The chest area is
in better condition than expected.

586
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,525
It seems like the rebar
is preventing the bleeding.

587
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,819
Vitals are 95/40. Heart rate 130.

588
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:13,903
I'm taking the scan now.

589
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,239
(machine clicks, beeps)

590
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,698
(in English)
Okay.

591
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,035
(in Korean)
That's the REBOA, right?

592
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,122
We're going to open the stomach
and use gauze for damage control.

593
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,540
Then remove the rebar in the OR.

594
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,707
I'll go prepare.

595
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,875
Should we remove the REBOA?

596
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,336
Let's remove it after checking
the patient's condition in the ICU.

597
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,088
Dr. Jung, take care of
sedating the patient.

598
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,339
Yes, Dr. Park. C-line, please.

599
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,423
Yes, Doctor.

600
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,885
Dr. Lee Seonung, tell an anesthesiologist
to prepare Operating Room One.

601
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,013
If there's a lot of damage,
we'll do a lung lobectomy too.

602
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,181
Yes, Doctor!

603
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,641
Dr. Cha.

604
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,602
Do you mind if the punctured lung surgery
is postponed to the second half?

605
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,358
(sighs)

606
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,450
(soft music)

607
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,773
(inaudible)

608
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,823
You would have done the same, Master Kim.

609
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,618
What if you had gotten hurt?

610
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,246
Then you could fix me up, Master Kim.

611
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,376
(cries)

612
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,434
CHIEF OF SURGERY
MASTER KIM

613
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,147
(door opens)

614
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,857
Master Kim, are you okay?

615
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,068
Yes, I'm okay.

616
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,363
I just needed to catch my breath.

617
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,156
What about Seo Woojin?

618
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,200
Are we ready to operate?

619
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,414
-One moment, please.
-No, it's fine.

620
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,832
Just one moment.

621
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,961
(beeps)

622
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,839
Look at this. It says 37.8°C.

623
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,009
You should be careful
with a fever this high.

624
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,386
Don't worry about it.

625
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,221
It's temporary.

626
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,640
You know that stress
and high fever are detrimental to MS.

627
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,227
You even passed out due to a high fever
last year because you overdid it.

628
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,022
The more it happens,
the more the damage will accumulate.

629
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,109
Seo Woojin hurt his hand.

630
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,485
I know.

631
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:04,115
In this situation,
I can't worry about the damage I'll take.

632
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,950
I don't have the mental capacity to.

633
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,994
-But Master Kim--
-I must

634
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,246
perform this surgery, Dr. Bae.

635
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,541
I'm going to fix him for sure

636
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,087
even if it costs my own wrist.

637
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,681
(cries)

638
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,766
(somber music)

639
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,004
INSU: The patient has been sedated.

640
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,089
MINGUK: There will be a lot of blood,

641
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,299
so prepare a lot of gauze.

642
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,258
Scalpel.

643
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,053
(suspenseful music)

644
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,473
MINGUK: Mayo scissors.

645
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,773
SABU: I don't see any fractures
on the X-ray,

646
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,193
but looking at the location of the rebar,
I suspect ulnar nerve

647
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,320
and arterial damage.

648
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:28,491
I also suspect digital nerve
and digital arterial damage

649
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,950
in the back of the hand.

650
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,369
MUNJEONG: From my initial check,

651
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,454
the fourth and fifth are starting
to lose sensation.

652
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,957
SABU: Let's quickly open up
and connect them.

653
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,543
-The tourniquet pressure is at 200, right?
-NURSE 1: Yes, Doctor.

654
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,879
SABU: I'm going to operate
without removing the tourniquet.

655
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,839
Can I start, Doil?

656
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,133
DOIL: Yes, you may start.

657
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,760
SABU (in English): Okay.

658
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,179
(in Korean)
I'll remove the rebar now.

659
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,268
(thrilling music)

660
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,278
(Sabu exhales)

661
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,207
SABU: Scalpel.

662
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,467
Gillies forceps.

663
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:29,885
Mosquito forceps.

664
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,722
MUNJEONG: Senn retractor, please.

665
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,644
SABU: Self retractor.

666
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,781
(machines beeping)

667
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,999
MINGUK: More gauze.
Pack it in to stop the bleeding.

668
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,000
HOJUN: Yes, Doctor.

669
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,795
INSU: I think the bleeding stopped.

670
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,630
The vitals are no longer dropping.

671
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,090
MINGUK: Where is Dr. Cha Eunjae?

672
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,926
HOJUN: Nurse Joo,
please get Dr. Cha Eunjae!

673
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,388
I'm here.

674
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,560
I'll get ready in the OR.

675
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,857
MINGUK: Ioban, please.

676
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,996
We move to the OR
as soon as we're done packing the gauze.

677
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,331
HOJUN: Yes, Doctor.

678
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,755
MUNJEONG: Do you see it?

679
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,964
SABU: Vessel clamp.

680
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,967
MUNJEONG: Senn retractor, please.

681
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,055
SABU: Another clamp.

682
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,473
Metz.

683
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,602
I'll cut off the torn artery.

684
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,522
(suspenseful music)

685
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,028
(Sabu grunts)

686
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,750
EUNJAE: After we check the punctured lung,

687
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:28,003
I'll decide on the scope of the surgery
and how to remove the foreign body.

688
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,338
SEONUNG: I understand, Doctor.

689
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,340
EUNJAE: Scalpel.

690
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,142
-SABU: Suction.
-MUNJEONG: Suction.

691
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,229
(Sabu sighs)

692
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:49,108
SABU: Thankfully,
it's not completely destroyed.

693
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,235
Give me the 8-0 Nylon.

694
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,320
(tense music)

695
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,875
(Sabu grunts)

696
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,262
MUNJEONG: It must have hurt a lot.

697
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,725
SABU: I'm going to work on the artery now.
Suture, please.

698
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,899
(tense music)

699
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:37,823
(Myeongsim gasps)

700
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,705
(Sabu grunts)

701
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,336
DOIL: Master Kim,
do you need to take a break?

702
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,421
We've already connected the nerves.

703
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,922
(Sabu breathes shakily)

704
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,758
MUNJEONG:
Should I call another CT surgeon?

705
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,594
MYEONGSIM: Dr. Cha and Dr. Ung are
in a trauma operation right now.

706
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,222
Administrator Cha Jinman is still
at his trial.

707
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,933
(Sabu breathes shakily, grunts)

708
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,745
(Sabu breathes shakily)

709
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,875
(Sabu grunts)

710
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,052
(tense music continues)

711
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,730
(Myeongsim gasps)

712
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,322
(Myeongsim exhales, sniffles)

713
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,828
SABU: Nurse Oh, I'll continue.

714
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,287
Suture, please.

715
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,086
-(hopeful music)
-(Sabu grunts)

716
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,888
(Sabu grunts, pants)

717
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,868
MUNJEONG: At that moment,
it was like Master Kim

718
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,911
was superhuman.

719
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,416
MUNJEONG: Thankfully, the damage
in the hand isn't too bad.

720
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,460
(Doil sighs)

721
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,795
DOIL: It seems the heavens helped us.

722
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,547
SABU: Give me the 9-0 Nylon, please.

723
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,306
SABU: Tourniquet off.

724
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,477
MUNJEONG: At the end,

725
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,729
there was another crisis, but…

726
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,441
MUNJEONG: What's going on?

727
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,652
Blood isn't flowing
through the nerve artery.

728
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,570
DOIL: What happened?

729
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,405
But the surgery was successful.

730
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,073
Why isn't the blood flowing?

731
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,242
MUNJEONG: He doesn't seem to have
a blood clot.

732
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,538
SABU: Forceps, please.

733
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,831
(forceps clanking)

734
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,502
(suspenseful music)

735
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,012
(Sabu sighs)

736
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,029
SABU (in English): Okay.

737
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,573
-(Sabu exhales)
-(Doil exhales loudly)

738
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,159
(Myeongsim exhales)

739
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,164
MUNJEONG:
What happened just now though?

740
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,583
Did we keep the tourniquet on
for too long?

741
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,419
SABU: When you get seriously injured,

742
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:23,465
sometimes part of the blood vessel
contracts and flattens.

743
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,218
Nurse Oh, hemovac, please.
I'm going to finish up now.

744
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,019
(Sabu grunts)

745
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,361
SABU: Suture, please.

746
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,994
MUNJEONG: Perhaps, at that moment,

747
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,914
Master Kim was putting
all his strength and luck

748
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,500
into the operation.

749
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,793
-SABU: Cut.
-MUNJEONG: Cut.

750
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,799
(Myeongsim exhales deeply)

751
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,468
(scissors snipping)

752
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,059
EUNJAE (in English): Okay.

753
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,020
(in Korean)
At least it didn't touch the hilum.

754
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,980
Let's remove the foreign body now.

755
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,648
Dr. Lee, do you want to do it?

756
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,735
Careful not to move the rebar
while doing the wedge resection.

757
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,111
You've got this, right?

758
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,155
SEONUNG: Yes, I'll give it a try.

759
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,364
EUNJAE: "I will get it done."

760
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,575
Only then can the patient live.

761
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,702
SEONUNG: Yes, Doctor.

762
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,704
Linear cutter, please.

763
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:36,830
EUNJAE (in English): Okay.

764
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,416
(hopeful music)

765
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,340
SEONUNG: I'm sorry.

766
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,674
EUNJAE: It's okay. Keep going.

767
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,022
SEONUNG: Scissors, please.

768
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:11,990
EUNJAE: Calmly.

769
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,499
You did well.

770
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,963
We'll be changing gloves.

771
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,725
Forceps, please.

772
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:40,978
Another one.

773
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,442
Mixter forceps.

774
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:53,865
Tie.

775
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,004
EUNJAE: I'll save him, Seo Woojin.

776
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,172
I will save…

777
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,259
this person

778
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,344
no matter what.

779
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:17,681
EUNJAE: Cut.

780
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,809
(approaching steps)

781
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:32,779
(Kyungsook grunts, coughs)

782
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,323
(weakly) Please help me.

783
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,868
-(grunts)
-PARAMEDIC 10: There's someone here!

784
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,327
-(groans)
-PARAMEDIC 10: A survivor!

785
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,874
-(rattling)
-(groans, coughs)

786
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,003
JINMAN: Thank you for your hard work.

787
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,714
Goodbye.

788
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,262
(phone vibrates)

789
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,309
8 UNREAD MESSAGES

790
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,649
Good job, Dr. Lee.

791
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,026
I learned a lot thanks to you.

792
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:14,946
DAD

793
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,075
(phone vibrates)

794
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,166
Hello?

795
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,418
Seo Woojin got hurt?

796
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:29,920
EUNJAE: Yes.

797
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,630
Where? How bad is it?

798
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,215
I don't know yet.

799
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,259
I just finished operating
on a different patient.

800
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,513
Where are you, Dad?

801
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,349
The trial just ended.
I'm on the way back now.

802
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,810
Was the trial that important?

803
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,520
JINMAN: What do you mean?

804
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,314
There was a disaster.
There was even a code orange.

805
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:51,733
As a doctor,

806
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:55,779
you should drop everything
and come back to the hospital.

807
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,740
The assemblywoman is determined
to denounce and attack us.

808
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,076
Should I sit around and let it happen?

809
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,662
Despite all of that,

810
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,623
I should have dropped everything
and gone back, like a saint?

811
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:09,209
Why on earth did you come
to the Trauma Center, Dad?

812
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,754
What do you want to do here?

813
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,008
(exhales shakily)

814
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,764
(sighs)

815
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,816
I have to fight

816
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,444
everything that tries to treat us rashly.

817
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,035
Master Kim.

818
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,745
Hey, Eunjae.

819
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:51,293
The surgery went well.

820
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,421
We'll have to wait and see

821
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,339
if the nerves recover or not.

822
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:00,135
Don't worry too much about it though.
Let's wait and see, okay?

823
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,559
Master Kim.

824
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,060
Yes?

825
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,190
Thank you.

826
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,401
(chuckles softly)

827
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,536
All right, go on in.

828
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,747
Okay.

829
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,833
(soft music)

830
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,171
(sighs)

831
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,107
(Eunjae cries)

832
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,697
(sniffles)

833
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,336
(exhales, sniffles)

834
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:17,879
(Eunjae exhales)

835
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,215
(Eunjae sniffles)

836
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,260
You're awake.

837
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,224
It's Cha Eunjae.

838
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:31,977
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

839
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,814
Yes, a little.

840
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,820
(cries)

841
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,537
Don't cry.

842
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,334
The patient is alive too.

843
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,045
The one you protected.

844
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,339
You successfully removed the rebar

845
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,050
in the chest, right?

846
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,177
Of course.

847
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,015
Dr. Cha Eunjae.

848
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,976
You did a great job.

849
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,352
(sniffles)

850
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,440
You're going to be okay too.

851
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,691
You know that, right?

852
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,402
Yes.

853
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:25,989
(sniffles)

854
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,373
(sniffles)

855
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,505
EUNJAE: By the way, Seo Woojin.

856
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,758
I'm curious about something.

857
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:46,801
WOOJIN: What is it?

858
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,182
EUNJAE: Why did you go so far?

859
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,476
YEONGMI: Excuse me.

860
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,771
Who are you looking for?

861
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,022
Well,

862
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,232
I'm looking for my teacher.

863
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,195
I heard he got surgery over here.

864
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,870
No visitors are allowed right now,

865
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,247
but I'll let you see him
from here for a bit.

866
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,961
(Soyoung sniffles)

867
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,299
EUNJAE: You even injured your hand.

868
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,135
Was he worth doing that for?

869
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:33,807
WOOJIN: Yes.

870
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,267
He's a teacher.

871
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,980
WOMAN 2: My gosh! Are you okay?

872
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,357
WOOJIN: I still think about it.

873
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,943
What would it be like

874
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,531
if you or I…

875
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,659
SABU: Let me take a look at you.

876
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,661
WOOJIN: …hadn't met Master Kim that time.

877
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,792
EUNJAE: I would still be throwing up

878
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,460
or passing out in the OR.

879
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:07,382
I might have even given up
on being a doctor.

880
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,343
WOOJIN: I feel the same way.

881
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,012
My life

882
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,974
would have come crashing down endlessly

883
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,436
if Master Kim

884
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,147
hadn't caught me that time.

885
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,359
Kid, you should go up now. It's your turn.

886
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,862
WOOJIN: I could tell that the teacher

887
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,989
meant the same for that child.

888
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,992
I said I would go up with my teacher.

889
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,913
I swore at him!

890
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,377
(soft music continues)

891
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,384
Sir.

892
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,305
WOOJIN: Teachers are like that.

893
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,640
They are people…

894
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,853
who can profoundly change someone's life.

895
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,004
(coins clink)

896
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,840
What is it? Do you have something to say?

897
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,467
(coins clink)

898
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:35,136
What kind of person are you, Master Kim?

899
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,016
What kind of nonsense is…

900
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,645
As you can see,
I'm just this kind of person.

901
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,855
-A person like me.
-(sighs)

902
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,984
Personally, I think
you're scary sometimes.

903
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,695
What?

904
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,781
You think I'm a scaredy-cat?

905
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,742
I think you're scary.
Very, super, absolutely scary!

906
00:58:57,825 --> 00:59:00,078
For someone who thinks
I'm "very, super, absolutely scary,"

907
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,288
you sure have a lot
to say while sitting there.

908
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,669
Just what kind of person are you,
Master Kim?

909
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,004
What are you?

910
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,758
This reminds me of the past.

911
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,593
A long time ago,

912
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,638
someone else asked me that question.

913
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,390
Just like you.

914
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:23,101
And? What was your answer?

915
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,945
SABU: "Master Kim."

916
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,991
-What?
-I said I was Master Kim.

917
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,326
That's what I told him.

918
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:43,121
(groans loudly)
This is driving me crazy.

919
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,914
Hey, don't go crazy.

920
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,959
We don't have another resident
with your specialty here.

921
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,919
I told you I wanted
to be a colorectal surgeon.

922
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,379
Did I say anything?

923
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:54,340
That's why I'm asking you
to stop trying to change my mind.

924
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:55,925
Were you about to?

925
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,427
Why?

926
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,637
Do you want to stay here?

927
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,639
No way! Not at all.

928
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:04,267
I dislike you right now anyway.

929
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,105
Maybe we can talk about it some more

930
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,773
if you pass the board.

931
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,526
I told you no!
I really don't like this hospital.

932
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,278
I hate it!

933
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:18,698
I never have time
to go home or play games.

934
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,577
Instead, there are people.

935
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:29,959
I'm not the type
to get along with people anyway.

936
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,754
I'm an ISFP. My disposition is--

937
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,714
What are you even saying?

938
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:39,761
It means that I don't get along
with strange people in a strange hospital.

939
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,596
Then why did you almost change your mind?

940
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,477
Is it because

941
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,395
you like me?

942
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,230
-(playful music)
-(groans)

943
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:55,026
-Please stop doing that.
-(laughs)

944
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,945
I'm allergic to words like that.

945
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,280
Look at these goosebumps.

946
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:03,785
I've noticed young people these days
aren't good at expressing their emotions.

947
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,913
If you like something or someone,
just say so!

948
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,665
It's not that big of a deal.

949
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,751
No! It's not like that at all!

950
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,670
-(yells)
-Come here!

951
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:18,257
SABU: Come here.
(laughs)

952
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:31,604
This guy…

953
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,440
GITAE: Master Kim!

954
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:35,942
Yes?

955
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,819
(pants)

956
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:41,906
Assemblywoman Ko has just arrived
at the Trauma Center.

957
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,449
She came to our hospital?

958
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,786
She said she wanted to be brought
to the main regional hospital.

959
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:47,954
What should we do?

960
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:53,376
She filed a lawsuit against us,
so it's an awkward situation.

961
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,837
How hurt is she?

962
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,220
You already heard
from our secretaries, right?

963
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:08,099
AIDE: First, please have
a room prepared for Ms. Ko.

964
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:11,728
And please run blood tests
and a CT as soon as possible.

965
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,521
You got a yellow tag.

966
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,481
Please take her to the Doldam ER.

967
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,858
Wait a minute.

968
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:19,318
Don't you understand what's going on here?

969
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,739
Right. We're in Code Orange right now.

970
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,116
MYEONGSIM: According to
the degree of emergency,

971
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,243
all non-emergency
and emergency patients go to the ER

972
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:30,788
while critical patients
are treated here at the Trauma Center.

973
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,040
Look here, Nurse Oh!

974
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:36,794
AIDE: Do you know how long it took Ms. Ko
to be rescued from the collapsed building?

975
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,297
You don't know
where or how hurt she may be--

976
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,840
Even if you don't have severe trauma,

977
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,259
you can get a CT at the ER.

978
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,053
Are you refusing treatment right now,

979
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,431
because I filed
a lawsuit against the hospital?

980
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,933
KYUNGSOOK: Are you allowed to do this?

981
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,227
As the main regional hospital?

982
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,189
The Doldam ER is
the main regional hospital,

983
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,024
not the Trauma Center.

984
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,694
All of the patients here
are being classified and treated

985
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,362
by the same standards, Ms. Ko.

986
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,657
(sighs)

987
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,871
-Chief Advisor Lee.
-Yes?

988
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:14,874
Let's go to another hospital.

989
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,126
Yes, Ms. Ko.

990
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,419
INSU: Hold on.

991
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,217
INSU: Ms. Ko.

992
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,469
May I take a look?

993
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,179
I said let's go to another hospital.

994
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:29,514
I'll take a look first.

995
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,476
Get your hands off me.
I don't want to be treated by you!

996
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,393
Excuse me.

997
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,270
KYUNGSOOK: What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

998
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,563
-Yes, Ms. Ko.
-(yells in pain)

999
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,274
Ms. Ko?

1000
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,527
(groans)

1001
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:46,405
There's a symptom you didn't tell
the paramedics about, right?

1002
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,367
You have to tell every symptom.

1003
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,202
That way you can get proper treatment.

1004
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,454
(whimpers)

1005
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,334
(yells, cries)

1006
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,923
Do you feel

1007
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,425
a little numb below your ankles?

1008
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,344
INSU: What about your toes?

1009
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:11,264
Is it hard to move your toes?

1010
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,932
(grunts, pants)

1011
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:14,600
Nurse Oh.

1012
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:17,937
I suspect compartment syndrome.

1013
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,523
Page OS.

1014
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,483
Transfer this patient
to the Observation Area.

1015
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,402
Nurse Oh, a pillow!

1016
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,371
Be prepared to face the consequences
if anything happens to Ms. Ko.

1017
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,290
Darn it.

1018
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,506
What happened?

1019
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,884
It's compartment syndrome.

1020
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,595
We've lost a lot of time,
so we need to operate immediately.

1021
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:51,637
Forget it.

1022
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,931
I will not receive
surgery in this hospital.

1023
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,266
What?

1024
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:57,101
Ms. Ko, this is considered

1025
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,729
an emergency orthopedic situation.

1026
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:02,440
MUNJEONG: If you don't open the muscle
with a fasciotomy immediately,

1027
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:03,983
you'll get necrosis in your tissue.

1028
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:07,069
You don't have time to move
to another hospital and get tested again.

1029
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:10,281
I don't understand
this situation right now.

1030
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,117
You said it wasn't an emergency earlier,

1031
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:16,621
but now you're saying I'll get necrosis
if I don't get surgery?

1032
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,499
I thought it was just a fracture.

1033
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,417
I'm sorry.

1034
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,585
Don't apologize.

1035
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:25,504
I don't want your apology.

1036
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:28,049
It won't touch my heart or anything.

1037
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:31,802
Do you think we're doing
this to please a customer?

1038
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,347
A doctor is trying to treat a patient.

1039
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,223
You're in critical condition, Ms. Ko.

1040
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:37,850
Why now?

1041
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,812
You left my son alone to die,

1042
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,856
so why are you trying

1043
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:46,233
to be so considerate now?

1044
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,778
Is it because of your hospital budget?

1045
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:54,200
Or are you hoping
I'll dismiss the lawsuit?

1046
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,243
-No--
-INSU: No, that's not it at all.

1047
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,789
We're doing this
because your condition is very bad,

1048
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,167
and you need surgery, Ms. Ko.

1049
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:08,547
Then you should have
taken care of my son like that!

1050
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,385
(Kyungsook cries)

1051
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,061
Assemblywoman Ko.

1052
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:24,814
I also have a child.

1053
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:27,858
INSU: She's a daughter

1054
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,444
whom I love so very much.

1055
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:32,488
I've spent the past seven years

1056
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,658
living away from her.

1057
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,787
While I am not the best dad,

1058
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:44,500
there is one thing I did
that can make my daughter proud.

1059
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,295
I did my best

1060
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,465
for the patients who come here.

1061
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,802
I worked very hard

1062
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,805
to become a doctor

1063
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,350
and not some quack doctor.

1064
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,146
That's the one thing I'm proud of.

1065
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,277
You don't have to…

1066
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,822
dismiss the lawsuit.

1067
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:19,160
You should still get the surgery.

1068
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:22,663
It'll be really bad

1069
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:25,833
if you don't.

1070
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:39,972
When we deal with patients,
we may not always meet expectations,

1071
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,017
but we have always done our best.

1072
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,480
So what will you do?

1073
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,441
Your leg must be
in a lot of pain right now.

1074
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,527
Are you sure you want
to go to another hospital?

1075
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,327
I'll tell Dr. Nam to open an OR.

1076
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,333
(soft music)

1077
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,548
NURSE 2: Don't forget the signs.

1078
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:15,633
NURSE 3: Okay.

1079
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:16,884
I'll do it.

1080
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,721
TO OBSERVATION AREA

1081
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:21,847
TO DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1082
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:23,682
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1083
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,564
(exhales heavily)

1084
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,660
What is all this?

1085
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,372
This is

1086
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:50,960
the only thing I've ever known
how to do in my life.

1087
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,137
Making delicious food for people.

1088
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:09,937
It's unfortunate that you hurt your hand
since you're a doctor.

1089
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:13,440
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

1090
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:17,736
It's okay.

1091
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:21,740
Stay strong.

1092
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:26,328
(laughs)

1093
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,249
I already feel sorry for telling someone

1094
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,043
who already works hard every day
to stay strong.

1095
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,759
But you should still stay strong.

1096
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,680
Only then can you keep living,

1097
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,641
right?

1098
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:51,979
Right.

1099
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:57,151
(exclaims)

1100
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,528
If you want to stay strong,
you have to eat well.

1101
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:02,364
People need to eat more than anything.

1102
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,994
Come on. Take a bite.

1103
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,333
I just made it and brought it here.

1104
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:13,834
Come on.

1105
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,381
(soft music)

1106
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:47,993
(sniffles)

1107
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,498
(Woojin sniffles)

1108
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,053
(sighs)

1109
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:11,892
Dr. Areum?

1110
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:15,938
AREUM: Did you just finish?

1111
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:17,564
Yes.

1112
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:19,858
I was watching the patient
since he was in bad condition,

1113
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,360
so I just finished.

1114
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,071
Were you waiting for me until now?

1115
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:26,991
Were you hurt?

1116
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:28,075
Well…

1117
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:30,452
just a little.

1118
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,455
(sighs)
I'm glad.

1119
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,544
But how could you
not even leave a text message?

1120
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:39,962
Well,

1121
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:44,508
I thought you would have heard
from the hospital staff that I was safe.

1122
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:49,221
I guess I only meant that much to you.

1123
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,101
To you, I'm just

1124
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:55,894
a part of the hospital staff.

1125
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:59,606
Right, Nurse Euntak?

1126
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:01,775
What do you mean?

1127
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,320
At least I understand now.

1128
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:09,533
"Why hasn't he texted or called me yet?"

1129
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:13,245
"Is he having that hard of a time
to not let me know he's safe?"

1130
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,622
"Is he hurt? Is he busy?"

1131
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:19,752
It was just me doing it again, right?

1132
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,339
-Just me again.
-(exhales)

1133
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:25,966
What's wrong, Dr. Areum?

1134
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,135
You're like a different person--

1135
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:30,304
I'm being very serious when I ask this.

1136
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:35,225
What percentage of your mind do I make up?

1137
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:39,396
-Dr. Areum.
-Why am I the only one missing you,

1138
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,440
worrying about you, and waiting for you?

1139
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,943
Why am I the only one ever upset?

1140
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:49,073
Is it because I like you

1141
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:51,200
more than you like me?

1142
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:54,828
If I like you less,

1143
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:57,456
will you treat me better?

1144
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:00,918
I'm sorry.

1145
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:03,962
I didn't realize you were this mad.

1146
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,214
Why?

1147
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:09,051
Did you think I didn't know how to get mad
and only knew how to laugh?

1148
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:14,390
I know how to get mad and be furious.
I know how to explode with anger.

1149
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:16,975
(sighs)

1150
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,980
I was completely out of my wits

1151
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,191
since Dr. Woojin got hurt.

1152
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,403
SABU: I was worried about Master Kim too.

1153
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,614
There was the operation
for the injured teacher too, so--

1154
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:31,740
See?

1155
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,660
I wasn't on your mind at all.

1156
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:35,911
That's not it.

1157
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,037
Enough.

1158
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,542
I won't be easily consoled this time.

1159
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,379
I'm going to be mad for the time being.

1160
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:47,673
Just keep that in mind.

1161
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:03,439
Oh, you haven't gone home yet, Dr. Areum?

1162
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,566
(Areum sighs)
Nurse Eom.

1163
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:07,568
Do you happen to have

1164
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,070
some of that candy?

1165
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,198
What's wrong?
I thought you stopped eating them.

1166
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,491
Are you stressed or something?

1167
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:17,119
I need the candy to get by today.

1168
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,955
Please give me one.

1169
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:21,665
But…

1170
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,293
if Nurse Euntak finds out,
I'll get in trouble.

1171
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:31,592
HYEONJEONG: What happened?

1172
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,385
You can tell me.

1173
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,721
(sighs)
I'm going to be nonchalant from now on.

1174
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,390
A relationship

1175
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,268
isn't something that happens
when only one person likes the other.

1176
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,772
AREUM: From now on, I'm going
to distance myself from Nurse Euntak.

1177
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:48,484
I can't let things go on like this.

1178
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,402
Thank you for the candy, Nurse Eom.

1179
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:53,906
Excuse me.

1180
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:55,782
I'll be going home now.

1181
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:58,327
Okay, see you tomorrow.

1182
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,082
Do you think they had a fight?

1183
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:06,376
Isn't it obvious?

1184
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,380
(sucks teeth)
I've never seen Dr. Areum this mad before.

1185
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,468
Nurse Joo, it's me.

1186
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,846
I think Dr. Areum and Nurse Euntak
just got into a fight.

1187
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,936
(Insu grunts, sighs)

1188
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:31,652
Master Kim.

1189
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:32,736
Hey.

1190
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,202
(soft exclaim)
We've made it this far

1191
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:41,912
before we knew it, haven't we?

1192
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,207
INSU: Right.

1193
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,502
It's something
I never dreamed of happening

1194
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:50,879
even when I first came down here.

1195
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,591
I felt the same way.
(chuckles)

1196
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:59,555
Still, you were the one
who brought it all together.

1197
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,223
I didn't bring anything together.

1198
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:05,978
I just go around
talking nonsense and stirring up trouble.

1199
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,688
(Sabu chuckles)

1200
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:11,233
SABU: It's all thanks to you guys

1201
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:14,528
that we were able to get this far.

1202
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:18,490
You know,

1203
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:23,453
not everyone in this world
will understand our true intentions.

1204
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,874
They're not that interested in us.

1205
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:30,043
So…

1206
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:34,006
there's no need to explain

1207
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:35,966
how hard we lived

1208
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:39,386
or how hard we tried.

1209
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:43,015
We'll just

1210
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:46,685
do what we've always done
and live how we've always lived.

1211
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,897
We'll silently move forward
no matter what anyone says.

1212
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:55,360
Just because we live silently
doesn't mean we disappear.

1213
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:58,864
Dr. Jung.

1214
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,658
What matters the most

1215
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,453
never disappears.

1216
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:08,540
SABU: You know that, right?

1217
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:10,917
Yes, Master Kim.

1218
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,961
(chuckles softly)

1219
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:19,092
My gosh. It's still chilly at night.

1220
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:22,512
-You should go in.
-Right.

1221
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:23,889
Okay.

1222
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,600
Oh, right.

1223
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:29,102
Ask Byeol how she's doing for me.

1224
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:30,812
I will.

1225
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,649
All right.
(chuckles)

1226
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,750
Byeol, it's me.

1227
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,044
Didn't you go to bed yet?

1228
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,838
INSU: I called because I missed you.

1229
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:00,967
What did you do today?

1230
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:05,430
Really? You scored a 100?

1231
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,557
(Insu laughs)

1232
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:13,397
(door closes)

1233
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:16,525
You operated
on Assemblywoman Ko Kyungsook?

1234
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:22,072
I was just operating
on a patient with compartment syndrome.

1235
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:24,574
So you didn't have an ulterior motive?

1236
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,744
Does a doctor need
an ulterior motive for a patient?

1237
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:30,122
That's how you took this hospital

1238
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:32,874
from Chairman Shin Myungho.

1239
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:35,210
What did you say?

1240
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:37,838
You should

1241
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,798
just tell me everything now.

1242
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:41,717
Tell you what?

1243
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,636
Your arm.

1244
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,974
(tense music)

1245
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:56,106
Did you really think I wouldn't notice?

1246
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:02,362
How far has it progressed?

1247
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:06,074
How much longer
will you be able to operate?

1248
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,622
I need to know your plan

1249
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,250
so I can keep up.

1250
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:20,338
Don't worry about what I'm doing.
Worry about yourself.

1251
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:24,217
As a doctor, father, and teacher,

1252
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:28,305
you were totally disqualified today,
you bastard.

1253
01:19:28,388 --> 01:19:29,389
You should be

1254
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,017
more respectful toward me, Yongju.

1255
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:34,644
Without me,

1256
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,815
you have no other alternative, right?

1257
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:39,900
(scoffs)

1258
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:45,864
"What gets us into trouble
is not what we don't know.

1259
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:48,492
It's when we boast about something
we think we know that does."

1260
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:50,952
This is something Mark Twain said.

1261
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:52,579
Looking at you now

1262
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:55,457
made me think of that saying.

1263
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:57,459
What is that supposed to mean?

1264
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,589
It means…

1265
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,011
that you were actually Plan B, Jinman.

1266
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:11,264
(upbeat music)

1267
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,854
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

1268
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,417
(phone vibrates)

1269
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:50,512
KANG DONGJU

1270
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:55,475
(closing theme music)

1271
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:26,464
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

1272
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:28,049
MUNJEONG: There's a possibility

1273
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,552
that his hand won't recover
to the way it was.

1274
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:32,554
Should we get married?

1275
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:36,683
JINMAN: I think someone came into my room
without permission.

1276
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:38,059
WOO SANGMIN

1277
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,770
HOJUN: Maybe it has something to do
with the incident from three years ago?

1278
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:41,897
EUNJAE: I love my dad.

1279
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,690
And I respect him
more than anyone else in the world.

1280
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:45,442
-MINGUK: At this point, that offer…
-Will you take it?

1281
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:48,111
JINMAN: How much of this did you plot out?

1282
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:50,155
WOOJIN: Just what are you planning
right now?
