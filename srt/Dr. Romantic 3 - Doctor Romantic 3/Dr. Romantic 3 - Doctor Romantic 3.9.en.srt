DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,962
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

SABU: Abnormal climate.

6
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,388
Natural disasters.

7
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,850
The climate is rapidly changing
for the worse.

8
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,853
Forest fires, earthquakes, and wars.

9
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,025
Many unpredictable incidents,
accidents, and man-made disasters.

10
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,155
We will be engulfed by these
suddenly and without warning.

11
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,534
At this point,
the world has become a place

12
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,245
where no matter what happens,
we wouldn't find it surprising.

13
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,164
Now,

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,334
we have to prepare for that kind of world.

15
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,298
Our Rough Rock Project
will become the cornerstone for that.

EPISODE 9

17
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,849
AGAINST REDEVELOPMENT
THAT'S KICKING OUT RESIDENTS!

18
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,893
PROTESTER:
We are against this redevelopment!

19
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,312
STUDENT 1: Hey,
I tanked all my exams today.

20
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,064
What about you?

21
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,149
That's the story of my life.

22
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,735
Still, I'm going to the academy
to at least try to do well in math.

23
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,363
-STUDENT 1: As if you are.
-(student 2 laughs)

24
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,574
Did you hear the academy is moving
to downtown Jeongseon next month?

25
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,910
They should've moved a long time ago.
Look at this.

26
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,954
It's a wonder
the building is still standing.

27
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,540
Will the tteokbokki restaurant move too?

28
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,624
Gosh. Tteokbokki.

29
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,167
-Hello.
-Hello.

30
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,085
WOMAN 1: Hi, girls.

31
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,336
-Hello.
-Hello.

32
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,420
MAN 1: Hey, there.

33
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,673
STUDENT 1: The building looks
shabbier than usual today.

34
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,799
STUDENT 2: I know, right?

35
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,968
Is there no tteokbokki place
near the new location?

36
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,137
STUDENT 1: I don't know.
I like the tteokbokki here.

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,221
STUDENT 2: I know.

38
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,681
-TEACHER: Hello.
-STUDENTS: Hello.

39
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,765
STUDENT 3: Hello.

40
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,643
Hey.

41
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,813
Why are you going down there?
The academy is upstairs.

42
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,066
What do you care?
Just go and teach your class, sir.

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,359
What did you say?

44
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,154
TEACHER: Will you keep skipping
after paying your lesson fees?

45
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,197
I'll call your mom.

46
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,949
What's with the sudden act?

47
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,620
Just take the money and get lost.
You're so annoying.

48
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,122
(clicks tongue)

49
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,208

911 PARAMEDICS
HIGH-QUALITY BASIC LIFE SUPPORT PROGRAM

53
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,684
Hello, I'm emergency physician

54
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,270
Jung Insu from Doldam Hospital.

55
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,690
(applause)

56
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,860
Recently, some regions
have launched pilot programs

57
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,446
that implement technologies such as
Smart Emergency Medical Services

58
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,406
that can provide
not only basic life support

59
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,366
but also more advanced life support

60
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,912
when a patient goes into cardiac arrest.

61
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,872
INSU: Some reports say that

62
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,542
the chances of ROSC
in cardiac arrest patients are increasing,

63
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,754
and many cases are
showing good neurologic prognoses

64
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,006
thanks to these programs.

65
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,008
What do we do in disasters?

66
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,469
(people murmuring)

67
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,971
What is the first thing we should do

68
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,474
at a scene with multiple casualties?

69
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,061
It's to minimize damage.

70
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,940
In order to minimize damage
with limited people and resources,

71
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,609
we must choose and focus.

72
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:59,447
In other words, it's not our goal
to resuscitate an already dead patient.

73
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,158
Instead, our greatest goal

74
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,370
is to prevent deaths

75
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,914
by treating patients who could be dying.

76
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:11,000
Do you mean we don't perform CPR?

77
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,460
That's right.

78
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,047
In disaster situations
with multiple casualties, we don't do CPR.

79
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,258
That's the rule.

80
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,469
(phone vibrates)

81
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,054

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,857
Right, let's get started
with the program right away.

85
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,567
-Open your books.
-STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

86
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,237
We went over the graph of
a logarithmic function last time, right?

87
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,154
STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

88
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,572
TEACHER: What do you do
when it's larger than one?

89
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,865
-STUDENTS: It increases.
-TEACHER: That's right.

90
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,701
When it's greater than zero
but less than one?

91
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,577
-STUDENTS: It decreases.
-Yes, it decreases.

92
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:47,578
Jungmin.

93
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,414
-Yes?
-TEACHER: Put your phone away.

94
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,667
That's why your grades
and popularity are decreasing like this.

95
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,710
(students laugh)

96
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,753
Sir, Jungmin isn't that bad.

97
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,588
Why are you saying that out loud?

98
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,717
-BOYS: Ooh.
-Sir, I'm more popular than you think.

99
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,552
STUDENTS: Ooh.

100
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,430
That's unexpected.
Let's move on to the problem.

101
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,516
TEACHER: You need to find the maximum
and minimum of a logarithmic function.

102
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,351
-This is easy.
-(cracking)

103
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,188
What's with this today?
The water hasn't been running all day.

104
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,108
You need to do something about this.
I have a business to run!

105
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,235
-STUDENT 4: Seriously?
-WOMAN 1: This is driving me crazy!

106
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,155
STUDENT 4 (groaning): What if
the teacher gets mad at us?

107
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,288
-(ominous music)
-(glass cracking)

108
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,503
STUDENT 5 (in English): Six, seven, eight!

109
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,089
(upbeat pop music)

110
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,133
-(rattling)
-(electricity buzzing)

111
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,385
STUDENT 5 (in Korean): And up.

112
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,013
Go back a little more.

113
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,015
(rattling continues)

114
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,935

115
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,649

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,379
Come on, lights. Change already.

119
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,922
We have enough time.

120
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,298
Right.

121
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,217
What did you say?

122
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,136
We still have plenty of time.

123
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,640
You're right.

124
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,017
(exhales)

125
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,269
I look nervous, don't I?

126
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,479
(groans)

127
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,940
This is my first time
officially introducing a guy to my dad.

128
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,236
I really must be
your first relationship, Dr. Cha.

129
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,779
And what about you?

130
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,531
I've had others.

131
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,033
I've always been pretty popular.

132
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,786
So how many girls have you dated?

133
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,122
I'm not sure. I don't remember.

134
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,374
I haven't really kept count.

135
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,420
How many girls have you dated
that you don't even remember?

136
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,923
Does the number matter?

137
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,591
You're the one by my side now.

138
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,802
WOOJIN: Isn't that what matters?

139
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,262
Ms. Pretty Please?

140
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,930
What's this?

141
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,307
Are you trying to provoke me,
Mr. Seo Woojin?

142
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,560
The light's green.

143
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,353
Don't think you can get away with this.

144
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,690
We'll have a proper discussion about this
later on, Mr. Seo Woojin.

145
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,649
(laughs softly)

146
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,987
(exhales)

147
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,697
(sighs)

148
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,782
This way.

149
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,418
EUNJAE: Mom?

150
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,591
What happened? Where's Dad?

151
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,051
He went to court. There's a hearing today.

152
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,511
EUNJAE'S MOM: Didn't you know?

153
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,474
Seriously, that hospital
must be cursed or something.

154
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,852
EUNJAE'S MOM: First, your brother
had to deal with an exhausting lawsuit,

155
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,687
and now your dad got roped into one

156
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,231
as soon as he became
head of the trauma center?

157
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,566
EUNJAE'S MOM: Goodness.

158
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,487
Should we just go?

159
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,113
What?

160
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,324
Let's sit down.

161
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,461
Hey, I didn't come
because I wanted to either.

162
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,339
Your dad insisted I buy you guys a meal,

163
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,090
so I did, even though I didn't want to.

164
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,052
Not gladly, but unwillingly.

165
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,180
That's good.
Then let's just leave for today, Mom.

166
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,432
It's our precious day off,

167
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,809
and we don't want to waste it
eating with you unwillingly.

168
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,061
Let's go, Dr. Seo.

169
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,231
I hear this place has great steaks.

170
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,691
WOOJIN: Are you okay with steak for lunch?

171
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,569
If that's too heavy,
we could also order some pasta

172
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,695
and share.

173
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,325
I tend to eat lightly for brunch.

174
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,079
Then I'll ask
if there's a salad you could order.

175
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,497
WOOJIN: Excuse me.

176
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,456
SERVER: Yes?

177
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,670
I have other plans.

178
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,839
Please, Assemblywoman Ko.
Why don't we reach a settlement?

179
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,509
I have nothing to say about that.

180
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,345
I'll see you in court.

181
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,933
(sighs)

182
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,729
Fighting in court
will be exhausting for everyone.

183
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,439
If you tell us what you want,

184
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,608
I'll do my best to meet your requests.

185
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:37,285
Do you think I'm haggling with you
over the price of my son's life?

186
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,453
(exhales)
I didn't mean that.

187
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,872
That trauma center you people built?

188
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,168
To be honest,
I still don't see why it's necessary.

189
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,381
Master Kim's emergency medical center
is running perfectly fine as it is.

190
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:54,176
Why did you build
a separate trauma center?

191
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,888
Why must we spend a large sum
of the province's budget on that?

192
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,474
What does this lawsuit
have to do with the province's budget?

193
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,604
I intend to prove the illusion
and worthlessness of the trauma center

194
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,066
through my son's death in court.

195
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,902
That's the true objective of this lawsuit.

196
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,322
-(tense music)
-(sighs)

197
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,574
Assemblywoman Ko, I have already sent you

198
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,118
over 100 pages of material
on the trauma center's necessity.

199
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,120
I've briefed you on it endlessly.

200
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,831
Its usefulness and value are
as clear as day.

201
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,417
Then you won't have to worry in court.

202
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,711
You can prove yourself in there.

203
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,715
GRAND MEETING ROOM
SEMINAR ROOM

204
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,758
(sighs)

205
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,178
MINGUK: She seems very determined.

206
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,264
It seems she will bring in reporters
to make the issue even bigger.

207
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,641
What should we do?

208
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,809
Then we should also be very determined

209
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,645
in our response.

210
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,649
This isn't the first time
something like this happened.

211
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,945
Will you be going to court in person?

212
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,491
Why not leave the trial to the lawyers
and watch how things proceed--

213
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,533
JINMAN: That would work

214
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,329
when both parties are willing
to settle on a certain amount.

215
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,999
JINMAN: I should go and explain
what I need to.

216
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,751
That would look better

217
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:10,920
for our side.

218
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,715
Still, the head of the trauma center
can't be gone all afternoon.

219
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,803
A trial would take hours
with the travel time to the courthouse.

220
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,181
The complaining party should put up with
the shortage of medical staff

221
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,975
due to useless lawsuits like this.

222
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,186
JINMAN: Don't you think so?

223
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,772
(door opens)

224
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,108
(sighs)

225
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,361
Master Kim.

226
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:40,074
We're putting an elephant
in a fridge now, aren't we?

227
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,329
(sighs)

228
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,627
MUNJEONG: Say hello, Dr. Lee.

229
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,671
-This is Elizabeth.
-Pardon?

230
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,966
(faltering) Eli… zabeth?

231
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,136
Elizabeth, you should say hello too.

232
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,973
This is Dr. Lee Seonung,
the new cardiothoracic surgeon

233
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,307
at Doldam Hospital.

234
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,311
SEONUNG: Uh…

235
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,980
Hi.

236
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,607
-MUNJEONG: That reminds me.
-(clattering)

237
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,277
You haven't met Jessie yet either, right?

238
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,155
-MUNJEONG: Here.
-SEONUNG: Oh.

239
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,743
SEONUNG: Hi.

240
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,500
Wow, Jessie sure has a knack
for recognizing a surgeon's hand.

241
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,128
She says you have great hands.

242
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,130
She expects great things from you.

243
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,590
Right.

244
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,633
Sure.

245
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,344
-(phone rings)
-Oh.

246
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,972
This is Bae Munjeong.

247
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,640
Hi, Ms. Eom.

248
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,643
Got it. Bye.

249
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,562
(phone clicks)

250
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,397
There's a patient.

251
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,899
MUNJEONG: One moment.
(chuckles)

252
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,818
(door opens, closes)

253
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,075
Did you finally say hi to them?

254
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,702
SEONUNG: Oh.

255
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,623
So you know them.
Did you say hi to them too?

256
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,501
Honestly, I was baffled at first too.

257
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,338
MUNJEONG: Say hello, Dr. Jang Donghwa.

258
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,881
This is Elizabeth.

259
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,258
DONGHWA: What is this?

260
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,844
Oh, and this…

261
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:25,888
is Jessie.

262
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,306
Here.

263
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,683
Go on.

264
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,728
DONGHWA: What's with this guy?

265
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,314
-That's what I thought.
-(knocking)

266
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,774
Yes?

267
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,652
Dr. Ortho,
here's a list of cutbacks from the ER.

268
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,111
Thank you.

269
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,238
Hi, Elizabeth.

270
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,864
AREUM: Hi, Jessie.

271
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,285
Elizabeth seems to be
in good condition today.

272
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,705
She just met Dr. Jang Donghwa.

273
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,874
She must like him.

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,462
You're a lucky guy.
She has high standards, you know.

275
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,551
SEONUNG: Oh.

276
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:08,180
This must be some kind of
welcoming ritual for new staff.

277
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,558
I see it now.

278
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,686
So it wasn't that weird a situation then.

279
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,148
You're wrong. It's a very weird situation.

280
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,277
This whole place is like that.
The hospital and the people too.

281
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,444
Jeez.

282
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,531
Still, you're going to stay
at this hospital.

283
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,950
No. My goal is clear.

284
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,077
Colorectal surgery.

285
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,706
Colorectal surgery?

286
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,251
Yes, I unwillingly became
a doctor because of my parents,

287
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,255
but I don't have a great sense of duty
to be responsible for someone's life.

288
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:42,882
DONGHWA: Hear me out.

289
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,343
No emergency patients.
You're guaranteed a nine-to-six schedule.

290
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,096
You have a steady number of patients,
but not too many.

291
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,556
You can have a work-life balance.

292
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,642
That's the life I dream of.

293
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,811
(inhales)
But then

294
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,272
why did you come all the way here?

295
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,067
You could've done
your residency in Seoul too.

296
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:07,823
Just because...

297
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,909
I was curious about this place.

298
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,917
(phone alarms blare)

299
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,923
(tense music)

300
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,674
Oh…

301
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,056
(sighs)

302
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,310
EUNJAE'S MOM: He seems to have become
a lot more relaxed.

303
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,395
He was so stiff three years ago.

304
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,107
He's just shy, not stiff.

305
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,902
How are his financial circumstances?

306
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,737
Have you looked into his bank accounts?

307
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,197
What do you mean?

308
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,825
Your dad has already approved
of his talent, so that's fine.

309
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,788
EUNJAE'S MOM: We should check
how his finances are ahead of time.

310
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,832
He has no family background to boast of.

311
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,126
It'll be a hassle if he has debts too.

312
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,254
(sighs)
He doesn't have anything like that.

313
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,465
He took care of everything
three years ago.

314
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,218
We're saving up together now.

315
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,594
Together?

316
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,304
Why would you do that?

317
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,184
I mean we'll take care of
our own business, Mom.

318
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,896
(phone alarm blares)

319
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,026
(tense music sting)

320
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,487
(phone alarm blares)

321
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,288
911 PARAMEDICS
HIGH-QUALITY BASIC LIFE SUPPORT PROGRAM

322
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,540
PARAMEDIC: What is it?

323
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,001
PARAMEDIC 1: Hey, it's an emergency.

324
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,544
It's an emergency!

325
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,712
Everyone, let's go!

326
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,879
Come on!

327
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,387
-Did you get the message?
-Yes, what's the situation now?

328
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,348
A decrepit building collapsed
in the Gongyeong-dong redevelopment area.

329
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,642
We're not sure
how many casualties there are,

330
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,562
but there was a math academy
on the second floor of the building.

331
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,480
Students again?

332
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,983
Yes, that's right.

333
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,777
(exhales)

334
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,948
REPORTER 1: We have breaking news.

335
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:17,786
A building in Gongyeong-dong,
Jeongseon, Gangwon Province has collapsed.

336
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,874
This old building was built in the 1970s,

337
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,877
and there were
already several cracks in the walls.

338
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,795
It was in a redevelopment area,

339
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,381
-and it was set to be demolished.
-Oh, no.

340
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,468
REPORTER 1: The exact number of casualties
remains unclear…

341
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,138
Is everyone here?

342
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,560
A building has collapsed
in the redevelopment area.

343
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,729
We don't know
how many casualties there are,

344
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,066
but Doldam Hospital will serve
as the base for the DMAT.

345
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,108
DMAT: DISASTER MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TEAM

346
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,528
And as of now, we're in Code Orange. Okay?

347
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,696
-Yes, Doctor.
-Yes, Doctor.

348
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,781
(claps)
Go.

349
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,534
Wait, what's Code Orange?

350
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,454
It means we will empty the ER now.

351
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,123
How?

352
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,583
EUNTAK: Discharge patients who can leave,

353
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,376
and move those who can't to the wards.

354
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,338
Oh.

356
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,300
-Yes, Master Kim.
-Call the trauma center.

357
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,970
Have Ms. Oh and Dr. Jung Insu
join us for the emergency meeting.

358
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,057
Dr. Jung went to teach the BLS program
at the fire department today.

359
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,392
He's supposed to go straight
to the courthouse after that.

360
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,311
What about Seo Woojin?

361
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,938
He's off today.

362
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,942

Should I go straight to the scene?

366
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,535
I'll join DMAT Team One.

367
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,372
It isn't far from where I am now.
I can be there in ten minutes.

368
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,082
(in English) Okay.

369
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,543

to the scene.

We're the base hospital.
We'll be flooded with patients soon.

It's a disaster situation.
Of course I should come too.

384
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,324
What about your mother?

385
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,326

That's how you can save
one more person, got it?

Yes, Master Kim.

449
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,768
The safety of the medical staff

450
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,020

WOOJIN: At a disaster scene
with multiple casualties,

468
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,581
the rule is to not do CPR.

469
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,043
We must save those who can be saved.
You get what I mean, right?

Your head, chest, or anywhere
that was badly hit or in pain?

478
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,106
Are you giving up on my friend?

479
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,943
Aren't you doing CPR?

480
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,986
This is the rule in a disaster.

481
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,988
We're not here to revive

482
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,449

483
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,744
We're here to treat patients
who can survive.

484
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,664
That's our priority,
so you should go and get treated--

STUDENT 7: Aren't you a doctor?

486
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,751
Then you should save my friend first.

487
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,087
STUDENT 7: Please save him.

488
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,880
(crying) Save him.

What's the current situation?

So far, there are 4 fatalities.

508
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,315
Thankfully, the math teacher
caught on before the collapse

509
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,191
and evacuated most of the students.

510
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,861
The kids got tangled up
and fell on their way out

511
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,446
and were hurt in the process.

512
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,031
Before the quick response team arrives,

513
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,325
set up a makeshift clinic
where the patients

514
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,576
are being brought out.

515
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,244
And set out triage mats.

516
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,247
After we triage them,
reds to the left, yellows to the right,

517
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,832
and greens to the back.

518
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,125
For blacks,

519
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,003
we'll keep them inside in a corner

520
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,422
until a temporary morgue is set up.
We'll send them there.

521
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,506
Got it.

529
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,856
start with the severe patients
that the paramedics can't handle.

00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,234
WOOJIN: Some of them
might outwardly look fine

531
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:34,653
but check them well.

532
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,571
Yes, Doctor.

534
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,202
-Kid!
-STUDENT 7: I can't breathe…

535
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,370
Are you okay?

536
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,288
-Watch your head.
-(student 7 groans)

537
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,249
I need a stethoscope over here!

538
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,460
-Dr. Cha.
-Nurse Euntak.

539
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,962
(student 7 continues groaning)

540
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,467
EUNTAK: Here.

541
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,601
(groans)

542
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,105
NURSE

543
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,901
BP 80/40, pulse 120.

544
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,111
It's a tension pneumothorax.

545
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,571
-Do you need the 16-gauge angiocatheter?
-Yes, please.

546
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,448
(groaning continues)

547
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,637

Got it.

549
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,767
STUDENT 7 (gasping): Help me. I can't…

550
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,310
I can't breathe.

551
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,564
(student 7 grunts, pants)

552
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,732
You'll be okay now.

553
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,483
Give me an IV line
and sodium chloride solution

554
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,818
to do an underwater seal
behind the catheter.

555
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,194
-Okay.
-EUNJAE: And something to cover up.

556
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,280
Transportation team! Over here!

TRIAGE TAG

558
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,079
This patient has tension pneumothorax.
Watch his BP and saturation.

559
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,664
Get him to Doldam's trauma center quickly.

560
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,754
(exhales)
I'll see you at the hospital.

561
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:18,882
Let's move him.

562
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,513
Ms. Joo, call all the doctors in.

563
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,557
Call Dr. Bae Munjeong here too.

564
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,559
-Hey.
-Doil.

565
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,519
We don't know
how many severe patients we'll get.

566
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,397
Call all anesthesiologists in,
so we can start emergency surgery

567
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,274
as soon as they come in.

568
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,526
-Okay. Check the blood supply first.
-Yes, Doctor.

569
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,069
Ms. Oh.

570
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,031
They'll triage the patients on the scene,

571
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:47,202
but check the patients' RTS
and separate them as they come in.

572
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,330
Emergency patients will go to Doldam's ER,

573
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,500
and critical patients
will come here to the trauma center.

574
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,669
I've ordered those
who may have internal injuries

575
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,338
to be sent here too.

576
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,381
I'll make sure not to miss anything.

577
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,926
By the way, where is Director Park?

578
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,136
I called him right after you called me.

579
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,304
Here he comes.

580
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,056
-Master Kim.
-Director Park.

581
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,017
We'll need you to help out
in the trauma center.

582
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,728
SABU: The head of the trauma center
isn't here,

583
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,106
and with Seo Woojin at the scene,
we're short on general surgeons.

584
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,274
Wait.

585
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,069
There is something you must see first.

586
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,612
What?

587
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,533
Here is the breaking news once again.

588
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,577
Provincial Assemblywoman Ko Kyungsook
who was visiting the redevelopment area

589
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,832
is currently believed to be buried
under the collapsed building.

590
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,751
REPORTER 1: We'll go to the scene
for more details.

591
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,462
Reporter Song Hyejin.
What is the current situation?

592
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:40,797
CAUGHT IN THE ACCIDENT
WHILE MEETING RESIDENTS

593
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,714
Yes.

594
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,426
Provincial Assemblywoman Ko Kyungsook was
in the redevelopment area around 1 p.m.

595
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,637
REPORTER 2: She was meeting
with the shop owners

596
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,472
in the building who haven't moved out yet.

597
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,641
As the shop owners
who were making a living

598
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,936
in the old building
refused to move out in protest,

599
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,481
she was there
to persuade them about safety issues

600
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,901
and what will happen after moving out
when the building suddenly came down.

601
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,862
(screams)
Help!

602
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:04,779
No!

603

REPORTER 2: Sadly,
Assemblywoman Ko Kyungsook's whereabouts

605
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,536
have not yet been confirmed.

606
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,497
With the Fire Department declaring
a Level Two Emergency Response--

607
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:15,748
Master Kim.

608
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,334
The situation might get
more serious than we thought.

609
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,252
What do we do?

610
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,337
(sighs)

611
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,091
(sirens wailing in the distance)

612
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,845
Master Kim. The patients are arriving.

613
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,847
One chest injury and one broken bone.

614
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,140

621
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,093
Can you hear me?

622
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,766
If you can't answer,
please tap something to make some noise!

623
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,725
(faint clang)

624
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,685
-PARAMEDIC 8: Please answer!
-Hang on.

625
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,646
(faint clanging)

626
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,898
-STUDENT 8: Over here.
-That way.

627
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,775
(faint clanging continues)

628
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,824
(clanging grows louder)

629
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,078
Is anyone there?

630
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,871
STUDENT 8: Over here.

631
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,915
-(soft music)
-(gasps)

632
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,042
Move this.

633
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,211
-STUDENT 8: Please help me!
-(clanging continues)

634
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,504
Okay. One, two.

635

PARAMEDIC 8: Where are you?

636
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,887
STUDENT 8: Down here.

637
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,394
(breathes shakily)
Please help me.

638
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,190
(groans)

639
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,405
Let's start a saline IV drip.

640
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,741
It's not an open fracture,
but there will be lots of bleeding.

641
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,702
He could go into shock.
Let's move him now.

642
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,662
Yes, Doctor. Transportation team!

643
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,999
-STUDENT 9: Are you okay?
-(student 10 retching)

646
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,795
Excuse me.

00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,442
You'll be moved to the hospital.

650
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,235
Can I go with her?

651
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,071
My leg is all scraped up below my knee.

652
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,322
Can you walk?

653
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,283
Yes, I brought her outside.

654
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,993
Then you're a non-emergency case.

655
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,621
Non-emergency cases will be moved last
according to the level of injury.

656
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,956
Please go to that tent for now.

657
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,708
I want to stay with my friend.

658
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,918
I can't do that for you right now.

659
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,630
You go to the ambulance.
You, to that tent over there.

660
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,924
Please take her to the ambulance.

661
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:12,925

ON-SITE EMERGENCY CLINIC

663
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,099
It seems to be hemoperitoneum.

664
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,476
His vitals are really bad.

665

666
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,782

His lungs sound bad too.

00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,994
Here you are.

669
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,997
Ms. Joo called just now.
She needs you back quickly.

670
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,876
Professor Cha is out for the hearing
and they're short on CT surgeons.

671
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,213
Then I'll ride with
this hemoperitoneum patient.

672
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,423
His vitals are really bad.
I'll keep an eye on him.

673
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,424
Yes, Doctor.

00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,657
Get this patient's vitals!

Dr. Cha.

682
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,205
Yes, I'm leaving.

I think we need to intubate.

688
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:44,976
What's going on?

689
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,520

The Ambu is stiff.

694
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,113
I think her airway is blocked.

695
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,074
Put a neck collar on her first.

00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,037

697
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,042

That's good.

702
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,895
This won't do. Give me the direct scope.

703
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,730
And get suction ready too.

00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,319
Ready.

705
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,487
WOOJIN: Hold her neck so it doesn't bend.

706
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,200
Please.

707
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,702
Take it out.

708
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,625
I can't get a clear view.

709
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,668
I'm just going in blind.

710
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,670
(Woojin grunts)

711
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,509
You can't let go of…

712
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,723
There is

713
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,517
no pulse.

714
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,563
-STUDENT 11: Help me!
-(somber music)

715
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,359
WOMAN 3: Over here. Please.

716
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,825
(exhales)

717
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,498
(exhales)

718
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,542
STUDENT 11: Please help.

719
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,836
(breathes shakily)

720
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,131
(exhales)

721
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,008
Dr. Seo.

722
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,281
MAN 3: Over here!

723
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,032
DECEASED

724
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,543
(exhales)

725
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,754
(exhales)

726
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,423
MR. HEO: Doctor!

727
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,802
We found survivors in the basement.

728
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,347
MR. HEO: A paramedic has gone down
after we cleared a small path.

729
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,641
I think there is someone injured
down there.

730
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,395
(dial tone rings)

731
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,272
What is it like down there?

732
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,983
PARAMEDIC 13: He's in
his early to mid-thirties.

733
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,860
He's a teacher at the academy.

734
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,321
His legs are pinned down and can't move.

735
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,031
It's because of us.

736
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,034
(cries)
He came down to evacuate us.

737
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,120
(cries)

738
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,164
PARAMEDIC 13: He has
a big bruise on his abdomen.

739
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,918
PARAMEDIC 13: His entire abdomen
is hard and swollen.

740
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,422
What about the other students?

741
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,427
There are five in total.

742
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,346
PARAMEDIC 13: One male student is
unconscious.

743
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,431
No external bleeding or things to note.

744
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,224
-His vitals aren't that bad either.
-(coughs)

745
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,354
The other four have
light abrasions and lacerations.

746
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,357
-One boy is having trouble breathing.
-(gasps for breath)

747
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,152
Can you ask if he has asthma?

748
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,237
Kid.

749
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,156
Do you have asthma?

750
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,699
(pants)

751
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,619
(breathlessly) I have my inhaler
in my backpack.

752
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,164
But it's buried underneath.

753
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,751
(continues panting)

754
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,712
How long until we can get them out?

755
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,924
There's a risk of further collapse.
It won't be easy to get equipment in.

756
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,343
MR. HEO: We'll have to get them out
by hand.

757
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,388
In that case, we don't know
if it'll take an hour or longer.

758
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,181
If we wait until they get out,

759
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,974
it's likely he could die.

760
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,351
Then what do we do?

761
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,946
WOMAN 4: Help us over here!

762
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:10,950
Nurse Euntak.

763
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,868
Bring the REBOA kit.

764
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,078
REBOA: RESUSCITATIVE ENDOVASCULAR
BALLOON OCCLUSION OF THE AORTA

765
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:14,995
No, Dr. Seo.

766
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,997
If I go down and do first aid,

767
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,167
we can buy some time until they get out.

768
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,252
Dr. Seo.

769
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,546
You can't go down there.
The building might collapse further.

770
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,005
The teacher risked his life

771
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,299
to save those kids down there.

772
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,511
I can't just let him die.

773
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,140
The safety of medical staff takes priority
at accident sites. That's the rule.

774
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,101
The moment we give up,

775
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,937
people will die.

776
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:48,988
Then let's go in together.

777
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,033
Nurse Euntak, don't be like this too.
You can't do this.

778
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,327
You'll need me
to use the REBOA kit anyway.

779
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,997
Get the salbutamol from the ambulance.

780
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,457
(sighs)

781
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,626
I'll let the command center know.

782
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,087
STUDENT 14: Ow, ow.

783
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,548
-Ow!
-Press on this.

784
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,680
DONGHWA: Huh?

785
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:16,891
What are they doing?

786
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,434
MR. HEO: Let's go.

787
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,769
What?

788
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:24,523
Are they going in?

789
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,611
Jeez, what do I do?

790
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,113
Seriously…

791
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,782
MAN 3: Please, it hurts so bad.

792
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,451
The building collapsed.

793
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,748
Green patients
to the Doldam ER waiting room.

794
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,751
MYEONGSIM: Yellows to the ER.

795
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,545
Reds to the trauma center's
observation area. Here.

796
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,214
PARAMEDIC 14: Hang in there.

797
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,340
To the treatment room.

798
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:51,967
-This way.
-(groans)

799
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,761
Goodness.

800
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,096
-Let me touch it.
-(yells)

801
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,264
Okay.

802
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,933
Give him some tramadol.

803
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,061
Please tell me if you feel pain.

804
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,314
Show me the CT scan.

805
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,816
(grunts)

806
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,696
There's lung laceration
and hemopneumothorax.

807
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,281
Get a tube in there quickly.

808
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,367
Get a chest tube ready, please.

809
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,453
(patients yelling, groaning)

810
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,539
-Don't move.
-STUDENT 15: It hurts!

811
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,290
(groaning continues)

812
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,002
PARAMEDIC 15: Moving the patient.

813
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,004
-One, two, three.
-HOJUN: You're here now.

814
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,798
Don't move.

815
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,175
Don't move. One, two, three.

816
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,803
Kid.

817
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,513
You're at the hospital.

818
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,973
STUDENT 16: It hurts!

819
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,724
Please wait just for a moment.

820
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,271
Nari!

821
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,773
Nari, are you okay?

822
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,732
This way!

823
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,318
(clamoring)

824
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,279
-WOMAN 5: We need to go.
-Just a moment!

825
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,698
You'll be treated according to
the severity of your injuries!

826
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,617
EMPLOYEE: Green patients,
please wait in the waiting room.

827
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,037
Green patients,
please have a seat in the chairs.

828
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,248
-Don't tell us just to sit.
-We'll see you in order!

829
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,253
Let's get a head CT in Bed 13!

830
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,964
-What's your name?
-Im Juyeon.

831
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,424
-Does your elbow hurt?
-Yes.

832
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,384
-Let's try moving it.
-(yells in pain)

833
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,969
-It hurts.
-Ms. Eom.

834
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,013
-Let's get her to X-ray.
-Okay.

835
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,474
(moans)
It hurts.

836
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,438
-Master Kim.
-SABU: Yes?

837
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,565
Dr. Jang Donghwa is
on the line from the scene.

838
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,400
Watch out for adhesions.

839
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,652
I told Dr. Seo
to give orders at the scene.

840
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,613
YEONGMI: The thing is…

841
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,366
Dr. Seo has gone into
the collapsed building.

842
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,042
SABU: What are you saying?

843
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,710
Why did Seo Woojin go in there?

844
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,964
DONGHWA: They found survivors
in the basement of the collapsed building.

845
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,468
There are five students
and a teacher down there.

846
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,594
But…

847
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,597
they didn't know
how long it'll take to get them out.

848
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,183
And… And I guess

849
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,520
there's someone
who is severely injured inside.

850
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,481
(yelling) So what?

851
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,859
What happened to Seo Woojin?

852
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,739
DONGHWA: He went
into the basement himself.

853
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,116
Along with Nurse Euntak.

854
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,162
(sighs)

855
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,753
DONGHWA: Can't you call them
and have them come back up?

856
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,130
There's a risk of further collapse.

857
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,801
Master Kim!

858
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,611
I'll go first.
I have better athletic skills.

859
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,155
I'm quite fit too. I jog every morning.

860
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,035
MR. HEO: Doctor,
are you sure you'll be okay?

861
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,621
If Master Kim finds out,
you'll be in big trouble.

862
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,624
I'll go down first,
then the DMAT bag, and Nurse Euntak last.

863
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,709
Let's go in that order.

864
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,669
MR. HEO: Okay.

865
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,130
-Take me down.
-Going down.

866
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,102
(dial tone ringing)

867
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,203
SEO WOOJIN

868
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,707
NURSE PARK EUNTAK

869
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,001
(dial tone ringing)

870
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,192
Patient's vitals are 80/60.
Rate is slowing down.

871
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,360
The abdomen is swollen
and the lung sound isn't great.

872
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,695
There's no room in here.

873
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,614
We'll move the fracture
to the observation area.

874
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,199
Let's bring the bed in first.

875
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,950
MUNJEONG: We need someone over here.

876
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,166
MUNJEONG: Moving the bed!

877
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,626
MINGUK: Coming in.

878
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,380
-MINGUK: Sonogram and portable!
-NURSE 1: Yes, Doctor.

879
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,634
Sir, can you hear me?

880
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,177
Open your eyes.

881
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,137
Let's intubate.

882
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,682
Master Kim.
(exhales)

883
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:58,816
SEONUNG: Dr. Cha.

884
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,275
Can you help with this patient?

885
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,652
Okay, coming.

886
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,201
Mr. Heo. What happened?

887
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,704
Why did my staff go down
to that dangerous place?

888
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,875
And why won't either of them
answer their phones right now?

889
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,044
MR. HEO: The thing is, Master Kim…

890
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,838
I came down with them.

891
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,256
It's me, Master Kim.

892
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,674
MR. HEO: One second.

893
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:24,758
(sighs)

894
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,677
Hey, Seo Woojin.

895
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,681
You idiot. What are you doing down there?

896
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,475
Why would you go down there?

897
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,644
Don't you know that

898
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,063
the safety of the medical staff
takes priority on the scene?

899
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,481
There was a patient.

900
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,150
WOOJIN: He's a teacher who was hurt
while trying to save kids.

901
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,151
What?

902
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:46,029
His leg is pinned under rubble
and can't move.

903
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,908
WOOJIN: He's bleeding a lot
in his abdomen, so even with ultrasound,

904
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,869
I can't see his organs very well.

905
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,911
(exhales)

906
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,831
WOOJIN: His spleen seems
to have completely ruptured.

907
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,918
His liver looks to be damaged too.

908
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,129
We're hydrating him via IV right now.

909
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,922
How are his vitals?

910
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,883
It's 80/40, 121.

911
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,217
How are his legs?

912
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,267
I think his sensory function
is deteriorating.

913
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,227
But I still feel
his dorsalis pedis artery.

914
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,646
SABU: So what's your plan?

915
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,024
You must've gone down
with some kind of plan.

916
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,278
I've brought a REBOA kit.

917
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,322
REBOA?

918
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,282
We'll do first aid

919
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,075
and buy some time until rescue.

920
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,244
(sighs)

921
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,040
SABU: Next time, don't run
into danger like you just did, got it?

922
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,751
Other people could have gotten hurt.

923
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,588
You would have done the same, Master Kim.

924
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,924
WOOJIN: Don't worry too much.

925
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,177
I'll do what I can
and call you back, Master Kim.

926
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,094
SABU: Hey.

927
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,305
-Seo Woojin!
-(call ends)

928
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,645
(sighs)

929
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,950
Did Dr. Seo go into
the collapsed building?

930
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,372
I think so.

931
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,337
(exhales shakily)

932
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,048
There are two patients
with chest injuries, Master Kim.

933
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,718
The hemoperitoneum patient
who just came in

934
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,514
is showing extravasation in the lungs.
We'll have to go in and stop the bleeding.

935
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:36,598
What should we do?

936
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,524
You and Director Park
should do a combined surgery

937
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,943
and stop the bleeding.

938
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,155
SABU: I have to do an artery repair
on a knee fracture patient.

939
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,493
And help Dr. Lee
with any future chest injury patients.

940
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,204
Yes, Master Kim.

941
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,607
EUNJAE: The sunlight was
so warm this afternoon.

942
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,901
EUNJAE: I don't know which one is better.

943
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,989
EUNJAE: No, it'll be cute with jeans.

944
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,116
Which pair of jeans do you like?

945
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,703
Okay, show me your walk.

946
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,163
WOOJIN: All right.

947
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,207
Ta-da.

948
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,544
EUNJAE: You and I were excited
to go out for the first time

949
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:48,962
in a while.

950
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,307
EUNJAE: Ms. Joo.

951
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,895
If you get any news about Dr. Seo
during surgery, please let me know.

952
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:10,275
It's not because I'm not worried.
It's been on my mind.

953
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,570
I think I'd be able to focus more
if I hear that he made it out okay.

954
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,740
I'm worried too, Dr. Cha.

955
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,702
I'll let you know as soon as I have news.

956
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,497
EUNJAE: Thank you.

957
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,716
EUNJAE: But before we know it,

958
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,760
we are

959
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,721
standing at the end
of someone's life again.

960
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:41,890
How is the student?

961
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,725
His vitals are holding steady.

962
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,148
WOOJIN (in English): Okay.

963
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,651
(in Korean) Euntak, let's begin.
Needle, please.

964
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,153
EUNTAK: Here.

965
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,618
(soft music)

966
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,455
Guide wire.

967
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:31,731
Long guide wire.

968
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,034
EUNJAE: You're there,

969
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,204
and I'm here.

970
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,125
As always, we will both do our best.

971
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,210
MINGUK: The patient is in bad shape.

972
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,087
We'll have to go after both bleedings

973
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,214
in the hemoperitoneum
and hemothorax at the same time.

974
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,550
Dr. Nam Doil.

975
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,093
DOIL: Yes, you may begin.

976
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,220
MINGUK: Dr. Cha Eunjae.

977
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,847
EUNJAE: Yes, I'm ready.

978
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,265
MINGUK: Scalpel.

979
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,858
EUNJAE: I sincerely hope

980
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,278
that our efforts will end well

981
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,407
and that they won't go to waste.

982
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,371
WOOJIN: Give it here.

983
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,876
Got it.

984
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:49,935
Let's dress the wound.

985
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,154
How are his vitals?

986
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,323
EUNTAK: BP is rising.

987
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,450
It's 100/60.

988
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,535
(exhales)
(in English) Okay.

989
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,371

995

Why won't he answer his phone?

(Sabu groans)

997
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,086

00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,637

Here. Kids.

1009
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,233
You'll be taken out one by one. This way.

1010
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:03,526
Put your foot in.

1011
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,870
Kid, what are you doing there?
You should go.

1012
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,206
I'll leave with my teacher.

1013
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,249
MR. HEO: Pull.

1014
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:20,960
That's it.

1015
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,213
Careful.

1016
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,257
Look up.

1017
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,760
MR. HEO: I'll control it from down here.
Just watch your head.

1018
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:31,930
MR. HEO: Help pull her up.

Why aren't the doctors coming up?

1030
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,023
Dr. Woojin and Nurse Euntak.

1031
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,360
I'm sure they'll come up
after they send up the kids.

1032

GITAE: If they were the kind of people
who wanted to save themselves first,

1033
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,533
they wouldn't have
gone down in the first place.

1034
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:36,077
Seriously, why on earth
did they go down there?

1035
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,079
Are doctors supposed to
be superheroes or something?

1036
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,040
It looks like
everyone is being rescued safely.

1037
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,417
Let's wait a bit longer.

Assemblywoman Ko is alive.

1042
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:55,096
She just called.
It's the assemblywoman. Take the call.

1043
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,724
Is this Assemblywoman Ko?

1044
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,934
It's me, Ko Kyungsook.

1045
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,438
No, I'm okay.

1046

Yes.

It's dark in here now.

1051
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,452

00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,842
a shop owner collapsed on the floor.

1057
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,762
KYUNGSOOK: She looks badly injured.

1058
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:40,391
Ma'am, please put pressure on the wound
with some cloth to stop the bleeding.

1059
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,145
CHIEF: But we're currently rescuing
some students right now.

1060
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,438
Hey!

1061
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,857
What are you saying?
You have to save Assemblywoman Ko first!

1062
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:51,069
She went into the tteokbokki store last.

1063
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,654
Look over there first!

1064
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,531
If we're not careful,
the building could further collapse.

1065
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,241
That's why you need to get her out!

1066
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,619
What if you delay
and something happens to her?

1067
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,079
AIDE: Will you handle the consequences?

1068
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:04,707
Do you want to be sued for negligence?
Is that what you want?

1069
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,294
Assemblywoman Ko.

1070
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:13,049
There are students who've been badly hurt.
We'll wrap up rescuing them first,

1071
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,343
and we'll get you out as soon as we can.

1072
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,637
Can you hang in there a little longer?

1073
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,014
Please hurry.

1074
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,141
(sighs)

1075
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,602
We'll do our best. Hang in there.

1076
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,442
There are more survivors! Hurry up!

1077
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,652
-Hey!
-PARAMEDICS: Yes, sir!

1078
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:33,987
-Go.
-AIDE: Hey!

1079
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,613
(phone vibrates)

1080
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,949
Assemblywoman Ko. Yes, ma'am.

1081
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,244
Don't worry and just hang on.

1082
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:45,039
Yes, I'll call the governor
and handle the situation.

1083
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:48,209
Yes, ma'am. Please hang in there.

1084
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,422
AIDE: Darn it.

1085
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,925

1086
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:57,885
(grunts weakly)

1087
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,690
Kid, you should go up now. It's your turn.

1088
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,028
I said I would go up with my teacher.

1089
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,489
(coughs)

1090
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:21,659
I know how you feel,

1091
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,162
but you can't be stubborn now.

1092
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,415
I swore at him!

1093
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,424
(upbeat pop music)

1094
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:39,218
Guys, get out. It's dangerous.

1095
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,391
-(music cuts off)
-Just hurry up and get out now!

1096
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,435
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

1097
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,312
Can't you see us practicing?

1098
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:52,774
Cheon Soyoung.
Something is wrong with the building.

1099
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,026
Everyone upstairs is evacuating too.
So let's get out first.

1100
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,236
TEACHER: Hurry up. Go.

1101
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,780
Why won't you listen?

1102
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,615
-Hurry up.
-SOYOUNG: Stop nagging already.

1103
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,325
Get out, you jerk!

1104
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:04,077
-Hey.
-(rattling)

1105
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,083
-(glass cracking)
-(rumbling)

1106
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,629
Watch out!

1107
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:23,012
(sniffles)

1108
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,360
Your teacher will be okay.

1109
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,615
WOOJIN: We'll be sure to save him,
so you go on up.

1110
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,119
That way,
we'll be able to focus on helping him.

1111
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,870
(cries)

1112
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,293
That's what you can do for him now.

1113
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,546
Do you understand?

1114
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:17,984
PARAMEDIC 17: Be careful.

1115
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,737
Going down.

1116
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:28,911
We're good.

1117
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,209
It looks a bit tight.

1118
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:41,382
If we just break
that bit of concrete to the right,

1119
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,092
I think we could get him up.

1120
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,304
MR. HEO: I don't know
how much weight this can stand.

1121

01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,719
We'll start the OR and IF now.

around 2 p.m. this afternoon,

1161
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:00,247
there has been an additional collapse.

1162
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:03,668
