Excuse me, sir.

10
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,989
Who are you?

11
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,952
Do you happen
to know a Doldam Hospital here?

12
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,370
Well, of course.

13
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,790
In Jeongseon,
everyone knows Doldam Hospital.

14
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,458
Why are you asking?

15
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,501
Are you sick?

16
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,797
Where's your mother?

17
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,632
I came to see my dad.

18
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,094
My dad is a doctor at Doldam Hospital.

19
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,804
Oh, really?

20
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:21,099
I have a nephew who works there too.

21
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,810
So which doctor is he?

22
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,272
Do you want me to call your dad?

23
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,357
No, you can't do that.

24
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,611
My dad can't know that I came here.

25
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,947
Oh, I see.

26
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,201
Okay, let's see.

27
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,162
If you go over there,

28
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,247
there will be a bus stop.

29
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,960
Take Bus Number 15 or 36 from there.

30
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,671
They'll take you
straight to Doldam Hospital.

31
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,381
(chuckles)

32
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,425
Okay, thank you.

33
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,593
You're welcome.

34
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,100
By the way,
does the doctor called Master Kim

35
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,102
still work at the hospital?

INSU (crying):
I forgot about that patient.

That's why he died.

41
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,421
It's my fault.

42
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:34,964

At the crosswalk

69
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,376
Wait, we didn't receive any calls
about a patient. What's going on?

70
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,050
Oh, I forgot! That way.
The Trauma Center is that way.

71
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,176
No, not that way!

72
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,220
-HYEONJEONG: This way is faster!
-This way, hurry!

73
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,971
-PARAMEDIC 1: Quickly!
-PARAMEDIC 2: Let's go!

74
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,139

-Go quickly!

75
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,307

00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,768

79
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,631
How are the patient's vitals?

80
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,550
PARAMEDIC 1: Vitals are 100/70.
Heart rate 110.

81
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,136
However, her saturation level
is too low. It's only 75%.

82
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,304
Ma'am, can you hear me?

83
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,224
We gave her plenty of oxygen
through a non-rebreather mask,

84
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,767
but her breathing's been odd.

85
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,604
Her lung sounds are abnormal.

86
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,814
Are her lungs injured?

87
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:20,857
I think she has asthma.

88
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,275
Nurse Choi, prepare for an ultrasound

89
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,568
-and page Pulmonology.
-NURSE CHOI: Yes.

90
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,361
-Let's start with intubation.
-Okay.

91
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,737
Have you contacted the guardian?

92
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,365
PARAMEDIC 1: Not yet.
Here's her phone, Doctor.

93
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,996
EUNJAE: Her medical information
is written here.

94
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,290
She has asthma and pulmonary fibrosis.

95
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,167
EUNJAE: She even has
pulmonary hypertension.

96
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,172
INSU: Tube, please.

97
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,048
Take it out.

98
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,843
I'll take a look at her stomach.

99
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:51,971
(Insu sighs)

100
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,140
Her spleen is completely ruptured.

101
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,433
Could you go lower?

102
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,518
INSU: Yes, like that.

103
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,563
Looks like there is bleeding
in the kidney too.

104
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,732
The left side is filled with blood.

105
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,568
Isn't surgery too risky
since she has pulmonary hypertension?

106
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,903
Let's first run some blood tests

107
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,113
and take a look
at her ABG analysis results.

108
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,323
Quickly page Dr. Nam.

109
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,282
Okay.

110
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,459
(whimsical music continues)

111
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,647
CHILD: Gosh, that scared me.

112
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,948
Who are you?

113
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,242
How did you get here?
Are you hurt somewhere?

114
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,120
No, I came to see someone.

115
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,250
Who did you come to see?

116
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,628
Do you happen
to know someone called Master Kim?

117
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,088
What?

118
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,856
(phone vibrates)

119
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,066
What's this?

120
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,819
Hello?

121
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,070
Uncle-in-law?

122
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,321
Yes, it's me.

123
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,658
It's just… The more I think about it,

124
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,286
the more it bothers me.

125
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,579
What is it?

126
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,622
Yes.

127
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,083
Wait, what?

128
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,502
Daughter?

129
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,598
What?

130
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,640
What?

131
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,725
What?

132
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,518
Daughter?

133
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,687
Yes, apparently.

134
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,398
Apparently.

135
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,359
Yes, I'm almost sure of it.

136
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,194
That's ridiculous!

137
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,615
I said the same thing,
that it's complete nonsense.

138
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:20,077
However, all the circumstances
say otherwise.

139
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,496
Her dad is a doctor at Doldam Hospital,

140
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,041
but it's a secret she can't tell.

141
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,418
Plus, she's looking for Master Kim.

142
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,631
Isn't it mysterious and heartrending

143
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,258
like something out of
a narrative structure?

144
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,719
No, Chief Jang.

145
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,304
It can't be, right?

146
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,264
It's definitely not true, Nurse Oh.

147
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,934
I may not know everything,
but I know about his familial relations.

148
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,811
-It's not true.
-(phone vibrates)

149
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,105
It's another patient. Goodness.

150
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,858
I'll be going now.

151
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,528
It's most definitely not true!

152
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,406
(shouts)
See?

153
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,200
What did I say? I told you it's not true.

154
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,661
I wasted my time on this. Gosh.

155
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:08,084
I believe what my uncle-in-law told me.

156
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,002
He may talk a lot,

157
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,129
but he doesn't make things up.

158
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,882
Then…

159
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,135
(Doil groans)

160
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,887
The patient's condition is really bad.

161
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,848
Shouldn't we
at least open her up to stop the bleeding?

162
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,310
Surgery is really risky
for someone with pulmonary hypertension.

163
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,020
Even if it's a success,

164
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,815
there could be a lot
of serious complications afterward.

165
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,733
Most importantly,

166
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,278
we don't know
if she'll make it through the surgery.

167
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,907
Would it really be that hard?

168
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,493
For now, I will open an operating room.

169
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,620
Because despite the risk,

170
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,914
surgery is our only option.

171
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,333
-Let's get ready.
-Okay.

172
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,836
Hold on, everyone.

173
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:57,591
Due to pulmonary hypertension,
this patient is in a state of RV failure.

174
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,844
If the bleeding
causes a reduction in preload,

175
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,304
you won't be able
to maintain pulmonary circulation.

176
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,973
JINMAN: That could result in
not hypervolemia,

177
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,683
but hypoxia,
which you won't be able to control.

178
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,268
JINMAN: Dr. Seo Woojin,

179
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,394
reconsider…

180
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,354
this operation.

181
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:11,856
WOOJIN: Professor Cha.

182
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,945
If we keep a blood transfusion going
while we stop the bleeding,

183
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,572
wouldn't that work?

184
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,699
If we don't do anything,

185
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,411
this patient will die within an hour.

186
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,663
I heard that you have some experience
working with trauma,

187
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,749
so you should know what will happen

188
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,334
as soon as you operate
on someone in that condition.

189
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,463
You won't be able to focus on the bleeding
because of the adhesions,

190
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,298
and she'll die on the table.

191
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,051
Is it really necessary
to operate on a patient

192
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,846
who has less than a 20% chance to live?

193
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,931
A 20% chance to live

194
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,225
is more than enough reason
for me to operate.

195
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,480
I've saved patients with even worse odds.

196
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,857
But in most cases,
it didn't go well, did it?

197
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,528
You've probably received hate
and been sued by the patients' guardians.

198
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,323
You've probably been to the police station

199
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,991
and questioned countless times too.

200
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,075
Even so,

201
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,994
am I supposed to give up on a patient?

202
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,621
Yes, give up.

203
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,039
(tense music)

204
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,960
-What?
-Excuse me, Professor Cha Jinman.

205
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,420
From what I can see, there is…

206
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,302
no hope for this patient.

207
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,181
(sighs)

208
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,477
WOMAN: What do you mean?

209
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,108
What do you mean by "there is no hope"?

210
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,986
Why would there be
no hope for my daughter?

211
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,031
Are you saying

212
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,825
she's going to die?

213
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,327
WOMAN: Well?

214
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,539
(breathes shakily)

215
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,459
SABU: Here.

216
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,797
Drink this. It's barley tea.

217
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:05,177
If you drink that,
it will warm you right up.

218
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,399
But why did you come looking for me?

219
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,485
I have something important
to discuss with you.

220
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,154
What would that be?

221
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,991
But…

222
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,244
are you sure you're Master Kim?

223
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,204
(chuckles)

224
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,124
Well, of course, I am.

225
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,543
See? Look here.

226
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,130
It says, "Master Kim."

227
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,923
Right?

228
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,387
(chuckles)
What is it?

229
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,847
It's just…

230
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,685
you look a lot different
from what I imagined.

231
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,979
What do you mean by different?

232
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,772
It's just…

233
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,609
I don't know.

234
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,776
(laughs softly)

235
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,861
(playful music)

236
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,575
(whispering)
See that? A dad's smile.

237
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,161
Are you sure it's a dad's smile?

238
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,245
Yes, of course.

239
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,498
There's so much affection in his gaze.

240
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,339
What do we do? Do you think he saw us?

241
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,258
We were a little faster. Don't worry.

242
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,551
Okay.

243
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,726
What are you two doing here?

244
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,187
My shoelaces were untied, so…

245
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,320
(phone vibrates)

246
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,115
Hello, Eunjae.

247
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,912
-That seemed natural, right?
-Yes.

248
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,830
He didn't notice
that there were no shoelaces.

249
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,374
(in English)
Okay.

250
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,005
(in Korean)
Hi.

251
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,345
Master Kim, I think you should
come over here right now.

252
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,180
Why? Did something happen?

253
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,515
It's just…

254
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,059
An emergency patient can't
get into an operating room.

255
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,145
Is Seo Woojin not there?

256
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,106
He's here, but…

257
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,691
(sighs)

258
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,110
Professor Cha
isn't allowing him to operate.

259
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,319
What?

260
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,780
(tense music)

261
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,158
Please tell me.

262
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,036
What about my daughter?

263
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,747
WOMAN (voice breaking):
What's wrong with her?

264
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,210
Is something bad going to happen to her?

265
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,171
There's severe bleeding
in the abdominal cavity,

266
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,339
but if we operate--

267
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,174
JINMAN: Yes.

268
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,136
The patient is in a very bad condition.

269
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,348
JINMAN: There's a lot of bleeding
in the abdomen so we need to operate.

270
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,309
However, your daughter
has pulmonary hypertension,

271
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,353
so even operating will be difficult.

272
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,731
-Professor Cha--
-It's unfortunate,

273
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,608
but there isn't much we can do
in her current condition.

274
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,902
JINMAN: The operation
will be meaningless as well.

275
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,447
(cries)

276
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,201
HEAD OF TRAUMA CENTER, CHA JINMAN

277
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,911
WOOJIN: But if you insist,

278
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,540
-I'll do my best and operate--
-JINMAN: Dr. Seo Woojin.

279
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,459
There are many risks,

280
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,752
but there's still a chance, so…

281
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,295
Professor Cha Jinman?

282
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,093
Are you Professor Cha Jinman

283
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,679
of Hanguk University's
Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery?

284
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,306
Yes, that's right.

285
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,974
(breathes shakily)

286
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,145
Oh!

287
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,521
(all gasp)

288
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,315
WOMAN: Why are you here?

289
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,608
"There is no hope"?

290
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,320
How dare you say something like that
to my daughter again?

291
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,198
WOOJIN: Ma'am, please.
You can't do this here.

292
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,825
Get away from my daughter immediately!

293
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,870
You terrible doctor!

294
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,581
You demonic man!

295
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,084
WOMAN (crying): This is all your fault!

296
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,252
Because of you,

297
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:11,340
my daughter
didn't get proper treatment on time

298
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,717
and never got compensated either.

299
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,513
You made my daughter like this.

300
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,598
Do you know that?

301
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,226
(yells)
Do you?

302
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,520
(wails loudly)

303
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,821
WOOJIN: Ma'am, please calm down.

304
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,948
(woman continues crying)

305
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,534
(machines beep frantically)

306
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,914
Doctor,
the patient's saturation level is falling!

307
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,290
Come on, Dr. Seo Woojin.

308
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,334
-Dr. Jung.
-Yes.

309
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,462
(crying)
Yurim.

310
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,674
Yurim.

311
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,718
What are you doing?
Take the guardian outside.

312
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,345
(tense music)

313
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,859
Woojin.

314
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,111
-How is she?
-Nurse Joo.

315
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,864
WOOJIN: The patient has asthma.

316
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,408
And due to pulmonary fibrosis
and pulmonary hypertension,

317
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,285
she's practically
in a state of RV failure.

318
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,205
There's severe hemorrhaging in the abdomen
and her spleen is completely ruptured.

319
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,001
DOIL: With her medical history,
we don't know how much adhesion there is,

320
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,002
so it'll be dangerous.

321
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,837
Master Kim…

322
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,511
SABU: Ma'am.

323
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,016
We will try to save Yurim.

324
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,019
Can she live?

325
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,230
You may have heard this already,

326
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,066
but she's in a very bad condition.

327
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,612
(cries)

328
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,073
It will be hard to access
the bleeding areas due to adhesion,

329
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,284
and because of her underlying disease,

330
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,287
she may not make it through the surgery.

331
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,955
(sobs)

332
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,332
SABU: Even after surgery,

333
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,417
there could be respiratory failure.

334
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,003
We can temporarily
keep her alive with ECMO,

335
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,507
but besides a lung transplant,
there may not be any other options.

336
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,635
(cries)

337
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,348
However, ma'am,

338
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,851
we should
still do everything we can, right?

339
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,811
Yurim…

340
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,941
SABU: She did her best to get this far.

341
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,362
Right?

342
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,989
(sobs)

343
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,121
Please save her.

344
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,876
Please save Yurim, Doctor.

345
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,131
YURIM'S MOM: Please save my daughter.

346
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,551
Okay, let's give it a shot.

347
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,430
All right.

348
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,141
Ma'am, you need
to sign the consent form first.

349
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,351
INSU: This way.

350
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,063
(continues crying)

351
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,117
SABU: Let's go, Doil.

352
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,286
Okay, I'll open up a room.

353
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,537
We'll move the patient.

354
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,290
SABU: Eunjae, put in a call to KONOS.

355
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,335
Tell them she's been waiting two years
for a lung transplant and it's urgent.

356
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,629
Even if we stop the bleeding,

357
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,882
if she doesn't get a lung transplant,
she won't make it past a week.

358
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,259
Yes, Master Kim.

359
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,677
Mm.

360
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,977
What are you doing?

361
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,856
How is this a trauma center
when everything moves so slowly?

362
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,860
I gave you the fast lane,
so why do you keep hitting the brakes?

363
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,197
Don't you know that every second counts
when it comes to a severe trauma case?

364
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,824
It's not because I don't know that!

365
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,785
It's because the patient
can't be operated on.

366
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,622
You're operating on a patient
with an obvious outcome.

367
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,874
What are you trying to do?

368
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,295
(yelling) Do you only see the patient,
and not the doctor?

369
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:24,593
Just how many doctors
did you screw over like this?

370
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,054
JINMAN: Last year's records alone

371
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,349
show 20 cases of Doldam Hospital's doctors
called in for investigation.

372
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,352
And 11 of those cases were Dr. Seo's.

373
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,811
JINMAN: But you.

374
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,646
You said he's your most cherished pupil

375
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,775
so why do you keep
making him perform ridiculous operations?

376
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,194
JINMAN: Why do you keep

377
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,323
putting that kind of risk
on the doctors? Just why?

378
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,665
Because that's

379
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,419
a doctor's job.

380
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,011
He's doing what a doctor should.

381
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,806
Should there be another reason?

382
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,848
(scoffs)

383
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,352
(sighs)
You're a lunatic.

384
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,521
(upbeat music)

385
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,235
Let's move the patient.

386
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,168
Yes, we're currently
moving the patient to the OR,

387
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,712
but the patient won't be able
to make it past a week.

388
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,133
That's why you, Bu Yongju,

389
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,302
even with your skills

390
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:54,641
will forever be known
as a third-rate doctor.

391
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,393
Do you know that?

392
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,730
Is that so?

393
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,485
Then so be it.

394
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:06,945
You lunatic.

395
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,116
SABU: By the way,

396
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,035
did you know...

397
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,915
that the patient on her way
to the OR, Bae Yurim,

398
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,461
is a humidifier victim?

399
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,341
She came to me as a patient two years ago,

400
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,429
but she started
being sick over 12 years ago.

401
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,142
She was only eight years old then.

402
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,148
She endured 12 years

403
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:46,026
without being able to breathe properly.

404
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,736
(sighs)

405
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,905
Can you even imagine

406
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,616
the pain she went through?

407
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,664
Even if I am a third-rate doctor,

408
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,001
if I can do anything to help,

409
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,631
I'm willing to do my best.

410
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,051
Got it?

411
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:28,902
(sighs)

412
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,912
EUNJAE: Put this against your head.

413
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,875
(sighs)
Just what happened?

414
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,382
Are you not going to tell me?

415
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,761
(sighs)

416
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,181
Around 12 years ago,

417
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,184
there was a compensation lawsuit

418
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,813
for an issue with a humidifier.

419
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,192
The court asked me
to issue a written opinion.

420
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,573
So the patient
in the lawsuit was Bae Yurim?

421
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,076
I could not clearly establish
whether the cause of her asthma

422
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,497
was because of an underlying disease
or a humidifier.

423
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,042
I wrote and submitted my opinion

424
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,337
according to my conscience
and medical views.

425
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,592
And this time, you were against
that patient's emergency surgery?

426
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,181
Do you know when I feel most disillusioned
with my job as a doctor?

427
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,517
It's when I have to deal with

428
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,770
impersonal individuals like them.

429
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,900
They have little to no courtesy
or respect for human beings.

430
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,072
They question and criticize the opinions
of experts however they want.

431
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,533
They endlessly tear others down,

432
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,121
turning their achievements
and dignity into their shame overnight.

433
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,789
They mock and condemn them

434
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,250
and call it justice.

435
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,252
(sighs)

436
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,671
I've had it up to here

437
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,758
with those kinds of people.

438
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,677
I'm also sick and tired

439
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,056
of that punk, Bu Yongju,
who defends those kinds of people.

440
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:28,229
Master Kim spends every moment
trying to do his best for his patients.

441
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:33,318
He helped me find pride
in being a doctor too.

442
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,865
The world doesn't care
about something like your pride, Eunjae.

443
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,533
JINMAN: Understand?

444
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,577
(door opens)

445
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,538
Dr. Cha, could you come out for a moment?

446
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,500
Let's talk later, Dad.

447
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,296
POLICE: Hello.

448
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,383
We have additional information

449
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,843
regarding Bae Yurim's accident.

450
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,477
WOOJIN: Since there was a lot of delay,
I'll try to stop the bleeding first.

451
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,312
SABU: Don't rush. Do as you always have,

452
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,189
at your own pace. Okay?

453
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,483
WOOJIN: Scalpel.

454
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,318
(tense music)

455
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,536
WOOJIN: Metz.

456
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,376
WOOJIN: Give me a lot of gauze, please.

457
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,628
More.

458
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,050
Dr. Nam,
will the patient be able to hold on?

459
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,345
DOIL: Just focus on the operation,
I'll try to keep her stable.

460
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,099
Add five units of packed RBC and FFP each.

461
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,809
-NURSE: Okay.
-DOIL: I'm starting the RIS.

462
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,145
SABU: All right.

463
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,022
-Three.
-Two.

464
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,607
-One.
-AREUM: Done!

465
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,950
Ah!

466
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,786
This is the best time to eat this.

467
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,289
Is this a Friday tradition
at Doldam Hospital as well?

468
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,207
No, it's not a tradition.

469
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,626
It just tastes the best at this hour.

470
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,588
You get hungry
right after the first wave of patients.

471
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,839
First wave?

472
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,050
So is there a second wave?

473
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:25,013
Well, on some days,
there's a third wave or a fourth wave too.

474
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,474
Doesn't that make you tired?

475
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,978
Of course, it does.
I'm always exhausted and past my limits.

476
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:35,565
Oh, I couldn't tell.
You're always smiling.

477
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:40,028
Well, it's very exhausting
but I'm also very proud.

478
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,280
I, Yoon Areum,

479
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,657
am a boring and insignificant person,

480
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,576
but as Dr. Yoon Areum,

481
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,537
I'm a pretty decent person.

482
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,581
I feel like I'm helping someone too.

483
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,542
You have a great mindset.

484
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,879
I think I know that feeling.

485
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,757
I came to Doldam
so I could know that feeling too.

486
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,135
That's my Dr. Ung.
You know what I'm talking about.

487
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,221
-(in English) Cheers.
-(in English) Cheers.

488
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,765
(in Korean) "Dr. Ung?" What is that?

489
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,683
It's a nickname Dr. Cha made for him.

490
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,019
Everyone here calls him Dr. Ung.

491
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,688
What about me? Do I have one?

492
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,690
Should I make you one?

493
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,276
Hmm…

494
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,486
How about "Dr. Dong"?

495
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,239
Well, that's…

496
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,281
Ah…

497
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,033
Isn't that a little dangerous though?

498
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,829
If you don't say it carefully,
it can sound like Dr. Dung…

499
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,249
Then he'll be Dr. Dung.

500
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,166
Hey!

501
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,709
(phone vibrates)

502
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,213
Oh, I'll be leaving first,
so enjoy the rest of your meal.

503
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,554
(door closes)

504
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,599
SEONUNG: She said she had a boyfriend.

505
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,226
DONGHWA: What?

506
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,854
Dr. Yoon Areum.

507
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,606
She has a boyfriend
she's been dating for about three years.

508
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,860
How do you know this?

509
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,695
By coincidence.

510
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:05,864
I overheard it.

511
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,578
Dang it.

512
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,997
PATIENT: It hurts.

513
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,966
(groans)

514
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,552
Mix five doses of dextrose-saline
with two doses of thiamine.

515
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,596
-A brain CT too.
-Yes, Doctor.

516
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,681
Where is Nurse Eom?

517
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,057
She's on her 10-minute break.

518
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,392
I see.

519
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,103
Have you taken a break, Dr. Areum?

520
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,146
(gasps)

521
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,273
You won't believe this.
I went to take a break,

522
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,610
but I ended up giving ultrasound lessons
to Dr. Ung and Dr. Dong.

523
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,945
I see.

524
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:51,075
The two of them were practicing
with the ultrasound in the dark.

525
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,786
AREUM: It was so funny.

526
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,955
You should have seen them, Nurse Euntak.

527
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,042
-I don't really want to.
-AREUM: Why not?

528
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,838
(Donghwa clears throat)

529
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,175
What about the patient?

530
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,928
We're taking him to get a brain CT.

531
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,013
I see.

532
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,184
Oh! What's with your hand?

533
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,687
My hand? What about it?

534
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,648
No, the other hand.

535
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,442
There's nothing here either.

536
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,781
-Right. There really isn't anything.
-What?

537
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,284
I heard that you had a boyfriend
you've been dating for three years.

538
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,246
DONGHWA: But you don't seem to have
a couple's ring

539
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,207
and there are no signs
of you having worn a ring.

540
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,459
That must mean
it's not that serious, right?

541
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,009
-What?
-(chuckles softly)

542
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,015
(door opens)

543
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,435
Oh! What are you all doing out here?
Did a patient come in?

544
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,026
WOMAN 2: Doctor, over here!

545
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,029
-Please take a look at my husband!
-Nurse Eom.

546
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,115
This way, please!

547
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,741
PATIENT 2: Oh, my stomach!

548
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,953
AREUM: Sir.

549
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,038
I'll take the patient to get a CT.

550
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,970
Young man. Can you examine me?

551
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,680
(woman 3 belches)

552
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,557
(burps)

553
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,310
Okay.

554
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,690
(whimsical music)

555
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,368
(approaching footsteps)

556
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,845
NURSE KOO

557
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,848
(gasps)

558
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,518
GITAE: They look similar.

559
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,312
Really similar.

560
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,606
There's no doubt about it.

561
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,566
That little kid and Master Kim?

562
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,611
No, not Master Kim.

563
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,616
Those friendly eyes and sharp nose…

564
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,619
(yells)

565
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,497
I'm certain she looks like someone.

566
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,749
But I can't remember whom.

567
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,378
MUNJEONG: She's asking you to call back.

568
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,214
Who, me?

569
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,591
Your wife called me just now,

570
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,761
and she said
you wouldn't pick up the phone.

571
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,680
I was busy. That's why I didn't pick up.

572
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:03,184
Well, it's not that.
You should call her back.

573
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,644
I think it's about Byeol.

574
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,562
What about Byeol?

575
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,064
Is she sick?

576
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,359
She hasn't been able to contact Byeol
since this afternoon.

577
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,194
What?

578
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,826
Do you want to eat this?

579
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,329
How come whenever adults see little kids,

580
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,748
they always try to give them
something to eat?

581
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,544
Especially sweets
like candies, jelly, and chocolate?

582
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,380
They're the things that make moms mad
if you eat them.

583
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,674
So you don't want the lollipop?

584
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,099
By the way, this hospital is really big.

585
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,810
Right. Especially
since the Trauma Center was built,

586
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,270
this place became even bigger.

587
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,064
You'll keep this a secret
from my dad, right?

588
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:54,735
Don't worry. I'm good at keeping secrets.

589
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,195
(Mr. Koo laughs)

590
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,281
INSU: What are you saying?

591
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,407
Where is Byeol?

592
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:07,290
You're supposed to look after the kid.
You had one job!

593
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,667
You don't even know when she disappeared

594
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,335
or where she went.

595
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,004
Do you think that makes sense?

596
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,423
What did you say?

597
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,050
Hey.

598
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,054
Besides living expenses,
all the money I make goes home.

599
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,308
Why is nothing ever enough for you?

600
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,810
What else do you want from me?

601
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,521
I'm lonely too.

602
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,026
I'm worn out too, honey.

603
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,155
You're not the only one
having a hard time, all right?

604
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,117
Forget it.

605
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,078
I don't want to fight with you.

606
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,666
I'm tired of it.

607
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:57,048
Let's just stop! I'll look for Byeol here.

608
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,346
(sighs deeply)

609
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,141
(Insu sniffles)

610
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,810
(cries)

611
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,834
(tense music)

612
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,841
WOOJIN: Taking out the spleen.

613
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,974
WOOJIN: Suture, please.

614
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,320
-WOOJIN: Cut.
-SABU: Cut.

615
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,201
WOOJIN: I'll be moving on to the SMV.

616
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,120
-SABU: Doil?
-DOIL: Yes.

617
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,163
She's holding on well.

618
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,415
I'm doing my best too.

619
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,084
WOOJIN: Clamp.

620
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,504
Suture, please.

621
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,507
(Woojin grunts)

622
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,721
MYEONGSIM: Dr. Seo, are you okay?

623
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,683
WOOJIN: I'm sorry.
I'll go change my gloves real quick.

624
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,019
SABU: Suture, please.

625
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,992
-SABU: Cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

626
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,202
SABU: Irrigation.

627
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,414
WOOJIN: Give it to me, please.

628
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,420
WOOJIN: Richardson retractor.

629
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,385
There seems to only be a hematoma
in the retroperitoneum

630
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,637
and no active bleeding.

631
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,265
SABU: Okay. Let's finish up.

632
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,683
WOOJIN: We'll start closing up now.

633
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:30,242
What do mean my daughter
tried to commit suicide?

634
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:34,288
According to the driver, Ms. Bae Yurim
was standing in the middle of the road

635
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,707
even though the walk signal wasn't on.

636
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,418
POLICE: Even when there was a car coming,

637
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,253
she didn't try to move out of the way,

638
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,339
like she was standing there on purpose.

639
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,759
It also seems that way from the footage
on the driver's dashcam.

640
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,054
That's ridiculous.

641
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,349
Why would my daughter--

642
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,350
POLICE: By any chance,

643
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,187
did she have depression?

644
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,816
While investigating,

645
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,069
we found this

646
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,114
on her social media account.

647
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,076
BAE_YURIM_

648
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:18,207
#SENDING #CONDOLENCES #TO_MYSELF

649
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,961
What do you mean it wasn't an accident?

650
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,506
They say she walked into the road herself.

651
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,341
It looks like

652
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,010
she was trying to commit suicide.

653
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:34,932
(sighs)

654
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,313
I heard about Bae Yurim.

655
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,609
If it comes out
that she really did try to commit suicide,

656
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,530
she won't be able
to receive a lung transplant.

657
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,743
One of KONOS' principles is

658
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,788
to not give transplants
to patients with suicide risks.

659
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,252
JINMAN: Do you know what that means?

660
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,922
It means that the emergency surgery
you risked performing

661
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,591
was for nothing.

662
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:12,887
Now the patient's family

663
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,308
will receive a huge surgery bill

664
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,560
and the patient won't even survive a week

665
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,313
and die.

666
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,863
When your moments of hope go awry,

667
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,408
only this

668
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,536
harsh reality remains.

669
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,830
JINMAN: Do you know that?

670
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,064
Hello?

671
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,234
This is Byeol's father
who just made a report.

672
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,487
Have you still not heard anything?

673
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,950
No. Right now,
I'm on duty at the hospital…

674
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,201
(breathes shakily)

675
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,121
(voice breaking)
I'm on duty right now,

676
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,500
so please find her quickly.

677
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,380
She's only nine years old.

678
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,508
It's late at night and cold out.

679
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,594
I beg you, please.

680
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,349
Okay, thank you. Bye.

681
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:43,894
(sighs)

682
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,773
MR. KOO: Dr. Jung Insu.

683
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:01,203
CONSULTATION ROOM 2

684
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,248
Master Kim.

685
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,591
(inhales)

686
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,470
(whimpers)

687
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,933
SABU: Hey, Insu. Let her sleep.

688
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:29,648
It seems like
she went on a great adventure today.

689
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,449
-I'm sorry, Master Kim.
-What?

690
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,494
It seems she suddenly
wanted to see her dad.

691
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:46,373
She only left a note for her mom
and ran away from home.

692
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,586
INSU: Since she's only nine years old,

693
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,255
I doubted she would come here by herself.

694
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,214
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,716
(Insu sniffles)

696
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,345
Insu, are you…

697
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,515
estranged from your wife?

698
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,852
(soft music)

699
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,191
Do you know what "estranged" is?

700
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,946
"Estranged" is just "estranged."

701
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,282
Why?

702
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:26,872
My mom and dad
have been estranged for a year now.

703
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,670
They're not divorced,
but it's pretty similar.

704
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,839
I see.

705
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,051
Mom said it was
because of you, Master Kim.

706
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,222
She said you're holding on to him
and wouldn't let him go,

707
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,849
so he couldn't leave this place.

708
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,355
So if I'm being honest…

709
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,109
I came here to ask you to let him go, but…

710
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,028
But?

711
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,279
(sighs)

712
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:03,742
I think my mom and dad
just don't get along.

713
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,954
I heard them fighting earlier.

714
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,790
BYEOL: Even at my age,

715
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,501
I don't yell and fight like they do.

716
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,045
Gosh…

717
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,674
(sighs)

718
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:24,346
Why didn't you tell me?

719
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,183
I'm embarrassed.

720
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,854
It's not something
you should be worrying about.

721
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:35,858
I'm sorry.

722
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,569
No, it's okay.

723
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,782
Stay with Byeol for a bit.

724
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,744
I'm going to go take a walk, okay?

725
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,282
(sniffles)

726
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,797
(somber music)

727
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,089
JINMAN: Just how many doctors

728
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,009
did you screw over like this?

729
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,302
It's my fault.

730
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,970
I will…

731
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,974
I will take full responsibility.

732
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:55,562
My mom and dad
have been estranged for a year now.

733
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,618
Do you only see the patient,
and not the doctor?

734
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,245
(Woojin grunts)

735
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,169
(sighs)

736
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,358
All right, sir, please show me your butt.

737
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,110
WOOJIN: What?

738
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,946
Okay, fine. Give me your arm then.

739
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,999
And they say
even monkeys fall from trees sometimes.

740
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:01,003
The surgery genius
stabbed his own finger during surgery.

741
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,046
EUNJAE: Hold it down, please.

742
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,469
How come you haven't gotten
better at giving shots?

743
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:13,098
As if. I have many years
of experience giving shots.

744
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,270
Anyway, it does seem a little futile

745
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,815
if she can't get a lung transplant.

746
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,984
Because I worked really hard.

747
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,195
We don't know that yet.
It's not conclusive yet.

748
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,699
Which finger was stabbed with the needle?

749
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,458
It's fine that you work hard,
but please don't hurt yourself.

750
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,920
Your blood is my blood

751
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:46,006
and your delicate bones are also mine.

752
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,799
-(snorts)
-EUNJAE: Okay?

753
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,843
Are you going home now?

754
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,847
Yes, since my strict father
is staying with me.

755
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,308
I'll see you tomorrow.

756
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:57,976
Okay.

757
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,020
(soft music)

758
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:07,819
(laughs softly)

759
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:12,950
WJ, EJ

760
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,243
(soft music continues)

761
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:10,257
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

762
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,094
Master Kim.

763
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:19,224
WOOJIN: Master Kim?

764
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,600
Oh, hey.

765
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,354
What is it? Why aren't you going home?

766
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,648
I'm staying here for the time being.

767
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,114
(grunts)
Did you dress the wound properly?

768
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,284
-Yes, you don't have to worry about that.
-Mm.

769
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,661
The patient's viral markers
came back negative as well.

770
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,581
What happened earlier?

771
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,375
You've never made such mistakes before.

772
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,501
(laughs softly)

773
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,504
I think it's because I was anxious.

774
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,340
I wanted to reduce
the surgery time somehow,

775
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,968
so as to lessen the strain on the patient.

776
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:57,679
Also,

777
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,432
I wanted to show Professor Cha Jinman

778
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,185
that I could save the patient.

779
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,186
(chuckles)

780
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:08,398
Well, you're not the type of person
to perform an operation just to show off.

781
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,357
(laughs softly)

782
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,735
See?

783
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,238
I told you.
You're the only one who knows me best.

784
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,281
(chuckles)

785
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,996
For the time being, we'll keep
the Trauma Center in a dispatch format.

786
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,499
Whenever you need urgent trauma surgery,

787
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:28,085
I'll go over and conduct it.

788
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,256
However, I won't
be changing my affiliation.

789
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,051
At least let me decide that for myself.

790
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,512
WOOJIN: And please stop

791
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,430
making a Plan B for everything.

792
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,350
-(laughs)
-WOOJIN: You'll put me in a tough spot.

793
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,976
(laughs)

794
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,813
Okay, I won't.

795
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,025
All right. Keep up the good work.

796
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,611
Okay.

797
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,638
(exhales)

798
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,475
SOONYOUNG'S RESTAURANT
BREAKFAST AVAILABLE

799
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,062
Woojin, you're here.

800
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,398
Yes, I'm hungry. Please give me some food.

801
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,816
SOONYOUNG'S MOM: Okay, take a seat.

802
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:36,194
What about Eunjae?
I haven't seen her around lately.

803
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,364
Her father is here from Seoul,
so she's been busy.

804
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,532
I see.

805
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,953
So are you making a formal introduction?

806
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,538
-(coughs)
-And choosing a wedding date?

807
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:49,791
Hey, if you need
a stand-in mom, let me know.

808
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:53,420
I'll get my hair done at the nearby salon,

809
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,797
wear my best clothes,

810
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:59,176
and be your stand-in mom, okay?

811
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,927
Okay, please do.

812
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,345
I'll bring your food out soon.

813
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,638
WOOJIN: Okay.

814
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,856
(whimsical music)

815
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,775
Woojin, are you

816
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,152
getting married?

817
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,655
Woojin, are you getting married?

818
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,241
Well, I…

819
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,080
EUNJAE: Dad,

820
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,166
have you heard from real estate yet?

821
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,793
Yes, there are a few houses,

822
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,795
but they're a little far from here.

823
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,672
Oh, I see.

824
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:39,591
Why?

825
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,678
Is your roommate complaining?
Asking me to leave faster?

826
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,138
No, that's not it.

827
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:49,476
My roommate says it's okay,
but I just feel bad.

828
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:51,895
About Seo Woojin…

829
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,563
Seo Woojin?

830
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,565
What about Seo Woojin?

831
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,485
Pick a day next week

832
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,403
so we can eat together.

833
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,576
JINMAN: I'll do the dishes,
so just leave them.

834
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,541
I disapprove.

835
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,627
You see,

836
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,755
marriage isn't something you do just
because you have feelings for them.

837
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:22,050
INSU: When you have feelings for someone,
the furthest you should go is dating.

838
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,261
Marriage

839
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:28,056
is like one of the pillars
in the multi-universe of chaos.

840
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,977
Why are you trying so hard
to go into that chaotic universe?

841
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,980
Just live comfortably by yourself.

842
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,358
Dad, you know I can hear you, right?

843
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,778
Of course, there is an upside to marriage.

844
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,989
Like having a beautiful daughter like her.

845
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,615
Having Byeol

846
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,868
was my greatest accomplishment in life.

847
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,328
However,

848
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,746
you…

849
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,040
You need to think
about this more carefully.

850
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,335
And who's going to be your father-in-law?
Professor Cha Jinman?

851
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:58,878
Seriously?

852
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:00,755
Are you crazy?

853
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,008
Should I tell Eunjae
what you said just now?

854
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,050
Hey!

855
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,305
Why tell her something
that was said between two men?

856
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,556
But I'm not a man.

857
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,349
Of course.

858
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,560
You're a girl, Byeol.

859
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,145
You're a child.

860
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,397
INSU: And my daughter, right?

861
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,859
I want to get married if Eunjae wants to.

862
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,027
Here.

863
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,072
I want to have
a pretty daughter like Byeol too.

864
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,408
WOOJIN: And exercise with her
in the mornings too.

865
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,784
(snorts loudly)

866
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:30,910
INSU: What?

867
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,956
In your dreams.
Just waking up every morning

868
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,334
to send your kid off
to kindergarten is a war.

869
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,003
It's such a hassle.

870
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,421
Dad!

871
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,632
Of course, it's not like that anymore,

872
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,426
right?

873
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,015
By the way,
was that lady's surgery a success?

874
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,517
-Who?
-Ms. Bae Yurim.

875
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,771
The one who got into an accident
in front of the terminal yesterday.

876
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,232
Byeol, how do you know about her?

877
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,984
I witnessed the whole thing.

878
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,279
I called 911 too.

879
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:10,950
I even took the ambulance
with her to Doldam Hospital.

880
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,160
What?

881
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:16,039
But how did you know
her name was Bae Yurim?

882
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:19,209
She told me in the ambulance.

883
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,800
(crosswalk beeping)

884
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,274
(grunts)

885
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,487
(Yurim chokes)

886
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,909
Be careful, miss!

887
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,245
-(chokes)
-BYEOL: Be careful!

888
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,330
It's dangerous!

889
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,332
A car is coming!

890
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,421
YURIM: I should have waited.

891
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,258
I should have crossed at the next light.

892
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,222
I knew I would only be able
to take a few steps

893
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,851
before getting winded.

894
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,312
Why did I do it?

895
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,358
(exhales)

896
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,155
So…

897
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,949
what happens now?

898
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,494
Can Yurim get a transplant now?

899
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,706
Yes. I believe so, ma'am.

900
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,166
(sighs in relief)

901
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:44,627
The little girl who witnessed
what happened and called 911

902
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,463
testified to it all.

903
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:50,091
SABU: The paramedics who were
in the ambulance also gave statements

904
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,801
about everything that they heard.

905
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,094
(exhales)

906
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,185
(Yurim's mom cries)

907
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,690
(light, hopeful music)

908
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,775
(laughs softly)

909
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,209
When you get to Seoul,

910
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,461
Mom will be waiting for you.

911
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,297
I'll be in big trouble, right?

912
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,926
Well, of course.
You ran away without saying anything.

913
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,262
Can I come again next time?

914
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,765
With your mom's permission.

915
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,896
I wish I lived with you.

916
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,690
BYEOL: But…

917
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,652
I think you're really cool
for working here.

918
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,199
(laughs emotionally)

919
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,911
Thank you, Byeol.

920
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,247
BYEOL: But…

921
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,959
Woojin is a little cooler.

922
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,045
-What?
-(playful music)

923
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,255
Hurry up and go.

924
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,798
The bus is leaving soon.

925
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,225
I love you, Dad!

926
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:24,644
I…

927
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,397
I love you too.

928
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,152
(mouthing silently)
See you next time.

929
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,384
I'm against this surgery.

930
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,472
What exactly are you against?

931
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:05,018
We already got KONOS' approval for it.

932
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:08,104
I do not wish
for Master Kim to perform it.

933
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,356
But what do you mean by that?

934
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:12,692
The patient is under Master Kim's care,

935
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,987
so if not him,
then who can perform this surgery?

936
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,281
Professor Cha Jinman.

937
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,242
-What?
-Cha Jinman?

938
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,669
Why should I

939
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,005
perform that surgery?

940
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,258
MINGUK: You want the Trauma Center,
don't you?

941
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,428
If you want it that badly,
you need to earn the staff's favor.

942
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,182
And in order to do that,
you need to perform this surgery.

943
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,725
Are you

944
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,812
asking me to put
on a performance, Director Park?

945
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,774
If you believe that will shift the tides,

946
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,151
then you must.

947
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,335
(phone vibrates)

948
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:23,388
What are you going to do?

949
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,391
Do you want to perform this surgery?

950
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,477
What's the real reason for you doing this?

951
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,646
As you said, I only know one thing.

952
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,692
So in one person's eyes, I seem reckless.

953
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,027
In another's, I seem dangerous.

954
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:41,948
And in someone else's,
I may seem like a lunatic.

955
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,242
SABU: But I

956
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,119
was okay with that.

957
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,037
I didn't care.

958
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,333
SABU: However…

959
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,087
(Sabu sighs)

960
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,134
…now I'm not sure

961
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,179
if it's okay with the others.

962
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,645
So show me.

963
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:16,774
How you would do it,
what solution you have in mind.

964
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:22,864
First, help Yurim get her life back,
the one that stopped 12 years ago.

965
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,658
Then, your time here

966
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,120
will begin anew.

967
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,432
MYEONGSIM: Did you know?

968
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,351
I don't like the way
you conduct your business at all,

969
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,228
Professor Park Minguk.

970
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,522
Did you know, Nurse Oh?

971
01:02:56,981 --> 01:03:00,485
For the last three years,
you've never called me Director.

972
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,403
(chuckles)
I guess I haven't.

973
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:06,282
You have the title
of Doldam Hospital's Director,

974
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,785
but I suppose it can't be helped
that I'm still wary of you.

975
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:12,330
I hope you get over it soon.

976
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:16,584
I don't really feel the need
to put in the effort to.

977
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,674
SABU: Please don't worry too much, ma'am.

978
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:27,470
Professor Cha Jinman performs
lung surgeries very well.

979
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,390
He has much more experience
than me in that field as well.

980
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:40,900
That man

981
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,028
never said he was sorry.

982
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,406
I still don't believe

983
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,284
what I did was wrong.

984
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,620
All I did 12 years ago

985
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,957
was my opinion as a doctor,

986
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,418
and my thoughts on the matter
still haven't changed.

987
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,130
JINMAN: I never sided with anyone

988
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:06,175
and did not make it personal.

989
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,680
Your daughter's surgery today
will also be that way.

990
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:15,476
As a doctor, I will do the best that I can

991
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,104
without any prejudice

992
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:21,148
or personal feelings.

993
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,486
You can count on that.

994
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,697
(sobs)

995
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,161
Please take care of her.

996
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,540
YURIM'S MOM: I was furious
but there was nothing else I could do

997
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,335
because saving my daughter comes first.

998
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:42,712
(cries)

999
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,844
EUNJAE (sighing): I'm nervous.

1000
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,721
You can't make a mistake, Cha Eunjae.

1001
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,265
WOOJIN: Is this your first operation
with Professor Cha?

1002
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:58,185
EUNJAE: Yes, it's my first time,
so I'm super nervous.

1003
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,815
Right, when's your next day off?

1004
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,609
WOOJIN: Why?

1005
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:07,486
EUNJAE: Professor Cha wants
to eat together, so make some time for it.

1006
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:10,656
(tense music)

1007
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,119
(door opens)

1008
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,629
-DOIL: Please lower the ECMO flow rate.
-NURSE 2: Okay.

1009
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,297
WOOJIN: What's going on?

1010
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:30,384
MYEONGSIM: Apparently,
Professor Cha Jinman called everyone here.

1011
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,262
I guess he's planning
to put on a performance.

1012
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:36,849
INFORMATION

1013
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:50,947
JINMAN: Patient's name, Bae Yurim.

1014
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,239
Age, 20 years old.

1015
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:57,995
She has pulmonary fibrosis
and secondary pulmonary hypertension.

1016
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,164
We will begin
the lung transplant surgery now.

1017
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,084
Dr. Nam Doil?

1018
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:06,003
DOIL: The patient's vitals
and saturation level are stable.

1019
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:06,921
You may begin.

1020
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,173
JINMAN: Dr. Cha Eunjae?

1021
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,133
EUNJAE: Yes, I'm ready.

1022
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:15,846
JINMAN: Scalpel.

1023
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:19,600
(upbeat rock music)

1024
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,754
WOOJIN: At that time, I didn't realize

1025
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:52,633
that the more solid your heart is,

1026
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:54,844
the more

1027
01:06:55,594 --> 01:07:00,099
difficult and meticulous
the trials become.

1028
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:03,102
That the more solid it is,

1029
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,855
even the smallest of cracks

1030
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,650
can leave a mark.

1031
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,319
(upbeat rock music continues)

1032
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:35,676
You seem to be studying very hard.

1033
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:39,180
Yes, whenever I get the chance.

1034
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:42,975
(inhales)
Uh...

1035
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,436
By the way, about Dr. Areum,

1036
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:47,605
have you ever
seen the person she's dating?

1037
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,482
(playful music)

1038
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:54,487
She said
they've been dating for three years,

1039
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:57,406
so I thought maybe you've seen him before.

1040
01:07:58,616 --> 01:07:59,867
DONGHWA: What kind of man is he?

1041
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,035
(turns page)

1042
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,036
Why are you asking?

1043
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,454
I'm just curious

1044
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:05,956
about how he looks.

1045
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,044
(sighs)

1046
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,462
He looks like this.

1047
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,305
I'm the man dating Areum.

1048
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:32,274
(sighs)

1049
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:39,782
Damn it.

1050
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,288
(upbeat music)

1051
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,306
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

1052
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,518
MYEONGSIM: There was a shooting incident
at the nearby military base.

1053
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,353
GITAE: He's still on the run.

1054
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:11,647
WOOJIN: One bullet is still
in the abdomen.

1055
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:12,815
DOIL: Cardiac arrest!

1056
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:14,483
EUNJAE: I failed this patient.

1057
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,026
DOIL: The blood transport vehicle
is stuck in traffic?

1058
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,528
MINGUK: Run!

1059
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:21,740
INSU: The shooter who is on the run
seems to be inside the hospital.

1060
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,576
JINMAN: You should get out too. Evacuate.

1061
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,869
What about Seo Woojin?

1062
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:27,163
AREUM: I looked everywhere
in the hospital, but I couldn't find him.

1063
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:28,998
SABU: Seo Woojin!
