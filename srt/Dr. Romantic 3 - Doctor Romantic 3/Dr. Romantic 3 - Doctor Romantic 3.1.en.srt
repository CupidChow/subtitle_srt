PRESENTER 3: It's four degrees
in Seoul and the surrounding area,

86
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,545
but Gwangju is--

87
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,589
PRESENTER 4: This song was requested
by one of our listeners.

88
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,092
We'll be back with part 3 after the song.

89
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,177
(soft music playing)

90
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,596

(medical equipments clatter)

97
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,397

98
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,566
MEDIC: They'll be here soon. Please wait

99
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,942
just a little longer.

100
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,611

101
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:10,364
(helicopter blades whirring)

102
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,286
Do you hear that?

103
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,871
They're coming now.

104
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,419
(helicopter whirring continues)

105
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,267
CURRENT TIME: 12:08 A.M.

106
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,687
PILOT: P-3008, we're returning home.
Report current weather status.

107
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,280
COAST GUARD

108
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,270
What's this?

109
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,230
They're kids.

110
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,149
They're the team that saved former
Defense Minister Ryu Woongil's life.

111
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,570
(sighs)

112
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,366
Lieutenant Ko Eunho.

113
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,326
Hello, we're from Doldam Hospital.

114
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,078
I'm emergency physician Jung Insu.

115
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,830
This is surgeon Seo Woojin.

116
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,291
And this is
nurse practitioner Park Euntak.

117
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,835
Let's see the patient first.
We heard it was a gunshot.

118
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,421
-Before that, you must sign some forms.
-INSU: What?

119
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,760
As of this moment, everything that occurs
on this ship is strictly confidential.

120
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,095
LIEUTENANT KO: You may only ask

121
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,931
the minimum information required
about the patient for treatment.

122
00:09:59,015 --> 00:09:59,849
If you do not comply,

123
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,476
you may be court-martialed
for violation of national security laws.

124
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,478
National security…

125
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,984
There. Can we see the patient now?

126
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:10,901
This way.

127
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,821
Where's Master Kim?

128
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,282
Eunjae went to find him.
We'll hear from her soon.

129
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,495
Wait up, Euntak.

130
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,581
(tense music)

131
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,336
EUNJAE: You know,

132
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,422
there are three things
I never do after sundown.

133
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,758
One of them is driving at night.

134
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,635
Does this make any sense right now?

135
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,138
I don't even drive on an eight-lane road
in Seoul at nighttime.

136
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,265
But at this time of night,

137
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,435
and on a bumpy unpaved road at that?

138
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,646
Gosh.

139
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,230
-Oh, dear.
-My goodness.

140
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,816
What are you doing, Dr. Jang?
You still can't reach Master Kim?

141
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,361
I keep calling, but he's not picking up.

142
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:57,615
Gosh, Master Kim. Please pick up.

143
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:04,288

148
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,195
This way.

149
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,170
LIEUTENANT KO: You may go inside.

150
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,930
How are the patient's vitals?

151
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,306
MEDIC: What? Oh, right.

152
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,975
BP 100/70, heart rate 120.

153
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,143
WOOJIN: Blood loss?

154
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,603
MEDIC: He had already lost a lot of blood
when I got here.

155
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,604
I'm not sure exactly…

156
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,606
We'll take charge from now on. Step back.

157
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,816
MEDIC: Okay.

158
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,820
Step back.

159
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,534
Sir? Can you hear me?

160
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,244
(groans in pain)

161
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,455
He's in a stupor.

162
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,331
When did he lose consciousness?

163
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,334
MEDIC: I'm not sure about that either.
He was like this when I got here.

164
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,005
Scissors, please.

165
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,515
Let's check his back.

166
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,977
One, two, three.

167
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,316
No exit wounds.

168
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,067
It means both bullets are still inside.

169
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,486
Let's see the ultrasound.

170
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,030
(suspenseful music)

171
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,158
(woman coughs)

172
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,954
(Insu sighs)

173
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,414
He has severe hemoperitoneum.

174
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,916
INSU: It's a liver injury, right?

175
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,250
Yes, it looks that way.

176
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,924
But there's too much blood,
even up to the spleen.

177
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,218
Right? There could more bleeding.

178
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,594
Can we do general anesthesia?

179
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,179
MEDIC: Here, in the treatment room?

180
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,140
That might be hard.
We don't have an anesthesiologist--

181
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,642
Dr. Jung, can you handle sedation?

182
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,935
Can we take him to a hospital?

183
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,394
I don't think he'll last.

184
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,689
He's lost a lot of blood,
but he's in bad shape in general.

185
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,108
Also, he might be…

186
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,318
Why? What is it?

187
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,444
Is something else wrong?

188
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,075
There is a possibility of an IVC injury.

189
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,160
(tense music)

190
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,123
Where is the treatment room?
Let's see your equipment first.

191
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,500
MEDIC: This is it.

192
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,004
This is the only place
you can treat patients

193
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,048
on this ship.

194
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,310
SEO WOOJIN

195
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,728
It's Dr. Seo Woojin.

196
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,564
-Answer it.
-Okay.

197
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,023
SEO WOOJIN

198
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,692
-DONGHWA: Here.
-Hey.

199
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,403
Hey, Eunjae.
What's going on? What about Master Kim?

200
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,780
I don't know yet. He won't even pick up.

201
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,031
You still haven't found him?

202
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,575
Cha Eunjae!

203
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,785
That's why I'm doing my best!

204
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,079
But I can't find him anywhere.

205
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,248
We've been circling this area
for an hour already.

206
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,791
(Eunjae pants)

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,042
Wait, over there!

208
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,419
Where? Is he here?

209
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,337
-There.
-Where?

210
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,882
Did you find him? Did you find Master Kim?

211
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,509
Stay on the line. Darn it.

212
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,137
(gasps)

213
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,016
EUNJAE: Master!

214
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,686
Gosh, Master Kim!
Were you here the whole time?

215
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,688
Why didn't you answer your phone?

216
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,524
Do you know how many times I called you?

217
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,775
(Eunjae pants)

218
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,279
Hey, I'm on my precious vacation.

219
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,447
Don't you know that?

220
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,573
EUNJAE: Of course I do.

221
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:08,949
I do,

222
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,869
but it's a gunshot wound patient.

223
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,290
We got an emergency call
from the Coast Guard.

224
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,751
EUNJAE: For now, Dr. Seo Woojin, Insu,

225
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,045
and Euntak went to the site.

226
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,631
But the patient seems to be in bad shape.

227
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,682
Hey, give me your phone.

228
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,975
-Here.
-Okay.

229
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,564
Hey, Woojin. What's the situation?

230
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,483
It's an unidentified middle-aged man.

231
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,360
He's had three gunshot wounds.

232
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,946
One of them nicked
the left brachial plexus,

233
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,407
and the other two don't have exit wounds.
They're lodged inside.

234
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,952
WOOJIN: We suspect a liver injury,

235
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,120
so we plan to open him up
and stop bleeding first.

236
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,623
Then why not just do it?

237
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,041
But,

238
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,294
there's also a chance of an IVC injury.

239
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,053
How much blood loss?

240
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,930
He was rescued
when he had already lost a lot.

241
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,264
We're not sure exactly--

242
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,349
WOMAN: It should be

243
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,184
about 800cc.

244
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,105
WOMAN: Since he was first shot,

245
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,482
he has lost about 800 up to 1,000cc.

246
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,193
Since about 10 minutes after he was shot,

247
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,861
he's been in a stupor.

248
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,365
(coughs)

249
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,408
Who's that?

250
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,535
It's the person who was with the patient.

251
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,414
The patient is very malnourished.

252
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,374
It's not looking good overall.

253
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,252
I'm not sure how much longer
he can hold out in this state.

254
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,420
Please save him.

255
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,716
He's my father.

256
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,636
WOMAN (over phone): We escaped…

257
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,304
(woman sobbing)

258
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,224
We escaped and risked our lives
in order to survive.

259
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,812
Please save him, doctor.

260
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,277
(rods creaking)

261
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,407
(helicopter blades whirring)

262
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,218
Open him up now.

263
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,721
Open him up and find the bleeding!

264
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,514
Are you coming?

265
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,600
Just hang on for 30 minutes!

266
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,851
SABU: Got it?

267
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,561
(exhales in relief)

268
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,771
Yes, sir.

269
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,281
(opening theme music)

270
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,495
VOLUME 1

271
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,081
BREAK LINE:
WHERE THE WATER SUDDENLY GETS DEEPER

272
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,305
NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE
ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA BEGIN

273
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,525
(soft music playing)

274
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,615
He's running pretty late.

275
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,619
Looks like he won't be showing up.

276
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,623
I told you it wouldn't be easy.

277
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,542
We're talking about a trauma center

278
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,961
in Gangwon Province, not even Seoul.

279
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,672
And Dr. Bu Yongju is there too.

280
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,842
It's not easy.

281
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,764
So, should I try calling Dr. Oh again?

282
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,933
If he's not showing up
after making an appointment,

283
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,810
it must mean he isn't interested.

284
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,104
Still, I'll call one last time--

285
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,022
Forget it. There's no need.

286
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,983
Let's get going.

287
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:12,818
(grunts)

288
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,996
Isn't that Dr. Cha Jinman?

289
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,038
You're right.

290
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,041
MAN: I went to see him once recently.

291
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,003
Actually, Shinseong Hospital has been
trying to recruit him.

292
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,173
Is he planning to leave his position?

293
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,009
Gosh, he won't go there, though.

294
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,846
All the major hospitals in Seoul
are fighting to recruit him.

295
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,682
I was one of them. And I still am.

296
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,810
There are always variables at play.

297
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,730
And where there is a will, there is a way.

298
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,191
Will you really meet with him?

299
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,153
(sighs)

300
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,283
MAN: Excuse me, sir.

301
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,868
Fancy meeting you here.

302
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,846
Surgery? Here?

303
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,807
He has bullets lodged inside
and is losing a lot of blood.

304
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,602
It seems they'll perform emergency surgery
to stop the bleeding.

305
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,521
They say they have
more people coming for backup.

306
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,736
WOOJIN: There's a lot of blood
in the peritoneum,

307
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,155
so we're going in
without a clear idea of the injury site.

308
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,533
If it's an IVC injury, his vitals
will drop as soon as we open him.

309
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,410
You're a cardiothoracic surgeon?

310
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,621
MEDIC: Yes, but I enlisted
as soon as I passed the exam.

311
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,122
I don't have a lot of experience.

312
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,291
WOOJIN: Do you have experience with
general or combined operations?

313
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,294
MEDIC: I've worked on an abdominal
aortic injury, a diaphragm injury,

314
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,507
and a cancer vessel invasion case.

315
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,093
WOOJIN: There will be much more blood
than you think.

316
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,887
Don't get flustered
and follow along when I ask for help.

317
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,847
MEDIC: Yes, I'll do my best.

318
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,766
-WOOJIN: Insu.
-INSU: Yes.

319
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:08,934
The patient is stable.

320
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:09,935
WOOJIN: Scalpel, please.

321
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,480
(tense music)

322
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,862
Bovie.

323
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,370
INSU: Hey, his BP is dropping.

324
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,581
-WOOJIN: Kelly.
-MEDIC: Yes, sir.

325
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,710
(clattering)

326
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,881
WOOJIN: Gauze.

327
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,300
MEDIC: Gauze!

328
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,723
Gauze.

329
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,730
(beeping)

330
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,273
INSU: Cardiac arrest. PEA.

331
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,027
Start chest compressions.

332
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,028
MEDIC: Cardiac arrest.

333
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,531
INSU: Get up there now!

334
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,824
MEDIC: Yes, sir!

335
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,162
(breathes shakily)

336
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,040
WOOJIN: Kelly.

337
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,668
Bovie.

338
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:20,881
Tie.

339
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,386
(medic pants)

340
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,103
-WOOJIN: Okay. Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

341
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:38,982
(Woojin grunts)

342
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,486
-WOOJIN: Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

343
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,495
WOOJIN: There's no one to take over
for you. Hang in there.

344
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,662
MEDIC: Yes, sir!

345
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,208
WOOJIN: Gauze.

346
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,050
(coughs)

347
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,433
(helicopter blades whirring)

348
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,310
(continues coughing)

349
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,980
(hopeful music)

350
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,205
Gosh.

351
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,297
(hopeful music rises)

352
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,945
-LIEUTENANT KO: This is the medical room.
-Okay.

353
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,781
I heard there was another patient.

354
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,908
Pardon?

355
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,413
(coughs)

356
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,623
She's coughing, and it doesn't sound good.

357
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,500
WOOJIN: She has pale conjunctiva,

358
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,002
and I hear rales and wheezing too.

359
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,257
You must be mistaken.

360
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,926
The gunshot wound patient
is the only one on this ship who needs

361
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,261
emergency medical care.

362
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,096
Lieutenant.

363
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,058
(woman coughs)

364
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,525
(heaves)

365
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,864
Ma'am, are you okay?

366
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,325
What are you doing? Get in there.

367
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,659
But I'm a general surgeon.

368
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,662
-And?
-Yes, sir.

369
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,998
Oh, darn you…

370
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,587
Where is the captain of this ship?

371
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,256
The Captain is on the bridge.

372
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,966
Run over there and tell him

373
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,219
that we need to get
the helicopter back up.

374
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,096
As soon as we finish emergency care,
we need to move them to a hospital.

375
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,473
Wait, but that's not--

376
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,518
Go and report to him now! Or else,
you'll have a dead man on your hands!

377
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,273
Cha Eunjae, how is she?

378
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,485
Her BP and heart rate are okay,
but oxygen saturation is at 93%.

379
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,737
She seems to have chest pain
on the right side.

380
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,864
It's dyspnea due to massive hemoptysis.

381
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,282
Can you get it under control?

382
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,909
Yes, I'll try.

383
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,703
Okay. Hey, Jang Donghwa.

384
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,373
-Yes?
-Help Dr. Cha.

385
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,750
Then what about the emergency surgery?

386
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,087
The ship is too small,
so we can't all fit in the room anyway.

387
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,422
I'll call you if we need you.
Just stay here.

388
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,967
EUNJAE: Give her 10 L of O2 reservoir.

389
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,968
Okay.

390
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,680
(medic bag zipper rasps)

391
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,723
(monitor beeping)

392
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,475
INSU: Master!

393
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:01,893
Hey.

394
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,478
How long have you been at CPR?

395
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,105
-INSU: Ten minutes.
-SABU: Is that so?

396
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,572
INSU: Let's check the rhythm.

397
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,615
(medic pants)

398
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,578
INSU: PEA. Continue compressions.

399
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,914
(medic grunts and pants)

400
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,212
SABU: Okay, how far along are we?

401
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,089
WOOJIN: We're stitching above
the injury site.

402
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,048
Okay, cut.

403
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,010
-WOOJIN: Suction.
-SABU: Suction.

404
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,096
(squishing)

405
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,389
WOOJIN: Tie.

406
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,354
-WOOJIN: Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

407
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,481
WOOJIN: We've got it all.

408
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,526
SABU: Good. Euntak, irrigation.

409
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,073
(medic pants)

410
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,242
SABU: Okay.

411
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,994
I think you tied it off well.

412
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,496
The bleeding seems to be under control.

413
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:04,873
Dr. Jung?

414
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,499
INSU: Yes. We'll check the rhythm.

415
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,095
INSU: ROSC.

416
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,722
He's back.

417
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,559
(medic sighs)

418
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,563
WOOJIN: We stitched him up in a rush
because he went into arrest.

419
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,316
But the venous return
isn't all there as expected.

420
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,233
What do we do now?

421
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,111
(Sabu grunts)

422
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,614
SABU: It's above the renal vein.

423
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,158
If we delay too much,
we'll lose the kidneys too.

424
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,787
WOOJIN: About a third of the liver
is damaged too.

425
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,755
MEDIC: This is checkmate.

426
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,093
Even I can tell
without any real firsthand experience.

427
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,845
This patient will soon…

428
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,223
die.

429
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,771
SABU: We're going to pass the injury site.

430
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,816
Change positions.

431
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,360
MEDIC: What does that mean?

432
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,695
EUNTAK: Will a foley tube work?

433
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,988
SABU: No, let's use an endotracheal tube.
The biggest one.

434
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,281
INSU: Yes, sir.

435
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,618
MEDIC: Does everyone understand
what he's saying?

436
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,788
(suspenseful music)

437
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,092
SABU: Blade number 11.

438
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,977
Stick in the side with the balloon first.

439
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,604
Put the side without towards the heart
and fix it in place.

440
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:55,066
As soon as I put this tube in,
tie it immediately. Are you ready?

441
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,193
-WOOJIN: Yes, sir.
-SABU: Let's begin.

442
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,737
SABU: There.

443
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,199
Okay.

444
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,410
SABU: All right, tie this side.

445
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,417
WOOJIN: There, cut.

446
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,295
SABU: And the right side.

447
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,550
Tie.

448
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,305
-WOOJIN: Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

449
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,017
MEDIC: I have never seen
anything like this before.

450
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,810
SABU: Euntak.

451
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,613
MEDIC: No way.
Is that really going to work?

452
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,243
WOOJIN: It's working, Doctor.

453
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,579
(Euntak sighs in relief)

454
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,458
(breathes heavily)

455
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,419
INSU: The patient is hanging in there.

456
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,047
-His vitals are holding steady too.
-SABU: Okay.

457
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,508
Cover it with film first,

458
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,593
and let's move him to Doldam Hospital.

459
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,513
We'll go straight into secondary surgery.
Get ready.

460
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,680
WOOJIN: Yes, sir.

461
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,723
(door opens)

462
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,225
OFFICER: That's not going to be possible.

463
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,523
For the next 18 hours,
this patient cannot leave this ship.

464
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,819
(tense music)

465
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,861
(gloves rustling)

466
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,407
(coughs)

467
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,326
DONGHWA: What?

468
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,870
Dr. Cha, blood keeps coming up the tube.

469
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,206
How many of the smallest tubes are there?

470
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,292
(plastic rustling)

471
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,336
There are two 4.5 mm tubes.

472
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,382
(squishing)

473
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,096
Give me one now.

474
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,782
(exclaims)
Isn't that too deep?

475
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,075
Another.

476
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,167
Use 3 cc for each ballooning.

477
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,920
You can do that much, right?

478
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,382
General surgeons can handle ballooning.

479
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,639
(hissing)

480
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,893
(coughs)

481
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,978
-(exclaims)
-Gauze.

482
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,813
This side is bleeding.

483
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,398
Did you put that in her lungs?

484
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,443
Yes, one tube is deep in one of the lungs.

485
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,403
The other one is positioned above.

486
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,655
That maintains respiration
from the lung that isn't bleeding.

487
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,036
(soft grunt)

488
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,917
If you were a cardiothoracic surgeon,

489
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,419
you'd know how sensational and fantastic
this treatment was.

490
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,130
Oh, okay.

491
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,841
It would've been nice to have
a double lumen tube, but we don't.

492
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,679
That's 98%. Good.

493
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,724
Suction both sides
and use half the force with the Ambu bag.

494
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,392
You can do that much, right?

495
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,936
Why do you keep asking me that?

496
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,897
There are plenty of residents
who don't even know how to do this much.

497
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,398
I can do it.

498
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,608
(scoffs)

499
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,821
Is your arm okay?

500
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,116
I'm fine.

501
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:33,952
The bullet only grazed me.

502
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,287
Okay.

503
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,293
Are you okay?

504
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,045
What's your name?

505
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,684
(sighs)

506
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,313
We don't have time for this, Captain.

507
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,359
If we don't move and operate right away,
the patient will die.

508
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,154
Orders from above are
just as serious as human life.

509
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,825
That patient will stay on this ship
until 6 p.m. tomorrow evening.

510
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,326
As a dead man?

511
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,913
You said that he's past the crisis.

512
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,289
At this rate,

513
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,334
he'll keep facing more crises.

514
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,545
He'll keep going into cardiac arrest,

515
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,131
and there's only so much
we can do with CPR.

516
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,842
I heard you were a talented doctor.

517
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,635
If we can't operate on time,

518
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,304
talented or not, it doesn't matter.

519
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,684
You must've caught on by now,

520
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,810
but those people…

521
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,021
are North Korean defectors.

522
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,232
Yes, and?

523
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,902
You do know that there is a summit
going on in Seoul, right?

524
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:50,987
So what?

525
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,198
The process to discuss peace policies
in the Korean peninsula

526
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,992
is happening in Seoul of all places.

527
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,327
If an issue regarding
North Korean defectors occurs,

528
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,787
what do you think will happen?

529
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,374
Does a doctor
need to consider all of that?

530
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,754
Anyway, there is a political situation
Korea is facing at the moment.

531
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:11,132
Even on the battlefield,
it's human nature to treat the injured,

532
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,760
no matter what side they are from.

533
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,761
Moreover,

534
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,849
these people risked their lives
to come down south to survive.

535
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,142
Also, they're civilians.

536
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,230
Tacking on all that
political situation nonsense to this,

537
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,483
isn't that foul play?

538
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,234
You should watch what you're saying.

539
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,487
I'm just saying
we should stick to our jobs!

540
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,322
(clicks tongue)

541
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,407
(tense music)

542
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,952
Captain.

543
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,623
You and I both work
our butts off day and night

544
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,666
so we can save people's lives.

545
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,670
SABU: Then we should save
the man's life first.

546
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:55,885
The political situation is
for the politicians to deal with.

547
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,178
Isn't that right?

548
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,808
Isn't it?

549
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,489
CAPTAIN: Yes, this is the captain.

550
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,991
Yes, sir.

551
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,704
Well… Please give us your order.

552
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,669
Yes, sir.

553
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,722
I spoke to the higher-ups just now.

554
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,853
Until the North Korean representatives
return to Pyongyang,

555
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,940
those people cannot be allowed
onto South Korean soil.

556
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,441
Darn it…

557
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,193
CAPTAIN: However,

558
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,362
that's how it is

559
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,406
on an official level.

560
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,284
(pensive music)

561
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,790
(sighs)

562
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,089
Then what about on an unofficial level?

563
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,342
How much can we do?

564
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,484
My shift ended a long time ago.

565
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,153
Go home then.

566
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,156
Are you joking?
How am I supposed to get off this ship?

567
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,699
I know.

568
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:45,119
This is exactly what they mean
by being on the same boat, Dr. Jang.

569
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,164
Just because you want to leave
doesn't mean you can get off alone.

570
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,375
How do I put it…
that we share a common destiny?

571
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:55,213
I want to live as an individual
without a destiny.

572
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,547
(inhales sharply)

573
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,676
(door opens)

574
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,054
(approaching footsteps)

575
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,264
(tense music)

576
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,356
(monitor beeping)

577
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,737
I guess even Master Kim can't fix this…

578
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,823
(approaching footsteps)

579
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,866
(door opens)

580
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,828
The helicopter will take off
in five minutes.

581
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,330
You may prepare to leave, doctors.

582
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,207
You're sending us back?

583
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,376
What about the patient?
What will happen to him?

584
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,463
He'll be transferred with you.

585
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,756
(sighs in relief)

586
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,092
(sighs in relief)

587
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,276
Where are you taking her?

588
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,529
We're transferring her to a hospital.
You should get treated too.

589
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,447
You mean you're taking us to South Korea?

590
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,449
Saving lives comes first.

591
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,997
Don't worry.

592
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,249
We're going to Doldam Hospital.

593
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,251
EUNJAE: It's this place.

594
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,879
A very nice hospital in Jeongseon.

595
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,134
(helicopter blades whirring)

596
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,775
(pensive music)

597
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,102
We'll be there soon.

598
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,646
Look.

599
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,927
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

600
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,305
DOLDAM HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

601
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,145
(grunts)

602
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,152
Where is everyone? Oh, wait…

603
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,405
Which way is it…

604
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,240
Oh, gosh.

605
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,200
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

606
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,369
(pants)

607
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,080
Darn it.
Why did they want me in such a hurry?

608
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,752
Hey, what on earth is this
all of a sudden?

609
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,170
A gunshot wound trauma patient?

610
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,256
Master Kim isn't even here.
What on earth--

611
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,049
Master Kim is on his way too.

612
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,136
Master Kim?
But he's on vacation right now.

613
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,721
Looks like
Dr. Seo Woojin called him urgently.

614
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,099
Dr. Cha went to find him herself.

615
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,642
Does anyone need caffeine?

616
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,685
I'm fine.

617
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,896
I'll take a double shot
with double the cream and sugar.

618
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,481
(Gitae sighs)

619
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,733
Gosh, that Dr. Seo. I mean,

620
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,695
Master Kim barely managed
to take a vacation in years,

621
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,405
but they just couldn't let him be.

622
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,241
There was a gunshot wound patient.

623
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,577
He had no choice in
such an urgent situation.

624
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,330
Anyway, that gunshot wound patient
is coming here with Master Kim.

625
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,249
We should come up with a plan too.

626
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,834
What plan?

627
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,252
Officially speaking,

628
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,172
this patient is someone

629
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,717
who can't be on South Korean soil
until 6 p.m. tomorrow evening.

630
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,012
(quirky dramatic music)

631
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,891
Other than the minimum number
of staff for surgery,

632
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,476
don't let anyone know.

633
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,811
And until 6 p.m. tomorrow,

634
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,522
make sure this information
doesn't get leaked.

635
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,109
Those are the conditions
for transferring this patient.

636
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,154
What on earth…

637
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,281
How is that possible?

638
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,367
You know how many staff come and go
from Doldam Hospital.

639
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,119
So it has to be a place

640
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,372
where we can keep this secret
and treat the patient with minimal staff.

641
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,917
It cannot be leaked.

642
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,961
That's what I mean, Ms. Oh.
In this tiny little hospital,

643
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,421
where can we treat a patient

644
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,549
without anyone knowing
with the bare minimum staff?

645
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,759
There is one place.

646
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,143
No way, Ms. Oh.

647
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,062
Could it be…

648
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,688
SABU (over phone): Yes, that's right.

649
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,148
The trauma center.

650
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,693
Let's open it up for now.

651
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,489
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

652
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,908
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

653
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,414
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

654
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,585
That can't be done, Ms. Oh.

655
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,380
We haven't even gotten approval
for completion of the building yet!

656
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,465
Didn't I tell you to hurry it up?

657
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,217
The building was finished ages ago.

658
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,636
Yet, you haven't been able
to get the approval for months.

659
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,513
We're getting government funding.

660
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,557
The process is complicated, that's all.

661
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,392
I hear a new government employee is
in charge.

662
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,353
That's what I mean.
Since there's a new person in charge,

663
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,355
we don't know when he might barge in.

664
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,148
How could we keep a patient there?

665
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,692
We can't do this, Ms. Oh.

666
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:53,070
This would be like ruining
the whole project at the very end.

667
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,823
Officially speaking,
until 6 p.m. tomorrow evening,

668
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,908
we're not admitting a patient.

669
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,246
We haven't done anything officially,
so why would it be a problem?

670
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,498
Come on, you can't say that!

671
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,333
Why are you being like this as well?

672
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:11,255
If this goes wrong and we can't use
that perfectly fine trauma center,

673
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,590
will you hold responsibility?

674
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,719
Well, Master Kim is bringing the patient
via helicopter as we speak.

675
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:20,097
Anyway, not there.
We can not put him there!

676
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,890
(helicopter blades whirring)

677
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:22,808
(exclaims)

678
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,020
What can we do?
They seem to be here already.

679
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,688
MYEONGSIM: Let's get ready, everyone.

680
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,192
Wait, no…

681
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,110
Seriously!

682
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,571
Ms. Oh!

683
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:39,158
CURRENT TIME: 3:09 A.M.

684
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,745
PILOT: Should I land
on the helicopter pad on the roof?

685
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,915
No, we haven't gotten approval
for the building completion yet.

686
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,877
Behind the building,
there's another helicopter pad.

687
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,045
Let's land there.

688
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,463
(in English)
Roger.

689
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,674
PILOT (in Korean): Bravo 517.
Bravo 518 will be landing first.

690
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,844
Bravo 517, standby in the air.

691
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,097
(epic music)

692
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,717
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

693
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,569
(machine beeps)

694
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,660
Over here. Come this way.

695
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,712
MYEONGSIM: Dr. Nam is waiting
in Operating Room One.

696
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,964
WOOJIN: Okay.
We'll move the patient to Room One.

697
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,799
Nurse.

698
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,177
Run an operation lab test first
and have plenty of packed RBCs ready.

699
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,471
As soon as we start anesthesia,
we'll start the operation.

700
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,348
-NURSE: Yes, Doctor.
-I'll get things ready.

701
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,851
Ms. Oh, more patients are coming.

702
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:31,770
I got the call. It's a CS case, right?
I'll get things ready.

703
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,105
(exhales loudly)

704
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,815
So this is how we open this place.

705
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,191
EUNJAE: Dr. Jung!

706
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,609
INSU: Hey.

707
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,366
-Dr. Jang.
-DONGHWA: Yes?

708
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,160
Get ready and come to OR One, quick.

709
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,120
-DONGHWAN: Right now?
-Hurry, it's urgent.

710
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,583
Darn it!

711
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,389
(sighs)

712
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,017
She's a massive hemoptysis patient.

713
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,643
She's been coughing and has chest pains.

714
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,187
-What about an echocardiogram?
-EUNJAE: Will do.

715
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,938
Can we get a CT scan here?

716
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,106
We've got it all.

717
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,776
Then can we get a sputum test
and run an OP lab too?

718
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,111
Why not just ask
if we can teleport in here?

719
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,864
Dr. Jang, let's get a sputum test
and run an OP lab--

720
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,116
Dr. Jang. Where did he go?

721
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,660
Dr. Seo called him into the OR.

722
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,121
Ms. Choi, let's get a sputum test
and run an OP lab.

723
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,624
-Yes, ma'am.
-Jang Donghwa is so out of it.

724
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,877
He was complaining about working
after hours in front of the patient,

725
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,504
and he doesn't even respect his seniors.

726
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,507
I don't think you respected me
that much either, Dr. Cha.

727
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,301
Still, I wasn't that bad.

728
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,513
Ms. Oh, can we get a portable chest x-ray?

729
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,597
MYEONGSIM: Yes, Doctor.

730
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,605
You're here, Master Kim.

731
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,232
SABU: Hey, Ms. Oh.

732
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,151
You couldn't even rest
on your long awaited vacation.

733
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,696
I guess it's just my fate.

734
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:09,910
By the way, you got Mr. Jang
to open up the doors somehow.

735
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:14,915
GITAE: This isn't right.

736
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,542
(sighs)

737
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,793
This can't be.

738
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,424
MYEONGSIM: But where did
these patients come from?

739
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,426
They're North Korean defectors.

740
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:30,722
Because of the South-North talks
in Seoul right now,

741
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,724
they're trying to keep this under wraps.

742
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:37,145
Still, we couldn't keep them on that ship

743
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,814
without operating on them.

744
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,276
I had them brought here unofficially.

745
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,152
I see.

746
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,656
SABU: That little boy's father expired
on the boat.

747
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,157
EXPIRE: TO DIE

748
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,703
The kid doesn't seem to be
physically hurt,

749
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,371
but he's too quiet.

750
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,332
I'll keep a close watch.

751
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:58,959
Okay.

752
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,212
Right, then let's get started.

753
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,465
Let's do that, Master Kim.

754
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,802
(lively music)

755
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,637
(both chuckle)

756
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,330
(sighs)

757
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,140
WOOJIN: Nurse.

758
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,768
Could you call Dr. Jang Donghwa?

759
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,852
Yes, Doctor.

760
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,901
DOLDAM HOSPITAL
OUTPATIENT CARE

761
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,611
(car beeps)

762
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,326
(cell phone buzzing)

763
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,125
(monitor beeping)

764
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,796
(sighs)

765
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:34,096
DOIL: Finally, this is the first surgery
at the Doldam Hospital Trauma Center.

766
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,806
Although, it's unofficial.

767
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,644
-SABU: Dr. Seo Woojin.
-WOOJIN: Yes, Doctor?

768
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,688
SABU: This is
our trauma center's first patient.

769
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,190
Let's save him no matter what. Got it?

770
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:46,733
WOOJIN: Of course.

771
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,362
DOIL: Okay.
The patient's vitals are stable.

772
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,781
SABU: Right. Let's get started.

773
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,908
Scalpel.

774
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,661
WOOJIN: Bovie.

775
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:07,546
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

776
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,235
Sorry to ask you to meet here.

777
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,280
MINGUK: It's quite all right.
It didn't take long getting here.

778
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,908
So, how is it…

779
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:38,869
living in the countryside?

780
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:42,581
There's no difference in saving lives
in Seoul or elsewhere.

781
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,000
I just do my best for my patients.

782
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,377
You sound like
you've reached enlightenment.

783
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,545
(chuckles)

784
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,088
Well…

785
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,426
I've heard rumors that you will be moving
to another hospital. Is this true?

786
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,803
Why do you ask?

787
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,599
Actually, Doldam Hospital
has newly built a trauma center.

788
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,143
You already have Bu Yongju there.

789
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,772
I know that
you're both Keosan University alumni.

790
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:10,067
That you two were undergrad rivals.

791
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,071
I don't know about rivals.

792
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,407
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon,
and he's a general surgeon.

793
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,450
(Minguk chuckles)

794
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:22,662
If you come to our hospital,
you would be of tremendous help.

795
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,167
By the way, Dr. Park,

796
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,586
why did you go there?

797
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,756
I wanted to test myself.

798
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,842
Master Kim can do it, so why can't I?

799
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,552
(Minguk chuckles)

800
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,387
MINGUK: But then,
I came to my senses one day,

801
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,014
and I found myself here.

802
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,432
You've gone off the deep end.

803
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,520
I guess you could say

804
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,856
that my respect for Dr. Bu Yongju
played a part in it.

805
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,948
Anyway, thank you for making time for me.

806
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,785
If you can,
please stop by the hospital sometime.

807
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,413
DOLDAM HOSPITAL
DIRECTOR PARK MINGUK

808
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,543
How about today?

809
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,088
Pardon?

810
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,843
I happen to be off today.

811
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,357
How are his vitals and urine output?

812
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,068
His BP is holding at 100/70.

813
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,946
EUNTAK: And his urine output is
70 to 80 cc per hour, which is good.

814
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:38,905
(exhales in relief)

815
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,366
I honestly thought he wouldn't make it.

816
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,035
You did a good job.

817
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,830
I didn't know
you'd get the IVC injury as well.

818
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,709
I wouldn't have been able
to do it without you.

819
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,837
Go and get some shut-eye.

820
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,257
We need to observe him until this evening
with the minimum number of staff.

821
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,967
Let's take turns and save our energy.

822
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,515
Have you not heard
from Dr. Jang Donghwa yet?

823
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,727
No, I think he went home.

824
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,442
I'll stay here. Go and get some rest.

825
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,653
Then I'll be back soon after I wash up.

826
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,407
(Euntak sighs)

827
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,249
(gentle music)

828
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,170
EUNTAK: Where are you now?

829
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:39,007
WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

830
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,429
When will you be back?

831
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:49,559
WHEN WILL YOU BE BACK?

832
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,145
I miss you.

833
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,230
(approaching footsteps)

834
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,731
Euntak.

835
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,442
Yes, Dr. Cha?

836
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,027
Where is Seo Woojin?

837
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,695
He went to get some sleep.

838
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,198
We're going to take turns observing
until this evening.

839
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,116
What about Jang Donghwa? What's he doing?

840
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,744
I think he went home.

841
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,539
Why, that little punk. I knew it.

842
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,376
What's Seo Woojin doing?
He's supposed to be his mentor.

843
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,294
Will he leave him to do whatever he wants?

844
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,380
I'm sure he'll deal with it.

845
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:19,965
(sighs)
Seriously.

846
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,217
By the way, did you finish moving?

847
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,138
I heard from Dr. Eom
that you moved over the weekend.

848
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,308
(chuckling awkwardly)
Oh, well, yes.

849
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,269
When will you have a housewarming party?

850
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,356
I'm so curious what your house is like.

851
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,609
Well, it's just a small house.

852
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,903
I haven't gotten settled in yet.

853
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,156
I think it will take some time
to get organized.

854
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,242
(Eunjae laughs awkwardly)

855
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,702
I'll be going first.

856
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,207
NURSE: Mm.

857
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,459
She should just get married instead.

858
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,255
Dr. Cha and Dr. Seo, I mean.

859
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,633
They're in the same place in
their relationship for over three years.

860
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,344
There's no progress
and it's getting awkward.

861
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,346
(nurse inhales sharply)

862
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,850
Being in a long-term relationship
isn't necessarily a good thing.

863
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,353
I'm sure they'll figure it out themselves.

864
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,107
How is Areum?

865
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,029
Is she doing well?

866
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,574
Yes, I'm sure she is.

867
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,039
What's this?

868
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,250
This couple is kind of awkward too.

869
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,139
I MISS YOU…

870
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,642
(phone clicks shut)

871
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,353
(gentle music playing)

872
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,247
(man exhales softly)

873
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,046
MAN: Goodness…

874
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,715
There you go.

875
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,281
(door opens)

876
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,200
(door closes)

877
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,223
Where is he?

878
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,183
Wait…

879
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:21,980
(door opens)

880
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:26,776
What are you doing?

881
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,446
I couldn't find you, so…

882
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,198
What? Did you miss me already?

883
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,994
The surgery must've gone well today.
You seem to be in a good mood.

884
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,664
I fixed an IVC injury.

885
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,460
What? An IVC injury
that's supposed to be super hard?

886
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,379
Goodness, congratulations, Dr. Seo Woojin.

887
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,714
Is that it?

888
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,507
Then what else do you want?

889
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,093
Beer? Or wine?

890
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:56,806
Something like this.

891
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:01,102
Gosh, Dr. Seo!
What are you doing in broad daylight?

892
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,438
Euntak told you to get some sleep,

893
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,190
but you're making moves on me?

894
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,774
Isn't this why we moved in together?

895
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:10,820
(Eunjae sighs)

896
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,364
Right. I'll explain it once more,
so listen carefully.

897
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:16,951
The reason why we decided
to move in together is, first,

898
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:20,580
to reduce our expenses
since we've spent so much

899
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,707
on monthly rent over the past three years.

900
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,459
-That's the first reason.
-And?

901
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:25,793
You and I are both so busy,

902
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:29,047
so it's a hassle to go into town
every weekend to go on dates.

903
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,926
So reducing the time and distance to be
more efficient is the second reason.

904
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,260
Is that it?

905
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,889
So let's stop messing around
and unpack our stuff, Dr. Seo Woojin.

906
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,142
Where's the memo I gave you
before we moved?

907
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,811
You remember that, right?
I cook and you do the dishes.

908
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,230
Recycling, me. Food waste, you.

909
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,774
Living room and bedroom, me.
Bathroom and yard, you.

910
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,859
Just as we agreed. Nice and neat. Okay?

911
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,946
I have a question, Dr. Cha.

912
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,657
Then when do we get to kiss?

913
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,575
Well, that's…

914
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:02,121
Just whenever the mood is right.

915
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,082
Then when do we sleep?

916
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,959
That's also…

917
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,211
when you're tired.

918
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,379
Sleep on your own time.

919
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,381
"On your own time?"

920
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,633
Of course, on our own.
How else would it be?

921
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,180
What? What are you imagining?

922
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,807
The same thing you just imagined.

923
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,934
Gosh. Dr. Seo!

924
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:26,187
Will you really make things rated-R
at every chance?

925
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,605
I totally will.

926
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,690
Hey!

927
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,525
EUNJAE: No.

928
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,194
Dr. Seo!

929
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,822
There are so many boxes to unpack!

930
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,616
-Go away.
-Okay.

931
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,660
-Okay!
-Wait!

932
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,913
Hey, hang on! Okay, wait.

933
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,832
EUNJAE: Wait a second.

934
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,667
-No, wait--
-No waiting.

935
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:48,751
(Eunjae squeals, giggles)

936
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:52,672
WOOJIN: What should we do now?

937
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:57,969
(rhythmic tapping)

938
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:01,556
(tapping continues)

939
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,146
Why, those little punks.

940
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,330
Are Seo Woojin and Cha Eunjae
still not here?

941
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,374
Oh, they're both off this morning.
They'll come to work in the afternoon.

942
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,502
There was a gunshot wound patient
on a military base last night.

943
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,796
They were called out urgently
and worked all night.

944
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,508
Where is that gunshot wound patient?

945
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,221
I'm not sure. Maybe the military hospital?

946
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,431
I don't know either.

947
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:46,059
What?

948
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,393
Wait…

949
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,354
(Hojun sighs)

950
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,440
(phone buzzes)

951
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:55,818
(groans)

952
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,155
INSU: Hey.

953
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,992
(pensive music)

954
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,047
TRAUMA CENTER

955
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:18,591
(groans)

956
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:41,072
TRAUMA CENTER

957
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,493
MYEONGSIM: Dr. Yang?

958
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,872
(chuckles awkwardly)

959
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,292
What are you doing there?

960
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,293
Oh, I just thought

961
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,504
I saw people in there.

962
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:58,756
I was wondering what it was.

963
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,926
I thought the trauma center
wasn't open yet.

964
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,386
(sighs)
I know, right?

965
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,930
Why is there so much

966
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:09,350
to prepare and check to get approval
for completion of the building?

967
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,686
I couldn't do it all myself,

968
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,147
so I asked a few people
to take care of it.

969
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,526
Will you help me out too?

970
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:21,654
-There's so much work to do.
-(groans)

971
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,990
Goodness.
(chuckles, sucks teeth)

972
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,324
I'm a bit busy right now.

973
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,368
I have a lot of papers to read.

974
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,287
Can't you spare some time?

975
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,872
Well, not right now.

976
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,623
Maybe next time.

977
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:33,541
Bye then.

978
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,584
(mutters)

979
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,253
(quirky music)

980
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,052
Goodness.

981
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,304
(laughs awkwardly)

982
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:48,973
(exclaims)

983
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,230
(sighs)

984
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,108
That's weird.

985
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,612
Something is definitely up.

986
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,074
(in English)
Mr. Koo?

987
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,269
They're from
the National Intelligence Service.

988
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,779
AGENT: Does it hurt anywhere?

989
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:47,031
This must've hurt.

990
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,534
Do you want to go eat something?

991
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,702
What do you like?

992
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,583
(sighs)

993
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,466
(male agent murmuring)

994
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,848
AGENT 2: Could you tell us why
you came here?

995
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:30,658
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

996
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:48,676
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

997
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,973
The trauma center is this way.

998
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,571
(panicked breathing)

999
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,158
(cell phone buzzing)

1000
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:14,994
(gasps)

1001
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,245
DIRECTOR PARK MINGUK

1002
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,456
(exhales deeply)

1003
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:20,708
Yes, Director Park?

1004
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,209
MINGUK: Where are you right now?

1005
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:25,630
Right now? I stepped out for a while.

1006
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,089
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1007
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:29,425
My gosh!

1008
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:32,553
What are you doing here?

1009
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,682
Oh, well, that's…

1010
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,895
I was just about to step out for a bit!
(laughs awkwardly)

1011
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,148
What is it this time?

1012
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,651
Tell me.

1013
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,783
(suspenseful music)

1014
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:57,995
(monitor beeping)

1015
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,081
(mellow music)

1016
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,269
Dr. Kim.

1017
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:04,979
Oh, hey.

1018
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,189
How is the patient?

1019
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,858
He's stable so far.

1020
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,609
His urine output is good too.

1021
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,652
Mm.

1022
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,198
Have you been taking your medicine?

1023
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,451
Haven't skipped a day.

1024
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:22,580
If I'm to keep this job for a long time,
I need to be prompt with my meds.

1025
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:23,748
(chuckles)

1026
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,294
Thank you for coming during your vacation.

1027
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:31,005
You would've been fine without me.

1028
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:35,509
You should go ahead and take care
of things you can do on your own, Dr. Seo.

1029
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:39,096
I still have a lot to learn, Master.

1030
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:42,725
And with you around,

1031
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,352
I feel like my surgeries go better.

1032
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:48,689
And I feel more confident too.

1033
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,941
Gosh, Seo Woojin.

1034
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:54,862
You're becoming good at flattery.

1035
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:57,156
Where did you learn
to say stuff like that?

1036
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,201
I'm not trying to flatter you.
It's the truth.

1037
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:01,744
Okay.

1038
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,204
It really is the truth, sir.

1039
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:06,540
(laughing)
Gosh, okay. I get it.

1040
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:11,212
GITAE: Master Kim!

1041
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,005
Master Kim!

1042
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,382
Do you have any idea what's happening now?

1043
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,344
(Gitae pants)

1044
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:19,303
GITAE: Right now…

1045
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:22,807
Director Park.

1046
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,142
-You're here.
-MINGUK: Master Kim.

1047
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,436
-Yes?
-What is this situation?

1048
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,397
(sighs)

1049
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,900
I was going to explain when you got here.

1050
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:34,819
Let's head to your office for now.

1051
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:35,736
(sighs)

1052
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:45,871
(tense music)

1053
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,302
SABU: What's going on?

1054
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,180
I offered him a position here.

1055
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,308
He wanted to see the trauma center first.

1056
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:08,269
Right.

1057
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,104
That's why he's here.

1058
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:12,648
It's been a while.

1059
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,109
Mm.

1060
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:19,155
(footsteps echoing)

1061
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,951
(tense music intensifies)

1062
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,204
(scoffs)

1063
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,085
It's been a while, Eunjae.

1064
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:39,717
Dad.

1065
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,430
(mouths)
Dad?

1066
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,390
(mouths)
Dad?

1067

1084
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,080
