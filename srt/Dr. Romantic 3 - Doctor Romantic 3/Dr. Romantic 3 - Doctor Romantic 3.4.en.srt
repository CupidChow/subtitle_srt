-Hurry, there's a fire!
-(music fades)

19
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,870
WOMAN 2: Yes, at the intersection.
There's a fire!

20
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,497
MAN 1: Are they okay?

21
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,874

(music swells, fades)

25
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,777
Are we starting with a neurorrhaphy?

26
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,988
Then when should I go in?

27
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,073
EUNJAE: What are you saying?
You have to come in right away.

28
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,493
Dr. Lee, this isn't
your everyday neurorrhaphy.

29
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,080
You should consider it an honor
to witness Master Kim's neurorrhaphy.

30
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,593
EUNJAE: Don't worry.

31
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,553
(tense music)

32
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,597
EUNJAE: I'm sure it'll go well.

33
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,559
Mm.

34
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,954
(exhales)

35
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,043
WOOJIN: Please succeed…

36
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,712
Dr. Kim.

37
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,509

SABU: Scalpel no. 15, please.

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,608
Retractor.

41
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,530
Hey, Lee Seonung. Look more closely.

42
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,657
SEONUNG: Okay…

43
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,748
SABU: Suction.

44
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,501
Bovie.

45
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,925
Metzenbaum.

46
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,098
Tenotomy.

47
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,855
A vessel loop in blue, please.

48
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,701
Now, yellow.

49
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,417
One more blue, please.

50
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,632
Another yellow.

51
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,471
All right.

52
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,514
Take this.

53
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,142
Dr. Cha Eunjae, pull.

54
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,155
(Sabu exhales)

55
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,167
SABU: We'll continue
without removing the tourniquet. Metz.

56
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,636

58
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,270
SABU: Clamp.

59
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,941
Another clamp.

60
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,612
Suture.

61
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,538
(Sabu exhales)

62
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,757
SABU: Cut, please.

63
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,843
Another suture.

64
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,058
EUNJAE: Are we using
an interrupted suture?

65
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,686
SABU: You must use interrupted sutures
to maintain the shape of the nerve,

66
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,816
because this thread can trigger
the nerve and cause pain.

OPERATION TIME, ANESTHESIA TIME
CURRENT TIME

68
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,826
DOIL (in English): Nice.

69
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,830
SABU (in Korean): All right, it is
Dr. Bae Munjeong and Eunjae's turn.

70
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,373
-Let's switch places.
-MUNJEONG: Okay.

71
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,709
All right, keep it steady.

72
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,796
Forcep.

73
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,049
Bovie.

74
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,136
Let's start.

75
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,610
(Woojin sighs)

76
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,070
DONGHWA: Wow.

77
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,322
Did they finish the neurorrhaphy already?

78
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,076
I suppose it is good
to have someone that has your back.

79
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,997
Without Master Kim,

80
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,083
this surgery wouldn't have been possible.

81
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,210
(tense music)

82
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,422
I'll be clocking out now.

83
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,936
OPERATING ROOM

84
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,238
(people clamoring and screaming)

85
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,827
(clamoring and screaming continue)

86
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,679
GITAE: Check for respiration.
Please calm down.

87
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,643
GITAE: You have to register.

88
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,770
Please let us know
if you're having trouble breathing.

89
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,188
Out of the way, please.

90
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,817
YEONGMI: What are you doing?

91
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,152
You have patients to look at.

92
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,696
(background clamoring)

93
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:53,991
Seriously…

94
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,326
(groans)

95
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,458
INSU: Carefully now. One, two, three.

96
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,669
I'm taking this off.

97
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,505
Vitals are 80/40. Heart rate 120.

98
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,924
PARAMEDIC 1: She collapsed in the corridor
of the burning building.

99
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,801
She was found under some rubble

100
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,678
and was unconscious
at the time of discovery.

101
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,638
There are signs of severe muscle guarding.

102
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,433
The hip joint isn't in good shape either.

103
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,519
Start two, full drip IV lines.

104
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,729
-A sonogram and a portable X-ray too.
-Okay.

105
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,022
Nurse Joo, page the GS on call.

106
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,065
Page Dr. Bae too.

107
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,441
Dr. Bae is in surgery though.

108
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,735
-Ask him to come as soon as he's finished.
-Okay.

109
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,279
PARAMEDIC 2: Incoming burn patient!

110
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,991
-Go quickly, Dr. Yoon Areum.
-AREUM: Okay!

111
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,662
Let's move the patient. One, two, three.

112
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,873
She's a woman in her late 20s.

113
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,127
PARAMEDIC 2: It looks like she was
engulfed by the flames while escaping.

114
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,921
Secure the airway, quickly!

115
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,840
Okay, let's start with intubation.

116
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,598
MUNJEONG: I can't see.

117
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,724
EUNJAE: Hold it correctly.

118
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,851
SABU: Focus.

119
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,227
SEONUNG: Yes, sir!

120
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,064
MUNJEONG: Metzen.

121
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,111
Irrigation, this way.

122
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,614
Suction.

123
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,034
(phone vibrates)

124
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,538
Seo Woojin speaking.

125
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,255
(Insu pants)

126
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,467
The bleeding
is more severe than I thought.

127
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,886
The airway is too swollen, Dr. Jung.

128
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,888
Perform a cricothyroidotomy then.

129
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,307
What? Me?

130
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,933
Is the GS not here yet?

131
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,602
Where is the portable X-ray?

132
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,686
MAN 2: It's here!

133
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,021
Please make way!

134
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,149
We'll do the pelvis first.

135
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,404
(machines beeping)

136
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,366
The patient's saturation levels
keep falling, Dr. Yoon.

137
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,828
Nurse Eom, prepare for a CTT.

138
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,379
DOIL: Yes? Okay, I understand.

139
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,800
A fire broke out in a nearby villa.

140
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,801
SABU: Huh?

141
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,679
DOIL: They're bringing in all the patients
to our hospital.

142
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,432
Some of them seem
to have a few broken bones too.

143
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,517
SABU: Mm.

144
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,852
MUNJEONG: I'll leave first.

145
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,020
SABU: Okay, you do that.

146
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,897
MUNJEONG: Here you go, Dr. Lee Seonung.

147
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,190
SEONUNG: Oh, okay.

148
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,278
EUNJAE: I'm almost finished here too.

149
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,619
The great saphenous vein, please.

150
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,502
Scissor.

151
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,469
Micro forceps, please.

152
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,899
Suture, please.

153
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,079
(Sabu exhales)

154
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,790
SABU: All right, I'll leave now too.

155
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,293
Keep up the good work, Cha Eunjae.

156
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,544
EUNJAE: I got it. Don't worry.

157
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,005
Nurse Euntak, heparin, please.

158
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,394
(clears throat)

159
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,313
Where are you going
in the middle of surgery?

160
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,106
What are you talking about?

161
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,692
My surgery ended some time ago.

162
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,279
Don't you see Dr. Cha Eunjae
operating on the blood vessels?

163
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,822
Do you think something will happen?

164
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,450
What kind of nonsense…

165
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,618
If there's a problem,

166
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,914
I'm asking if you're planning to make
Eunjae take responsibility for it all.

167
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,165
(laughs)

168
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,249
Don't laugh.

169
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,837
The way you think and the way you speak…

170
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:22,593
Gosh, you haven't changed one bit.
You're exactly the same.

171
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,094
Don't change the subject.

172
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,472
Who are you doubting?

173
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,765
Me or Cha Eunjae?

174
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,393
I perfectly completed my surgery.

175
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,604
On the off chance
you don't trust your daughter,

176
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,315
she's doing a fine job in there.

177
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,651
So you don't have to worry about that.

178
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,197
If you're that curious,
go inside and look for yourself.

179
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,091
(sighs)

180
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,766
WOOJIN: What are you doing?
You said you'd leave.

181
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,353
So I can be treated like scum again?

182
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,354
(scoffs)

183
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:16,939
Follow me.

184
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,944
-(sighs)
-(clattering)

185
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,737
Please finish up the dressing for me.

186
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,738
NURSE 1: Okay.

187
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,964
AREUM: Scalpel blade no. 11, please.

188
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,635
(Areum breathes shakily)

189
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,658
AREUM: A tracheal hook, please.

190
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,871
HYEONJEONG: Oh, okay.

191
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,837
AREUM: Hold it, please.

192
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,176
AREUM: A tube, please.

193
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,065
AREUM: Ambu bag, please.

194
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,210
(Areum sighs in relief)

195
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,420
(Areum laughs lightly)

196
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,757
(Areum sighs in relief)

197
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,258
(Areum sighs)

198
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,719
(curtain opens)

199
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,097
Move on to the next step quickly.

200
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,348
AREUM: Master Kim.

201
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,350
HYEONJEONG: Just now,
Dr. Yoon performed a crico--

202
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,894
You need to apply
wet gauze onto the burns.

203
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,104
HYEONJEONG: Right. Yes.

204
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,616
SABU: My gosh.

205
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,539
There seems to be
severe contracture on the right arm.

206
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,125
AREUM: Yes, that seems to be the case.

207
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,209
SABU: Nurse Kim.

208
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,504
Hydration and warm saline
for both IV lines, please.

209
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,588
NURSE KIM: Yes, Doctor.

210
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,428
SABU: Dr. Yoon Areum,
have you ever performed an escharotomy?

211
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,971
AREUM: Yes, of course.

212
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,098
SABU: I see. Go ahead then.

213
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,349
AREUM: Yes, Doctor.

214
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,354
Nurse Eom, scalpel blade no. 10, please.

215
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,112
SABU: Not too deep.

216
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,617
Just until the subcutaneous level.

217
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,872
Just like that.

218
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,500
Nurse Eom.

219
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,753
I'll stay here,

220
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,756
so could you contact
the burn center in Seoul?

221
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,091
Tell them we need to transfer
this burn patient urgently.

222
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,843
HYEONJEONG: Yes, Master Kim.

223
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,646
(dialing)

224
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,982
This is Doldam Hospital in Jeongseon.

225
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,860
We'd like to request a doctor helicopter
to the burn center in Seoul.

226
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,445
Yes.

227
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,197
(Insu sighs)

228
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,657
ISNU: This looks worse than I thought.

229
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,827
The condition of the hip joints
isn't good either.

230
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,413
What if we try to stabilize
the vitals with damage control

231
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,581
and pack the bleeding?

232
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,085
It depends on how damaged the surrounding
blood vessels and bones are.

233
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,878
Oh? What is this?

234
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,885
(suspenseful music)

235
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,013
It can't be…

236
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,349
Uh…

237
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:22,976
(in English) Oh my God.

238
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:36,406
(in Korean) I think we should inform
the police first.

239
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,992
Nurse Joo, hand it over.

240
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,124
This is Doldam Hospital's
Emergency Center.

241
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,292
Yes.

242
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,878
What should we do, Dr. Seo?

243
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,881
Whether this old lady
committed arson or not,

244
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,591
that's for the police to decide.

245
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,802
We should take care
of the hemoperitoneum first.

246
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,472
Prepare 10 mcg
of norepinephrine, Nurse Joo.

247
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,557
Okay.

248
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,603
She might go
into hypovolemic shock in her condition.

249
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,690
She's old too. Are you sure?

250
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,152
WOOJIN: It's the best we can do
before we can operate on her.

251
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,113
Jang Donghwa, go ask Dr. Nam Doil

252
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,699
when Operating Room Two
will be ready and make preparations.

253
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,788
What are you doing? Go.

254
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,670
By the way,
is norepinephrine the right call?

255
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,006
What?

256
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,551
WOOJIN: What do you mean?

257
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,887
I just remembered learning that
during a hypovolemic shock,

258
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,723
using norepinephrine will only
increase the myocardial oxygen demand.

259
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,352
If the shock lasts,
it could cause a vicious cycle to occur.

260
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,397
And there's no solution for that.
Does that answer your question?

261
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,400
Is that so?

262
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,491
I was just making sure.

263
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,786
I don't want you to be wrong this time.

264
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:09,958
Dr. Jang.

265
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,753
I apologize if I offended you.

266
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,926
What's with him?

267
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:42,950
(scoffs)

268
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,284
What are you doing?

269
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,203
What did you think
you were doing in there?

270
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,081
I was just telling you my opinion.
Am I not allowed to do that?

271
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,792
Are you sure it was an opinion?
You weren't being tongue-in-cheek?

272
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,461
Not necessarily,

273
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,922
but it can't be helped
if that's how it sounded.

274
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:57,965
(scoffs)

275
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,885
What is it? Why are you doing this?

276
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,805
Do you really not know?

277
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,891
No, I don't know. So tell me what it is.

278
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,520
I said we should let him rest!

279
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,315
(Donghwa inhales shakily)

280
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,276
You told me not to be nosy,

281
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,237
but look at what happened to that patient.

282
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:24,783
Master Kim was able
to connect the patient's nerves,

283
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,454
but there's no guarantee
that he can go ski jumping anymore.

284
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:34,751
Imagine how hard he must've worked
to become a national athlete!

285
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,756
You could have let him rest
for those few hours…

286
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,885
Then, he might not have been hurt.

287
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,099
Then why didn't you
tell me from the start?

288
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,562
Without beating around the bush,
without being sarcastic? Just straight up!

289
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,899
You could have looked me in the eyes
and told me what you were thinking.

290
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,986
WOOJIN: So I could give you
a proper answer.

291
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,364
So I could tell you why you were wrong
and why I thought differently.

292
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,075
Don't you even feel sorry
for that national athlete?

293
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,785
Don't you feel guilty?

294
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,246
No, I don't.

295
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,998
A doctor

296
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,002
makes a diagnosis, not a prediction.

297
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:23,216
We don't deal
with people who might get hurt.

298
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,844
We deal with patients
who are already hurt, sick, broken,

299
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,637
or on their last breath.

300
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,682
Patients come in every day.

301
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,186
I can't hang
onto those unfortunate situations.

302
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,230
WOOJIN: It happened
because I wasn't good enough.

303
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,192
To avoid making the same mistake,

304
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,695
all I can do is focus
on the patient in front of me.

305
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,322
That's…

306
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,533
how I repay my shortcomings.

307
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,870
Does that answer your question?

308
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,419
So hurry up and go focus
on doing your work.

309
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,055
(snorts)

310
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:14,142
Acting like he's better than me.
He's so full of himself.

311
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,569
What have you been up to?

312
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:30,492
I heard Dr. Seo Woojin tell you
to prepare an operation room.

313
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,000
(sighs)

314
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,712
Dr. Nam Doil,

315
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,715
when will surgery be over?

316
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,347
DOIL: Dr. Cha Eunjae,
how much longer will this take?

317
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,474
EUNJAE: I'm taking the clamps off.

318
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,982
There's no leak, right?

319
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,316
EUNTAK: No, there isn't.

320
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,818
EUNJAE: All right. I'll be closing up now.

321
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,486
DOIL: About 10 more minutes.

322
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,947
In 10 minutes,
I'll open Operation Room Two.

323
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,284
EUNJAE: Did you hear that, Dr. Lee?
Dr. Nam gave us 10 minutes.

324
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,702
You can finish in ten, right?

325
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:15,996
SEONUNG: Me?

326
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,125
I don't have much
real-life experience yet…

327
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,211
EUNJAE: That's why you should work
on quickly building up that experience.

328
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,883
All right.
Let's see how bad you are. Go ahead.

329
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,722
-(upbeat percussive music)
-(Seonung exhales)

330
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,060
SEONUNG: Suture, please.

331
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,248
(music warps)

332
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,668
(quirky music)

333
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,642
(Seonung breathes shakily)

334
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,900
EUNJAE: Wait, stop!

335
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,156
SEONUNG: Yes?

336
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,242
EUNJAE: Now that I think about it,

337
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,787
I should finish it this time.

338
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,248
There are a lot of emergency patients,
and Dr. Nam has to go.

339
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,375
Suture, please.

340
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,670
SEONUNG: I'm sorry.

341
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,387
-EUNJAE: Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

342
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,141
-EUNJAE: Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

343
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,101
(snips)

344
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,278
Excuse me, Dr. Cha.

345
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,030
You did well, Dr. Lee. You must be tired.

346
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,825
I'll see you tomorrow.

347
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,333
MYEONGSIM: It was
because he was nervous, right?

348
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,921
It's his first surgery in
an unfamiliar hospital and operating room.

349
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,635
But still, it was a simple suture,
so that was a bit…

350
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,555
DOIL: I heard that they don't give
residents a lot of surgeries

351
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:42,058
because a lot of patients sue these days.

352
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,395
That's why nowadays,
even some fellows aren't as skilled.

353
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,606
MYEONGSIM: But still, he got his license.

354
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,190
With those skills…

355
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,275
(Doil laughs)

356
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,818
DOIL: What else can we do?

357
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,696
Let's do our best
to raise our green newbie.

358
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,617
Ah, I'll be going now
since I have to open Operating Room Two.

359
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,788
(Euntak laughs softly)

360
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,553
-(sighs)
-(door opens)

361
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,097
(approaching footsteps)

362
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,601
Jaehyun's mother?

363
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,394
Dr. Cha.

364
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,855
What happened to Jaehyun?

365
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,273
What about my mother-in-law?

366
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,441
What?

367
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,696
(patient coughing)

368
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,366
(gasps)

369
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,201
Ma'am, are you okay?

370
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,202
(coughs)

371
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,370
WOMAN: Dr. Eunjae?

372
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,996
Dr. Eunjae, I can't believe it.

373
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,998
-Saehyun?
-NURSE 2: Come with me to get checked.

374
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,167
-SAEHYUN: I mean…
-You should get checked out first.

375
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,126
SAEHYUN: There was a fire…

376
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,628
(sighs)

377
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,754
One moment, please.

378
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,175
(patient coughing)

379
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,720
Dr. Yoon Areum,
is there anything I can help you with?

380
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,805
Oh.

381
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,224
For now, I've done everything I could.

382
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,893
AREUM: I'm waiting
to transfer her to a burn center.

383
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,436
Oh, okay.

384
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,439
Is something the matter?
Do you know this person?

385
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,151
Yeah, they're people I knew
from the villa I used to live in.

386
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,653
Oh.

387
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,363
Hm?

388
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,615
Did you move? When?

389
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,908
Last week.

390
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:25,370
This patient moved into my old apartment.

391
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,123
Ooh.

392
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,374
I see.

393
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,751
How did the fire start?
Have you heard anything?

394
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,670
About that…

395
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,464
AREUM: The old lady over there

396
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,426
had a lighter on her.

397
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,441
(gasps)

398
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,276
Jaehyun's grandmother?

399
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,028
What?

400
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,030
My mother?

401
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,199
Your mother had a lighter

402
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,285
and the fire originated on the same floor.

403
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,703
POLICE: Eyewitness accounts match too.

404
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,496
By any chance,

405
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,166
did she show any symptoms
of depression or dementia?

406
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,334
No, she's healthy.

407
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,503
But why…

408
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,131
What are we going to do?

409
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,761
HYEONJEONG: Her son's business
failed due to the pandemic,

410
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,013
so his family came to stay at her place.

411
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,849
The six-year-old child is
usually left with the grandmother

412
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,517
while the son and his wife work.

413
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,353
According to eyewitnesses,

414
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,898
she seemed pessimistic about life.

415
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:36,983
How upsetting.

416
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,235
What do we do?

417
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,237
I feel bad for the woman.

418
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,657
She's so young and got all those burns.

419
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,661
It's strange though.
It's not like her to do that.

420
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,374
She was a very cheerful person.

421
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,919
She would joke around
and sing all the time.

422
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,004
EUNJAE: Even when her son came down

423
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,173
after his business failed,
she never seemed upset.

424
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,676
She was actually really happy
to get to live with Jaehyun.

425
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,514
They say it's scariest when depression
comes in the form of a smile.

426
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,099
There's evidence and witnesses.

427
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,559
Everything points to her, Dr. Cha.

428
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,853
Who are the witnesses?

429
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,403
(suspenseful music)

430
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,455
RESTRICTED AREA
OPERATING ROOM

431
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,624
Why are you outside?

432
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,210
What about the patient?

433
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,419
We're waiting.

434
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,879
She's not here yet?

435
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:44,217
The guardians are here,
but they haven't signed yet.

436
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,513
Mother.

437
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,683
(shouting)
Why did you do it?

438
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,228
You could've said
that you were having a hard time!

439
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,896
Why did you do it?

440
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,649
What am I supposed to do?

441
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,110
(Jungmin sobs)

442
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,157
JUNGMIN: Why did you cause
such a disaster?

443
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,951
Why?

444
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,203
What were you going to do?

445
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,124
(sobs)

446
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,587
EUNTAK: Sir.

447
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,965
Please sign the surgical consent form.

448
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,554
The patient's life will be
in danger the longer you take.

449
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,848
Honey.

450
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,851
(coughs)

451
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,020
-(machines beeping)
-(tense music)

452
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,188
MAN 3: What happened?

453
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,315
JAEHYUN'S MOM: Mother!

454
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,025
Mother!

455
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,527
Dr. Jung, it's hematemesis.

456
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,486
We'll start a suction.

457
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,655
Mother!

458
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,740
-JUNGMIN: Mom!
-Nurse Eom!

459
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,658
-Guardians, please step outside.
-Mom!

460
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,077
-JAEHYUN'S MOM: Mother-in-law!
-Oxygen levels are low!

461
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,329
-Let's start intubation.
-Okay.

462
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,039
(machines continue beeping)

463
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,498
What happened?

464
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,251
Her vitals are bad
and saturation levels keep dropping.

465
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,506
Are you the guardian?

466
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,301
We need to perform emergency surgery
to stop the bleeding.

467
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,802
Every second counts!

468
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,348
Sir!

469
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,895
We don't have money to pay for surgery.

470
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,021
(crowd gasps)

471
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,941
(sighs)

472
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,360
I'm sorry…

473
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,740
but we really don't have any money.

474
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,912
Everything we make
goes toward paying off our loans.

475
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,248
There's no way…

476
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,418
(cries)

477
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,503
So…

478
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,298
are you really going
to let your mother die?

479
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,054
If we delay any longer,
we really won't be able to do anything!

480
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,222
(sobs)

481
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,682
WOOJIN: Sir!

482
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,061
SABU: Move the patient
to the operating room now.

483
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,021
WOOJIN: Master Kim.

484
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,448
-The consent form, please.
-Yes, Master Kim.

485
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,786
SABU: Please, sign it now.

486
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:20,790
As Chief of Surgery,
I'll cover the cost of the surgery.

487
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,175
What are you doing, Dr. Seo Woojin?
You said that every second counts.

488
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,261
Let's move the patient!

489
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,474
Nurse Euntak!

490
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,271
INSU: Please get out of the way!

491
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,689
(people murmuring)

492
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,941
STAFF 1: Please get out of the way.

493
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,317
Out of the way!

494
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,496
Are you not going to sign?

495
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,332
But, Doctor…

496
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,752
How could I…

497
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,007
(sighs)

498
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,511
If your mother were in your position,
what do you think she'd do?

499
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:22,143
If the person on
that hospital bed were you,

500
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,147
would your mother give up on you
because she didn't have money?

501
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,908
WOMAN 1: Jungmin.

502
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,577
Hurry up and sign.

503
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,205
First things first is
to save your mother's life.

504
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,956
That's right.

505
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,585
This isn't the time
to talk about fire or faults.

506
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,671
WOMAN 2: You should save
your mother's life. Do that first.

507
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,007
WOMAN 3: Exactly, your mother's life
is more important.

508
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,468
You can just earn the money back.

509
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,178
MAN 4: Exactly. There's no other solution.

510
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,721
-MAN 5: Sign it.
-MAN 6: Hurry up and sign it.

511
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,431
-Go ahead and sign it.
-WOMAN 4: Do it.

512
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,308
-WOMAN 4: Sign it.
-MAN 7: Quickly now. Sign it.

513
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,559
(sobs)

514
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,106
SABU: Here you go.

515
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,530
(Jungmin sniffles)

516
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,872
(sobs)

517
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,171
(continues sobbing)

518
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,267
EMERGENCY ROOM

519
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,227
(mysterious music)

520
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,324
Sir, wait!

521
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,410
-Me?
-Where are you going?

522
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,412
Your treatment doesn't
seem to be over yet.

523
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,583
You see,
I have something urgent to take care of.

524
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,918
I heard you're a witness.

525
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,463
Mr. Koo.

526
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,175
Mr. Koo!

527
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,344
What are you doing?

528
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,762
Which apartment do you live in?

529
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,804
What?

530
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,265
I used to live in that villa
until last week,

531
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,059
but I don't remember seeing you before.

532
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,646
You're not a resident there, are you?

533
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,023
Move.

534
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,233
Who are you?

535
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,984
EUNJAE: Why are you pretending
to be a resident?

536
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,403
How did you witness the fire?

537
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,905
I said, move!

538
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,282
Where are you going?

539
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,117
You little…

540
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,203
What the…

541
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,670
Violence is not allowed in the hospital.
Lower your hand.

542
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,554
DOIL: Set up a RIS.

543
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,723
-Are the monitors connected?
-NURSE 3: Yes.

544
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,141
WOOJIN: How are the patient's vitals?

545
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,145
DOIL: A bit unstable, but I'll do my best
to keep them from falling.

546
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,981
(Woojin sighs)

547
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,066
SABU: Hey.

548
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,734
WOOJIN: What about Dr. Jang?

549
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,319
SABU: I told him to clock out.

550
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,031
-WOOJIN: What?
-SABU: I'll assist you. Don't worry.

551
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,950
Begin immediately, Dr. Seo Woojin.

552
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,204
WOOJIN: There's severe
intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

553
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,623
Organs may spill out as soon as we open.

554
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,626
May I start, Dr. Nam?

555
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,920
DOIL: Yes, you may.

556
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:19,714
WOOJIN: Scalpel.

557
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,016
Bovie.

558
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,772
Metz.

559
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,029
Gauze!

560
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,290
SABU: Pour all the normal saline we have.

561
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,714
WOOJIN: Richardson retractor.

562
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,935
DOIL: Bring some more blood.

563
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:15,936
NURSE 4: Okay.

564
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,246
SABU: There are

565
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,957
only two types of doctors
in the operation room.

566
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,752
One who wants to save the patient
and one who wants to learn.

567
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,837
If you're not one of them,
you don't pick up a knife

568
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,714
and stand at the operation table.

569
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,678
Are you scolding me?

570
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,931
At least you're not so dull.

571
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:55,226
Why? Is it because I talked
back to Dr. Seo Woojin?

572
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,727
It's okay to talk back.

573
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,814
If you have different opinions,

574
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,900
you can argue, especially if it's
for the patient's well-being.

575
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:03,859
Then?

576
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,778
But that's not the case for you.

577
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,572
You're not voicing opinions,
you're trying to pick a fight.

578
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,491
Then how am I supposed to understand?

579
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,702
He sent a national athlete away
for "faking an illness,"

580
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,622
but is trying his best
to save an old lady who committed arson!

581
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,374
(scoffs)

582
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,836
What kind of nonsense are you spouting?

583
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,754
SABU: So what are you saying?

584
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,383
We should have kept the national athlete
in the hospital even if he was faking it,

585
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,595
but it doesn't matter
if an arsonist lives or dies?

586
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,305
Come on, sir!

587
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,348
A doctor,

588
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:39,311
as soon as he puts on his surgical gown,
must not discriminate against any patient.

589
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,189
All patients should be
treated equally and fairly.

590
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:46,152
Whether it's a national athlete,
an arsonist, or even a murderer,

591
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:50,990
as long as you're a doctor,
you have a duty to treat the patient.

592
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,576
That's the fate and responsibility
of being a doctor, understood?

593
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,953
Why are you arguing about faults

594
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,788
and debating over
who is good and who is bad

595
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,166
in front of a dying person?

596
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,335
Hey, you might as well go
be a judge or prosecutor then

597
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,753
instead of being here!

598
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,299
(sighs)

599
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,636
From now on, you're not allowed
in the operating room until I permit it.

600
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,973
Without the intention to save or learn,

601
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,933
the operating room is off-limits.

602
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,353
How dare you pick up a scalpel
with that kind of mindset?

603
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,105
Are you trying to get someone killed?

604
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,276
(huffs angrily)

605
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,028
Were you this kind of person?

606
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,324
-What?
-I thought you were different, Dr. Kim.

607
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,577
You're just as condescending
as the other professors.

608
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,662
What did you just say?

609
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:42,666
"Don't get in the way and mess around."

610
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,670
You're just trying to get me to fall in,
aren't you?

611
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,963
(laughs)

612
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,301
Take a look at this punk…

613
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,469
(inhales sharply)

614
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:58,349
You really know how to use harsh words
to grind someone's gears.

615
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,977
What do you mean by "punk"?
Don't talk to me however you want!

616
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,271
Don't call me doctor then!

617
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,901
Hey, you can't even tell
whether it's education or discipline.

618
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,822
You disregard everything older people say,
calling it bossy and condescending.

619
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,576
"Doctor"?
Who the hell are you calling doctor?

620
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,205
Dr. Jang Donghwa,

621
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,626
you're free to call people
"this punk" or "that punk" as well.

622
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:34,051
Just so you know, this is my temperament.

623
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,262
Punks who don't even try

624
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,431
but talk about
the unfairness of the world.

625
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:43,435
Punks without any skill
who boast about themselves

626
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,521
simply because they wear
the gowns of a doctor.

627
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,773
Punks who don't do their job properly

628
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:51,026
and complain about everything!

629
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:51,944
I just…

630
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,282
really enjoy humbling them.
It's my specialty.

631
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,493
SABU: Keep that in mind.

632
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,746
(solemn music)

633
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,478
-WOOJIN: Dr. Kim, please hold this.
-SABU: Okay.

634
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,147
Clamp.

635
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:32,985
One more clamp.

636
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,326
WOOJIN: Tie.

637
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,042
-WOOJIN: Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

638
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,127
WOOJIN: Another tie.

639
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,050
-Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

640
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,055
(Sabu exhales)

641
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,015
SABU: The color
of the bowels doesn't look good.

642
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,809
We need to check if it's because of shock

643
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,479
or if there's any necrosis.

644
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,606
WOOJIN: I'll perform a biopsy.

645
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,650
We'll do a frozen section biopsy.

646
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,835
(crowd murmuring)

647
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,051
What's going on?

648
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:40,886
The arsonist.

649
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,223
-What?
-It's not the old lady

650
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,850
but that guy who set the villa on fire.

651
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,895
EUNJAE: Jaehyun's grandmother saw him

652
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,605
and she got hurt trying to stop him.

653
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,025
It seems like she tried her best
to take the lighter from him.

654
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,905
The woman who moved into my old place
set up a CCTV outside the house,

655
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,032
and it caught everything that happened.

656
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,160
EUNJAE: And he just now confessed it all.

657
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,543
Mr. Koo, good work.
We couldn't have done it without you.

658
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,294
Call me whenever you need me, Dr. Cha.

659
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:15,796
(chuckles)

660
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,594
Let's go.

661
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,139
(crowd murmuring)

662
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:33,021
SABU: All patients should be
treated equally and fairly.

663
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:36,692
Whether it's a national athlete,
an arsonist, or even a murderer…

664
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,611
…all I can do is focus
on the patient in front of me.

665
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,209
EUNJAE: Vitals look good.

666
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,630
Let me know if there's any change
in the color of the toe,

667
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,174
NURSE 5: Okay.

668
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,100
(sighs)

669
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,063
NURSE 6:
The frozen biopsy results are out.

670
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,565
It's cancer.

671
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,158
(Woojin exhales)

672
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,619
WOOJIN: This old lady…

673
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,247
Should we say she's lucky or unlucky?

674
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,583
DOIL: Let's take it positively.

675
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:37,377
The cancer she never knew she had.

676
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,296
It was found. By us.

677
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,717
SABU: All right, operating surgeon.
What should we do?

678
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,596
WOOJIN: We need to cut more margins.

679
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,516
SABU: Let's remove the lymph nodes
around the aorta too.

680
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,518
WOOJIN: What about the OS?

681
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,853
MUNJEONG: The surrounding vessels
and muscles are severely damaged.

682
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,814
I don't think metal plates
will support it.

683
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,273
For now, just pack the area clean.

684
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,860
Also, it'll take at least two weeks
to make the artificial joint.

685
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,279
We'll schedule
the second surgery accordingly.

686
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,281
SABU (in English): Okay.

687
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,242
WOOJIN (in Korean): Give me warm saline
and surgical pads.

688
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,996
-WOOJIN: Bovie.
-SABU: Suction.

689
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,583
WOOJIN: Kelly.

690
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,795
SABU: Tie.

691
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,883
-WOOJIN: All right, cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

692
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,303
WOOJIN: Metzen.

693
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,307
(Doil exhales)

694
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,814
OPERATING ROOM 2

695
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,608
(Sabu chuckling)

696
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,651
Good job, everyone.

697
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,987
-DOIL: Yes, good job.
-MYEONGSIM: Good job, everyone.

698
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,287
MYEONGSIM: Two surgeries
in a row are too much for me now.

699
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,664
-Oh, my shoulders.
-I'm still okay.

700
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,249
I could do two more.

701
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,334
It must be nice to be young.

702
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,502
Oh?

703
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,628
Dr. Jang Donghwa?

704
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,088
MUNJEONG: Didn't you clock out?

705
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,966
Well, yes.

706
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,887
Dr. Nam, why don't
we grab a beer after we get off?

707
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,139
Sure, I'm always down for some beer!

708
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,646
What? Why…

709
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,447
Excuse me.

710
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,199
What? Do you have something to say?

711
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:32,993
Uh…

712
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,373
How is the hemoperitoneum patient?

713
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,209
For now, we stopped the bleeding

714
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,463
and there will be another surgery
for the hip joint in two weeks.

715
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,674
The surgery was delayed a little
because we found cancer.

716
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:48,967
Why?

717
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,763
I was just wondering how the surgery went…

718
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,806
Were you worried?

719
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,642
That I would

720
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,310
miss something again?

721
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,479
That's not what I meant.

722
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,732
The patient is old,
so we need to wait and see.

723
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,153
Still,

724
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,406
the surgery was easier,
thanks to what you said.

725
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:13,825
What?

726
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,452
About the norepinephrine.

727
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:18,997
Nurse Joo.

728
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,458
Instead of norepinephrine,
just hook her up to a RIS.

729
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,128
Will that be enough
to keep her alive through surgery?

730
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,588
We'll just have to move quickly.

731
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,175
Like Jang Donghwa said,
even if we stop all the bleeding,

732
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,344
there's no point
if the heart doesn't beat?

733
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,304
SABU: You did well.

734
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,849
Inotropics are double-edged swords.

735
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,727
They're drugs
that help raise blood pressure,

736
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,021
but you give up a lot
due to vascular contraction.

737
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,650
If something goes wrong,
SCMP can occur in the heart muscles.

738
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,862
What I'm saying is
that you saved that old lady,

739
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,239
Dr. Jang Donghwa.

740
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:54,866
You did well.

741
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,958
Go clock out. You must be tired.

742
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,670
(snorts softly)

743
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,182
(inhales shakily)

744
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:30,777
(whispering)
What did I say?

745
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,196
He understood me, Nurse Oh.

746
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,451
Plus, Dr. Seo is much more generous
with his compliments than you, Master Kim.

747
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,410
(chuckles)

748
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,954
Is this what they call
"a pupil surpassing his master?"

749
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,915
That's a notion I will always welcome.

750
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,004
AREUM: Transporting the patient now.

751
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,967
Are you transferring the patient?

752
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,596
Yes. The patient is unstable,
so I'm taking them to the burn center.

753
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,139
Okay, keep up the good work.

754
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,348
-Okay, I'll be back.
-SABU: Okay.

755
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,561
-Oh, right, Dr. Yoon Areum.
-Yes?

756
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,607
You did really well earlier.

757
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,901
The cricothyroidotomy and the escharotomy.

758
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,155
Thank you, I know. I'll be back.

759
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,449
(chuckles)

760
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,951
(laughs)

761
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,247
-Oh, Nurse Euntak.
-Where are you going?

762
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,499
I'm transferring a patient.

763
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,001
The patient isn't in a good condition,
so I'm going with them.

764
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,170
I see. You must be tired.

765
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,798
Not as tired as you.

766
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,925
AREUM: I heard you had two operations.

767
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,177
You must be pooped.

768
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,930
I'll be back soon, so rest up.

769
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,766
Dr. Yoon, quickly!

770
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,267
Okay, I'm on my way!

771
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,187
(upbeat music)

772
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,231
(laughs)

773
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,374
DOCTOR HELICOPTER
AIR AMBULANCE

774
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,000
We'll move the patient now.

775
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,502
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

776
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,590
STAFF 2: Are we good to go?

777
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,675
-Yes.
-Moving the bed out!

778
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,515
Bye, Dr. Yoon.

779
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,058
I'll be back.

780
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,686
Huh?

781
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,691
I have nothing to do
after I get off anyway.

782
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:33,775
Let me join you.

783
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,558
You see, Dad--

784
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,642
I still

785
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,061
don't understand.

786
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:15,192
How could you make
such a ridiculous decision so easily?

787
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,028
JINMAN: How…

788
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,404
How could you so casually

789
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,532
perform a combined surgery like that?

790
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,659
The results were good.

791
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,162
The surgery was completed
without complications too.

792
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,414
You watched how it went.

793
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,832
Are you saying that

794
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,543
if the results are good,
the process doesn't matter?

795
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:37,923
I'm just saying that for good results,
a little flexibility is necessary.

796
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,549
In all things,

797
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,302
there are fundamentals and principles.

798
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:46,056
If you keep changing the fundamentals
and principles according to convenience,

799
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,934
the foundation is ultimately
doomed to collapse.

800
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:52,979
Master Kim has never broken
the fundamentals or principles.

801
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,608
More than any other doctor I know,

802
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,194
he's upheld his duty as a doctor.

803
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,571
I've neglected you for too long.

804
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,281
Dad.

805
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,532
Professor.

806
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,410
Call me Professor in the hospital.

807
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,621
Keep your work and personal life separate.

808
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,666
I know that much.

809
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,167
What you think you know

810
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,294
is different from
what you actually know, Eunjae.

811
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,131
You should know
how to differentiate the two.

812
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,218
What about my surgery?

813
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,391
I want to know
what you thought about my surgery.

814
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,227
Regardless of skill,

815
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:37,065
I want you to become a doctor
that upholds principles.

816
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:41,987
(door closes)

817
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,657
STAFF LOUNGE

818
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,617
(solemn music)

819
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:58,420
(sighs)

820
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,156
If not a compliment like "you did well,"

821
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,701
I thought I'd at least hear
something like "I'm proud of you."

822
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,954
Because I really did well today.

823
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,123
You did well.

824
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,710
I'm very proud of you.

825
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:40,879
I compliment you.

826
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,176
You too, Dr. Seo Woojin.

827
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,053
EUNJAE: You did well today.

828
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,057
I'm very proud of you. I compliment you.

829
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:53,892
Mm.

830
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,226
"Pretty please."

831
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,103
(snorts)

832
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,026
(sighs)

833
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,237
(sighs)

834
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,448
It's been a long day.

835
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,408
Right?

836
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,078
A long night too.

837
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,913
Right?

838
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:35,725
SABU: Nurse Lee.

839
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,646
Can you check the urine hourly?

840
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,858
And for the phlegm,
please make sure to suction properly.

841
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,485
-NURSE LEE: Okay.
-SABU: Thanks.

842
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,959
Excuse me. You can go and rest now.

843
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,587
The patient seems to have improved a lot.

844
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,260
I…

845
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,472
I was 23 years old when I had him.

846
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,601
COACH: I was immature back then,

847
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,313
I thought the whole world was mine

848
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:27,110
just because I won a medal
at the Asian Championships.

849
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,613
And just like that, I messed around…

850
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:34,826
and I had him.

851
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,495
Hm.

852
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,042
(sighs)

853
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,670
COACH: After that,

854
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,548
my grades plummeted

855
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,260
and I needed to make money

856
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,180
for baby formula and diapers.

857
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,934
Man.

858
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,021
I really didn't know what to do.

859
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,733
So…

860
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,736
I worked at a supermarket,
cleaned buildings,

861
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,946
and worked for a chauffeur service.

862
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,242
There's nothing I didn't do.

863
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,412
I see.

864
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,583
Still, I was good at skiing,

865
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,087
so I taught him how to ski
when he was five years old.

866
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,342
And he was good at it too.

867
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,848
Honestly, I never expected him
to win a gold medal.

868
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,475
(laughs softly)

869
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,440
But then I became afraid.

870
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,027
That he'd become like me.

871
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,617
I was afraid he'd mess around
and fall from grace, just like I did.

872
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,457
That's why I pushed him harder.

873
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,047
But he…

874
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,509
really did fall from grace.

875
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,348
(somber music)

876
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,351
(sighs)

877
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,732
(machine beeping)

878
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,577
What will happen to my boy?

879
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,374
Can he continue being an athlete?

880
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,675
You see, the thing about nerves…

881
00:59:57,468 --> 01:00:00,513
Once they're damaged,
it's not easy to recover.

882
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,058
Well, medically,
that is the case. However…

883
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:09,814
I have seen many instances
that surpass the boundaries of medicine.

884
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:15,987
It's what people call miracles. However,

885
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:21,826
I call it the will of a person.

886
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,000
Sir.

887
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,502
Don't give up.

888
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,340
In the end, a person's will

889
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,718
is what makes a miracle.

890
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,101
(exhales)

891
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,454
JINMAN: No matter
where they stand in life,

892
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,958
people will dream again.

893
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:21,552
They don't give up hope
in the face of despair.

894
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,440
To the end…

895
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,904
they will want to prove
that they are still alive.

896
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:45,326
Even if it is false hope,

897
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,086
they are

898
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:58,339
unwilling to give up.

899
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,220
CONSULTATION ROOM 2

900
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,859
What are you still doing here?

901
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:23,072
What is it? Are you worried
because your first day was too hard?

902
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,241
SABU: What are you going to do?

903
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:28,995
Today was just a taste
of what we have going on here.

904
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,375
What were you trying to prove here?

905
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,002
What?

906
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,755
In this countryside hospital,

907
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,340
I was just wondering
what kind of pride you held

908
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,885
from this tiny amount of success.

909
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,094
(chuckles)

910
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:46,637
I'm not sure.

911
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,223
Success and pride.

912
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,059
I don't really know what those are.

913
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,729
I'm just living my life as I am.

914
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,981
Shouldn't that be enough?

915
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:58,649
Is that how you live?

916
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,027
"Ignoring the fundamentals,
principles, and practices

917
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,570
is what makes me who I am."

918
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:05,114
Self-satisfied and reassuring yourself--

919
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,450
No, I live gratefully.

920
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,412
I'm making my dream come true like that.

921
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,747
Your dream?

922
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,165
(scoffs)

923
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,124
At that age?

924
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,751
What of it?

925
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:18,795
Don't you have any dreams?

926
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:19,754
(snorts)

927
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,925
SABU: So what's left of you then?

928
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,552
Besides remorse, besides regret.

929
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,639
Besides anger.

930
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,058
Besides betrayal.

931
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,436
(tense music)

932
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,150
You'll see.

933
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,695
You don't think
I won't live up to my name,

934
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:46,447
do you?

935
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:52,245
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

936
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,290
(door closes)

937
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:00,795
(car beeps)

938
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,756
(engine turns on)

939
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,679
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

940
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,043
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

941
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:47,967
It's a good morning!

942
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,635
(laughs)

943
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,095
Have a good morning!

944
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,388
(laughs)

945
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:53,472
(in English) Good morning!

946
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,599
(laughs)

947
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,601
(quirky playful music)

948
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,061
(in Korean) Hello, Elizabeth.

949
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:00,897
Did you sleep well?

950
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:05,443
And what about you, Jessie?
Did you sleep well?

951
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:08,988
(in English) High five.

952
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,077
Good smell.

953
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:19,540
Good.

954
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:23,544
Wow.

955
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,447
(in Korean) You're here early today.

956
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,909
Do you have any business in the lounge?

957
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,245
I just want some coffee. Why?

958
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:02,792
The coffee machine
in the lounge is broken.

959
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,627
Let's go to the medical office.

960
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:07,338
Oh, really? I'll just get
something else to drink then.

961
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:10,049
Since all the drinks are out,

962
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,969
I will escort you
to the medical office. Let's go.

963
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,262
-What? No…
-GITAE: Let's go, Dr. Yang.

964
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,014
I'll make you a coffee.

965
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,402
(gasps)

966
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,700
(sighs)

967
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:37,660
Are you awake?

968
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,078
Yeah.

969
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,205
You still have time.
You can sleep some more.

970
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:43,708
I'll see you later.

971
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:47,211
(door opens)

972
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:49,338
-(exhales)
-(door closes)

973
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,425
(birds chirping)

974
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,759
(door closes)

975
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,188
Did you just get home?

976
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,151
Yes, well…

977
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:12,653
I was watching the patients
that were operated on.

978
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:15,948
And well… I've been working
on medical progress reports.

979
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:18,743
Come sit. Let's eat breakfast.

980
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,536
What?

981
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,455
Let's eat.

982
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:23,873
EUNJAE: Yes, Professor.

983
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:25,041
"Dad."

984
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,960
You should call me Dad at home.

985
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,588
Don't confuse your work
with personal life.

986
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,466
I know that much.

987
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:37,553
(gasps)

988
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:39,930
EUNJAE: This omelet is amazing!

989
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,266
Mmm!

990
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:44,143
When do you have to go in?

991
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,103
I have to go after I change my clothes.

992
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:48,105
Let's go together then.

993
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:50,566
What?

994
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,193
Why? Is that weird?

995
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,570
No, that's not it.

996
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:55,946
All right then.

997
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,698
Let's go to work together.

998
01:07:58,699 --> 01:07:59,700
Okay.

999
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,041
-(sniffles)
-(door opens)

1000
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:12,129
(door closes)

1001
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,179
Hello, sir.

1002
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,059
-(door opens)
-AREUM: Good morning!

1003
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:27,269
-(door closes)
-AREUM: Oh!

1004
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:29,438
Dr. Cha. You're already at work.

1005
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,857
Oh, my. Dr. Yoon,
are you just now coming in?

1006
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,944
-Yes.
-Say hello. This is Professor Cha Jinman.

1007
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,072
-(mouths)
-AREUM: Oh.

1008
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:41,200
Hello, I've heard many things about you.

1009
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,576
I am EM Dr. Yoon Areum.

1010
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,454
JINMAN: Dr. Yoon Areum?

1011
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,917
Oh, my daughter Eunjae's roommate?

1012
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:56,090
Well, I'm staying in a room
at the company house.

1013
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:59,343
Oh, Dr. Yoon Areum. Did you happen
to get a room at the company house?

1014
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,387
I'm glad. Good for you.

1015
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:02,805
What?

1016
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,933
I was uncomfortable knowing
that you were sleeping in the office,

1017
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:07,476
but the company house had a room.

1018
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,519
(laughs awkwardly)

1019
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:11,355
Anyway, I'm sorry to make you
uncomfortable as soon as you moved.

1020
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:12,690
Well, no…

1021
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,696
I mean… No, it's okay.

1022
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:22,241
Speaking of which,
while I'm indebted to you,

1023
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,660
may I stay for a few more days?

1024
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,579
-What?
-What?

1025
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:31,667
I'm looking for a house through a realtor,
but I'm afraid it'll take some time.

1026
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:33,586
Do you mind?

1027
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,255
Of course not.

1028
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:37,715
It's fine.

1029
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:44,138
You can stay for as long as you'd like.

1030
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:45,931
AREUM: I have a place to stay anyway.

1031
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,266
(laughs)

1032
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,810
Thank you, Dr. Yoon Areum.

1033
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:51,437
Sure.

1034
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,404
What is going on?

1035
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:01,906
It's…

1036
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:04,074
nothing at all.

1037
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:17,504
No…

1038
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,174
PROF. CHA JINMAN
EUNJAE'S FATHER

1039
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:21,258
EUNJAE

1040
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,603
Unbelievable.

1041
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:38,692
MINGUK: All right.

1042
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:42,112
This is the list that Professor Cha Jinman
sent this morning.

1043
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,657
The list of doctors
he'll be taking from Doldam Hospital.

1044
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:51,538
(scoffs)

1045
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,416
(phone vibrates)

1046
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,006
(phone vibrates)

1047
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:11,392
(phone vibrates)

1048
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,812
"Please come in."

1049
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:15,980
(phone vibrates)

1050
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:20,776
(phone vibrates)

1051
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,281
(phone vibrates)

1052
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,288
(tense music)

1053
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,648
MYEONGSIM: He's basically cleaning house.

1054
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,526
He acted like he wouldn't
take anyone with him.

1055
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:07,698
-Nurse Eom.
-Yes?

1056
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:10,784
So who's staying at Doldam Hospital?

1057
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,370
You, me,

1058
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,080
Nurse Oh,

1059
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:16,373
Master Kim,

1060
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,168
and the two new doctors.

1061
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,145
MYEONGSIM: Is this also something

1062
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:41,231
you've predicted, Master Kim?

1063
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:46,945
MINGUK: For the next two months,

1064
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,907
we'll be doing simulations
here in the Trauma Center.

1065
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,450
What do you mean by simulation?

1066
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:55,746
It'll be a preliminary inspection
for teamwork

1067
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:58,165
before the Trauma Center officially opens.

1068
01:12:58,248 --> 01:13:02,586
Then, what about the emergency room
at Doldam Hospital?

1069
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:07,549
Master Kim says he has it covered
for the time being.

1070
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:09,927
MINGUK: From now on,

1071
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:13,889
for the next two months,
please focus on the Trauma Center here.

1072
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:19,269
I'm sorry, but I'm out.

1073
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:26,360
JINMAN: Why?

1074
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:29,613
Do you lack confidence?

1075
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:33,909
You learned from Bu Yongju,

1076
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:36,036
so I had high hopes for you.

1077
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,249
I guess you don't have the skills yet

1078
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:42,459
to show me?

1079
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:51,427
MYEONGSIM: Do you know what will happen…

1080
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:53,679
during those two months?

1081
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,808
There are only two outcomes.

1082
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:01,395
You either put the elephant in

1083
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:05,107
or the refrigerator breaks.

1084
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:08,193
(dramatic music)

1085
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,261

DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

1099
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,214
WOOJIN: Master Kim will eventually…

1100
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:55,133
-AREUM: Patient is going into arrest!
-…have to take care of all the patients.

1101
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,469
Does my dad get to you that much?

1102
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,347
SABU: What you're doing isn't
turning your back on Dr. Cha Jinman.

1103
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:03,225
Know that you're turning your back
on the patients that need your care.

1104
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,936
Even if you're a resident,
I'm a doctor, and you're a nurse.

1105
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:07,104
I'm well aware.

1106
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:08,772
EUNTAK: Are you done?

1107
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:11,733
GITAE: The son of
a provincial assemblyman…

1108
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,902
WOMAN 5: This is medical malpractice,
isn't it?

1109
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:16,405
-Reconsider this operation.
-What?

1110
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:18,991
Even so,
am I supposed to give up on a patient?

1111
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:22,202
-JINMAN: There's no hope.
-SABU: So show me.

1112
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:25,289
How you would do it,
what solution you have in mind.
