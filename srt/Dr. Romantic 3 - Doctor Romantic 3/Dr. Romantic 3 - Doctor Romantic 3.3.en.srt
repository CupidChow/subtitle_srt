00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,005
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,840
(opening theme music)

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,962
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,507
(wind howling)

5
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,268
JINMAN: Generally speaking,
it's important to make it down well.

6
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,021
But this darn thing called pride

7
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,940
makes a man act petty.

8
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,901
Look far ahead, got it?

9
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,320
-COACH: Also…
-JINMAN: If you're going down anyway,

10
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,740
-you might as well look cool doing it.
-COACH: …loosen up a little!

11
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,241
COACH: Put your goggles on!

12
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:19,746
JINMAN: But greed and arrogance
make you try so hard.

13
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,290
-JINMAN: Only after you become a wreck…
-COACH: Got it?

14
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:26,127
JINMAN: …will you finally be able
to let it go.

15
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:30,256
(wind howling)

16
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,430
COACH: This wind…

17
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,391
Don't jump. No! Don't!

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,852
Don't jump, I tell you!

19
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,939
(exhales)

20
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,155
(dramatic music)

21
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,374
JINMAN: Is there no way for a man

22
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,001
to look graceful

23
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,212
while falling?

24
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,137
What do you mean by that?

25
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,097
There is only one condition
for me to join you.

26
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,935
You will remove Bu Yongju
from Doldam Hospital Trauma Center.

27
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,145
(sighs)

28
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:31,359
Can't we reach an agreement
with your salary or any other condition?

29
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,945
I'm not asking to make a deal,
Director Park.

30
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:38,116
Professor, we can't run the Trauma Center
without Master Kim.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,160
MINGUK: It's unimaginable.

32
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,662
Then let's forget we ever discussed this.

33
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:44,998
-(exhales)
-(line disconnects)

34
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,458
(soft tense music)

35
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,631
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN

36
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,106
(phone buzzes)

37
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,652
It's me.

38
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,863
When do you want to start?

39
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,281
When would you like me to start?

40
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,700
MINGUK: How about in one week?

41
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,536
I'll talk to Master Kim by then.

42
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,290
Of course, you will have to deal with
resistance from the other doctors.

43
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,250
I'm prepared to deal with that much.

44
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,629
And let me know about other details
before you start work.

45
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,130
Okay.

46
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,550
Yes. I'll see you then.

47
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,353
(sighs)

48
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,523
He says he'll do it.

49
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,322
Good work, Director Park.

50
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,241
-MINGUK: Master Kim.
-Yes?

51
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,202
May I ask you why?

52
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,955
Why did you make such a decision?

53
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,624
You determined that we need him

54
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,292
and wanted to bring him here.

55
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:16,005
Still, I didn't want the Trauma Center
without you there.

56
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,548
The Trauma Center…

57
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,844
had been a longtime dream of yours.

58
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,972
Taking that away would be cheating.

59
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,348
Director Park.

60
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,726
Do you know how to put
an elephant into a fridge?

61
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,146
The answer is simple.

62
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,190
Open the door.

63
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,859
Put the elephant inside.
Then, close the door.

64
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,945
Master Kim.

65
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,864
But just because something is simple

66
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,242
doesn't mean anyone can do it.

67
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,996
A simple solution doesn't make it easy.

68
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,373
(sighs)

69
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,753
You and I
have only just grabbed the doorknob.

70
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,798
(laughs softly)

71
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,219
-(laughs)
-(door opens)

72
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,221
(door closes)

73
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,935
(door opens)

74
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,318
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN!
GIVE ME AN ANSWER FOR MY SON'S DEATH!

75
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:35,376
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN!
GIVE ME AN ANSWER FOR MY SON'S DEATH!

76
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,503
(opening theme music)

77
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,179
VOLUME 3
PUTTING AN ELEPHANT IN A FRIDGE, PART 2

78
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,221
(phone rings)

79
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,390
This is the Doldam Hospital ER.

80
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,226
Yes, got it.

81
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,229
Dr. Jang, an emergency patient
is arriving in three minutes.

82
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,857
Oh, okay. Can you bandage him up, please?

83
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,025
Yes, Doctor.

84
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,112
Oh, and you need to look at
the laceration wound in bed eight.

85
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,280
Laceration wound? Okay.

86
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,533
Dr. Jang, the X-ray is out
for the patient in bed two.

87
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,369
Okay.

88
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,873
Oh, what should we do
about the patient with the stomachache?

89
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,333
I'll do it.

90
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,585
HYEONJEONG: Dr. Jang!
The laceration wound in bed eight.

91
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,380
-They've been waiting for a while.
-Okay.

92
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,256
PATIENT 1: Doctor, there's so much blood.

93
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,258
Doctor, please take a look here.

94
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,927
-Doctor.
-PATIENT 3: We were here first.

95
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,720
-PATIENT 2: But this is urgent.
-PATIENT 3: Doctor.

96
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,097
-PATIENT 2: Just a moment.
-PATIENT 4: Please help us.

97
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,265
-Doctor.
-We were here first.

98
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,225
-PATIENT 4: Doctor?
-PATIENT 3: Doctor!

99
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,393
-Excuse me.
-PATIENT 2: Doctor.

100
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,812
Are Dr. Jung Insu
and Yoon Areum not here yet?

101
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,147
Dr. Jung went to a meeting
with the director.

102
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,066
And Dr. Yoon hasn't come to work yet.

103
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,651
Seriously…

104
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,194
PARAMEDIC: We have a patient!

105
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,404
(man groaning)

106
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,696
There was a car crash.

107
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,908
A penetrating wound in the abdomen.
BP is 80/40. Heart rate 120.

108
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,955
(tense ethereal music)

109
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,707
His BP is too low.
What should we do, Dr. Jang?

110
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,627
Dr. Jang!
What about the stomachache patient?

111
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,296
Dr. Jang!
The laceration wound in bed eight!

112
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,173
-Dr. Jang!
-Dr. Jang!

113
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,675
HYEONJEONG: Dr. Jang! Bed eight!

114
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,260
Wait… just a minute.

115
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,678
-Bed eight!
-What are you doing?

116
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,305
-Please come quickly!
-It's urgent!

117
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,433
-Dr. Jang!
-Dr. Jang!

118
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,518
Over here!

119
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,978
(gasps)

120
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,521
(whimpers)

121
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,316
What are you doing right now?

122
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,110
Get a grip, punk!

123
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,528
(wails)

124
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,029
(screams)

125
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,364
(pants)

126
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,410
WE WISH YOU GOOD HEALTH

127
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,788
(pants heavily)

128
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,748
(Donghwa exhales loudly)

129
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,838
He just fell asleep standing up, right?

130
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,756
I think he even had a dream.

131
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,678
You must be very tired, Dr. Jang.

132
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,472
-Yes…
-(sirens wailing in the distance)

133
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,890
I'm okay.

134
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,807
(tires squeal)

135
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,187
PARAMEDIC: It's an emergency patient!

136
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,815
(tense, somber music)

137
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,984
(cries in pain)

138
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,488
It's a 26-year-old male.
He's on the national ski jump team.

139
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,199
PARAMEDIC: He was injured
while making a landing during training.

140
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,034
-His vitals are 126/82 and 68.
-(groans)

141
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,620
PARAMEDIC: He doesn't seem to have
any external injuries,

142
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,163
but he's suffering from extreme pain.

143
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,331
(groans loudly)

144
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,458
-Let's get him in the hybrid OR.
-PARAMEDIC: Okay.

145
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,336
Please wait here.

146
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,673
Aren't you coming?

147
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,302
What about
Dr. Jung Insu and Dr. Yoon Areum?

148
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,262
Dr. Jung is in a meeting
with the director.

149
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,056
And Dr. Yoon hasn't come to work yet.

150
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:38,809
Dr. Jang.

151
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,102
MYEONGSIM: Dr. Jang, hurry.

152
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,987
-EMPLOYEE: Oh, you're here.
-Yes, hello.

153
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,116
Put that inside. No, not there. That's it.

154
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,620
Wait! That's new.
Make sure not to bump it.

155
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,581
-Yes, that's it.
-What are you doing?

156
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,334
Oh, Dr. Seo. Are you just coming to work?

157
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,920
A new CT surgical fellow
will be joining us today.

158
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,797
I've been rearranging for them.

159
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,508
Is Cha Eunjae moving to this room?

160
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,344
That's right. From now on,
general surgeons will be in one room,

161
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,804
and CT surgeons will be in another.

162
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,472
You will be with your own specialty.

163
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,765
(laughs loudly)

164
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,518
But, why are there three desks?

165
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,981
GITAE: I'm not sure. Director Park Minguk
asked me to prepare another.

166
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,150
Anyway, I can't believe
I get to witness this sight.

167
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,654
It seems only yesterday
we ran the hospital with just Master Kim.

168
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,324
Honestly, when Dr. Kang Dongju
and Dr. Yoon Seojeong joined us,

169
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,452
I never imagined that Master Kim's dream
would come true.

170
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,998
But one room is overflowing
with general surgeons,

171
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,792
and another room is full
of cardiothoracic surgeons.

172
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,837
On top of that,
the Trauma Center is standing tall.

173
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,090
I am so deeply moved.

174
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,341
(laughs)

175
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,467
(stops abruptly)

176
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,053
Hey, a man is talking.

177
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,431
Gosh, how could he be so lacking
in social skills?

178
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,975
-(thud)
-My goodness! Sorry, go easy on that.

179
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,903
(soft piano music)

180
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,763
(gasps)

181
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,222
Hey, you're here.

182
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,601
-Did you work all night?
-Of course.

183
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,770
I was on call.
Of course I worked all night.

184
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,521
I couldn't sleep a wink.

185
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,898
Weren't you sleeping just now?

186
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,192
Sleeping? Who?

187
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,235
I wasn't sleeping.

188
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,863
(laughs softly)

189
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,201
I brought you some tomato juice.

190
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,453
WOOJIN: I blanched them
before blending it.

191
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,871
It should taste okay.

192
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,456
You made it yourself?

193
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,709
-You even blanched them?
-WOOJIN: Yes.

194
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,128
I even blanched them myself.

195
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,506
Hey, what is this?

196
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,301
You're quite moving
with just a few tomatoes.

197
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,848
(in cutesy voice) While you're at it,
open the lid for me too. Please?

198
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,225
Pretty please?

199
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,443
Sorry, I'm still half asleep.

200
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,153
My tongue isn't completely awake yet.

201
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,115
EUNJAE: Mmm!

202
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,451
This tastes good. It's so fresh.

203
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,580
Please forget what you just heard.
Can you do that?

204
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,166
No, I can't.

205
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,169
It was a momentary error
on my part because I was tired.

206
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,671
Please forget about it, okay?

207
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,672
I don't want to.

208
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,465
"Pretty please."

209
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,925
There you go again.

210
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,219
This one will last a while.
What? "Pretty please?"

211
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,721
Stop it, Seo Woojin.

212
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,805
-"Pretty please?"
-Hey.

213
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,223
-Pretty--
-Hush.

214
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,975
-Someone might hear.
-Okay, I'll stop.

215
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,478
-But "pretty please?" Okay, I'll stop.
-Seriously, I said stop.

216
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,896
(Woojin laughs)

217
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,111
(laughs awkwardly)

218
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,406
Dr. Lee Seonung.
This is Dr. Seo Woojin in general surgery.

219
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,743
Hello. We met on the boat last time.

220
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,290
Oh, you must be the new CT surgery fellow.

221
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,875
I'm Lee Seonung.

222
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,878
As of today, I'm reporting to duty
at Doldam Hospital.

223
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,171
Master Kim hired me.

224
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,173
It's good to see you. I hope we get along.

225
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,425
Pretty please.

226
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,634
What?

227
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,595
(phone buzzes)

228
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,933
It's a call from the ER.

229
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,728
See you later, Dr. Cha Eunjae.

230
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,772
Have a good day.

231
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,900
(exhales)

232
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,737
What did he just say?

233
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,614
Oh, don't mind him.

234
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,909
He's just like that sometimes.
He's not even funny, but he tries.

235
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,368
But he's not funny at all, right?

236
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,370
EUNJAE: Gosh, seriously.

237
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,209
Do you like tomato juice?

238
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
Yes.

239
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,004
What do we have?

240
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,050
He's on the national ski jump team.
He was injured while landing.

241
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,969
Dr. Bae Munjeong
is looking at his knee ligaments.

242
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,388
But he keeps saying he has stomach pain.

243
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,723
-What about the CT?
-The CT…

244
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,143
The CT shows wall enhancement
in a part of the front abdomen.

245
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,020
I think we need to do
a surgical observation.

246
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,980
-WOOJIN: Right here?
-DONGHWA: Yes.

247
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,070
But in the back, the aeration looks good
and the size is small.

248
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,697
I think the enhancement is
just from the swollen bowels.

249
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,741
That's true, but…

250
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,788
-What about diarrhea?
-There is none.

251
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,748
-What about his labs?
-His WBC is 9,000.

252
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,291
Only his CRP is slightly elevated.

253
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,209
Physical condition?

254
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,044
There's some tenderness in the RLQ.

255
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,045
And there's no rebound?

256
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,964
It's not prominent.

257
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,007
It's either there or not.

258
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,717
What do you mean by not prominent?

259
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,178
The patient keeps saying it hurts.

260
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,639
-Where is the patient?
-In the hybrid OR.

261
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,308
(sighs)

262
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,689
MUNJEONG: There's nothing wrong
with the knee ligaments.

263
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,275
Right, I said the same thing,

264
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,443
but the patient keeps saying
that it hurts.

265
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,028
(groans)

266
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,488
COACH: Excuse me.

267
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,199
He had surgery on his ACL three years ago.

268
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,160
Oh, but it seems fine now.

269
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,621
SUNGYOON: My stomach hurts so much.

270
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,374
Oh, my stomach. It's killing me.

271
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,752
Let me take a look.

272
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,671
INSU: Hey, Dr. Seo. You're here.

273
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,215
The patient keeps complaining
about stomach pain.

274
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,510
But there isn't anything in particular
in the CT scan.

275
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,057
WOOJIN: Sir, excuse me for a minute.

276
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,934
Bring your knee up.

277
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,064
-WOOJIN: Does it hurt if I press here?
-Yes.

278
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,941
WOOJIN: What about this side?

279
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,484
Does the right side still hurt?

280
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,903
Yes, it does.

281
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,697
Let me look under your clothes.

282
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,658
(groans)

283
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,951
What if I tap on it like this?

284
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,036
That hurts too.

285
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,787
Can you cough with some force?

286
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,543
(coughs, groans)

287
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,629
Do you feel a ringing in your stomach?

288
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,880
Yes, I feel it.

289
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,927
Let's try a different position
and compare.

290
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,346
Lift your legs. Tighten your muscles.

291
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,514
Lift your head and look at your knees.

292
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,190
Which one hurts more? Earlier or now?

293
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,067
This hurts more.

294
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,196
Okay. You can relax now.

295
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:49,990
Jang Donghwa.

296
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,075
Yes?

297
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,452
Did you check for Carnett's sign?

298
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:54,912
I did…

299
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,830
Then why did you suggest
a surgical observation?

300
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,374
There's no muscle guarding at all.

301
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,169
Excuse me. What is it? Is something wrong?

302
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,714
It's nothing big. It's a common illness

303
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,174
called faking.

304
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,685
COACH: What is this?

305
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,312
Did you fall while landing on purpose?

306
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,023
No, I didn't. I really am hurting.

307
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,942
Why won't you believe me?

308
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,070
The orthopedic surgeon and I agree.

309
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,239
There is nothing wrong
with the exam results.

310
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,032
What a bunch of quacks!

311
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,034
Is it all fine
if the exam results are fine?

312
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,245
I'm telling you I'm in pain!

313
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,789
COACH: You pathetic fool!

314
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,458
The competition is days away.
What is this?

315
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,046
You wasted our time fussing over nothing,
at this ungodly hour!

316
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,090
I really was in pain!

317
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,427
Forget it, punk!
Why, I ought to rip you apart.

318
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,096
Sir, you can't speak so loudly here--

319
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,558
COACH: Do you think winning one gold medal
is a huge accomplishment?

320
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,436
Do you? Don't flatter yourself.

321
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,062
COACH: Got it?

322
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,607
A medal is just a tiny dot in your life.

323
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,694
All you did was put a dot on the map.

324
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,238
You're no big shot.

325
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,574
COACH: You're stiff with arrogance
and won't even practice.

326
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,867
And now, you fake an injury?

327
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,119
You…

328
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,955
Do you know what happens
if you get too stiff with arrogance?

329
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,833
Even the slightest error
can lead to a huge injury.

330
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,877
Got that?

331
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,046
A person's life is the same way.

332
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,714
COACH: Punk.

333
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,008
(sighs)

334
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,637
Gosh, I'm sorry.

335
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,895
What are you doing? Get up already!

336
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,786
Gosh, that coach is scary.

337
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,538
He must've faked it several times already.

338
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:05,459
Is it right to let him go?
He says he's in pain.

339
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,295
Still, there's nothing we can do.

340
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,381
MUNJEONG: That's what I think too.
I'm sure they have team doctors.

341
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,759
Let's just do what we can, Dr. Jung.

342
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,970
Okay, if that's what OS and GS say.

343
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,847
I'll discharge him for now.

344
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,565
Excuse me.

345
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,069
About Mr. Cho Sungyoon…

346
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,905
Couldn't we give him an IV
and let him rest for a few hours?

347
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:36,990
What does that mean?

348
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,243
Stress is a type of illness too.

349
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,371
He could get better
with a few days of rest.

350
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,666
Since when did GS surgeons
start to manage patients' stress levels?

351
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,626
Pardon?

352
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,089
Right, a doctor can feel sympathetic
for a patient.

353
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,716
WOOJIN: But that's all.

354
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,345
You told me to do what I had to do.

355
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,642
I meant you should do your best
at your job.

356
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,602
What you just did is go overboard.

357
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,105
Don't confuse those two.

358
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,279
(door closes)

359
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,446
Seriously.

360
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,825
(sighs)

361
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,369
INFORMATION

362
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,204
MYEONGSIM: It must be
a lack of finesse, right?

363
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,958
-Dr. Seo, I mean.
-Mm.

364
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,545
MYEONGSIM: I think he says what he says
to teach Dr. Jang,

365
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,922
but Dr. Jang seems to be hurt
by his words.

366
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:35,924
(laughs)

367
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,720
I feel like I'm watching you
in your early days.

368
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,389
(laughs)

369
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,765
Gosh.

370
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,561
Wasn't Yang Hojun in charge
of the residents?

371
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,605
Yes, he was supposed to be.

372
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,357
I'm sure he passed it on to Dr. Seo.

373
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,568
Anyway, he's the world's best

374
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,196
at being shameless
and having no sense of responsibility.

375
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,495
(laughs)

376
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,497
So…

377
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,126
can't you clear up some traffic
between those two?

378
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,254
Gosh, leave them alone.

379
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,716
SABU: If grown-ups butt in
for these things,

380
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,219
it will only make things more complicated.

381
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,514
They need to butt heads and bond over it.

382
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,975
That's how they'll grow up.

383
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,940
(machines beeping)

384
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,566
WOOJIN: Dr. Jang Donghwa!

385
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,070
Suction for Mr. Kim Inguk.

386
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,323
(upbeat comical music)

387
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,533
WOOJIN: Keep an eye on this patient
for the next hour.

388
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,923
He's a diabetic
with an intestinal obstruction.

389
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,216
How should you do a bowel rest?

390
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,052
He should take nothing by mouth
and give him an IV.

391
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,680
That's when he isn't diabetic.

392
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,765
WOOJIN: A diabetic patient

393
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,100
could go into hypoglycemia.

394
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,851
So you should give him TPN,
not just fluids.

395
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,312
Oh, right.

396
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,366
(sighs)

397
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,578
(beeping)

398
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,923
WOOJIN: If I catch you playing games
in the hospital again,

399
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,466
you'll work two hours of overtime.

400
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,970
Try it if you want to.

401
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,642
JANG DONGHWA

402
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,068
Dr. Jang, have you checked
tomorrow's surgery schedule?

403
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,739
I'm on it now.

404
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,157
Seriously.

405
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,003
Where is the report
on yesterday's abdomen injury patient?

406
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,756
I'll do it now.

407
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,900
Don't forget to organize
the case report by this afternoon.

408
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,526
Yes, sir.

409
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,321
(sighs)

410
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,086
(humming, then stops)

411
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:20,899
(yelps)

412
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,487
Are you tired?

413
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:26,988
No, sir.

414
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,119
Yes, a bit.

415
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,121
That means you're doing well.

416
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,289
Here you go.

417
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,583
Yes, sir.

418
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,926
(humming)

419
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,309
SABU: Oh, there you are.

420
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,478
Did you have surgery?

421
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,355
I had some practice to do.

422
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,108
I'm done now.

423
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,070
It's hard, isn't it?

424
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,698
Well, it's fine.

425
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,869
SABU: Take it easy.

426
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,413
Easy.

427
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,047
MYEONGSIM: I'm betting that
he didn't understand.

428
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,218
Do you think so?

429
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,680
Even for a cool-headed man,

430
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:38,310
being objective about himself
is not an easy thing, Master Kim.

431
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,735
By the way,
you said you wanted to tell me something.

432
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,029
What is it?

433
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,115
HOJUN: What?

434
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,451
A new head of the Trauma Center?

435
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,745
Who?

436
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,413
Well,

437
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,209
I'm not sure
if the rumors are true either.

438
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,464
I hear Dr. Cha Jinman will be coming
as head of the Trauma Center.

439
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,633
By Dr. Cha Jinman, do you mean…

440
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,260
Cha Eunjae's dad?

441
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,637
Yes.

442
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,977
(chuckles)

443
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,111
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

444
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,368
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

445
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,919
Wow!

446
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,130
How nice. This is perfect!

447
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,634
Great things are happening
now that I have a new junior.

448
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,012
Now, CT surgeons are
taking over Doldam Hospital.

449
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,264
Let's sweep the board, okay?

450
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,059
I'm lacking in practical experience.
I have a lot to learn.

451
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,646
Don't worry. Don't be nervous.

452
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,690
If you have any questions, ask me anytime.

453
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,316
And if you need any help, ask for it.

454
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,363
You'll catch on soon enough,
but everyone here at Doldam is nice.

455
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,574
Well…

456
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,244
Just watch out for Dr. Yang Hojun in GS.
He's not that great.

457
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,665
(Seonung laughs)

458
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,836
By the way, why are there three desks?

459
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,087
Oh…

460
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,797
I'm not sure.

461
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,133
No way.

462
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:38,054
With his skills and his name value,
it's not out of the question.

463
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,183
In fact,
we're gaining a lot from this, Ms. Oh.

464
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,271
Is it Director Park's doing again?

465
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,440
It is, right? He pressured you into this.

466
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,484
Gosh. No, it isn't.

467
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,362
What did he say this time
to get his own way?

468
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,490
Did he use the opening date against you?
Or the emergency helicopter?

469
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,409
MYEONGSIM: What kind of excuse did he use

470
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,202
to steal the position of
head of the Trauma Center?

471
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,914
I didn't steal it from him, Ms. Oh.

472
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,876
MINGUK: I heard your voice from outside.

473
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,462
I didn't mean to,
but I overheard your conversation.

474
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,130
I'm glad you already heard me.

475
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,800
Tell me in person.

476
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,927
What kind of plot are you hiding

477
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,472
behind this ridiculous
personnel appointment?

478
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,015
There is no plot.

479
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,933
I'm upset, Ms. Oh.

480
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,687
I've been working with loyalty
and sincerity over the past three years.

481
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,690
Isn't this too absurd of a decision
to call it loyalty and sincerity?

482
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,401
How could you do that with
that position of all things?

483
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:37,197
How do you develop such random
and senseless creativity?

484
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,241
I told you it was my idea.

485
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,911
That's what I mean!
It was Master Kim's idea…

486
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,124
-What?
-I said we should do it.

487
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,418
-But…
-MINGUK: Look.

488
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,170
Let's clear up the misunderstanding later.

489
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,339
Let's go up to my office for now.

490
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,093
Professor Cha Jinman just arrived.

491
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,262
Let's do that.

492
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,974
Later.

493
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,268
-Let's talk later, Ms. Oh.
-But…

494
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,439
-SABU: Let's go.
-Okay.

495
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,027
But why?

496
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,613
Why on earth?

497
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,121
GITAE: Then I'll leave you to talk.

498
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,963
MINGUK: I'm so grateful to have you here,
Professor Cha.

499
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,005
Welcome.

500
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,638
JINMAN: Here.

501
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,850
I've come up with a list of doctors
to join the Trauma Center.

502
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,017
Ah, yes.

503
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:52,021
A few of them have given me
positive responses.

504
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,942
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER
RECOMMENDED DOCTOR LIST

505
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,697
The Doldam surgeons aren't on here.

506
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,577
I haven't been able
to confirm their skills yet.

507
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,705
MINGUK: You don't have to worry
about that.

508
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:12,417
The Doldam surgeons' specialty
is treating trauma patients.

509
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,919
Master Kim has focused on that area

510
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,589
and trained them to be a good team.

511
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,631
JINMAN: Director Park.

512
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,384
My standards of judging people

513
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,262
is quite different from Bu Yongju's.

514
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,308
My style of teaching
should differ greatly as well.

515
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,934
No way.

516
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:34,272
You don't mean you will exclude surgeons
from Doldam because of me, right?

517
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,358
I mean we can't give Doldam surgeons
any special treatment.

518
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,111
This center runs on government funding.

519
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,322
The rules must be fair.

520
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,617
Besides, skill may be important
in treating trauma,

521
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,161
but so is teamwork.

522
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,954
You said you'd judge fairly
based on skill.

523
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,792
But it sounds to me that you will have
very personal standards.

524
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,422
To be honest, it's obvious
how they'd be if they learned from you.

525
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,507
(chuckles)

526
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,342
They will be reckless, insolent,

527
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,428
or happy to wield a scalpel
out of arrogance.

528
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,638
JINMAN: People like that.

529
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,139
You like kids like that.

530
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,685
I do favor doctors
who do what they must for patients.

531
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,356
And if they have good hands, even better.

532
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,234
A good hand doesn't always
make a good doctor.

533
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,401
Exactly.

534
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,239
Just like how good test scores
don't make good doctors either.

535
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,873
(tense music)

536
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,583
MINGUK: Well…

537
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,462
I don't think we can decide on
personnel matters right now.

538
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,297
Are you so confident?

539
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,930
If I weren't confident,

540
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,890
would I have set up this meeting?

541
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,394
I'm sure you know that my standards

542
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,021
are very picky and conservative.

543
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,608
I do remember that you frustrated me with
your narrow-minded and stubborn nature.

544
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:05,697
Well, we still have some time
until the Trauma Center opens.

545
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,073
MINGUK: So, in due time…

546
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,366
Let's do it, then.

547
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,119
Let's see how good Doldam's surgeons are.

548
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,580
It would be better
if you operate yourself.

549
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,709
I want to see how good you are
since it's been so long.

550
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,547
I wonder how much your skills
have improved over the years.

551
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,841
-You're not drinking this, are you?
-MINGUK: Master Kim.

552
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,468
I wonder

553
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,054
if you've gotten rusty at all.

554
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,810
(scoffs)

555
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,444
Let's discuss personnel matters
in due time.

556
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,155
I'll show you the room
that you will be using, Professor Cha.

557
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,574
Room?

558
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,536
I'll show you the way.

559
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,288
Let's go.

560
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,041
MINGUK: Professor Cha?

561
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,929
Will you really be okay?

562
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,388
Don't ask.

563
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:17,143
I was just regretting this decision
for about three seconds.

564
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,521
He hasn't signed the contract yet.

565
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,982
It's not too late to tell me
if you've changed your mind.

566
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,029
We can't end things
before we even open the door.

567
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,324
So ultimately,
you really will enter this narrow door?

568
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,659
If you pick up a sword,

569
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,495
the least you can do is unsheathe it.

570
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,746
(in English) Okay.

571
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,750
(in Korean) Remember.
That was the last chance I gave you.

572
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,967
(soft piano music)

573
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,013
(sighs)

574
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,811
SEONUNG: When I first saw you
in the Trauma Center,

575
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:00,979
you were like the Avengers.

576
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,981
-Seriously.
-EUNJAE: The Avengers? Don't flatter me.

577
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,149
SEONUNG: Anyway,
I'm honored to work with you.

578
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,067
EUNJAE: Honored?

579
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,236
Dr. Lee, you use such sweet words.
You're honored.

580
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,904
SEONUNG: I really think you're impressive.

581
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,449
Totally understandable.
I know we surgeons are pretty impressive.

582
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,743
Mmm!

583
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,786
(quirky music)

584
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,496
EUNJAE: Dr. Lee, you're our lucky charm.

585
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,623
SEONUNG:
Did you blend this yourself? Gosh.

586
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,792
I didn't make it, but it's good, right?

587
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,918
SEONUNG: Mmm!

588
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,883
What is it, Dr. Seo?

589
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,011
This is the CS room.
Knock before you come in.

590
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,102
Dr. Lee.

591
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,146
Have you been to the ER yet?

592
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,399
Do you want to look around
and say hi to the ER folks?

593
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,489
Why? Do you have something
to tell me, Dr. Seo?

594
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,908
Don't you think you have something
to tell me, Dr. Cha?

595
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,494
Later.

596
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,746
(laughs awkwardly)

597
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:00,955
Let's talk later.

598
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,792
I have something to do
with Dr. Lee right now.

599
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,170
Dr. Lee, could you give us the room
for a moment?

600
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,963
I have something to discuss with Dr. Cha.

601
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,423
Yes, of course.

602
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,424
EUNJAE: No, Dr. Lee!

603
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,469
-There's no need to leave.
-Okay.

604
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,928
I just need five minutes, Dr. Lee.

605
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,764
Oh, okay.

606
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,058
Dr. Lee, you only need to listen
to a fellow CT surgeon.

607
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,060
WOOJIN: Dr. Lee.

608
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,437
(exhales)

609
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,025
(door opens)

610
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,829
(tense music)

611
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,384
(knocking)

612
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,396
Come on, I'm sure you misheard something.

613
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,608
The Trauma Center of all places?
That place is Master Kim's--

614
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,527
I heard it from Master Kim himself.

615
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,029
I know. So Master… What?

616
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,281
Why did he make that decision
all of a sudden?

617
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,076
If Director Park didn't pressure him,

618
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,495
and he made this decision himself,

619
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,664
it's even more of a mystery.

620
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,748
Perhaps,

621
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,251
could it be because
of his multiple sclerosis?

622
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:33,089
His symptoms might have gotten worse
without our knowing.

623
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,675
Come on, there's no way.

624
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,010
He's been going fishing on his days off,

625
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,388
getting plenty of fresh air and exercise.

626
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,765
He's been working hard
to keep up his health.

627
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,227
Right, when we did some bloodwork
and a few other tests last month,

628
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,687
all his results were okay.

629
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,523
Right, I doubt that's what it is, Ms. Oh.

630
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:54,861
If that's not it,
I just don't understand it at all.

631
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,738
-(sighs)
-(sighs)

632
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,032
(soft, somber music)

633
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,841
What are you doing here?

634
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,141
I need an explanation, sir.

635
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,601
What?

636
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,778
Gosh.

637
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,702
DOIL: First of all, Master Kim.

638
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,371
Cha Jinman as head of the Trauma Center?

639
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,665
MYEONGSIM: Is there

640
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,501
some other reason that we don't know of?

641
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,006
If not, I just don't get it.

642
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,507
No, Ms. Oh.

643
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,012
That position should be open
to anyone capable,

644
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,098
even if that isn't me.

645
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,352
SABU: Saying that
you can't understand that

646
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,313
is a dangerous thought.

647
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,025
SABU: I know.

648
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,529
We've all been working very hard
for the Trauma Center.

649
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,741
And if not
for your efforts and dedication,

650
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,660
we wouldn't have gotten this far.

651
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,288
But effort and dedication

652
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,832
should be left behind
the moment you've given them.

653
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,210
SABU: Hoping for some kind of payment

654
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,254
or demanding recognition of your input,

655
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:40,341
things will turn into
a muddy mess in a flash.

656
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,759
GITAE: But,

657
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,305
the head of the Trauma Center
should be the leader who will take charge.

658
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,724
GITAE: That position should be filled

659
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,727
after more careful
and meticulous consideration.

660
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,444
If all of you keep working hard

661
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,738
in your respective positions,

662
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,409
nothing drastic will happen
just because we hired someone

663
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,287
from the outside
to be the new head of the Trauma Center.

664
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,621
(Sabu chuckles)

665
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,790
My goodness.

666
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,750
SABU: I know.

667
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,963
This will be a test for us too.

668
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:19,964
However,

669
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:25,136
we will have more trauma patients
once we open,

670
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,472
then we'll need more doctors.

671
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,600
SABU: Without accepting new doctors,

672
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,437
how much longer do you think
we can hold out?

673
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,274
So please,

674
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,027
accept my decision without any bias.

675
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,696
Okay, Ms. Oh?

676
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,243
Doil.

677
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,870
(somber piano music)

678
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,755
Chief Jang and Dr. Bae too.

679
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,593
Okay.

680
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,262
Dr. Jung and Euntak too.

681
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,726
And you, Dr. Seo Woojin?

682
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,319
EUNJAE: What's going on?

683
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,657
I'll be sharing this office with you
until the Trauma Center is ready.

684
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,453
I'm asking why you came
to Doldam Hospital.

685
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,247
Director Park offered me the position
of the head of the Trauma Center,

686
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,999
and I accepted.

687
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,084
Dad!

688
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,712
Is it okay for you to call me Dad
in the hospital?

689
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,590
If you're the head of the Trauma Center,
what about Master Kim?

690
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,928
I mean, why did you quit your job
at the university hospital?

691
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,262
What for?

692
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,682
JINMAN: I've received much privilege
from today's society.

693
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,434
What?

694
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:59,188
Thanks to that, I've received honor
and been in the limelight.

695
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,233
JINMAN: It's time for me to pay it back.

696
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,068
For society,

697
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,406
I intend to take on responsibility
and perform my duties from here.

698
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,950
-Dad.
-JINMAN: And most of all,

699
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,535
I wanted to see you too.

700
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,246
(soft piano music)

701
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,549
I'm sorry, sir,

702
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,220
but I can't agree
with your decision this time.

703
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,640
Why not? Do you still need
more of an explanation?

704
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:39,145
No, I understood everything you said.

705
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,856
I just…

706
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,733
can't agree with it. That's all.

707
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,361
I told you. You don't need to keep
your guard up like that.

708
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,656
Professor Cha Jinman is a talented surgeon
who has experience in the field.

709
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,991
And with this opportunity,

710
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,120
it won't be a bad idea to get
an objective evaluation from an outsider.

711
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,747
You're the only one
who can evaluate me as a doctor.

712
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,751
You're also the only one
I want to be recognized by as a doctor.

713
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,796
Hey, Woojin.

714
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,382
I don't want a trauma center without you.

715
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,260
-(somber piano music)
-(sighs)

716
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,387
If you decide to stay here,

717
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,764
I will too.

718
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,939
(door opens)

719
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,445
(sighs)

720
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,371
Can we talk for a minute?

721
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,754
EUNJAE: So…

722
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,633
My dad will be coming to Doldam Hospital.

723
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,135
WOOJIN: I heard from Master Kim.

724
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,013
Oh, I see.

725
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,768
What is it?

726
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,269
Hm?

727
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,356
You have something
you want to say to me. Tell me.

728
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,359
Well, the thing is…

729
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:16,617
My dad says he hasn't found
a place to stay yet, so…

730
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,289
Sorry, what do we do?

731
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,668
What about all my stuff?

732
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:29,630
We haven't unpacked them,
so they're still in boxes.

733
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:33,801
If I say that I have a roommate,
he won't go into your room.

734
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:38,597
Could you please stay somewhere else
until he finds a place in a few days?

735
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,849
(soft acoustic music)

736
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,770
I looked into it,
but company housing is already full.

737
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,356
He said he would sleep at an inn,

738
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,858
but he'd have to go all the way into town.

739
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,739
I haven't seen him in a year,
so I didn't feel at ease.

740
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,994
Okay, I'll stay at the hospital.

741
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,788
You're not mad, are you?

742
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,248
Not at all.

743
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:06,959
Thanks.

744
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,382
-Eunjae.
-Yes?

745
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,009
He's your dad.

746
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,927
And I'm your man.

747
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,850
It doesn't have to be so hard
for you to ask me, okay?

748
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,353
Okay.

749
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,148
Don't get caught.

750
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,942
Okay, I won't.

751
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,989
Sorry about the tomato juice.

752
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,700
Hey, that tomato juice…

753
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,662
Okay.

754
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,943
ARRIVED AT DOLDAMN HOSPITAL
PROFESSOR PARK

755
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:18,906
JINMAN: Generally speaking,
it's important to make it down well.

756
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,370
But this darn thing called pride

757
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,748
makes a man act petty.

758
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,419
(wind howling)

759
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,675
(dark mysterious music)

760
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,597
-COACH 1: Why did he do that?
-COACH 2: Where are you?

761
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,808
-COACH 1: What was he thinking?
-COACH 2: Where is he?

762
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,518
We're coming!

763
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,019
-Hurry up!
-COACH 3: Sungyoon!

764
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,480
-I think it's serious.
-Hurry.

765
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,690
Hey, Sungyoon.

766
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,193
-Are you okay?
-His leg is broken!

767
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,487
This way.

768
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,114
-Sungyoon!
-Coach!

769
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,490
Coach!

770
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,200
(Sungyoon groaning)

771
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,743
-Hurry up!
-We have to help him!

772
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,286
-Hurry!
-Oh, no.

773
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,831
Hurry! Coach!

774
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,168
(yells)

775
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,087
-Endure it.
-Hey, did you call 911?

776
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,090
-(Sungyoon wailing)
-(all clamoring in panic)

777
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,216
Don't touch him.

778
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,095
-(Sungyoon groaning)
-(all continue to clamor)

779
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,433
(music intensifies, fades)

780
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,394
AREUM: Hello, I'm here.

781
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,521
Huh?

782
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,941
Hey, Dr. Jung. I'm here.

783
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,568
Hey, Dr. Yoon Areum.

784
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,446
All right then.

785
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,409
-(somber guitar music)
-Hm?

786
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,334
(Sabu sighs)

787
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,717
GITAE: Anyway,
it was Master Kim's decision.

788
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,261
What kind of person is Dr. Cha exactly?

789
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,306
Well, he was pretty well-known
in cardiothoracic surgery.

790
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,066
Huh?

791
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,779
Dr. Yoon. You're here early.
Aren't you on call tonight?

792
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:25,491
I had some papers to look over.
But, Dr. Bae.

793
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,452
What's with the mood in the hospital?

794
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,537
Oh.

795
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:35,542
Gosh, Master Kim set off
a massive bomb just now.

796
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:40,631
EUNTAK: Five…

797
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,887
(sighs)

798
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,685
(clears throat)

799
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,313
Can I help you with anything?

800
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,689
You're here.

801
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,274
I heard.

802
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,861
Apparently, Master Kim set off
a nuclear bomb today.

803
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,780
I know.

804
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,740
He did.

805
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:11,119
What do we do? It feels like everyone
is having a mental breakdown.

806
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,456
Are you okay, Euntak?

807
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,959
It was a breakdown for me too.

808
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,169
But after hearing
Master Kim's explanation,

809
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,421
I understood why he did what he did.

810
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,841
That's always the problem.

811
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,802
Whenever Master Kim sets off a bomb,

812
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,722
you think, "Does this make any sense?"

813
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,642
But then when you hear him out,
you always understand him.

814
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,230
Are you jet-lagged at all?

815
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,608
I'm fine. I adjusted within two days.

816
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:43,986
Oh, right.

817
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,572
Here.

818
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,866
I bought it at the airport on my way back.

819
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,659
I missed the chance to give it to you.

820
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,002
Since your hands are precious.

821
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,131
(soft romantic music)

822
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,549
I missed you.

823
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,135
We were only apart for a week.

824
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,720
But how could you

825
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,139
not even text me once?

826
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,226
You went to volunteer in a remote area.

827
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,061
"I miss you."

828
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,438
"When are you coming back?"

829
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,522
"Come back soon."

830
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,317
I'd seem like I was throwing a fit.

831
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,736
That's always the problem.

832
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:30,073
You think, "Does this make any sense?"

833
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,825
But when I hear you out,

834
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,037
I always understand you.

835
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,872
(laughs)

836
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,585
Mm!

837
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,383
You said you missed me.

838
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,428
I want to check how much you missed me.

839
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,471
Mm!

840
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,891
We're in the hospital, Dr. Yoon.

841
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:04,232
See? You didn't miss me that much.

842
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,241
(giggles)

843
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,878
(sighs)

844
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,094
There are still 40 minutes left.

845
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,680
What?

846
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,139
Until you get off work.

847
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,685
Still, we didn't have
very many patients this afternoon.

848
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,979
(intense ominous music)

849
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,188
Dr. Jang.

850
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:44,982
What?

851
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,568
DONGHWA: Did I do something wrong?

852
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,114
What is it?

853
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,075
-(music intensifies)
-(phone rings)

854
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,038
Yes, Doldam Hospital ER?

855
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,332
Yes.

856
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,334
HYEONJEONG: Yes, got it.

857
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,421
Someone fell while skiing.
They'll be here in five minutes.

858
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,338
What?

859
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,341
(sighs)

860
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,592
This is driving me nuts.

861
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,223
(shivered breathing)

862
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,354
(phone buzzes)

863
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,983
(tense music)

864
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,240
WE WISH YOU GOOD HEALTH

865
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,075
What kind of patient is it?

866
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,161
Someone fell while skiing again.

867
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,871
We were told it was an open fracture.

868
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,790
INSU: Next month, there's going to be
a World Championship game in Pyeongchang.

869
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,210
We'll probably keep seeing patients
who get injured while training.

870
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,754
PARAMEDIC: Emergency patient!

871
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,715
-COACH 1: Sungyoon.
-COACH 2: Hey, hang in there.

872
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,341
-COACH 1: Sungyoon!
-COACH 2: We're at the hospital.

873
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,097
(groans)

874
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,392
What a bunch of quacks!

875
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,269
Is it all fine
if the exam results are fine?

876
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,271
I'm telling you I'm in pain!

877
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:08,899
What?

878
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,652
(inhales sharply)

879
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,322
To the hybrid OR! Now!

880
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:16,782
COACH 1: Please.

881
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,033
INSU: This way.

882
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,869
-The middle bed!
-PARAMEDIC: This way!

883
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,037
INSU: Sir.

884
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,290
-Be careful.
-AREUM: Please wait outside.

885
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,585
(suspenseful music)

886
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,170
INSU: Dr. Seo!

887
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:37,886
-PARAMEDIC 1: Sir!
-PARAMEDIC 2: It's his leg.

888
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,638
MUNJEONG: Let's lift him up. One, two.

889
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,722
INSU: Be careful.

890
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,057
MUNJEONG: Okay.

891
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,476
(door unlocks)

892
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,569
Just a second, Dad. One second.

893
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,154
One second…

894
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,949
(funky music)

895
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,910
Just a second, Dad!

896
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,662
(pants)

897
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,122
Just a second.

898
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,375
(gasps)

899
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,753
(pants)

900
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,171
It's my laundry.

901
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,926
EUNJAE: Just a second.

902
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,888
Come in, Dad.

903
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,939
It's nice and cozy.

904
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,483
Do you live here alone?

905
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,236
No, I have a roommate.

906
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,656
I mentioned you were coming,
so my friend is staying at the hospital.

907
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:40,782
The hospital?

908
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,617
Your roommate is a doctor?

909
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,327
What?

910
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,371
Yes, well…

911
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,207
It's Dr. Yoon Areum at Doldam Hospital.

912
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,792
She's an emergency medicine doctor.

913
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,091
My room is this way.
You can leave your stuff here.

914
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,134
I'll do it.

915
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,266
(sighs)

916
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,978
INSU: Start two IV lines, and start
hydration with 500cc of warm saline.

917
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,938
Get two emergency pack RBCs.

918
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,816
And prepare ten RBCs and eight FFPs.

919
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,067
YEONGMI: Yes, Doctor.

920
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,278
Dr. Seo, have you found
the bleeding focus?

921
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,446
WOOJIN: It's hemoperitoneum.

922
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,406
Jang Donghwa, open that side up.

923
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,454
Open it up all the way!

924
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,624
(groans)

925
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:32,918
It's his spleen.

926
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,587
Dr. Jung, BP is 80 over 40.

927
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,797
-Prepare the RIS!
-NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

928
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,549
INSU: Areum, get the labs started.

929
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,800
Okay, I'll get it ready.

930
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,553
His pulse is really weak.

931
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,597
He might have a vessel injury too.

932
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,932
The popliteal artery?

933
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,016
Yes, it could be.

934
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,143
Was there any pumping?

935
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,270
No, there wasn't any at the scene.

936
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,649
Ms. Eom, ask Dr. Nam to open up an OR.

937
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,776
-And call Dr. Cha Eunjae.
-Yes, Doctor.

938
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,527
Let's get a temporary splint on here.

939
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,364
-Dr. Jung, see him through sedation.
-Okay.

940
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,323
Euntak.

941
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,574
I'll get it ready.

942
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,952
-INSU: Let's get him intubated.
-YEONGMI: Yes, Doctor.

943
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,828
Jang Donghwa, you assist.

944
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,997
What?

945
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,590
Jang Donghwa, stop dawdling!

946
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,427
Get your scrubs on. Hurry.

947
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,644
HYEONJEONG: Excuse me. Coming through.

948
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,855
What's going on?

949
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,524
Is it an emergency patient?

950
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,985
Well, maybe? I think so.

951
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,865
WOOJIN: Let's begin. Scalpel.

952
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,451
DONGHWA: But sir, this is the ER.

953
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,495
WOOJIN: Prepare a lot of gauze
for the bleeding.

954
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,496
YEONGMI: Yes, Doctor.

955
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,423
WOOJIN: Bovie.

956
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,764
WOOJIN: Suction! Large tape!

957
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,691
WOOJIN: Richardson.

958
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,651
Forceps.

959
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,071
WOOJIN: Suction.

960
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,114
I said, suction!

961
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,544
WOOJIN: Don't touch that.
You're crushing the pancreas.

962
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,129
DONGHWA: Oh, okay.

963
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,966
WOOJIN: Euntak, switch with Jang Donghwa.

964
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,648
WOOJIN: Clamp.

965
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,276
Another one here.

966
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,156
Tie, please.

967
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:16,748
WOOJIN: Cut.

968
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:17,832
EUNTAK: Cut.

969
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:18,875
WOOJIN: Another.

970
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,669
We'll temporarily hold the splenic artery,

971
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,963
pack it with gauze, get a CT,
and get him to the OR.

972
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,298
-Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

973
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,841
-WOOJIN: Get me a cover.
-YEONGMI: Okay.

974
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,975
EUNTAK: We're moving the patient.

975
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,320
(pants)

976
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,243
WOOJIN: What are you doing?

977
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,369
Are you here to have fun?

978
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,955
What are you doing,
just standing around and watching?

979
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,207
I'm sorry, I was so dumbstruck.

980
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,835
Get your act together fast
and run over to the OR.

981
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,045
We're starting a splenectomy right away.

982
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,422
Get ready quickly.

983
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,634
Get a move on!

984
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,058
Dr. Seo.

985
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,936
INSU: Jang Donghwa is
a third-year resident.

986
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,980
You should at least explain things
along the way.

987
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,774
He has to know what he's doing
to follow along.

988
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,359
Right now, the patient comes first.

989
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,695
There's no time
to look out for Jang Donghwa's mood.

990
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,202
What's wrong with you?
You're not acting like yourself.

991
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,998
Why are you in such a rush?

992
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,167
That patient

993
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,252
is on the national team.

994
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,630
So?

995
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,757
He's the patient from this morning

996
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,886
that I sent away for faking his pains.

997
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:00,977
(sighs)

998
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:08,109
Are you really okay with ramyeon?

999
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,738
I usually eat out or order in.

1000
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,907
I didn't realize I was out of rice.

1001
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,409
Delivery food tastes good too.

1002
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,453
It's fine. Don't mind me.

1003
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,872
I don't dislike ramyeon.

1004
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,959
Mm.

1005
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,669
(phone buzzes)

1006
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,216
Is it the hospital?

1007
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:34,427
Yes. They think
it's a ruptured popliteal artery.

1008
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,720
Get going.

1009
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,263
(sighs)

1010
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,475
Just leave the bowl in the sink
when you're done.

1011
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,727
-I'll do the dishes when I get back.
-JINMAN: Okay.

1012
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,525
The surgery might run late,
so don't wait up.

1013
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,276
(coughs)
Okay.

1014
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:51,653
(coughs)

1015
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,655
(door opens)

1016
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,448
(door closes)

1017
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,578
(exhales)

1018
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,466
(sighs, chuckles)

1019
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,147
(tense music)

1020
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:35,238
IT'S THE TOMATOES LEFT FROM THIS MORNING.
SHAKE WELL BEFORE DRINKING.

1021
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:44,682
WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM

1022
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,102
EUNJAE: Hey, Dr. Lee. Are you still here?

1023
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:49,687
Are you going home?

1024
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,899
I went home and came back
for an emergency surgery.

1025
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,359
An emergency surgery?

1026
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,780
May I also go into the OR?

1027
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:00,823
(quirky music)

1028
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,241
What is it?

1029
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,244
How lucky can you get? Gosh.

1030
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,580
EUNJAE: Where on earth did
this rarity come from?

1031
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,415
Hurry up and get ready.

1032
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,001
I'll teach you a lesson today.

1033
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,461
(Eunjae chuckles)

1034
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,175
(exhales)

1035
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:33,690
RESTRICTED AREA
OPERATING ROOM

1036
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:36,109
(dark somber music)

1037
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,654
(machines beeping)

1038
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,664
MUNJEONG: The CT scan seems to show damage

1039
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,374
in the anterior
and posterior tibial artery

1040
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,710
in the distalis region
rather than the popliteal artery.

1041
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,421
MUNJEONG: We'll have to do some exploring,

1042
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:58,881
but from what I saw
while putting on the splints,

1043
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,509
it seems to be the deep peroneal nerve.

1044
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,764
Eunjae, what about the artery anastomosis?

1045
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,641
There's a lot of tissue damage around it,

1046
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,144
so I'm considering
a GSV graft from the other side.

1047
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,979
EUNJAE: In order to prevent
compartment syndrome,

1048
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,398
Munjeong is considering
a fasciotomy as well.

1049
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,233
What will you do about the peroneal nerve?

1050
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:20,903
(sighs)

1051
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,655
WOOJIN: Gauze.

1052
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,870
WOOJIN: Okay. Bovie.

1053
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:36,711
WOOJIN: Hold here.

1054
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,379
DONGHWA: Forceps.

1055
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:41,966
WOOJIN: Metzenbaum scissors.

1056
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,472
DONGHWA: Sorry, sir.

1057
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,604
WOOJIN: Remove the spleen.

1058
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,152
WOOJIN: Gauze, please.

1059
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,242
WOOJIN: Suture.

1060
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,419
WOOJIN: Get Master Kim on the line.

1061
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:22,423
(flip switches on)

1062
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,342
WOOJIN: Master,

1063
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:25,802
we'll finish suturing in five.

1064
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,762
Will we start with neurorrhaphy?

1065
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,889
What are you saying?
The arteries come first.

1066
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,307
WOOJIN: He's on the national team.

1067
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,852
If we don't stitch up the nerves soon,
he might never get to jump again.

1068
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:38,606
If we don't get to his arteries soon,
he might lose his whole leg.

1069
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,024
WOOJIN: Master.

1070
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:49,867
WOOJIN: Master.

1071
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,254
WOOJIN: Cut.

1072
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:04,048
Jang Donghwa, you do the closing sutures.

1073
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:04,966
Within three minutes.

1074
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,013
EUNTAK: Dr. Jang.

1075
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:18,062
DONGHWA: Give it to me.

1076
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,898
Master.

1077
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,608
Can't we do the neurorrhaphy first?

1078
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,193
EUNJAE: Seo Woojin.

1079
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,863
A fracture this serious means
the end of the injury site is crushed.

1080
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,240
EUNJAE: Even if you do a neurorrhaphy
after exploring,

1081
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:32,410
the viability is too low.
We can't delay the artery anastomosis.

1082
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,328
If he doesn't recover
from the nerve injury,

1083
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,247
his life as an athlete is over anyway.

1084
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,499
Either way,
it's a death sentence for that man.

1085
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,043
Still, rather than taking a risk,

1086
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,671
I think it's right to do
the arterial surgery first, Dr. Seo.

1087
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:46,924
Nerves start to die
the moment they sustain an injury.

1088
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:49,385
WOOJIN: Then isn't it best to stitch them
back up as soon as possible?

1089
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:53,139
Master Kim.
With your speed, it's possible.

1090
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:58,811
(sighs)

1091
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,062
Master.

1092
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,773
-(door opens)
-JINMAN: Why are you hesitating?

1093
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:04,275
Hm?

1094
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:08,779
All surgeries must prioritize
the patient's life.

1095
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,197
Next is the patient's safety.

1096
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,117
Decisions on function come last.

1097
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,078
Everyone in here knows that.

1098
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,455
So why are you wasting time?

1099
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,249
You're not thinking

1100
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,295
of doing a neurorrhaphy first
like a madman, are you?

1101
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:28,424
We're contemplating what would be
the best method for this patient.

1102
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,384
So why are you contemplating that?

1103
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,220
The order to save him is already set.

1104
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,513
To that patient,

1105
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:37,516
his life as an athlete
is also on the line.

1106
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,269
If you miss the timing to operate,
he will lose his life as an athlete

1107
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,187
as well as his leg.

1108
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,315
Or, he might not lose either one.

1109
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:51,822
SABU: All right, Ms. Oh.

1110
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,367
Could you check the complexion
of the patient's left foot?

1111
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,838
MYEONGSIM: It's looking good, Master Kim.

1112
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,638
Woojin. How much longer do you need
to finish closing?

1113
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,140
Dr. Jang Donghwa.

1114
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:21,894
DONGHWA: I'm done.

1115
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:24,105
-Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

1116
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:27,400
MYEONGSIM: We're done closing, Master Kim.

1117
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,611
DOIL: Are we doing the arteries first?
Or the neurorrhaphy?

1118
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:34,448
(exhales)

1119
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:44,291
Neurorrhaphy first.

1120
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,504
DOIL: Okay, the neurorrhaphy first.

1121
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,631
You shouldn't look
at the patient's perspective.

1122
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,262
You must look at the symptoms, Dr. Bu.

1123
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,640
That's why I just checked his symptoms.

1124
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,768
Didn't you hear the complexion
in his left foot is back?

1125
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:03,978
SABU: That means

1126
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:08,607
one of the two arteries
hasn't been damaged. And that means

1127
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,362
it won't be too much of a risk
to stitch up the nerves first.

1128
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,866
Don't be such an amateur.

1129
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,327
Are you getting rusty?

1130
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,042
MUNJEONG: Gosh, he knows everything.

1131
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,085
He even had that in mind.

1132
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:30,629
Let's go in, Dr. Cha.

1133
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:33,632
Oh, okay.

1134
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:34,800
Cha Eunjae,

1135
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,137
are you saying
you will go into that surgery?

1136
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:39,555
What?

1137
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:42,975
You will participate
in that impulsive and reckless surgery?

1138
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,351
It's not reckless.

1139
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,229
He sees what we can't see.

1140
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:50,149
EUNJAE: Master Kim has a lot of experience
dealing with trauma.

1141
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:51,233
WOOJIN: Yes, that's right.

1142
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:55,404
Whoever it is,

1143
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,949
no matter what he does
or what position he is in,

1144
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,327
he doesn't think about anything else.

1145
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,538
He just keeps one thing in mind.

1146
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:06,499
Save the patient.

1147
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,834
Save the patient, no matter what.

1148
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:14,840
That was Master Kim's first lesson
that he taught us.

1149
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:19,220
Do you think that's a surgery
to save a person's life?

1150
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:20,888
For that patient,

1151
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:24,100
his life as an athlete
is a part of his life.

1152
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:26,852
You guys…

1153
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,314
are just as crazy as he is.

1154
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:35,486
Sometimes, there are levels
that you can't reach without going crazy.

1155
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:37,822
And Master Kim…

1156
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:43,869
calls it romance.

1157
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,622
Romance?

1158
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,084
In a field
where people's lives are at stake,

1159
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:51,794
he talks about finding romance?

1160
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:52,837
Yes.

1161
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:58,300
That's how we've been saving people
up until now, Professor.

1162
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,595
(tense music)

1163
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,809
Cha Eunjae, aren't you going?

1164
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,394
WOOJIN: If not, I'll go.

1165
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,901
Dad, let's talk later.

1166
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:19,738
EUNJAE: Woojin.

1167
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,287
(scoffs)

1168
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,373
(tense, grandiose music)

1169
01:09:57,943 --> 01:09:58,819
Romance?

1170
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,614
(scoffs)

1171
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,449
Romance, you say?

1172
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,576
(suspenseful music)

1173
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,494
SABU: Mm.

1174
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:16,879
SABU: Scalpel.

1175
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,843
(closing theme music)

1176
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,777
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

1177
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:41,737
JINMAN: In all things…

1178
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,156
-EUNTAK: It's hematemesis.
-SABU: The patient isn't dead yet.

1179
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,866
…there are fundamentals and principles.

1180
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,369
GITAE: He just died from heart failure.

1181
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:50,537
WOOJIN: Whether this old lady
committed arson or not…

1182
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,748
SABU: Debating over
who is good and who is bad.

1183
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:55,459
Hey. You may as well
go be a judge or prosecutor

1184
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:56,710
instead of being here!

1185
01:10:57,127 --> 01:11:00,172
MINGUK: This is the list that
Professor Cha Jinman sent this morning.

1186
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,341
MYEONGSIM: He acted like he wouldn't
take anyone with him.

1187
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:05,261
INSU: What about the emergency room
at Doldam Hospital?

1188
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,471
JINMAN: The moment hope proves futile,

1189
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:11,642
the only thing left is the harsh reality.
