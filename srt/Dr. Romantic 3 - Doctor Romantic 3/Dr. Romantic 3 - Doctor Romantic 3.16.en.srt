DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,962
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,882
(soft acoustic music)

5
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:55,513
SABU: They say that life
puts us to the test in two ways.

6
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,185
Either nothing happens

7
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,147
or everything happens all at once.

8
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,024
-NURSE 1: Coming through!
-NURSE 2: This way.

9
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,317
-MR. KOO: Make way!
-I'll take her now.

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,234
Okay.

11
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,152
FINAL EPISODE

12
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,320
Just a second.

13
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,906
It was really hard to start an IV
for this patient.

14
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,240
Make sure it doesn't slip out.

15
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,533
DONGHWA: Yes, Doctor.

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,953
You should leave too, Dr. Areum.

17
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,122
This patient seems to be the last one.

18
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,958
I'll stay and look around a little more,
so you should go ahead.

19
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,337
I'll look around
so please evacuate first, Dr. Areum.

20
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,508
The Doldam ER is my responsibility.

21
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,843
The person in charge
should be the last one to leave.

22
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,430
Shall I stay with you?

23
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,308
No, please evacuate with the others.

24
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,894
I'll go with the last team to leave.

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,563
Okay, I'll see you at the shelter.

26
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,066
Let's go.

27
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,541
-MAN: Let's hurry up.
-WOMAN: Are you hurting anywhere else?

28
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,084
NURSE 3: Yes, this way.

29
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,503
-Please be careful.
-Let's go.

30
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,005
-NURSE 4: Let's move.
-PATIENT: Yes, thank you.

31
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,674
EUNTAK: Yes, Nurse Oh.

32
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,384
I just came over to Doldam.

33
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,887
I understand, I'll take a look upstairs.

34
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,599
(Areum gasps)

35
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,819
-Please evacuate first.
-NURSE 5: Yes, sir.

36
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,490
Nurse Oh, both the ICU
and individual ICUs have been cleared.

37
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,869
Just to be sure, could you check
the inpatient rooms one last time?

38
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:41,786
Yes, Nurse Oh.

39
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,956
You two help transport
the flammable drugs.

40
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,040
NURSE 6: Yes, Nurse Oh.

41
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,584
Nurse Oh.

42
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,669
Nurse Euntak, how is the Trauma Center?

43
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,337
All patients there have been evacuated.

44
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,965
The remaining trauma staff
will evacuate after one last inspection.

45
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,217
Please take care
of the DMAT bag, Nurse Euntak.

46
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,511
MYEONGSIM: There may be
a shortage of drugs in the shelter

47
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,389
so work with the emergency rescue team
to pack as much as you can.

48
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,599
Yes, Nurse Oh.

Are you looking for something?

51
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,438
I don't see Master Kim anywhere.

52
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,273
He was the first
to leave after the operation.

53
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,442
He didn't come up here.

54
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,068
I'll take care of the DMAT bag first.

55
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,111
Okay.

INSU: Pack important documents only.

60
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,372
Yes, Dr. Jung.

INSU: Quickly.

62
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,922
I hope nothing bad happens.

63
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,633
I really hope we can come back.

64
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,763

We'll move in teams. Mr. Lee!

66
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,516
The Doldam team will go in this car.

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,560
-Keep looking.
-Check there and come back.

68
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,354
-Yes, sir.

-INSU: Dr. Ung, can you take this?
-SEONUNG: Okay.

75
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,011
Why aren't you leaving?

76
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,930
Master Kim isn't here.

Are you all ready to evacuate?

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,206
I think all of the patients have been
evacuated from Trauma Center and Doldam.

82
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,251
The rest of the staff are checking
the hospital rooms one last time.

83
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,503
The ICU on the second floor
has been taken care of,

84
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,589
and all the highly flammable drugs
and oxygen tanks have been transported.

85
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,426
All right, we will start
evacuating the medical staff now.

86
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,511
MINGUK: Doldam Hospital staff
will go to the shelter,

87
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,139
and Trauma Center staff will go
to the community health center

88
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,267
to take care of any injuries that arise
and any patients.

89
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,476
All right, let's move!

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,270
Let's go first. This way!

00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,278
INSU: Director!

94
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,863
MINGUK: Yes, Dr. Jung?

95
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,574
Master Kim is nowhere in sight.

96
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,200
What?

97
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,411
(pensive music)

98
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,422
Here.

(breathes heavily)

100
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,098
Nurse.

101
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,684
Has everyone
from the Trauma Center evacuated?

102
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:55,104
I'm not sure.
I just finished evacuating patients.

103
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,522
Oh, okay.

104
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,450

-(door opens)
-INSU: Nurse Euntak!

112
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,227
Master Kim left
the operation room earlier, right?

113
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,729
Yes, he left before me.

114
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,606
EUNTAK: Why?

115
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,816
Is he not in his office?

116
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,025
He's not there.

117
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,320
His coat is still there,
and there's no sign of him coming over.

118
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,614
INSU: No one has seen him either.

119
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,953
I'll check the ICU on the second floor
and the general ward again.

120
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,498
Can you look
around the Trauma Center again?

121
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,541
Yes, I'll do that.

122
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,961
INSU: Areum, hurry up and evacuate.

123
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,087
Let's go, quickly.

128
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,940
It looks like the fire
is spreading toward us already.

(Eunjae sighs)

130
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,903
What do we do?

131
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,325
WOOJIN: It's going to be okay.

132
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,828

-I can't find Master Kim.

137
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,258
EUNJAE: What?

138
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,723

141
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,939
I'll look in the hallways.
(coughs)

142
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,106
I'll check inside.

143
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,191
Okay.

144
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:49,987
Seo Woojin!

145
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,907
What are you still doing here?
Why didn't you evacuate yet?

146
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,369
I already checked upstairs
so hurry up and evacuate.

147
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,495
Master Kim…

148
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,331
Master Kim is missing.

150
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,463
Master Kim!

EUNJAE: Master Kim!

152
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,175
Master Kim?

153
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,302
EUNTAK: Master Kim!

154
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,638
Master Kim!

155
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,598
Master Kim!

159
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,073
Okay, I understand.

160
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,078
We checked around the consultation rooms,
locker rooms, and bathrooms

161
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,413
but he wasn't there.

162
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,165
I just spoke to Chief Jang too.

163
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,168
No, Master Kim hasn't come out yet.

164
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,296
I don't see him

165
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,423
out here.

166
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,969
Where on earth did he go?

167
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,724
Nurse Oh, Dr. Bae, and Dr. Jang.
You three should evacuate first.

168
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,392
I'll check the second floor again.

169
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,855
I have to grab some things from my office.
Please go first.

170
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,360
Nurse Oh.

Nurse Euntak.

175
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,735
I just found Master Kim.

176
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,280
(panting)

177
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,908
I'll evacuate with him,

178
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,620
so please evacuate
with the rest of the doctors.

179
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,330
Is he sick or injured?

180
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,376
Okay, Nurse Oh.

181
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,503
You too, please be careful.

182
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,630
(exhales loudly)

183
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,757
They found him? Where?

184
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,927
(exhales loudly)

185
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,512
Okay.

186
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,349
I'll evacuate with Cha Eunjae.
You should evacuate too, Nurse Euntak.

187
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,686
-DONGJU: Master Kim!
-(phone vibrates)

188
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,728
(coughs)

189
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,231
DR. SEO WOOJIN

190
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,441
WOOJIN: We found Master Kim.
Please evacuate quickly.

191
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,985
(exhales loudly)

192
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,787
HEAD OF TRAUMA CENTER'S OFFICE

193
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,714
What are you doing here alone?
You should evacuate.

194
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,258
Hey, Nurse Oh.

195
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,802
I just

196
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,888
wanted to look around.

197
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,312
My gosh. Come to think of it,

198
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,066
you've saved a lot of people here.

199
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,694
MYEONGSIM: You practically

200
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,697
chased after people
standing at death's door

201
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,992
with a scalpel

202
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,161
and rescued them.

203
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,663
(chuckles softly)

204
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,709
To tell you the truth,

205
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,380
I holed up in Doldam Hospital

206
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,925
because I was tired of
and disliked the way of the world.

207
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,137
People began to flock over

208
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,140
after you came here.

209
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,272
I know better than anyone else

210
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,526
that you want to leave the Trauma Center

211
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,863
as your pupils' dreams.

212
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,993
MYEONGSIM: I also know
Professor Cha Jinman and Dr. Kang Dongju

213
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,204
are both skillful surgeons

214
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:12,333
and have great potential.

215
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,669
However,

216
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,339
I think there's a difference

217
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,716
between being skillful

218
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,843
and being gravitational.

219
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,222
Gravitational?

220
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,140
Your gravity

221
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,852
pulled everyone here, Master Kim.

222
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,569
Even if the forest fire passes

223
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,990
and Doldam Hospital becomes ashes,

224
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,537
Team Doldam will last forever

225
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,790
as long as your gravity is around.

226
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,463
(chuckles softly)

227
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,305
Well, there's nothing I can do for you
about this situation, but…

228
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,772
I was afraid
your blood sugar might be low.

229
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,357
Cheer up.

230
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,775
(laughs)

231
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,281
(uplifting music)

232
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,580
(laughs)

233
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,917
-(laughs)
-(Sabu laughs)

234
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,928
(thunder rumbling)

235
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,360
(thunder rumbling)

236
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,700
-Please open the door.
-This way.

237
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,077
-Slowly. Be careful.
-(coughs)

238
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,748
(thunder rumbling)

239
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,502
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

240
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,883
Chief Park!

241
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,177
Is that a cloud

242
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,305
or smoke up there?

243
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,268
(rumbling)

244
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,196
You heard that too, right?

245
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,659
(thunder rumbling)

246
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,087
EUNJAE: What?

247
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,255
(gasps)

248
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,467
It must be raining.

249
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,346
(Eunjae gasps)

250
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,436
I felt a raindrop just now.
What about you?

251
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,859
I think I just… Oh, it's cold.
I just felt another raindrop.

252
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,902
HOJUN: Rain?

253
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,696
-What?
-DOIL: What?

254
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,701
(exclaims, laughs)

255
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,868
Look!

256
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:39,498
(staff members exclaiming, laughing)

257
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,625
GITAE: It's raining!

258
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,921
Chief Park, it's raining!

259
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,382
-It's me.
-STAFF: It's raining!

260
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,758
Is it raining over there too?

261
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,511
CHIEF PARK: Yes, okay. Got it.

262
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,513
It's been raining
for ten minutes in the city too.

263
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,307
The fire is slowly getting
under control over there.

264
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:01,478
If the fire is getting under control,
does that mean Doldam Hospital is safe?

265
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,939
The evacuation order
will be in effect until tomorrow morning,

266
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,483
but if it keeps raining like this,
the fire will be contained.

267
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,735
Thank you!

268
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,737
GITAE: Thank you so much!

269
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,823
(laughs)

270
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:13,991
We're saved!

271
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,035
We're saved now!

272
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,077
We're saved!

273
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,246
(all cheering, laughing)

274
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,291
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

275
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,852
-(all cheering, laughing)
-GITAE: We're saved, everyone!

276
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,773
Hey, Dr. Ung, we're getting wet.
Get inside, quickly!

277
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,067
HOJUN: Let's go in, hurry up!

278
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,697
Hey, Jang Donghwa!

279
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,616
Hurry up and come here!

280
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,867
Come over here!

281
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,786
-What are you doing?
-Get over here!

282
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,503
DONGHWA: For a long time,
I couldn't forget about that moment.

283
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,923
Even the meaningless rain

284
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,926
started to become meaningful.

285
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,637
(phone vibrates)

286
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,141
Chief Jang just texted me.

287
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,226
What?

288
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,188
(gasps)
He says it's raining outside right now.

289
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,606
It's raining?

290
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,401
The forest fire warning level
has gone from alert to caution too.

291
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,071
(laughs)

292
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,907
(laughs)

293
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,663
(laughs)
Goodness.

294
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,833
FOREST FIRE NEAR SABUK-EUP
WARNING LEVEL LOWERED TO 'CAUTION'

295
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,211
Oh, my gosh!
The fire is getting under control now!

296
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,921
We're safe.

297
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,550
That means our hospital
is safe now, right?

298
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,301
See? I told you everything would be okay.

299
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,387
What a relief!

300
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,681
(sighs)

301
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,642
I was really scared this time.

302
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,394
(sighs)

303
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,812
EUNJAE: Gosh.

304
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,232
(Eunjae breathes shudderingly)

305
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,536
(sighs)

306
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,549
(rain pattering on window)

307
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,066
You received the text too, right?

308
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,862
The warning level went down to caution.

309
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,947
But the evacuation orders

310
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,951
will stay in effect
until tomorrow morning.

311
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,499
It looks like
the rest of us will have to stay

312
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,252
and watch the hospital
until tomorrow morning.

313
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,636
Actually,

314
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,222
I have something to say.

315
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,306
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,603
I never imagined
you would be waiting for me

317
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,898
with that expression.

318
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,194
EUNTAK: And that's how
you must've looked that day too.

319
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,155
You must have been so anxious and restless

320
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,659
waiting for news of my safety.

321
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,372
I didn't take that into consideration.

322
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,167
I'm sorry for being inattentive.

323
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,340
I thought

324
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,220
everything would be better if I liked you.

325
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,142
I don't know why my heart hurts more
the more I like you.

326
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,231
I keep relying on you

327
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,233
and expect more from you,

328
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,988
so I get even more upset
and have a harder time.

329
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,578
So…

330
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,876
I gave you a hard time
with words I didn't even mean.

331
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,759
I'm…

332
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,929
such a fool, right?

333
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,143
I think so too, really.

334
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,313
I'll do better.

335
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,150
I may be far from a perfect boyfriend,

336
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,570
but if that's okay with you,

337
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,780
you can rely on me a bit more.

338
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,576
I'll make sure

339
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,037
not to upset you

340
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,165
or give you a hard time. So please…

341
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,671
Let's not break up.

342
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,759
(soft music)

343
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,430
I'm sorry for saying this
in an uncool way,

344
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,309
but…

345
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,147
I love you.

346
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,318
Very much.

347
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,488
Very deeply.

00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,199
Hi, Seojung, it's me.

352
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,076
Nothing much.

353
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,206
The junior surgeons?

354
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,712
Well, they're skillful,
but they challenge me now and then.

355
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,506
(laughs)

356
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,051
What do you mean?
When have I ever challenged Master Kim?

357
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,015
By the way,

358
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,725
when are you coming?

359
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,186
I miss you.

Excuse me.

368
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,763
Someone's hurt.

369
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,390
KYUNGSOOK: Excuse me!

370
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,607
Excuse me. Is no one here?

371
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,902
Anybody here?

372
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,286
(yelling) Please help!

373
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,082
Is no one here?

374
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,461
KYUNGSOOK (yelling): Anybody?

375
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,881

376
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,842
-Ms. Ko?
-Are you okay?

377
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,261
What happened?

378
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,721
(exhales shudderingly)
Please help.

379
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,724

(tense music)

385
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,585
Nurse Euntak,
I'm in the Trauma Center's parking lot,

386
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,295
and there are two injured people.

387
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,547
I think you need to bring people
here right now, quickly!

388
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,935
(upbeat music)

VOLUME 16
DREAMERS

390
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,371
I didn't have a dream. I just had a goal

391
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,374
to become a doctor like my parents wanted.

392
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,254
However, I felt at a loss
after I became a resident.

393
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,799
It doesn't suit me. I don't know
if I should keep doing this or…

394
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,886
-(Seonung slurps)
-(sighs)

395
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,640
You're not listening to me, are you?

396
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,558
I was listening.

397
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,851
I'm eating with my mouth

398
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,062
and listening with my ears.

399
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,313
SEONUNG: So what?

400
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,815
Did you figure out the answer

401
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,567
to your concerns?

402
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,820
(slurps)

403
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,366
How long do you plan on staying
at Doldam Hospital, Dr. Ung?

404
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,910
Forever, as long as
they don't kick me out.

405
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,454
-Why?
-Well…

406
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,001
Because it's fun.

407
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,003
It's fun?

408
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:56,007
When you're here,
you keep wanting to do something

409
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,843
and have all kinds of dreams.

410
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,064
-EUNJAE: Master Kim.
-Hey.

411
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,276
What's going on?

412
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,612
Assemblywoman Ko had an accident

413
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,988
while inspecting the fire site.

414
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,283
EUNJAE: The aide and attendant
who went out with her were injured.

415
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,286
All of the ambulances are out
because of the fire,

416
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,996
so she brought the injured herself.

417
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,164
I see.

418
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,084
EUNJAE: Assemblywoman Ko seems
to only have light abrasions.

419
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,752
What about the other injured people?

420
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,839
Dr. Seo, Dr. Jung,
and Nurse Euntak went outside.

421
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,049
INSU: We have a patient!

422
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,343
(tense music)

423
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,184
(pants)

424
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,605
We'll take them to Trauma Bay.

425
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,607
Go, quickly. Now.

426
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,151
SABU: Hurry.

427
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,742
INSU: One, two, three!

428
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,161
WOOJIN: Carefully.

429
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,454
One, two, three!

430
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,706
WOOJIN: We'll remove the belt.

431
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,921
Can someone wipe the mud off?

432
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,048
Bring surgical pads, please.
I'll wipe it off.

433
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,807
Nurse Oh, call Dr. Nam Doil, please.

434
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,311
Dr. Nam should be on his way
to Seoul Hospital with Paramedic Heo.

435
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,188
Oh, right.

436
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,731
Professor Sim Hyejin is back.

437
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,232
Professor Sim Hyejin?

438
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,067
She should be at the shelter right now.

439
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,235
I'll try calling her.

440
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:43,573
Nurse Oh, Jungil Hospital is close by,
so please call Dr. Yang too.

441
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,908
Yes, Master Kim.

442
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,995
Let's get a CT for both patients
and check their conditions first.

443
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,538
-Master Kim.
-SABU: Yes?

444
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,999
-There's no staff left in the hospital.
-What?

445
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,375
The fire may be under control,

446
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,961
but the evacuation order won't be lifted
until tomorrow morning.

447
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,590
The OR, ER, and ICU staff
have all evacuated

448
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,510
with the patients.

449
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,636
(machine beeps frantically)

450
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,720
He's in cardiac arrest!

451
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,013
I'll go up.

452
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,685
Nurse Euntak, 1 mL of epinephrine, please.

453
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,146
I'll start intubation.

454
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,732
Nurse, call Nurse Oh

455
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,777
and ask how long it'll take
for the radiologist to get here.

456
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,861
Yes, Master Kim.

457
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,664
WOOJIN: I think it's the liver area,

458
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,624
but there's not a lot of bleeding.

459
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,044
I think there's blood above the diaphragm.

460
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,170
So hemothorax?

461
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,841
So we should put in tubes
until he's stable and pack him in the OR.

462
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,885
Let's do a foreign body removal first
and then ligation for the bleeders.

463
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,805
Dr. Jung, do a rhythm check.

464
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,973
Yes, Master Kim.

465
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,433
He's in asystole.

466
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,476
Let's switch.

467
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,359
-Master Kim.
-SABU: Yes?

468
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,863
Fortunately, the radiologist is
in the hospital and will be here soon.

469
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,531
Professor Sim Hyejin and Dr. Yang

470
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,200
will arrive in seven
and ten minutes, respectively.

471
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,910
You heard that, right?

472
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,330
Until then, let's keep these patients
alive no matter what. Okay?

473
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,291
-BOTH: Yes, Master Kim.
-BOTH: Yes, Master Kim.

474
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,295
-Nurse Oh, let's put in tubes first.
-MYEONGSIM: Okay.

475
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,422
(pants)

476
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,007
I'll do a rhythm check.

477
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,430
What kind of patients do we have?

478
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,266
They were seriously injured
by a falling tree

479
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,685
while trapped at the site of the fire.

480
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,692
Why didn't you page me
when we have two patients?

481
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,068
They just came in.

482
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,738
There's an evacuation order in place,
so we're the only staff

483
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,156
in the hospital right now.

484
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,950
They're also patients who meet
the appropriate trauma classification.

485
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,456
-What about the portable X-ray?
-It should be here soon.

486
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,876
-STAFF: The portable is here!
-Scan the foreign body patient first!

487
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,960
Let's switch!

488
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,216
How long has it been?

489
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,259
About 15 minutes.

490
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,555
-DONGJU: Did you give him epinephrine?
-INSU: Yes, we did.

491
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,516
STAFF: Scanning now.

492
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,022
All right. Rhythm check.

493
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,319
DONGJU: Asystole!

494
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,656
Ms. Ko, let's take you
to the Observation Area.

495
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,325
We have to treat your wounds

496
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,828
and run some tests to check
if you have any other injuries.

497
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,417
(hopeful music)

498
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,419

No.

510
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,601
Hurry up and take it off.

511
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:42,937
It's my turn.

512
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,523

Fortunately, the patient that went
into cardiac arrest was resuscitated,

530
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,013
so they're operating on
both patients in the ORs right now.

Oh, my.

535
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,902
have they been operating all night?

00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,737
Yes.

00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,306
It's not worn out yet,

543
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,310
so don't worry too much, Dr. Kang Dongju.

544
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,694
(Sabu grunts)

545
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,302
DONGJU: I guess you're right.

546
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,555
You're still quite nimble.

547
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,557
SABU: I told you.

548
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,852
Cut.

549
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,313
DONGJU: Cut.

550
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,441
SABU: All right.
I finished my part of the surgery.

551
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,236
DONGJU: Thank you for your hard work.

552
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,696
Master Kim.

553
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,076
If you

554
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,829
hadn't shown me this much,

555
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,040
I would have never known
this was possible.

556
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,209
SABU: You're wrong.

557
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,503
You would have known.

558
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,882
Because even from the beginning,
you were a capable person.

559
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,263
(light music)

560
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,058
(soft chuckle)

561
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,734
SABU: The moments that I thought
would never connect in my life

562
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,445
started to connect one by one.

563
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,253
WOOJIN: Suture.

564
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,851
SABU: The things
I thought would just pass by

565
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,480
are starting to become meaningful,
one by one.

566
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,689
All right.

567
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,775
SABU: Gosh, so heavy.

568
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,860
Hello, I'm a doctor named Master Kim.

569
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,571
There's an emergency patient
I need to operate on right now.

570
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,907
I really need you here, Ms. Oh Myeongsim.

571
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,825
SABU: Can you come?

572
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,995
I wish to perform
a combined surgery in the OR…

573
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,040
with you.

574
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,090
How many patients have you killed?

575
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,635
(pants)

576
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,011
(flatlines)

577
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,389
(pants)

578
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,934
SABU: Hey! Who are you?

579
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,561
INBUM: I'm Do Inbum, a general surgeon.

580
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,901
INSU: Coming here was already
a drastic change for me.

581
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,113
The crucible of chaos itself.
I don't want to keep enduring it.

582
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,864
-Hey, Dr. Geodae.
-Yes, Dr. Geodae here.

583
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,408
SABU: Dr. Jung Insu.

584
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:11,867
Yes, Master Kim?

585
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,160
From this point onward,

586
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,872
you're in charge of Doldam ER.

587
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,959
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

588
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,711
(inaudible)

589
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:28,884
WOOJIN: However,

590
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,178
I need money.

591
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,889
How much can you give me?

592
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,933
(laughs)

593
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,476
Are you trying to kill someone?

594
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,563
If you're going to be like that,
quit being a doctor!

595
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,571
SABU: And now,

596
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:52,867
that meaning is taking shape
and becoming tangible.

597
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,913
It's the moment when dreams come true.

598
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,249
(chuckles)

599
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,211
MYEONGSIM: And the moment
a dream comes true,

600
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,964
you'll encounter another reality

601
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,550
because life goes on, regardless.

602
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:15,222
SABU: At least people who have achieved
their dreams once know how to do so.

603
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,767
Somehow, they'll find a way
to get through reality again.

604
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,020
So…

605
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,982
what are you dreaming about now?

606
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,152
That's a secret.

607
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:29,987
Don't tell me

608
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:34,033
you're planning on making us
lose our minds again, are you?

609
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,201
(chuckles)

610
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,912
Maybe, maybe not.

611
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,374
It won't be fun
if I give you a spoiler in advance.

612
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,459
What?

613
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,044
Let's go.

614
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,879
(laughs)

615
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,315
KYUNGSOOK: Why aren't you saying anything?

616
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,530
Isn't this an opportunity for you?

617
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,616
KYUNGSOOK: "Why do you think
we need a Trauma Center?"

618
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,701
"How do you feel after experiencing it?"

619
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,830
Isn't this situation a great opportunity
for you to ask these questions?

620
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,292
I think you know

621
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,795
without me asking.

622
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,129
(scoffs)

623
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,677
Assemblywoman Ko.

624
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,264
What's the point of reconstruction

625
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,225
and building new cities

626
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,103
if there's no hospital to go to
when you're sick?

627
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,398
There's no pediatrician

628
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,692
to go to even when a child is sick

629
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,528
and ERs that can provide CPR
for cardiac arrest patients

630
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,363
are disappearing.

631
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,532
Forest fires aren't the only disasters.

632
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,953
Having no hospital to go to
in a life-threatening situation

633
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:06,083
and ending up dying in an ambulance
after wandering the streets for hours.

634
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,087
That's a disaster too, Ms. Ko.
Do you understand?

635
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,674
SABU: I know.

636
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,050
There are choices

637
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,513
that seem like losses.

638
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,349
When you think about

639
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,979
the many important, conflicting choices
you'll have to make in life

640
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:31,108
and what you'll base those decisions on,

641
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,737
many people will weigh the pros and cons

642
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:38,365
and choose the option
that won't end up in a loss.

643
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:44,246
If you feel ashamed in your mind,
you shouldn't ignore it.

644
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,085
Even if it's a tough and foolish decision,

645
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,881
you should make it unashamed
and with confidence.

646
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,844
What kind of hope can exist in a country

647
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,432
where schools collapse
and hospitals disappear?

648
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,607
What happened to your son

649
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,776
is heartbreaking,

650
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:19,615
but don't turn a blind eye
to what you have to do

651
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,283
using his death as an excuse.

652
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,621
Don't be political, do politics.

653
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,582
Properly and honestly.

654
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,469
(pensive music)

655
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,601
(Kyungsook exhales deeply)

656
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,359
NURSE 7: Hello, Master Kim.

657
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,443
-Hello.
-NURSE 8: Hello.

658
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,611
-Hello.
-Hello, Master Kim.

659
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,946
-Hello.
-Hello.

660
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,739
-Oh, Mr. Koo.
-Yes.

661
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,033
-No one caused any trouble, right?
-No.

662
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,284
HYEONJEONG: Master Kim!

663
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,620
-Hi, Nurse Eom.
-Thank you for your hard work.

664
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,789
-You must have worked hard all night.
-Thank you.

665
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,916
-You're welcome.
-GITAE: Master Kim.

666
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,000
Oh, Chief Jang.

667
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,086
-Did the surgery go well?
-Yes, of course.

668
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,588
What happened to the evacuation order?

669
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:20,050
It was already lifted 30 minutes ago,
so everyone is returning now.

670
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,385
(laughs)

671
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,429
-DOIL: Hello, everyone!
-Hey, Doil.

672
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,889
You're already at work, Master Kim?

673
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,891
He spent all night operating.

674
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,560
My gosh.

675
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,479
-I'm not even surprised.
-(chuckles)

676
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,148
What about Paramedic Heo?

677
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,816
I safely escorted him

678
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,944
and came back in the same ambulance.

679
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:39,903
I see.

680
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,282
Now that Professor Sim is back,
I'll put down my things and…

681
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,243
Oh, right.
I need to reorganize Come and Go.

682
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,078
You're opening Come and Go again?

683
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,832
Come on. I may not seem so,
but I have a lot of regulars.

684
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,419
Even Dr. Yoon Seojung approved
of our rice cake instant noodles.

685
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,087
(chuckles)

686
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,047
Oh, you're all here.

687
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,341
My gosh, I guess the surgery is over now.

688
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,718
GITAE: Thank you for your hard work,
Nurse Oh.

689
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,261
Thank you for your hard work.

690
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,180
You said you couldn't do
two surgeries in a row,

691
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,598
but you worked hard all night.

692
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,601
Isn't it a regular occurrence?

693
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,102
Gosh, I'm so tired.

694
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:16,607
Would you all like some coffee I made
in the lounge from the finest coffee beans

695
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,275
to relieve some fatigue?

696
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,027
I quit drinking coffee.

697
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,946
I prepared some yuja tea
from Jeju Island as well, Nurse Oh.

698
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,116
I'll take a cup of that then.

699
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,744
-(in English) Hot or with ice?
-(laughs)

700
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,455
I guess you're still taking
those English lessons.

701
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,624
(in Korean)
I pay close attention to vocabulary.

702
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,418
-(laughs)
-(all laugh)

703
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,920
Would you like some too, Master Kim?

704
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,339
Sounds good. Let's do that.

705
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:44,718
It's been a while since the last time
the hospital wasn't so busy…

706
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,806
(suspenseful music)

707
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,728
-Master Kim.
-Yes?

708
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,147
MYEONGSIM: Why are you being like this,
this early in the morning?

709
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,442
I came out of an operation just now.

710
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,987
(groans)

711
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,074
There's no such thing
as a jinx or whatever.

712
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,285
All of that is just a coincidence,
a superstition.

713
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,789
There's no such thing in the world--

714
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:14,957
(phone rings)

715
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,376
-(snorts)
-(phone continues ringing)

716
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,546
(phone continues ringing)

717
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,267
Yes, this is Doldam ER.

718
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,816
Yes.
(chuckles)

719
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,067
I see.

720
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,654
Yes, I understand.

721
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,496
(Sabu sighs)

722
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,582
So we have
a traffic accident patient coming.

723
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,250

-(groans)

725
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,045
(groans)
Master Kim!

726
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,714
Well,

727
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,843
they say it isn't a big injury,
just a minor one.

728
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,052
(chuckles)

729
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,679
Nurse Eom.

730
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,806
Please page Dr. Yoon Areum, quickly.

731
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:17,895
Also, quickly page our fellow
Dr. Lee Seonung and Dr. Jang Donghwa too.

732
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,021
Yes, Master Kim.

733
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,524
I'll go get changed first.

734
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,444
Let me know if you need to operate.

735
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,362
Oh, yes.

736
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,489
I suppose

737
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,826
people aren't the only things you pull in
with your gravity.

738
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,244
Right?

739
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,872
(laughs)

00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:57,476
-GITAE: Thank you.
-POSTMAN: Have a nice day.

742
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:02,981
Chief Jang.

743
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,317
Is my package here?

744
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,652
Let's see.

745
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,657
Oh, it's here.

746
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,367
Thank you.

747
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,253
(sighs)

748
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,965
(solemn music)

749
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,728
I guess you haven't been contacted yet?

750
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,522
Yes, well,

751
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,108
budget reviews usually take a while.

752
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,526
I'm sure it'll go well.

753
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,112
Don't worry too much.

754
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,948
Everything is based on results.

755
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,283
My efforts won't be in vain

756
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,203
as long as the budget review goes through.

757
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,915
Well, it's not always like that.

758
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,501
MYEONGSIM: Regardless of the results,

759
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,503
we'll keep moving forward.

760
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,631
That's how we've always been.

761
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,175
Are you comforting me in advance?

762
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,887
I'm saying thank you
for everything you've done.

763
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,352
Thank you for your hard work,
Director Park Minguk.

764
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,062
Thank you, I suppose.

765
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,193

766
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,248

769
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,106
(in English) Okay.

770
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,671
-What are you doing?
-I'm clearing the desk.

771
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:38,053
Oh, Dr. Jang's clinical rotation
ends this week.

772
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,680
It's already been that long?

773
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,807
Yes.

774
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,100
I see.

775
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,768
Speaking of which,

776
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,605
we're hosting a farewell party
for Dr. Jang Donghwa this Saturday,

777
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,065
May 6th.

778
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,775
SEONUNG: You're free, right?

779
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,527
What's the date again?

780
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,529
SEONUNG: May 6th.

781
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:59,783
Dr. Jung, Dr. Ortho,
Dr. Yang, Dr. Areum, Nurse Euntak,

782
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,660
Nurse Eom, and Nurse Joo

783
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,912
are joining us at Come and Go that day.

784
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,873
(quirky music)

785
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,128
It's okay.
You don't have to come if you're busy.

786
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:15,173
Come on. Dr. Seo is your senior.
Of course he'll be coming.

787
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:18,885
(clears throat)

788
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,054
You're coming, right?

789
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,767
-EUNJAE: No, I can't go.
-(sighs)

790
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,978
What should I do?
(groans)

791
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,564
I have an important appointment that day.

792
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,816
I see.
(sucks teeth)

793
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,861
That's too bad.
All of the other doctors are coming.

794
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,864
Dr. Seo Woojin said he would come too.

795
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,616
What? Seo Woojin?

796
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,077
Seo Woojin said he would go?

797
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,914
Yes, he's Dr. Jang's senior
so of course he has to go.

798
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:49,916
Oh.

799
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,170
I see.
(soft exclaim)

800
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,880
Okay.

801
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,262
(knocking)

802
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,597
Come in.

803
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:09,978
What brings you here?

804
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,022
I'm here to say farewell.

805
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,524
My rotation ends this week.

806
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,401
Yes, I heard.

807
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:19,946
Take a seat for a second.

808
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,165

811

is nice.

812
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,693
You know this song?

813
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,570
It's an old song.

814
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,281
Yes, I've heard it before
because of my older sister.

815
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,910
(sucks teeth)
She's a lot older than me.

816
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:07,953

Open it.

SABU: I was

826
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,331
originally going to give that
to your older sister.

827
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,836
Oh…

828
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,966
How long have you known?

829
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,261
I actually didn't know

830
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:10,265
until Dr. Nam Doil told me.

831
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,267
SABU: That's why

832
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,060
it looked

833
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,354
so familiar.

834
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,024

In truth, I became a doctor

838
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,159
to fulfill my sister's dream.

839
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,746
After she died,

840
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,417
my parents had a really hard time.

841
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,505
So I told them I would
become a doctor in her stead.

842
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,966
-(soft chuckle)
-DONGHWA: After they heard that,

843
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,928
they laughed
for the first time in a while.

844
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,973
(both laugh softly)

845
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,601
However,

846
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,979
I'm still not sure

847
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,483
if I am truly living my life,

848
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,487
or if I'm just living my sister's life.

849
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,322
So…

850
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,742
you're going to quit being a doctor?

851
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:12,994
No,

852
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:16,581
I can't do that
because I studied so hard for this.

853
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,708
Then what?

854
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,876
DONGHWA: I just

855
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,213
don't have the courage
to live a life as you have.

856
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,216
That's fine.

857
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,302
There's no need
to live as someone else has.

858
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:33,056
You just need to live your own life.

859
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,517
(soft music)

860
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,648
Yes, your era

861
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,818
is definitely different
from the one I've lived in.

862
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,780
It isn't an era where you get rewarded
for all your efforts.

863
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,867
The competition is incredibly intense

864
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:57,205
and the path you need to take
keeps getting narrower.

865
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,543
However, Dr. Jang Donghwa,

866
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,462
you won't find
the answer you're looking for

867
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,506
anywhere in this world.

868
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,884
So don't look for an answer.

869
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,679
Look for something you want to do, okay?

870
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:18,476
Find something you can do happily
because you really like doing it.

871
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,687
That will be

872
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,690
your answer.

873
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,325
(clears throat)
Here.

874
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,495
The list of people
attending the farewell party for Dr. Jang.

875
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,373
All of them are attending,

876
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,791
including Dr. Cha Eunjae.

877
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,043
ALL: Ooh!

878
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,671
-(door opens)
-Including Dr. Cha Eunjae?

879
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,340
Of course I should go.

880
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,759
After all his hard work,

881
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,761
I can't just let him go
without a proper farewell.

882
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,017
By the way,

883
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,603
when are you two
having a housewarming party?

884
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,063
(quirky music)

885
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,857
AREUM: Excuse me.

886
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,358
Nurse Joo?

887
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,943
Oh, right!

888
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:12,363
You two moved recently.
You should have a housewarming party.

889
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,202
Nurse Eom.

890
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,745
Why don't we do both on that day?

891
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,081
It isn't easy for us
to get together like that.

892
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,126
We should have the housewarming party

893
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,670
and Dr. Jang's farewell party
on the same day.

894
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,591
(exclaims)
I approve!

895
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:32,884
Me too.

896
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,136
(laughs awkwardly)

897
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,471
One moment, please.

898
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,765
Can I have a word with you?

899
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,646
(laughs)
It's going to be fun.

900
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:51,569
AREUM: How could you just say that
out loud?

901
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,906
Why? I thought you said
they moved together?

902
00:58:55,657 --> 00:59:00,954
(gasps)
Wait, was that supposed to be a secret?

903
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,748
I didn't hear it
from them directly either.

904
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,251
I happened to figure it out
and mentioned it,

905
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,921
but if you publicly announce it like that…

906
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,048
Oh, so it was like that.

907
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,841
Oh, no.

908
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,176
Wait.

909
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,512
Dr. Seo and Dr. Cha

910
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,722
are dating?

911
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,434
(groans, sighs)

912
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,271
(laughs)

913
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,605
What?

914
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,483
I see…

915
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,489
-Was it you?
-No, it wasn't.

916
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:37,907
Maybe you got caught.

917
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,118
No, it wasn't me this time.

918
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,370
STAFF LOUNGE

919
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,665
Why did you suddenly say
you were going to the farewell party?

920
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,917
I can't miss out on
Jang Donghwa's farewell.

921
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,253
I heard you were going too!

922
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,838
I was just going to show up for a bit.

923
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,090
As if that would work.

924
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,217
Once you start drinking,
you'll get excited

925
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,052
and there will be second and third rounds.

926
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,346
I don't want to sit pitifully
at home alone among candles.

927
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,518
-Were you disappointed?
-(sighs)

928
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:07,478
Sure.

929
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:10,273
Jang Donghwa worked hard,

930
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,485
and it's natural for you to attend
the farewell party as his senior.

931
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,696
That's the right thing to do, but…

932
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,740
Should I not go then?

933
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,703
(playful music)

934
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:25,413
You startled me!

935
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,417
(chuckles)
You two were here.

936
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,838
Right. I heard Dr. Jang's farewell party
is this Saturday.

937
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:35,757
You two are coming, right?

938
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,508
-No--
-EUNJAE: Yes, we're going.

939
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,595
We have to go since we're his seniors.

940
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,515
But when are you two
having a housewarming party?

941
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,062
Tell me if you need anything
for a housewarming gift.

942
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,022
It's more practical
to buy something you'll need

943
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,774
than to pick something useless.

944
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,275
Bye then.

945
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,944
It can be something expensive!

946
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,201
What's going on?

947
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,205
Does everyone in the hospital know
we moved in together?

948
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,333
Should we just do it?

949
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,251
The housewarming party.

950
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,634
AREUM: What kind of house do you want
to live in later on, Euntak?

951
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,513
Would you like your own house,
an apartment, or live in a villa?

952
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,515
What about you, Areum?

953
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,100
Even if it's small,

954
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,603
I'd like someplace with a yard
so I can raise a dog.

955
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,814
I want to have many houseplants too.

956
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:36,776
Why?

957
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:39,612
If there's a yard,

958
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:42,156
it'll be harder to manage than you think.

959
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,533
I mean…

960
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,035
When I have a child later,

961
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:49,163
I thought it would be nice
to raise a dog as well

962
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,082
so they can run around together.

963
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,335
Oh.

964
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,338
What I mean is…

965
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,967
I'm not trying to pressure you in any way.

966
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,051
I'd like a house

967
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,054
with a yard too.

968
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,851
-What?
-A child

969
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:12,854
and a dog…

970
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,567
(cheeful music)

971
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,985
…will be nice too.

972
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,201
Should we

973
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,537
order some cheese balls too?

974
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,749
-Oh.
-We ordered a lot of chicken, so…

975
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,041
I'll make the order.

976
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,596
AREUM (squealing): What do I do?

977
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,600
-Pop! Pop!
-(laughter)

978
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,978
-Wow.
-The house is so cozy and pretty!

979
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:56,063
It's perfect
for two people to live together!

980
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,815
YEONGMI: By the way,

981
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,485
you two don't seem to clean up
as much as I thought you would.

982
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,987
But I did clean up a bit.

983
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,865
People are all the same.
Have a drink, Nurse Joo.

984
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,242
Okay, thank you.

985
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,452
Dr. Jang Donghwa.

986
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,497
Thanks for all your hard work

987
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:14,290
and you've done well.

988
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:17,084
MUNJEONG: You're coming back to Doldam
after you pass the board, right?

989
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,586
About that--

990
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,837
Of course.

991
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,048
He must come back.
It wouldn't be right if he didn't.

992
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:25,092
I'm telling you, Dr. Lee knows what's up.

993
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,678
MUNJEONG: I've known that
ever since Elizabeth started liking him.

994
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,847
SEONUNG: I, Lee Seonung,
the man chosen by Elizabeth

995
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,474
will have a drink.

996
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,184
Have a drink, Dr. Lee.

997
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,769
-Please pour me one.
-AREUM: We're here!

998
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:35,853
Hey, come in!

999
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,688
-Take a seat.
-The fried chicken is here too!

1000
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,190
-Yes!
-Welcome!

1001
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,942
-All right.
-Fried chicken!

1002
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,987
-Sorry I'm late!
-Hey, what took you so long?

1003
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,113
I had a patient.

1004
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:47,824
-INSU: Hurry up and sit down.
-Okay.

1005
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,909
-Fried chicken?
-Yes, sit down.

1006
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,666
(indistinct chattering)

1007
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,251
(laughs)

1008
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,129
(exclaiming)

1009
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,464
Have a drink.

1010
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,132
-INSU: Drink up.
-Thank you!

1011
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,054
DONGHWA: Honestly,

1012
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,682
I'm still not sure

1013
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:18,229
if I can do this job,

1014
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,358
if I want to keep doing this job,

1015
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,318
or if I want to stop doing it.

1016
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,988
-Excuse me, Dr. Seo?
-Yes?

1017
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,699
Why did you become a doctor?

1018
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:30,825
To make a living.

1019
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,287
Isn't it hard?

1020
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,455
Is there a non-hard way to live?

1021
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,459
I've never seen anyone live an easy life.

1022
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:44,505
Why Doldam Hospital though?

1023
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,509
Because the people I like are here,

1024
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,804
and I can do what I do well here.

1025
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,389
That's enough for me.

1026
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:55,516
Is that all?

1027
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,060
I'm with people I love.

1028
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,146
What more could I ask for?

1029
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,275
SABU: Jang Donghwa.

1030
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:08,613
There is no such thing
as a choice you're forced to make.

1031
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,948
You make a choice,

1032
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,326
because you're that kind of person.

1033
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,331
DONGHWA: Speaking of which,

1034
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,208
I actually

1035
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,503
decided to do another round of rotation.

1036
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:30,384
At Doldam Hospital.

1037
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,220
I'm staying for another four months.

1038
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,680
-What?
-What?

1039
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,683
Then what are we doing here today?

1040
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,393
It's not a farewell party?

1041
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,729
MUNJEONG: In that case…

1042
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:43,648
It's a welcoming party!

1043
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:44,982
-A welcoming party!
-Hey!

1044
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,692
No, that's not right.

1045
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:47,985
It's just a housewarming party.

1046
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,362
-Right.
-No.

1047
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,947
It's Dr. Jang's welcoming party.

1048
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,490
Come on, it's a housewarming party.

1049
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,327
Can't we just do both?

1050
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,121
-Yes, exactly!
-Yes!

1051
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,290
Congratulations.

1052
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,917
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

1053
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,293
Congratulations.

1054
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,170
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1055
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:08,297
DONGHWA: I've decided

1056
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,884
to stay with these people a little longer.

1057
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:16,138
I want to figure out
what I'm able to do too.

1058
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,098
(phone vibrates)

1059
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:18,599
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1060
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,644
Hold on. I'll be right back.

1061
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,354
-Where are you going?
-What?

1062
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,106
-HOJUN: Dr. Jung!
-Where is he going?

1063
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,108
Anyway, congratulations!

1064
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:29,360
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1065
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:35,116
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1066
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:45,042
(wind howling)

1067
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,672
(whimsical music)

1068
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,303
Byeol.

1069
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:57,722
Dad.

1070
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:01,976
What is this?

1071
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,228
What's going on?

1072
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,105
I came down with Mom.

1073
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:10,401
We're coming down

01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:47,938
For being the first…

1084
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,069
to ask if we'd come down.

is this?

1107

It's a ring.

1108
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,919
Exactly. What kind of ring is this?

1109
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,379

MINGUK: The provincial government

1119
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,435
will provide funding

1120
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:56,812
for our Doldam Trauma Center.

1121
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,398
We achieved the grant, Master Kim.

Congratulations, Director.
Congratulations, Master Kim!

Good job, Director Park and Chief Jang.

1124
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:11,076
This is all thanks to you
running around for the past three years.

1125
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,536
You did a great job.

1126
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,623
We did it, all of us!

1127

Hello.

01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,017
Pardon my intrusion.

1135
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,273
The results of the Trauma Center's trial

1136
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,026
are quite miserable.

1137
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,779
So many things
need to be revised and corrected.

1138
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,741
I think getting the provincial budget
is the least of your worries now.

1139
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:54,161
Right. We're still in the middle
of conducting simulations.

1140
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:58,248
As per my observation over these few days,
many things need to be rectified.

1141
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,502
Shall we start with you accepting
non-trauma patients?

1142
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,963
CHIEF CHOI: I can't not talk about
what happened during the last inspection.

1143
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,633
You're lucky that I was there.

1144
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,219
You see, if it is found difficult

1145
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:12,679
to operate facilities and equipment
exclusively for trauma use

1146
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,640
during disasters or serious situations

1147
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:17,309
following a natural disaster,

1148
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,270
you'll need approval
from the Minister of Health and Welfare

1149
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,438
to use it again.

1150
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:27,653
So are you ready to make a choice?

1151
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:29,446
I want to ask you something first.

1152
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,034
What's your vision

1153
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:35,869
for the Trauma Center?

1154
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:40,332
(in English) Level One.

1155
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,003
(in Korean) From Gangwon-do to
Chungcheongbuk-do and Gyeongsangbuk-do,

1156
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:48,549
I want all severe trauma patients within
an hour's distance by air ambulance

1157
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:49,716
to be received here.

1158
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,677
Everything, even pediatric trauma.

1159
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:58,350
I want to make sure no one dies
due to a lack of available doctors.

1160
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:01,145
DONGHWA: I want to make sure
no one wanders the streets

1161
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,272
because there's no hospital to admit them.

1162
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:06,400
I want us to be able
to take care of all severe trauma cases

1163
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,610
within our area.

1164
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:12,948
In order to do that,

1165
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,619
we need a surgeon as good as you.

1166
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:21,165
How about it?

1167
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:24,960
Don't you want to reach Level One with me?

1168
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,968
My left hand
hasn't completely recovered yet.

1169
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,679
I'll need to continue physical therapy.

1170
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:40,184
You still have your skillful right hand.

Good.

That's how revenge works.

there's been a five-vehicle crash.
