DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,962
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,805
(classical music)

5
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,824
EUNJAE: How old was I when it happened?

6
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,618
EUNJAE'S MOM: Look over here.

7
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,328
EUNJAE: I had woken up to the sound

8
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,038
of my dad coming home
from work late at night.

9
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,332
Suddenly, he took my hand
and started dancing with me.

10
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,710
It seemed like he had been drinking,

11
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,838
but my dad looked so happy then.

12
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:33,093
It was the day he successfully performed
an open heart surgery for the first time.

13
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,181
As a child,

14
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,976
I believed my dad was the most confident,
cool, and respectable adult

15
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,978
in the whole world.

16
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:52,779
However,

17
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,990
the dad I saw as a grown-up…

18
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,408
(woman breathes heavily)

19
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,745
Yes, give up.

20
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,832
From what I can see,
there is no hope for this patient.

21
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,292
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN!
GIVE ME AN ANSWER FOR MY SON'S DEATH!

22
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,336
NURSE 1: I heard he drove
his student to his death.

23
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,712
Is that true?

24
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,091
Yes, he put all the blame
for a patient's death on the student.

25
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,634
NURSE 2: It's no joke.

26
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,679
I heard he was practically
kicked out of Hankuk University.

27
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,598
-Hello.
-Hello.

28
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,975
(both laugh awkwardly)

29
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,227
NURSE 2: For two years in a row,

30
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,396
there were no applicants
for cardiothoracic surgery,

31
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,273
because no one wanted
to work under Professor Cha.

32
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,276
EUNJAE: Did my dad change?

33
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:33,945
Or…

34
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,448
did I become
a different adult compared to my dad?

35
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,035
I swear it wasn't me!

36
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,453
It wasn't me!

37
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,372
Then how do you know in such detail

38
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,040
about the Hankuk University
resident's suicide?

39
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,377
And how did you know
that Dr. Lee was a colleague

40
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,712
of that resident?

41
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,338
That's because Director Park told me to…

42
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,553
That's not what I meant.

43
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,513
It wasn't Director Park. It was me.

44
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,183
I dug a little
because of my personal curiosity.

45
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,394
What are you scheming right now?

46
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,312
Hey.

47
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,771
What do you mean by scheming?

48
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,814
That's a little harsh.

49
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,357
It's not like that--

50
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,109
Then explain it in a way I can understand.

51
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,570
-(sighs)
-(thuds)

52
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,155
Just know that all of this

53
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,909
is for the sake
of the Trauma Center, okay?

54
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,036
It wasn't me.

55
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,331
I wasn't the one
who went into Professor Cha's room, okay?

56
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,129
(door closes)

57
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,383
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

58
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,887
SABU: Director Park.

59
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,722
What did you do just now?

60
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,641
I did as you said, Master Kim.

61
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,228
You said a leader is someone
who must fight the big waves upfront.

62
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,942
Don't tell me

63
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,488
you're thinking about accepting
Assemblywoman Ko Kyungsook's terms?

64
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,074
I chose the practical route.

65
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,409
I can't put the Trauma Center in a crisis

66
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,079
just to protect Professor Cha Jinman.

67
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,792
It sounds like a humiliating compromise

68
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,253
-rather than a practical route.
-(snorts)

69
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,923
I did what I had to
as the director of Doldam Hospital.

70
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,551
No matter how valid the purpose is,

71
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,681
if the way to achieve it isn't just,
it's not right, Director Park.

72
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,642
This isn't about
what's right or wrong, Master Kim.

73
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,312
It's a matter of cost-effectiveness
and competence

74
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,730
as the head of the Trauma Center.

75
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,946
I've come up with a list of doctors
to join the Trauma Center.

76
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,114
MINGUK: Ah, yes.

77
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,993
A few of them have given me
positive responses.

78
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,412
I answered that out of courtesy.

79
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,247
He really believed that.

80
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,623
What should I have done then?

81
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,542
He was my department advisor.

82
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,460
I couldn't say no to his face.

83
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,588
That's why I politely declined
by saying I'd think about it.

84
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,718
Or you could convince me
with a higher annual salary.

85
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,762
Honestly, the amount
you're offering is not enough.

86
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,181
Nowadays,
local hospitals offer different salaries.

87
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,644
None of them said yes?

88
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,480
No, no one on that list

89
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,567
said they would come down here with you.

90
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,823
SABU: We didn't expect

91
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,035
anything like that
from Professor Cha in the first place.

92
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,580
He should have
at least shown his potential as a leader.

93
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,789
But look what happened.

94
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,666
He is the head of the Trauma Center,

95
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,377
but he wasn't here
during the building collapse incident.

96
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,297
He couldn't give a sincere apology
to Assemblywoman Ko

97
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,299
and created an even bigger situation.

98
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,886
In the last two months, he was nowhere
near implementing a working trauma system.

99
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,555
Rather, he encouraged disruption
and put forward his own authority.

100
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,560
Honestly, there's no reason
to cover for Professor Cha anymore.

101
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,647
So you're going to kick Cha Jinman out

102
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,025
and accept Assemblywoman Ko's deal?

103
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,193
Master Kim,

104
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,697
I think we should make a decision
before we end up losing more.

105
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,118
Sure, if someone doesn't have the skills
or is incompetent,

106
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,329
you can fire them all you want.

107
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,830
However,

108
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,708
political deals shouldn't be involved

109
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,377
in that decision.

110
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:23,132
Personally, I think
it's killing two birds with one stone.

111
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,342
Director Park.

112
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,219
Do you really think

113
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,347
Assemblywoman Ko is doing this
just because of a personal grudge?

114
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,808
You think she would put
that huge budget on the line

115
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,769
just to get Cha Jinman fired?

116
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,523
Is that really what you think?

117
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,316
If not, what other reason is there?

118
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,197
(sighs)

119
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,865
(phone vibrates)

120
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,034
ASSEMBLYMAN YOO

121
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,079
KYUNGSOOK: Yes, this is Ko Kyungsook.

122
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,749
You don't have to worry too much.

123
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,961
The head of the Trauma Center
will be stepping down soon.

124
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,588
It'll only be a matter of time

125
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,799
before the leaderless Trauma Center
shuts down.

126
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,887
The calls for budgeting will stop too.

127
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,932
You may begin

128
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,853
with the eco-city contractor selection
as planned.

129
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,938
KYUNGSOOK: Yes.

130
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,189
KOREA, A JUST COUNTRY

131
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,357
KYUNGSOOK: Let's do that.

132
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,919

VOLUME 12
THE COURAGE TO BE ORDINARY

DOLDAM HOSPITAL

EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

136
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,479
AREUM: Oh, Mr. Koo.

137
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,563
What about the elderly lady?

138
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,815
MR. KOO: I don't believe
she went to the Trauma Center.

139
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,066
No one has seen her there.

140
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,695
I've checked the CCTVs.

141
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,947
GITAE: I only saw her leaving the ER,

142
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,158
but her whereabouts
after that are unknown.

143
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,618
I didn't see her on the screens.

144
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,830
Nurse Eom,
did you get in touch with the guardians?

145
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,749
I just talked
to the elderly lady's daughter,

146
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,125
but she lives in Seoul.

147
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,669
She said she won't be able to come
until tomorrow afternoon,

148
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,796
because she has a son
who's a senior in high school.

149
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,007
(sighs)
Darn, what should we do?

150
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,134
Why? Is there a problem?

151
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,346
These are
the elderly lady's chest CT results.

152
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,182
AREUM: Her aortic aneurysm is
completely swollen.

153
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,850
Is she in serious danger?

154
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,352
It's a time bomb.

155
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,063
We don't know when it'll burst.

156
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,357
(tense music)

157
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,444
We haven't heard
from Nurse Euntak yet, right?

158
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,540
What?

159
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,169
(whimsical music)

160
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,553
Hey!

161
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,887
JUNGGEUM: Who are you?

162
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,106
My goodness, you're so pretty.
(giggles)

163
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,524
(thuds, rattles)

164
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,206
Your hands are pretty too.

165
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,129
They look like you've never had
to work a day in your life.

166
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,635
DONGHWA: Are you coming in just now?

167
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,345
Yes, are you going somewhere?

168
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,264
(exhales)
I'm looking for the elderly patient.

169
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,850
By the way, Dr. Seo,

170
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,519
someone came and dropped off
your belongings not too long ago.

171
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,187
DONGHWA: I asked them who they were,

172
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,897
but they left without saying anything.

173
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,115
(phone vibrates)

174
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:17,908
Hello?

175
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,119
It's me, Dr. Seo.

176
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,413
(soft tense music)

177
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,789
Yes.

178
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,543
(approaching footsteps)

179
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,420
DONGHWA: Does this even work?

180
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,506
Darn it.

181
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,259
DONGHWA: Hello.

182
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,552
Are you going somewhere?

183
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,805
An elderly patient is missing,
so I'm looking for her.

184
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,267
She has dementia,
but her CT results seem to be pretty bad.

185
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,019
I see. Good luck.

186
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,687
By the way,

187
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,607
is Dr. Seo Woojin
still in the medical office?

188
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,942
Oh, he just left.

189
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,364
But I think he got kicked out
of the boarding house.

190
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:57,865
What do you mean?

191
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,744
Someone just left
after coming by the medical office

192
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,538
to drop off
Dr. Seo's clothes and belongings.

193
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,793
(inhales)
It can't be because he couldn't pay rent.

194
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,753
Maybe he fought
with the boarding house's owner.

195
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,054
EUNJAE: Jeez.

196
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,516
(huffs, sighs)

197
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,188

198
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,524

199

200
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,083
I'm sorry I'm late.

201
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,459
Sit down.

202
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,464
(phone vibrates)

203
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,176
MY DAUGHTER

204
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,845
(phone continues vibrating)

205
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,682
-OPERATOR: The person you're calling…
-(sighs)

206
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,892
(Eunjae sighs)

207
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,398
Did you receive all your belongings?

208
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,524
Yes.

209
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,568
I saw them before I came here.

210
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,819
To be honest,

211
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,780
I'm very disappointed, Dr. Seo.

212
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,699
Did my daughter look that easy to you?

213
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,202
Living together…

214
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,456
How could you make
such a reckless decision?

215
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,583
I apologize
for not letting you know beforehand.

216
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,878
However,

217
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,548
I didn't think we needed permission
for making such a decision.

218
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,634
Eunjae and I

219
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,053
are adults well over the age of 30,

220
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,348
and we discussed it countless times

221
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,517
before making this big decision.

222
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,560
Dr. Seo.

223
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,395
I wanted to be with her
because I like her.

224
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,733
I made that decision because I wanted us

225
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,903
to have a stronger relationship.

226
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,157
It goes to show
that you grew up without parents.

227
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,745
If I'm being honest,

228
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,622
I'm not too sure about you.

229
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,415
I'm letting things slide

230
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,543
because Eunjae likes you
and Professor Cha complimented you,

231
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,839
but something about you makes me hesitant

232
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,549
and reluctant.

233
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:26,222
EUNJAE'S MOM: I can't imagine
what it's like to live without a family.

234
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,724
In truth, how your parents passed away

235
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,521
really bothers me.

236
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,942
EUNJAE'S MOM: You shouldn't take
making a family

237
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,027
and being the head of a family lightly.

238
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,697
It doesn't always shine beautifully
like a rainbow.

239
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,785
You can hurt them more easily
because they're family,

240
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,330
and there are times it hurts more
because they're family.

241
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,082
EUNJAE'S MOM: Sometimes,

242
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,085
you have to endure the cruelest,

243
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,505
most painful times together.

244
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,465
That's why I wanted

245
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:06,136
someone who grew up with plenty of love
from his family to be Eunjae's partner.

246
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,808
Only people
who have received love can give love.

247
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,397
You may be a good doctor,

248
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,734
but being good to a family
is another matter.

249
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,071
Do you understand

250
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,366
what I'm saying?

251
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,745
Yes.

252
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,665
I'm glad you understand.

253
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,086
I expect you to be the one
to take care of this problem, Dr. Seo.

254
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:43,090
Please ensure
that Eunjae doesn't make a fuss again.

255
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,481
(phone vibrates)

256
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,734
CHA EUNJAE

257
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,820

258
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,407
-OPERATOR: The person you're calling--
-Gosh, answer the phone!

259
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,825

Mom.

261
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,997
Did Seo Woojin tell you already?

262
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,791
Are you with him right now?

263
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,834
(sighs)

264
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,295
I just finished talking to him.

265
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,881
You two living together
never happened, okay?

266
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:24,924
Mom!

267
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,594
EUNJAE'S MOM: Get that in your head
and stop talking about it.

268
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,387
Don't you dare say another word.

269
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,056
I really will get angry.

270
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,349
(sighs)

(groans loudly)

272
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,068
Did something urgent happen?

273
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,277
Yes, a little.

274
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,946
It should take about two hours.

275
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,572
I told Insu, so--

276
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,907
No worries. I'll see you later.

277
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,661
I'll take up your next shift
and the one after that.

278
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,954
No, there's no need.

279
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,872
Just go and take care of
everything you need to.

280
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,630
I heard

281
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,883
what you went through at the university
because of Professor Cha.

282
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,553
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,389
I'll apologize in his stead.

284
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,349
No, you don't need to do that.

285
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,102
SEONUNG: It has nothing to do with you.

286
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,353
I know

287
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,731
how to distinguish the two.

288
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,941
Still,

289
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,986
my father shouldn't have done that to you.

290
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,197
What you went through

291
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,158
never should have happened,
no matter what.

292
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,872
Call me as soon as a patient
comes in for an operation.

293
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,375
I'll only be five minutes
away by car, okay?

294
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:42,876
Yes, Doctor.

295
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,378
Thank you, Dr. Lee.

296
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,694
(exhales shakily)

297
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,160
(door closes)

298
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,461
(sighs)

299
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,965
JINMAN: Is this why you called me here?

300
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,343
To make me look like a fool?

301
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,470
Is it fun?

302
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,764
Just because I don't like you

303
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,932
doesn't mean I don't respect you.

304
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,977
As a doctor, you're still admirable.

305
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,815
Which is why I was sorry to hear
that you were leaving the field.

306
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,319
Did you run a background check on me?

307
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,697
We can't be lenient about personnel issues

308
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,699
concerning the head of the Trauma Center.

309
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,827
(clicks tongue, sighs)

310
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,829
How much of this

311
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,248
did you plot out?

312
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,460
Were Lee Seonung, the Trauma Center,
and Assemblywoman Ko Kyungsook

313
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,545
all a part of your scenario?

314
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,047
The scenario I came up with

315
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,967
involved you adapting well
as the head of the Trauma Center.

316
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,763
From what I recall about you,

317
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,642
you could do anything
once you put your mind to it.

318
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,561
You said I was your Plan B,

319
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,107
but I didn't know
you expected that much from me.

320
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,233
Yes.

321
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,693
If I'm being honest,

322
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,364
deep down I was rooting for you.

323
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,909
I wanted you to find your own solution,

324
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,495
one that was different from mine.

325
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,706
I honestly believed
it could happen until some point.

326
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,624
However!

327
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,127
However,

328
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,590
you're still risking your life
for futile and worthless things.

329
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,385
Why is it futile to protect your authority

330
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,178
and pride as a doctor?

331
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,557
What does a doctor have but honor?

332
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,768
Their sense of duty.

333
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,604
Jinman.

334
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:13,235
At the end of the day, our job is
to treat sick and injured people.

335
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,196
-That's where we start and where we end.
-(scoffs)

336
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,283
Everything else is futile nonsense,
Jinman.

337
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,450
Sense of duty?

338
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,831
You know how the Korean medical community

339
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,542
entraps and abuses doctors

340
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,712
with that sense of duty like a leash?

341
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,006
And yet, how could you say that?

342
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,593
Nevertheless, it's something you can't do
without a sense of duty.

343
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:42,055
This darn hospital system won't work
without it!

344
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,140
What else can you do?

345
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,311
Are you just going to sit
and watch the dying patients?

346
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,770
Just how long?

347
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,065
How long do I have to put up
with their rudeness?

348
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,109
All I get in return for fixing them

349
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,862
is verbal abuse and resentment.

350
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,906
(exhales)

351
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,240
Just how long--

352
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,241
Until it works!

353
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:08,165
Until we find the answer
to all the irrationality.

354
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,627
That's why…

355
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,380
That's why we old folks are standing
in the front line, Jinman.

356
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,465
(scoffs)

357
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,260
We're not at the top to work the others
to the bone and boss them around.

358
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,514
We're here to make a better world

359
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,725
with our experience and insight!

360
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,519
SABU: I put you in that position
not for your own honor,

361
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,690
but for everyone's well-being
and benefit, got it?

362
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,734
(sighs)

363
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,823
You were off to a good start.

364
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:47,204
If you were going to put on a performance,
you should have been more magnanimous.

365
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,750
The second you won that case,

366
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,294
you turned around
and picked on Lee Seonung.

367
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,963
He provoked me first.

368
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,131
That little punk started it.

369
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,258
Jinman.

370
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,136
When you want to pretend
to be a good boss,

371
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,223
you have to have
more patience and perseverance.

372
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,766
With more generosity.

373
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,061
Why even pretend
when you'll be found out right away?

374
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,980
Aren't you embarrassed?

375
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,108
What are you really trying to say?

376
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,944
"Now that it's come to this,
you should stop"?

377
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,281
Are you saying I should step down?

378
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,284
No, you should stay
and fight until the end!

379
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,578
Put your pride or whatever aside

380
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,206
and dedicate yourself to the Trauma Center
as a part of the team!

381
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,292
Pull yourself together
and hang on until the end,

382
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,752
so you can try and humble me, you punk.

383
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,338
SABU: You…

384
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,134
better not throw
in your resignation and run away.

385
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,385
If it comes to that,

386
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,347
we won't be friends or anything like that.

387
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,473
Got it?

388
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,686
(soft music)

389
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,276
(elevator dings)

390
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,517
(door closes)

391
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,565
Mom.

392
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,692
EUNJAE: What are you doing?

393
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,570
Can't you see I'm cleaning up the trash?

394
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,202
What are you doing, Eunjae?

395
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,745
(sighs)

396
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,498
This isn't your house, Mom.

397
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,415
It's ours.

398
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,501
It's the house Seo Woojin and I live in.

399
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,587
-Don't you know what that means?
-That's enough.

400
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,130
I don't want to hear it.

401
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,508
You're hurting me. Stop it.

402
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,927
Why?

403
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,845
Why is my happiness

404
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,014
hurting you, Mom?

405
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,683
Do you

406
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,977
not want me to be happy?

407
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,980
I'm doing this
because I'm afraid you'll be unhappy

408
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,233
and regret all of this later!

409
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,694
"That's not going to happen."

410
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,279
"You're going to live well."

411
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,781
Can't you just say that?

412
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,325
He's the man your daughter loves.

413
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,286
I even decided to live with him.

414
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,747
How can you be

415
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,292
so unhappy about everything I choose?

416
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,421
Is your life perfect then?

417
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,049
What about Dad?
Is he respected by everyone?

418
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,553
You're going too far.
How dare you bring your dad into this?

419
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,388
So please respect my decisions!

420
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,850
He's the man I chose

421
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,935
and this is the life I chose.

422
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,814
And I already became independent of you
three years ago.

423
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,067
So, Mom…

424
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,904
Can you please

425
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,699
become independent of me?

426
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,743
(exhales shakily)

427
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,630
WOOJIN: Allow me to pour you a drink.

428
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,929
That's right.

429
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,141
Even someone like me isn't respected
by everyone.

430
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,310
Drink.

431
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,818
Woojin.

432
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,197
How long do you plan on staying
at Doldam Hospital?

433
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,533
I have no plans to leave.

434
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,452
JINMAN: Don't you have any ambitions?

435
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,706
With your skills,
you would be treated well

436
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,794
and welcomed at any hospital in Seoul.

437
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,422
Why are you wasting that
in the countryside?

438
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,925
That won't be a problem

439
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,469
if this hospital becomes
the best in the country.

440
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,638
WOOJIN: I dream of the day

441
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,976
the ace of Doldam Hospital
becomes the country's ace.

442
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,479
Is this the romance

443
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,690
that Bu Yongju talked about?

444
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:08,942
No, it's not.

445
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,403
It's just my dream.

446
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:13,947
Your dream?

447
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,033
Your dream?

448
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,369
(scoffs)
At that age?

449
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,204
What of it?

450
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,206
Don't you have any dreams?

451
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,043
Your dream, you say…

452
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:32,757
I just

453
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,678
wanted to instill
a sense of responsibility in him.

454
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,222
His competence as a doctor

455
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,475
is directly related to his patient's life.

456
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,520
I wanted to help him realize that.

457
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,397
JINMAN: I didn't think…

458
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,529
he would jump to his death.

459
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:02,162
To be honest,
I don't understand your generation.

460
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,916
You all say
whatever you want to so easily,

461
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,211
but fall apart just as easily
when taking responsibility.

462
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,089
You all have a weak mentality.

463
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,258
You're all so difficult

464
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,594
and demanding.

465
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,929
JINMAN: You don't even try,

466
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,140
but you want results.

467
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,227
You don't even work hard but complain
the second you're given something to do.

468
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,523
It's a wonder

469
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,902
what you can accomplish in that state.

470
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,280
(glass clinks)

471
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,117
Our thought processes have changed,

472
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,244
and above all else,

473
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,622
the world we live in is different.

474
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,001
It's no longer an era of possibilities.

475
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,713
To the youths, we live in an era

476
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,132
where we have to hold out.

477
00:27:58,968 --> 00:27:59,969
Do you think…

478
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,475
I'm at fault for the kid's death too?

479
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,194
Master Kim

480
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,114
is tough sometimes.

481
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,908
Sometimes, he curses…

482
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,660
(laughs softly)

483
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,162
…and yells if he doesn't like something.

484
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,249
WOOJIN: However,

485
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,003
he never gave up on me

486
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,133
no matter the situation.

487
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,054
No matter the situation,

488
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,640
he was on my side.

489
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,815
He was like that

490
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,693
not only to me

491
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,404
but also to everyone at Doldam.

492
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,490
I see.

493
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,078
I see.
(sighs)

494
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,748
Here.

495
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,018
-You think I won't hit you?
-MAN 1: Let go.

496
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,811
-You gals will get hurt.
-AREUM: No--

497
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,814
-You--
-Why is it so loud?

498
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,107
Be quiet this instant!

499
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,528
SABU: How dare you call a doctor "gal"?

500
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,240
These two are at it again.

501
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,283
Sit down!

502
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,868
I said sit down!

503
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,787
MAN 2: Ow, it hurts.

504
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,413
As if.

505
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,581
SABU: Look into the light.

506
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,667
MAN 2: It hurts.

507
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,503
SABU: Gosh.

508
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,173
There was hemothorax, so I put in a tube

509
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,926
and the first drain was about 400 cc.

510
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,803
That wasn't so much.

511
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,305
No, but it hasn't been an hour yet.

512
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,767
At the current rate,
it's 300 cc per hour though.

513
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,311
The primary site of bleeding is…

514
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,814
SABU: Where do you think it is?

515
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,399
SABU: Hey.

516
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,071
I said, where do you think it is?

517
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,618
I don't think it's clear on the CT.

518
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,746
What do you have to do
when the bleeding is

519
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,206
over 300 cc per hour?

520
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:36,918
(silently mouthing) Sur…

521
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,628
Surgical…

522
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,713
Surgical?

523
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,090
(silently mouthing) Tho…

524
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,009
A surgical thoracostomy
should be performed.

525
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,723
Have you ever done an exploratory surgery?

526
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,642
I've been
a surgical first assistant in several.

527
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,769
-Is that true?
-Yes.

528
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,979
Okay.

529
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,860
You perform the surgery today.
I'll assist.

530
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,821
Dr. Jung,

531
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:08,449
make sure to keep the patient's vitals
stable until she gets to the OR.

532
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,701
Yes, Master Kim.

533
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,828
INSU: Nurse Joo,
please hang up the packed RBCs.

534
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,912
Yes, Doctor.

535
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,417
Pull yourself together.

536
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,378
-Let's eat some meat after you're done.
-(sighs)

537
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,089
Take deep breaths. Yes.

538
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,924
There you go.

539
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:28,636
Master Kim!

540
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,891
What is it now?

541
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,643
Am I really

542
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,896
going to operate?

543
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,440
What? Are you afraid?

544
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,568
Yes, a little.

545
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,821
Why did you do such a thing

546
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,781
when you're afraid
over something like this?

547
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,745
MYEONGSIM: I believe
Dr. Lee Seonung did it, Master Kim.

548
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,624
He was the one who was in front of

549
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,500
Assemblywoman Ko's room too.

550
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,544
(sighs)

551
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,089
SABU: Tell me why you did it.

552
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,551
I just wanted

553
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,930
to get revenge in some way.

554
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,184
For my friend's death

555
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,228
and his discrimination against me.

556
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,649
It looks like you have a lot
to say about that incident.

557
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,568
Tell me.

558
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,112
What would you like me to do?

559
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,448
SEONUNG: I thought

560
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,992
it would be better if Professor Cha

561
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,578
stepped down from being
the head of Doldam Hospital Trauma Center.

562
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,122
I told you
that's how you're supposed to do it.

563
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,292
Yes.

564
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,171
SEONUNG: If Professor Cha leaves,

565
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,634
there would be no problems
receiving the grant for the Trauma Center,

566
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,054
so I felt like I needed to do something.

567
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,891
HEAD OF THE TRAUMA CENTER, CHA JINMAN

568
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,109
Do you know how to really get revenge?

569
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,196
By becoming a better human than them.

570
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,114
SABU: Okay?

571
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,117
You prove to those who ignored you
and discriminated against you

572
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,955
that their prejudice and concerns
were misplaced and nothing but nonsense

573
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,457
with your skills.

574
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,878
There's no better revenge
than that, you know.

575
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,967
Can I really be that kind of surgeon?

576
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,301
Hey.

577
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,138
Why not? Just do it.

578
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,850
If you've endured
that long decade of training and residency

579
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,935
to become the fellow you are now,

580
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,730
you're more than qualified to do so.

581
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,149
SABU: So…

582
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,152
don't play such cheap tricks from now on.

583
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,612
That's not revenge or anything, you punk.

584
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:55,783
That's just destroying your own character
with your own hands.

585
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,995
SABU: You may be able to hide
your actions,

586
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,663
but your conscience

587
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,332
will haunt you forever.

588
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,959
Do you understand?

589
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,005
Yes, Master Kim.

590
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,091
Count yourself lucky, you punk.

591
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,803
I don't assist just anyone
in surgery, you know.

592
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,431
Hurry up and get ready.

593
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,224
Yes, Master Kim.

594
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,480
SEONUNG: Excuse me, Master Kim?

595
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,856
What is it?

596
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,026
Thank you.

597
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,445
I will do my best.

598
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,240
I mean it.

599
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,993
Hey, don't laugh.
I might start liking you.

600
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,955
Now get lost and get ready.

601
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,005
SABU: That little…

602
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,968
(laughs)

603
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,971
Oh, boy.

604
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,725
Is anyone here?

605
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,394
Ma'am!

606
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,439
Ma'am!

607
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,692
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am!

608
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:13,986
Nurse Euntak, let's…

609
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,698
Ma'am?

610
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,075
Ma'am!

611
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,248
By chance,

612
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,416
have you ever felt

613
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,628
that ever since
the Trauma Center was built,

614
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,924
there's been a lot of strange happenings
at Doldam Hospital?

615
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,136
There's always been
a lot of strange happenings

616
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,804
at Doldam Hospital.

617
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,514
Did we build it in the wrong location?

618
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,599
(suspenseful music)

619
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,477
Oh, right.

620
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,646
My uncle-in-law said

621
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:52,984
that during the Korean War,
a lot of people died in this area.

622
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,446
The field hospital at that time
became Doldam Hospital.

623
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,323
Then…

624
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:03,327
there must be
a lot of vengeful spirits here.

625
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,371
Why are you saying such scary things?

626
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,458
Ghosts scare me the most.

627
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,127
-(shudders)
-(gasps)

628
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,254
Me too.

629
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,464
(both yell)

630
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,633
Who said there's a ghost?

631
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,014
Where could she be?

632
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,101
(blows air)

633
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,019
-What the heck?
-What?

634
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,103
-You scared me!
-Gosh!

635
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,855
What? Darn it.

636
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,148
Oh, sorry.

637
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,651
What, aren't you guys
looking for the elderly lady?

638
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,905
Dr. Dong, you scared us!

639
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,781
My heart…

640
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,492
Is she not here either?

641
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,244
No, we haven't found her.

642
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,415
She wouldn't have gone
near the lake, right?

643
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,921
DONGHWA: Nurse Euntak,
where are you going?

644
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,423
You're not going
to search by the lake, are you?

645
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,052
Gosh, going that far would be too much.

646
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:03,930
DONGHWA: Nurse Euntak!

647
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,390
What are you doing?

648
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,185
Aren't you going with them?

649
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:14,023
Ghosts are known to like water.

650
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,621
We should just call the police.

651
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,331
Wouldn't that be faster?

652
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:32,875
(sighs)

653
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,463
Why don't you show
the same level of passion for Dr. Areum?

654
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,218
I mean,

655
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,721
you're putting a lot of effort
into finding a missing patient,

656
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,474
but you're indifferent toward Dr. Areum.

657
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,062
I'd rather not have
this conversation with you.

658
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,772
Let me ask you a question.

659
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,233
What would you do

660
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,945
if I confessed my feelings to Dr. Areum?

661
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,530
(soft music)

662
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,242
I mean I was pretty popular
for my looks in my school days,

663
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,828
so if I put my mind to it,

664
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,289
I'm sure it'll bother you a lot.

665
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,500
What do you think about this?

666
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,088
-Do you want to hear what I think?
-That's why I asked.

667
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,886
I think it'll go like this.

668
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,097
DONGHWA: Come on.

669
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,976
It's just frustrating to watch you guys.

670
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,108
(exhales, sniffles)

671
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,236
What do you say?

672
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,697
Would you like to use
the Jang Donghwa free pass?

673
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,411
Gosh.

674
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,122
It must be hard
working practically every night.

675
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,417
Professor Shim should be here next week,
so it should get better.

676
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,543
By the way,

677
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,171
Professor Cha and Dr. Seo Woojin

678
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,298
stopped by my restaurant, Come and Go.

679
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,717
What happened? Did they say anything?

680
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,055
You and I both know
Professor Cha has a rigid personality,

681
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,599
but he seemed very confused.

682
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,561
Every belief he's ever had

683
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,023
has been contradicted and shaken.

684
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,400
He must be having a hard time.

685
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,951
(door closes)

686
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,716
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

687
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,093
Are you looking for someone?

688
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,845
Shh! Be quiet.

689
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:56,477
You're scaring all the fireflies away.

690
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,440
Ma'am.

691
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,360
Are you not feeling well?

692
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,113
It must be great for them.

693
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,824
To be so pretty.

694
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,331
(Sabu grunts)

695
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,458
Excuse me, ma'am.

696
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,421
Where are your guardians?

697
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,425
They've already gone to a better place.

698
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,848
Living a long life isn't always great,
don't you think?

699
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,518
I'm all alone now,

700
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,605
so nothing is fun anymore.

701
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,191
(sighs)

702
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:46,944
(laughs softly)

703
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,991
It feels lonely, doesn't it?

704
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,410
(laughs)

705
00:40:56,203 --> 00:41:01,083
That's why not anyone can do what you do.

706
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,338
You have to endure a lot of things alone

707
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,175
and take on a lot
of responsibilities by yourself.

708
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,598
But you're doing a great job.

709
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,808
-(Sabu chuckles)
-Sit up straight, honey.

710
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,851
Sit up straight.

711
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,436
Yes, ma'am.

712
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,605
(laughs)

713
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,441
Oh, my.

714
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,737
They're flying around again.

715
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,077
(laughs)

716
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,482
(Sabu chuckles)

717
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,659
SABU: Ma'am?

718
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,328
Ma'am?

719
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,163
SABU: Ma'am?

720
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,831
Dr. Yoon Areum!

721
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,751
Dr. Yoon, the hybrid OR, quickly!

722
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,002
Yes, Master Kim.

723
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,630
Okay, be careful!

724
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,799
Slowly, be careful.

725
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,883
Slowly.

726
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,637
SABU: Slowly.

727
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,348
What's the medical history
of this patient?

728
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,642
She has symptoms of dementia
and came in for cardiomegaly

729
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,935
and pulmonary edema.

730
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,813
SABU: Her pulse is weak.

731
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,481
AREUM: From the moment she got here,

732
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,692
both dorsalis pedis arteries were weak

733
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,611
so I notified Dr. Ortho
that I suspect Buerger's disease.

734
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,738
AREUM: I couldn't get into contact
with the guardians,

735
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,242
so I had no choice but to just drain
the excess fluid in the lungs.

736
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,828
The patient disappeared
after we took her chest CT,

737
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,830
and the CT results
showed an aortic aneurysm.

738
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,041
Master Kim, BP is 90/50.
And her last heart rate measured was 140.

739
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,252
Give her more oxygen
and prepare an ultrasound.

740
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,963
Let me borrow your stethoscope.

741
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,684
It doesn't sound good.

742
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,686
I think it's cardiac tamponade.

743
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,897
Dr. Yoon, get me a needle
for pericardiocentesis.

744
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,024
Yes, Master Kim.

745
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,739
Master Kim found her.

746
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,075
AREUM: She's in very bad condition
so we have to perform pericardiocentesis.

747
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,285
Pericardiocentesis?

748
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,536
I'll prepare for it.

749
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:46,373
SABU: Jang Donghwa,
don't just stand there. Put in an A-line.

750
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,499
What?

751
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,753
I'm actually not on duty today…

752
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,672
but I'll do that right now.

753
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,924
(tense music)

754
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,385
Dr. Yoon Areum.

755
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,763
Hurry up and call the guardians.

756
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,100
We may have to perform
an emergency operation.

757
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,142
Yes, Master Kim.

758
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,406
Come on, please pick up the phone.

759
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,991
Dr. Yoon, have you spoken
to the guardians yet?

760
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,869
-No, they won't answer the phone.
-(sighs)

761
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,250
JUNGGEUM: Honey.

762
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,628
Yes?

763
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,172
Don't call the kids.

764
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,633
They're already

765
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,386
busy as it is.

766
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,679
Ma'am.

767
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:28,225
The condition of your aorta
is very bad right now.

768
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,937
You may need
to get emergency surgery soon.

769
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,190
In order to do that,
we need the guardian to--

770
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,275
JUNGGEUM: I'm sleepy.

771
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,819
I want to sleep.

772
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,989
(soft music)

773
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,911
Honey.

774
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,081
Take your time getting here.

775
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,918
After you finish doing
everything you need to.

776
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,171
Okay?

777
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,764
Thank you.

778
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,189
(flatlines)

779
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,195
(soft emotional music)

780
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,453
(cries)

781
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,634
(exhales)

782
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,145
You chose a very nice

783
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,482
and cozy house.

784
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:41,733
(chuckles)

785
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,822
It looks like a perfect place
for the two of you…

786
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,490
(chuckles)

787
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,909
…to start something together.

788
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,330
-(soft music)
-(Jinman inhales)

789
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,540
You really like

790
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,542
Eunjae, right?

791
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,129
-Yes.
-How much do you like her?

792
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,922
More than words

793
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,758
can convey how much.

794
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,345
That's a nice saying.

795
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:14,516
That cowardly little girl

796
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,477
wouldn't have made that decision

797
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,730
without certainty.

798
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,860
I hope you cherish her.

799
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,281
Yes, I plan on doing that.

800
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,407
All right.

801
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:33,785
JINMAN: You can go.

802
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,550
(sighs)

803
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:54,932
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

804
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,309
Hello.

805
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,770
Good morning, Dr. Cha.

806
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,271
Oh, you're here?

807
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,648
Did you stay up all night?

808
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,817
Last night, Dr. Lee operated
on a hemothorax patient

809
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,235
so I was watching over the surgery.

810
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,112
Dr. Ung operated?

811
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,406
Master Kim assisted him too.

812
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,699
That lucky guy.

813
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,619
You should get some rest.

814
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,913
You have huge dark circles.

815
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,707
(chuckles)
Then I'll be taking my leave.

816
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,502
(sighs)

817
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,769
Oh, are you getting off work?

818
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,106
Hey, Dr. Jang. Did you sleep
in the medical office yesterday?

819
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:47,025
Yes. In the end,
the elderly patient passed away.

820
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,987
I barely got any sleep.

821
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,030
Really?
(clicks tongue)

822
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,327
Are you looking for Dr. Woojin?

823
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,247
What? No, it's nothing like that.

824
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,665
I guess he's not here.

825
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,503
-Where did he go?
-Oh,

826
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,923
I guess things worked out between him
and the boarding house's owner.

827
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,675
He answered a call this morning

828
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,302
and packed his things and left.

829
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,609
Hey, what happened?

830
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,363
How can you come out like this
when my dad is here?

831
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,032
Hurry up and get dressed.

832
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,409
-You haven't met Professor Cha yet?
-What?

833
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,327
He left for the hospital
early this morning.

834
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:41,997
What?

835
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,168
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

836
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,212
This is a rather sudden decision.

837
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,382
Isn't this what you wanted, Director Park?

838
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,344
Still, I didn't think
you would decide so quickly.

839
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,055
There's no reason

840
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,348
to drag on an uncomfortable situation.

841
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,601
We know each other's stance on things.

842
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,269
Anyway,

843
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:08,148
although you weren't here long,
I'd like to thank you for your hard work.

844
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,324
There's always a price to pay

845
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,160
for every choice we make, Director Park.

846
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,038
However, most people

847
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,291
don't realize that at the moment.

848
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,754
Only after time has passed

849
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,924
will they realize

850
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,052
what was lost because of the choices.

851
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,971
That's why I always try
to be careful about everything.

852
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,224
I tend to take everything
into consideration as well.

853
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:47,312
Don't trust your capabilities
and intelligence too much

854
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,981
or else you might be proven otherwise.

855
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,027
Let's go. I'll escort you to your car.

856
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,655
No, it's okay. I know the way out.

857
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,492
Take care.

858
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,800
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

859
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,594
MINGUK: Hello, Ms. Ko. It's Park Minguk.

860
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,608
JINMAN: Generally speaking,

861
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,696
it's important to make it down well.

862
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,575
But fear of the downward slope

863
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,537
makes a man act petty.

864
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,497
WOO SANGMIN

865
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,958
JINMAN: If you're going down anyway,

866
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,420
you might as well look cool doing it.

867
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,339
But greed

868
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,259
and arrogance

869
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,429
make you try so hard.

870
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,807
And in the end,

871
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,767
you will become a wreck.

872
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:12,397
-(door slams open)
-(pants)

873
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,441
-(Eunjae continues panting)
-(door closes)

874
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,375
JINMAN: Is there no way for a man

875
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,419
to look graceful

876
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:36,963
on his way down?

877
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,549
Dad?

878
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:40,800
JINMAN: Yes, Eunjae?

879
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,469
Where are you?

880
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,512
JINMAN: Where else?

881
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,348
I'm on my way home.

882
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,226
But…
(sighs)

883
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:53,605
...how can you leave
without saying goodbye?

884
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,358
When you have time,
you can visit me in Seoul

885
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,276
with Woojin.

886
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,238
I'll make you a delicious omelet.

887
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,282
(sighs)

888
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:06,701
Dad.

889
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,664
-Yes?
-Can't you go back to Seoul?

890
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:16,044
I don't want to see you like this anymore.

891
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,882
I don't want to hear the hospital staff
whisper about you either.

892
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:23,802
I'm having

893
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,971
a really hard time.

894
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:29,975
Eunjae.

895
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:31,893
I'm…

896
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,565
I'm really sorry.

897
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,487
I should have left a better impression.

898
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,785
(exhales shakily)

899
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,331
I'm sorry, Eunjae.

900
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,419
Did you know

901
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,966
that when I was torn
between general surgery and CT surgery,

902
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,803
I chose CT surgery without hesitation

903
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,139
because of what you said?

904
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,350
What did I say?

905
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:16,563
"Do you want to hold dung or a heart?"

906
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,023
(laughs)

907
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,400
JINMAN: I did say that.

908
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,360
(laughs)

909
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,158
Dad.

910
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,287
I love you.

911
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,795
You have always been

912
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:46,051
a decorated hero to me.

913
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:55,393
-(Eunjae cries over phone)
-(exhales shakily)

914
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:56,853
Thank you, Eunjae.

915
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,737
Make sure you eat well.

916
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,117
(call ends)

917
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,828
(soft music)

918
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,886
-(door opens)
-(approaching footsteps)

919
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,179
(door closes)

920
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,950
(cries)

921
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,141
(sighs)

922
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:37,745
(door closes)

923
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,303
KYUNGSOOK: Yes. Keep up the hard work.

924
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,387
MAN 3: Yes, Ma'am.

925
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,931
(exhales)

926
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,940
I heard that the development company
sent an official letter.

927
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,402
Yes, I looked at it. The environmental…

928
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,789
-MINGUK: Excuse me. Wait, Ms. Ko!
-(approaching footsteps)

929
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,334
(pants)

930
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,003
-KYUNGSOOK: Director Park Minguk.
-Are you

931
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,922
just leaving like this?

932
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,883
Yes, I'm done with all my meetings today.

933
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:34,135
You should have something
to discuss with me.

934
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,262
Oh, you mean the lawsuit?

935
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,474
I already informed my lawyer.

936
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:42,393
The case should be dismissed
by tomorrow afternoon.

937
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,562
There will be no appeal.

938
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,731
-KYUNGSOOK: Will that be all?
-(sighs)

939
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:51,027
Will the Trauma Center's budget
be passed without incident then?

940
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,577
What are you doing right now?

941
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,581
-Pardon?
-Listen here, Director Park Minguk.

942
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:08,878
Every provincial budget deliberation
has its own deliberation process.

943
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:12,382
What do you mean
by "pass without incident"?

944
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:16,594
Are you trying to take tax money without
going through the appropriate process?

945
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,348
You made the promise first, Ms. Ko.

946
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:23,893
(scoffs)
What a troublesome man you are.

947
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,188
What promise did I make?

948
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,525
I am a government employee

949
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,735
who works for the people.

950
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,070
Are you now saying

951
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,450
I used the provincial budget
as some kind of bait?

952
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,618
Ms. Ko.

953
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,621
I'm really sorry,

954
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,999
but I don't understand
what's going on right now.

955
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,587
Why have you suddenly changed your mind?

956
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,010
You were there too.

957
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,054
Then you should have heard what I said.

958
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:03,182
That you should be
prepared for an all-out war.

959
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,687
Since you asked for a political war,
I said I would pay you back with politics.

960
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:13,860
The head of the Trauma Center, Cha Jinman,
has been taken care of.

961
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:20,491
Next will be the Trauma Center
that let my son die in vain.

962
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,879
It sounds like a humiliating compromise

963
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,881
rather than a practical route.

964
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:38,676
Don't trust your capabilities
and intelligence too much

965
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,471
or else you might be proven otherwise.

966
01:00:58,988 --> 01:00:59,947
(sighs)

967
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,537
Where are you going?

968
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:07,789
MAN 4: Doldam Hospital.

969
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,707
DRIVER: Okay, sir.

970
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,262
Is something the matter?
Are you meeting someone?

971
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,597
(chuckles)

972
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,058
No, I wouldn't say that.

973
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,857
-Let me.
-NURSE 3: Here you go.

974
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:35,817
Thank you.

975
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,366
Is something the matter?

976
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,035
Are you waiting for someone?

977
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,163
Oh, no. I wouldn't say that.

978
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:50,873
I'll see you later.

979
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,252
What's going on?

980
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,928
Chief Jang.

981
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,847
What is it now?

982
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,849
Is someone coming today?

983
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,559
Are they here already?

984
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:11,310
Who's coming?

985
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,521
Oh…

986
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,606
Are they not here yet?

987
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,191
Who is it?

988
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:20,570
You'll find out soon enough.
(chuckles)

989
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,239
(chuckles mockingly)

990
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,032
(Woojin grunts)

991
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,619
When will I be able to operate again?

992
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,204
MUNJEONG: Gosh, I told you.

993
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,831
Until I say you can.

994
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:36,252
It's just that
Master Kim has been overdoing it lately.

995
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,923
You're supposed to rehabilitate
with a sense of ease.

996
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,925
If you rush things,
you'll hurt yourself again.

997
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,218
MUNJEONG: You know that, right?

998
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,180
(sighs)

999
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,267
(door closes)

1000
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,519
(sighs)

1001
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,889
(hopeful music)

1002
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,935
-(approaching footsteps echo)
-(door closes)

1003
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,788
-(sighs)
-(soft music)

1004
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:55,832
(sighs)

1005
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,793
(sighs)

1006
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,213
(sighs)

1007
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,383
(sighs)

1008
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,928
SABU: Did your meeting
with Assemblywoman Ko go well?

1009
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,307
MINGUK: Master Kim.

1010
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,562
You were here?

1011
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:19,272
You said

1012
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:24,652
you were meeting
Assemblywoman Ko Kyungsook today.

1013
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,489
I was curious about how it went,

1014
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,824
so I came up here.

1015
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,119
So…

1016
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:37,206
did Assemblywoman Ko say she would
pass the budget without incident?

1017
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,042
Yes, well, you see…

1018
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:44,046
She first said
she'd drop the appeal for now.

1019
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,049
For now…

1020
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,010
What about "five now"?

1021
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:50,803
What?

1022
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:52,763
(chuckles)

1023
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,432
The budget.

1024
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,143
What did she say?
Did she say she'll pass it?

1025
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,477
I'm meeting with the people

1026
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,022
in charge of the budget next week.

1027
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:04,025
And then?

1028
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:05,192
Then…

1029
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:08,195
they'll have to go
through various deliberations

1030
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,823
since they have to enforce taxes.

1031
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,908
I mean…

1032
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:15,620
didn't you say she would
pass the budget without incident?

1033
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,081
About that, Master Kim--

1034
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,374
Now, now.

1035
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:25,087
Let's keep it simple
and get straight to the point.

1036
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,506
So…

1037
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,508
what did Assemblywoman Ko say?

1038
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,514
She said it was an all-out war, right?

1039
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,398
How did you know that?

1040
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,567
(chuckles)

1041
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,905
There was a moment when Assemblywoman Ko
told me her true intentions

1042
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,492
for the first and last time.

1043
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,162
KYUNGSOOK: But you'll have to be prepared
for an all-out war, Master Kim.

1044
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:01,916
The head of your Trauma Center
came at me asking for a political war,

1045
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:03,709
so I should pay you back with politics.

1046
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,923
(sighs)

1047
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,634
The civil suit

1048
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,263
was like the foundation
for forcing us to kick Cha Jinman out.

1049
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:17,765
She had no intention

1050
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,434
of giving us the budget.

1051
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,145
Should I meet
with Professor Cha Jinman again?

1052
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,191
Even if I have to get on my knees
and apologize to bring him back,

1053
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,277
-I'll go and do that.
-(sighs)

1054
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,072
Do you really think Professor Cha
would come back if you did that?

1055
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,282
What do we do then?

1056
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:38,452
Meeting the people in charge of the budget
without the head of the Trauma Center

1057
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,329
will definitely reflect poorly on us.

1058
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:42,665
You have nothing to be afraid of.

1059
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,919
In an all-out war, you go all-out.

1060
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,464
An eye for an eye

1061
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,260
and a tooth for a tooth.

1062
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,432
Are you perhaps

1063
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:03,686
thinking about being
the head of the Trauma Center, Master Kim?

1064
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:06,439
Someone more intense

1065
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,483
than me will be.

1066
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:12,987
Someone more intense

1067
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,073
than you?

1068
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,286
Who are you?

1069
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,294
I'm Kang Dongju, a GS at Doldam Hospital.

1070
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:29,962
And you are?

1071
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,883
I'm Seo Woojin, a GS at Doldam Hospital.

1072
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,647
SABU: There you are.

1073
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:53,694
(laughs softly)

1074
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,490
(laughs softly)

1075
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,086
DONGJU: It's been a while, Master Kim.

1076
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:12,963
You haven't changed at all.

1077
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:15,132
(chuckles)

1078
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,177
Are you back now?

1079
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:21,305
Yes.

1080
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:22,807
I'm back.

1081
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,103
-(Sabu chuckles)
-(upbeat music)

1082
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,532
(chuckles)

1083
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,496
(closing theme music)

1084
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:17,153
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

1085
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,781
Dr. Kang Dongju is going to be
in charge of the Trauma Center?

1086
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,534
How much did you think about doing
while coming here?

1087
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,451
DONGJU: We'll start

1088
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,037
by following the rules.

1089
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,455
Send them to the Doldam ER.

1090
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,415
Move them to an OR.

1091
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,125
EUNJAE: I'll be right there.

1092
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:33,419
You shouldn't treat
or operate on non-trauma cases!

1093
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,045
SABU: Let me ask you something, Dongju.

1094
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,298
What do you want to become?

1095
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:39,466
May I ask why you acted so rashly?

1096
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:42,261
I wanted to see if I can beat Master Kim.
