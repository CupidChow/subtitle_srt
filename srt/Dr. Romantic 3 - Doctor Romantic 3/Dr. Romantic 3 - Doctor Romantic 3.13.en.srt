00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,628
(theme music)

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,005
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,962
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,175
(clock ticking)

5
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,342
(phone vibrates)

6
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,430
-(chuckles)
-(cheerful music)

7
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:00,894
Finally.

8
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,437
Finally!

9
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,191
EPISODE 13

10
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,484
MYEONGSIM: Is he really here?

11
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,651
I believe so.

12
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,528
I haven't seen him in forever!

13
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,863
He actually came after all.

14
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,032
Did he say he'd come here straight away?

15
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,576
Master Kim told me
to wait in the trauma center.

16
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,995
So I'm sure
he will bring him here directly.

17
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,455
Right through those doors!

18
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,460
(cheerful music continues)

19
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,945
(music distorted)

20
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,868
What are you guys doing there?

21
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,080
Did something happen again?

22
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,916
Whatever. I'm going to go see him now.

23
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,585
Me too! Wait for me, Ms. Oh!

24
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,795
Hey!

25
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,006
GITAE: Master Kim told us to wait!

26
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,716
What is it?

27
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,511
Is someone coming?

28
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,180
He's already here.

29
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,890
Right here at Doldam Hospital.

30
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,308
Who?

31
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,936
The first ace surgeon at Doldam Hospital.

32
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:30,024
It's none other than Dr. Kang Dongju!

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,026
Right then, I'm off too.

34
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,030
Dr. Kang Dongju?

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,241
No way.

36
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,743
That Kang Dongju?

37
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,580
What? Dr. Kang is here?

38
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,039
Yes, Dr. Kang Dongju.

39
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,666
He arrived just now.

40
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,169
Who's Dr. Kang Dongju?

41
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,212
He's the legendary surgeon

42
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,549
who had a fistfight with Master Kim
as soon as he got to Doldam Hospital.

43
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,760
What? They had a fistfight?

44
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,971
(laughs)
Come on. I doubt that's true.

45
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,764
DONGHWA: Even if it's a rumor,

46
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,725
I doubt Master Kim would get
into a fistfight.

47
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,686
I mean, I only heard about it too.

48
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,356
So just like all legends,
it's up to you to believe it or not.

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,442
It's not just a story. It really happened.

50
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,693
Right, Mr. Koo?

51
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,944
Is that true?

52
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,364
Did he really throw punches at Master Kim?

53
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,616
Yes, that's right.

54
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,578
I was there at the very scene
and broke up the fight myself.

55
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,831
Oh, my. No way.

56
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,542
Master Kim used his fists on a student?

57
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,420
No way.

58
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,755
SEONUNG: Come on.

59
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,466
I'm sure that Kang Dongju guy

60
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,968
couldn't throw punches
at Master Kim either.

61
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,261
How is that possible?

62
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,849
That guy was always unyielding
and headstrong since med school.

63
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,105
He picked a fight
with Director Do Yoonwan as a fellow

64
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,441
and got sent to Doldam Hospital,
so you get the picture.

65
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,736
You can tell how he is
from his attitude to his character, right?

66
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,490
-(scoffs)
-Dr. Cha, you seem to know him well.

67
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,371
I mean, I don't know him well personally.

68
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,207
He was just very famous
for being so headstrong.

69
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,333
(Eunjae chuckles awkwardly)

70
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,918
So where is Dr. Kang now?

71
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,670
He's talking with Master Kim.

72
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,339
I should go and say hi.
I'm so excited to see him.

73
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,385
Aren't the rest of you going to say hello?

74
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,719
(door closes)

75
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,974
(cup thuds)

76
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,854
(door closes)

77
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,149
(paper rustles)

78
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,401
Aren't you going, Dr. Cha?

79
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,902
What?

80
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,612
Right.

81
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,616
Well, I can say hi later.
(chuckles)

82
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,620
Look at the time. Goodness.
(mumbles)

83
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,423
(pensive music)

84
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,013
Are you back now?

85
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,431
You haven't changed at all.

86
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,142
-(door opens)
-YEONGMI: Ms. Eom!

87
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,478
-Ms. Eom!
-Ms. Joo!

88
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,148
-Wait up!
-Wait for me!

89
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,108
(quirky music)

90
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,488
Dr. Kang Dongju is here.
Did you hear about it?

91
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,115
Yes.

92
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,951
He won't remember us, will he?

93
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,332
Sure. He won't remember.
That was ages ago, right?

94
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,126
DONGHWA: What happened?

95
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,590
Did something happen
between you and Dr. Kang?

96
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,800
You kids don't need to know, okay?

97
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,345
Go now. Shoo.

98
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,638
GITAE: Dr. Kang!

99
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,933
(hospital staff cheering and clapping)

100
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,019
-Welcome!
-(laughing)

101
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,729
DOIL: It's great to see you!

102
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,773
Look who it is!

103
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,067
-Dr. Kang!
-You're here!

104
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,030
Dr. Kang. You're finally here.
I'm glad you came.

105
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,615
-MYEONGSIM: Welcome back.
-(Doil laughs)

106
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,325
I'm glad to see you too, Dr. Kang.

107
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,495
It's been so long! I'm so happy!
(laughs)

108
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,789
I'm glad you're here.
I missed you so much.

109
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,415
Have you all been well?

110
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,501
Ms. Oh, you still look the same.

111
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,418
Gosh.

112
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,587
I know that's not true,
but since you're saying that,

113
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,422
-I'll take your word for it.
-(laughs)

114
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,132
You've gotten even more handsome.

115
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,675
Come on.

116
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,969
So are you back for good this time?

117
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,097
Yes, I'm back for good.

118
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,641
(all exclaim)

119
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,017
(Gitae exclaims)

120
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,144
My dear Dr. Kang Dongju.

121
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,189
Do you know
how long I've waited for this day?

122
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,608
I thought you'd be back
after your military service,

123
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,360
but you suddenly went to the US.

124
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:46,072
Do you know how crushed I felt back then?

125
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,324
Why would you feel crushed?

126
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,910
He told everyone he'd be back
once he finished his studies.

127
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,414
Still, that was
just how I felt at the time.

128
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,124
-Oh, you.
-DOIL: All right.

129
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,836
Say hello to the Doldam staff
who have been holding down the fort.

130
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,797
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Areum,
a Emergency Medicine specialist.

131
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,299
I'm Lee Seonung, a cardiothoracic surgeon.

132
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,051
I'm Nurse Joo Yeongmi.

133
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,221
It's an honor to meet the legend himself.

134
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,681
(laughter)

135
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,015
I hope we get along well.

136
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,475
INSU: Hey!

137
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,936
Kang Dongju!

138
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,397
Goodness.

139
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,441
(grunts, laughs)

140
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,192
INSU: What took you so long?

141
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,194
You should've come back sooner!

142
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,030
Insu, you haven't changed one bit.
Have you been well?

143
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,159
I've been well and not so well.

144
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,494
Anyway, it's so good to see you.

145
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,121
INSU: I'm glad you're back.

146
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,415
I've been waiting, Dr. Kang.

147
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,131
(hospital staff exclaiming, laughing)

148
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,925
Did you see
the trauma center on your way in?

149
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,344
INSU: It stands so tall and proud,
doesn't it?

150
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,388
You have to see the inside. Let's go.

151
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,182
-INSU: Come on.
-Do you want to see it now?

152
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,017
-MYEONGSIM: We'll take you.
-DOIL: Slow down.

153
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,060
-Okay.
-Dr. Kang must be so confused.

154
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,354
(in a cute voice)
What have you been up to lately?

155
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,440
-DOIL: How have you been?
-DONGJU: I've been well.

156
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,442
-INSU: Did you lose some weight?
-DONGJU: Come on.

157
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,944
-DOIL: He must've worked out a lot.
-I know, right?

158
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,071
-He looks great.
-I can tell from your accent.

159
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,073
-It does.
-Are you good at English now?

160
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,326
-What?
-INSU: Well, he looks great anyway.

161
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,536
-Yes.
-He was always known for his good looks.

162
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,872
SABU: How much did you think about doing
while coming here?

163
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,083
How far can I go here?

164
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,336
As far as you want to.

165
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,089
However, you can't go against the rules.

166
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,801
Then we'll start

167
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,221
by following the rules.

168
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,473
It's going to be tougher than you think.

169
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,892
You've come prepared, right?

170
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,436
You know I can take a punch.

171
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,440
(chuckles)

172
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,112
DONGJU: The teacher is still strange.

173
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,786
The people are still strange.

174
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,711
This hospital is still strange.

175
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,631
And…

176
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,426
I have returned to that place.

177
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,103
(soft music)

178
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,532
SURGEON KANG DONGJU

179
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,623
KANG DONGJU

180
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,457
That's my desk.

181
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,377
It used to be mine.

182
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,339
If you need a desk,
you can ask the administrative office.

183
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,549
Forget about the desk.

184
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,428
We've met, haven't we?

185
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,640
Yes, we have.

186
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,350
I'm surprised.

187
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,143
I didn't know I'd meet you here.

188
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,020
I know, right?

189
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,148
What happened to your hand?

190
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,819
I got hurt
when I went out to do disaster relief.

191
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,904
You should be careful.

192
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,782
The most important tool for a surgeon

193
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,283
is his hand, not his scalpel.

194
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,620
I'll handle

195
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,622
my own tools.

196
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,125
(snorts softly)

197
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,919
This will be fun.

198
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:11,796
You think so?

199
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,464
I'll see you around then.

200
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,303
-(upbeat music)
-(door closes)

201
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,764
(sighs)

202
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,768
(footsteps echo)

203
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,532
TRAUMA CENTER

204
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,513
(upbeat music)

205
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,564
VOLUME 13
THE PARROTBILL PARADOX

206
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,316
-(hopeful music)
-(engine revs)

207
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,847
FLOWERS

208
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,601
DONGHWA: Flowers.

209
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,936
It's always flowers!

210
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,314
DONGHWA: Flowers!
(laughs softly)

211
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,900
Don't you think that's a bit too much?

212
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,402
Wait.

213
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,740
Do you perhaps think what matters
is the heart and not a grand gesture?

214
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,451
In that case…

215
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,038
No, you're wrong.

216
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,414
You have to go big or go home.

217
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,502
Love without action is just being
plain lazy.

218
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,254
And what happens to lazy love?
It withers away quickly.

219
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,132
It can never last long.

220
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,218
(Donghwa chuckles)

221
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,888
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

222
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,139
You like Areum, don't you?

223
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,808
What…

224
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,101
Are you seriously asking me that
to my face?

225
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,728
You got me.

226
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,565
Don't people usually wish for
the other guy to fail in his relationship?

227
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,776
I did, really strongly.

228
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,403
"Please fight, drift apart, and break up."

229
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,280
(sighs)

230
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,408
But Dr. Areum wasn't that kind of person.

231
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,163
I only ever read
about such dedicated love in storybooks.

232
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,168
This is my first time seeing it in person.

233
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,756
It's fascinating,
but it also makes me jealous.

234
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,093
Don't mess this up.

235
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:08,097
Don't keep it to yourself.
Express how you feel, okay?

236
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,686
Flowers are the answer. Got it?

237
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,938
(Euntak sighs)

238
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,489
(Euntak sighs)

239
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,992
(door opens, closes)

240
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,004
What? What do you mean?

241
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,422
Kang Dongju is

242
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,924
the interim head of the trauma center?

243
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,510
Yes. That's what I heard.

244
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,891
Does that mean Dr. Kang is going to be
in charge of the Trauma Center?

245
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,184
That's probably what will happen.

246
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,061
(scoffs)

247
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,272
(exhales heavily)

248
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,984
The office is quite spacious.

249
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,615
We took great care
from the layout to the decorations.

250
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,950
(laughs)

251
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,494
GITAE: If you need anything,
let me know anytime.

252
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,247
I will take care of it
right away, Dr. Kang.

253
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,332
Right.

254
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
Or should I call you
the head of the trauma center?

255
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,879
I'm only the interim head for now.

256
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,882
Whether you're the interim head or not,

257
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,634
you're still in charge.

258
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,178
It'll soon become official, won't it?

259
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,221
The outcome is set in stone.

260
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,141
Dr. Kang Dongju,
the head of the trauma center.

261
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,770
Where is the medical office?

262
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,396
Gosh.

263
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,815
How does this make sense?

264
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,859
He came to the field
much later than I did.

265
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,778
How is he the interim head?

266
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,280
He's only two years your junior.

267
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,698
The difference isn't that large.

268
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,242
Still, this can't happen.
I'm still alive and kicking.

269
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,411
And are you the only one? I'm here too.

270
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,246
That's what I mean.

271
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,748
But they want us

272
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,750
to work under our junior.

273
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,754
This will mess up seniority
and the whole pecking order.

274
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,339
Is that okay with you?

275
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,799
Aren't you angry?

276
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,759
No. I'm fine.

277
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,511
Why should I be angry?

278
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:15,057
That punk, Kang Dongju, will do
as he pleases in the trauma center.

279
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,060
HOJUN: And we'll have to follow
the orders that he gives us.

280
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,687
Will you just sit back and watch that?

281
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,480
Won't you feel ashamed?

282
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,606
Well,

283
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,525
if that makes you feel ashamed,

284
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,860
you should've worked harder.

285
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,278
What?

286
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,239
While Kang Dongju went
all the way to the US

287
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,908
to study trauma cases
and build more experience,

288
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,245
how much effort have you put in, Dr. Yang?

289
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,288
Why are you being like this?

290
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,208
I've been pulling my weight at Doldam too.

291
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,793
No matter what position it is,

292
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,671
a leader can't just pull his own weight.

293
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,965
You have to be excellent, outstanding,

294
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,259
ahead of the others,

295
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,678
or work several times harder.

296
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,390
Shouldn't you at least
do one of those things?

297
00:16:59,059 --> 00:16:59,935
(clicks tongue)

298
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,396
It's always those who don't work hard

299
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,649
that care about
the pecking order and seniority,

300
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,068
and try to use that to their advantage.

301
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,321
(sighs deeply)

302
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,617
Dr. Cha, what's with the long face?

303
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,369
Do you have a complaint too?

304
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:18,871
Sorry?

305
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,374
No. It's not really a complaint, but…

306
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,128
Doctors, here you are.

307
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,799
Dr. Kang here wanted to see
the medical office, so we stopped by.

308
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,301
Welcome.

309
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,844
(exclaims)

310
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,180
It's nice in here.
(Dongju chuckles)

311
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,349
We put in a lot of thought
as we built this office too.

312
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,060
(laughs exaggeratedly)

313
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,729
Then I should just stay here
for the time being as well.

314
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,939
In the medical office?

315
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,693
But there's such a nice office
for the head of the trauma center.

316
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,446
I'm not officially
the head of the trauma center yet.

317
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,074
I'll just stay here for now.

318
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,077
I should get to know
the other doctors too.

319
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,953
DONGJU: This is more comfortable for me.

320
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,371
Is that okay?

321
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,874
Of course.
You're always welcome to join me.

322
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,713
It's fine with me too. Sure.
(chuckles awkwardly)

323
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,341
What's your name?

324
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,011
I'm Cha Eunjae, a CT surgeon.
I was a freshman in 2007.

325
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,305
I see. A CT surgeon.

326
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,934
(tense music)

327
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,645
It's been a while, Dr. Yang.

328
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,776
(groans loudly)

329
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,528
Hey.

330
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,530
INSU: Seriously, that punk.

331
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,865
(door slams shut)

332
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,284
(loud footsteps approaching)

333
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,753
(exclaims)
Why is Dr. Yang so angry?

334
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,714
What do you think is wrong?

335
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,717
Since there is
a new interim head of the trauma center,

336
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,512
everyone will need some time
to get used to each other.

337
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,100
Let's not mind them
and just do our jobs, Ms. Joo.

338
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,101
I see.

339
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,936
Okay.

340
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,024
INSU: Hey, don't mind him.

341
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,818
You know he can be quite sensitive.

342
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,945
(exhales loudly)

343
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,363
Which desk should I use?

344
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,949
Use one of the empty ones,
whichever is comfortable for you.

345
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,120
-Dr. Cha?
-Yes?

346
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,206
Can you ask the activation team
and the key staff to get together?

347
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,626
I have something to brief them
on the management of the trauma center.

348
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,504
Let's meet
in the meeting room in 30 minutes.

349
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,884
Yes, in the meeting room in 30 minutes.
I'll let everyone know.

350
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,470
I'll look around the rest
of the trauma center and meet you there.

351
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,763
Okay, see you later.

352
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,015
All right.

353
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,438
-(door closes)
-Kang Dongju, that guy.

354
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,564
He's already so passionate

355
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,816
when he only just got here.

356
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,068
This is awkward.

357
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,322
-Does he remember or not?
-Remember what?

358
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,452
Nothing. I'll see you
in the meeting room in 30 minutes.

359
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,707
Still, how can you bring in Kang Dongju?

360
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,792
All this time,
no matter how hard things were,

361
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,170
I haven't complained once
and endured it all.

362
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:17,007
But I just can't accept
this personnel appointment.

363
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,675
Him as the new head of the trauma center?

364
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,888
Don't you think Master Kim is wielding
his authority however he wants?

365
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,265
He already discussed this matter with me.

366
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,642
Pardon?

367
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,813
The budget officers will be barging in
here next week.

368
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,649
I think it's a relief

369
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,734
that he arrived ahead of schedule.

370
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,821
(inhales deeply)
Why? Is there a problem?

371
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,740
Of course there's a problem.

372
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,534
Who has been working
the hardest for the provincial budget?

373
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,787
It's you, Director Park.

374
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,791
HOJUN: And you'll appoint Master Kim's man
to become the head of the trauma center?

375
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,209
Does that make any sense?

376
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,129
Isn't Master Kim just trying
to start internal strife?

377
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,089
(slams hand)

378
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,009
I think you're the one
who's causing internal strife.

379
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,013
You should go
and review another case study

380
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,640
rather than waste time like this,

381
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,267
Dr. Yang.

382
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,772
Hey, do you think I'm acting like this
because a junior is outranking me?

383
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,732
It seems so.

384
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,401
-MUNJEONG: Wasn't that it?
-HOJUN: Hey!

385
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,987
Okay, to be honest,

386
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,571
if Woojin took that spot,

387
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,073
I'd totally accept it.

388
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,534
For the past three years,
he worked harder than anyone,

389
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,619
made an effort, and went through a lot.

390
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,371
And I watched the whole thing.

391
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,791
HOJUN: But this jerk, Kang Dongju?
He's a nobody from nowhere.

392
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:33,875
This smells nice.

393
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,669
MUNJEONG: He's not a nobody.

394
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,255
He was at Doldam before us.

395
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,049
I didn't see it myself. I can't accept it!

396
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,885
But it won't change anything

397
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,971
just because you can't accept it.

398
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,472
That's what I mean.

399
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,397
Woojin, can't you do something?

400
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,774
Master Kim listens to everything you say.

401
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,527
Does he? That's news to me.

402
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,613
You should step up
to shed some light on this issue

403
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,865
and express your opposition.

404
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,075
HOJUN: Wouldn't that make a difference?

405
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,579
I mean, you're the ace of Doldam.

406
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,165
But I don't work in Trauma Center.

407
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,750
It's not my place to step in.

408
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,753
Hey, are you really going to be like this?

409
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,464
You didn't get along
with Kang Dongju either.

410
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,674
MUNJEONG: Dr. Seo.

411
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,551
Do you know Kang Dongju?

412
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,137
They got into a big fight as residents.

413
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,098
I'll be going now.

414
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,310
Woojin. You can't just leave.

415
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,812
Hey, how will you oppose the situation?

416
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,147
Hey, Woojin!

417
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,079
CONSULTATION ROOM 2

418
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,925
-What are you doing?
-Goodness.

419
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,844
SABU: Are you looking for something?

420
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,890
No, I was just passing by.

421
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,475
Really?

422
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,564
Are you working hard
on your rehabilitation?

423
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,442
Of course. It's getting better.

424
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,568
(phone vibrates)

425
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,655
No. It's mine, not yours.

426
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,283
Goodness, there's an emergency patient.

427
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,870
-I'll go.
-It's my patient.

428
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,290
You can go inside and do your own thing.

429
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,292
Go inside.

430
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,388
-WOOJIN: Hey.
-(phone vibrates)

431
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,936
-What is the call about?
-It's from the ER.

432
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,188
(door opens)

433
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,398
(door closes)

434
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,115
I've looked over the records
of all the patients who were treated

435
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,910
at the trauma center for the past
two months of the simulation period.

436
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,872
A lot of the operations
were still inefficient,

437
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,666
and the distinction between
severe and emergency trauma patients

438
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,876
was still vague.

439
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,837
The paramedics are
still confused about that too.

440
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,922
And it is uncertain for us in some ways.

441
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,885
From now on, we won't accept
non-trauma patients at the Trauma Center.

442
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,013
(tense music)

443
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,139
How do we distinguish them?

444
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,265
We'll go by the rules.

445
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,478
We'll only accept patients
who meet the criteria set by KTDB,

446
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,647
with severe trauma,
multiple injuries, or heavy bleeding.

447
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,651
Won't that put too much pressure
on Doldam Hospital's emergency room?

448
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,821
I think we ought to help out
so they don't feel too burdened.

449
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,867
That's for Doldam Hospital to figure out.

450
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,119
DONGJU: We'll only think about
our own problems.

451
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,171
Until the system is stabilized,
Dr. Jung Insu and I will distinguish

452
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,757
which patients will be accepted
to the trauma center.

453
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,927
What? Okay, then.

454
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,972
DONGJU: Next, about the trauma bay.

455
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,391
SABU: Just go along

456
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,477
with what he wants to do.

457
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,604
But if we do as he says,

458
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,232
Doldam Hospital will have to
take on a lot more patients.

459
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,609
There will be more surgical patients too.

460
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,819
Even when we didn't have a trauma center,

461
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,155
we handled everything ourselves.

462
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,242
I just think
it might be too much of a burden on you.

463
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,578
And Dr. Seo's hand isn't
fully recovered yet.

464
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,707
I'll handle everything on my end.

465
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,087
I want all three of you to take
Kang Dongju's side no matter what.

466
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,800
Let's give him time
and watch what it is he wants to do.

467
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,510
SABU: Okay, Doil?

468
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,429
You too, Insu.

469
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,348
Yes, Master Kim.

470
00:25:58,932 --> 00:25:59,933
All right.

471
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,603
(siren wails)

472
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,941
PARAMEDIC: We have
a traffic accident patient!

473
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,611
-What are his vitals?
-PARAMEDIC: They're 110/75.

474
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,822
Heart rate is 100, RR is 22,

475
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,448
and saturation is 97%.

476
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,325
He had chest pains
before losing consciousness.

477
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,827
-To the trauma bay.
-Yes, Doctor.

478
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,579
INSU: Give me the sonogram.

479
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,788
Sir?

480
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,373
Sir?

481
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,666
Can you hear me?

482
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,751
INSU: Open your eyes. Sir?

483
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,504
Get the portable X-ray in here now!

484
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,757
(tense music)

485
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,634
Let's send this patient to Doldam.

486
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,137
He's a TA patient.
You still want to send him to Doldam's ER?

487
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,306
He doesn't have any trauma or bleeding.

488
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,349
They can handle fractures over there too.

489
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,144
He has an aortic dissection.

490
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,770
It's a descending one, not ascending.

491
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,690
And it's only an intimal tear,
so it won't be an emergency surgery.

492
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,025
What will you do here?

493
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,570
Will you do a TEVAR yourself?

494
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,363
TEVAR: THORACIC ENDOVASCULAR AORTIC REPAIR

495
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,241
(sighs)

496
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,327
AREUM: Can you try lifting your knee?

497
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,870
Where does it hurt?

498
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,039
-PATIENT 1: Here.
-I'll press on the part.

499
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,125
(patient 1 gasps, sucks teeth)

500
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,088
What about the flowers?

501
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,215
What happened?

502
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,385
-(door slams open)
-NURSE: We have a patient!

503
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,387
Just a second, ma'am.

504
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,472
Let's talk later.

505
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,142
-It's a dissection patient.
-To the hybrid OR.

506
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,898
(clicks tongue, sucks teeth)

507
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,316
He still hasn't bought them.

508
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:32,984
(tuts)

509
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,278
(phone vibrates)

510
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,156
(tense music)

511
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,957
PARAMEDIC: We have a patient.

512
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,209
INSU: What's her condition?

513
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,044
She was found after a fall while hiking.

514
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,504
PARAMEDIC: Her vitals are 120/80,

515
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,214
heart rate is 90, RR is 25,

516
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,965
and saturation is 98%.

517
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,550
It seems her right knee is fractured.

518
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,469
-Take her to the trauma bay.
-PARAMEDIC: Okay.

519
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,470
Hang on.

520
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,556
Ma'am, where does it hurt the most?

521
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,266
(whimpers)
Right here.

522
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,852
Let me take a look.

523
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,939
There's no swelling in the scalp.

524
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,400
GCS is a 15.

525
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,527
-Tell me if this hurts.
-PATIENT 2: Okay.

526
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,696
She doesn't have pain in her hips.

527
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,447
Send her to Doldam's ER.

528
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,615
What?

529
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,243
Let's move her to Doldam's ER.

530
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,626
EMERGENCY ROOM

531
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,711
(door opens)

532
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,839
INSU: Sir!

533
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,590
Sir?

534
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,634
Can you hear me?

535
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,719
What are his vitals?

536
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,514
BP is 100/60, 110. Saturation is 91,
and temperature is 34°C.

537
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,683
Drowning patients
without multiple injuries

538
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,435
aren't included in the KTDB.

539
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,353
Send him to Doldam's ER.

540
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,605
This patient too?

541
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,316
Let's move the patient
to Doldam's ER. Ms. Joo?

542
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,110
-(door opens)
-YEONGMI: We have a patient!

543
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,072
What do we have?

544
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,450
He fell into the water.
He went into cardiac arrest once.

545
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,618
He's still unconscious.
His temperature is 34°C.

546
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,953
Take him to the hybrid OR now.

547
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,247
Nurse Euntak.

548
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,459
-Yes, coming.
-MUNJEONG: I'll take this.

549
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,127
You're okay. I'm almost done.

550
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,463
-MUNJEONG: Just one more.
-Over here. Let's get a CT scan.

551
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,714
HYEONJEONG: Dr. Yoon.

552
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,923
AREUM: I'm coming.

553
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:23,887
One, two, three.

554
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,936
(phone vibrates)

555
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,130
Are you leaving me out on purpose?

556
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,925
Did you catch on?

557
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:02,926
Master Kim.

558
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,012
Dr. Bae.

559
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,056
-Come here.
-Yes, Master Kim.

560
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,601
-Yes?
-What's your opinion as his doctor?

561
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,230
He still needs further rehabilitation.

562
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,023
That's right. You heard him, didn't you?

563
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,486
Just focus on your rehabilitation for now.

564
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,906
NURSES STATION

565
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,408
Yes, you should. Stop getting so anxious.

566
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,246
(uneasy music)

567
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,413
Let's see.

568
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,626
-(sighs)
-(siren wails)

569
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,630
PARAMEDIC: We have a patient!

570
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,132
-INSU: What are his vitals?
-BP is 120/80. Heart rate 90.

571
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,635
Patients with stable vitals
and below knee and elbow injuries

572
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,761
will go to Doldam's ER.

573
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,430
Yes, tell them we'll take them.

574
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,976
There's a patient coming in
who lost consciousness in a freezer.

575
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,936
Hypothermia patients
without associated injuries,

576
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,355
superficial frostbite patients,
or first-degree burn victims

577
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,773
will be sent to Doldam's ER.

578
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,899
Hello?

579
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,694
You'll have to go to Doldam's ER.

580
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,154
-Yes, take them.
-(patient 3 groans)

581
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,990
To Doldam's ER.

582
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,658
Have them sent here.

583
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,494
To Doldam's ER.

584
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,496
Okay, have them sent here.

585
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,331
All right, tell them to come here.

586
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,457
Have all of them sent here.

587
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,586
Say that we'll take them all.
Have them sent here.

588
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,089
To Doldam's ER.

589
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,132
PARAMEDIC: Yes, Doctor.

590
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,103
DOIL: Master Kim said
it would be like this.

591
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,688
Still, it has been three days.

592
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,150
We haven't taken in
any patients for three days.

593
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,443
This isn't normal.

594
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,070
Don't you know Kang Dongju?

595
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,990
He's never one to act without a plan.

596
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,034
I'm sure he has his reasons.

597
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,245
That's why Master Kim said
we should keep watching him.

598
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,415
The problem is that
the other doctors don't see it that way.

599
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,793
Everyone feels uncomfortable
with Dr. Kang's methods.

600
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,337
The complaints are piling up too.

601
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,632
Master Kim also expected that.

602
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,216
(sighs)

603
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,969
I hear the Doldam ER

604
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,347
is having a tough time too.

605
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,350
Hey! I was the one who nursed Mom

606
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,143
for three years before she passed away!

607
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,646
PATIENT 3: That's all you can say,
isn't it?

608
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,899
I lived with Mom for ten years!

609
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,902
Hey, you punk.
Mom was nice enough to take you in.

610
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,278
You didn't take care of her!

611
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,780
Hang on.

612
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,825
Anyway, I have a right to that house too!

613
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:37,205
Gosh, it looks like Mom raised a thief!

614
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,082
Be quiet. This is a hospital!

615
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,416
Who are you calling a thief?

616
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,293
-PATIENT 4: Be quiet!
-PATIENT 3: Why should I?

617
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,544
Sir?

618
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,421
Fortunately, your head looks fine.

619
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,299
Is anything else wrong besides nausea?

620
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:53,721
I don't have sensations in my legs,
so I can't walk.

621
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,139
Did you fall during the fight?

622
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,350
I did bump into the edge of the staircase.

623
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,979
PATIENT 3: But I've been losing sensation
in my legs since before that.

624
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,063
AREUM: Let me take a look.

625
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,691
(suspenseful music)

626
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,574
Do you have high blood pressure, diabetes,
or any other illnesses or allergies?

627
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,036
I had surgery for
second-stage colon cancer last year.

628
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,748
And I've been taking
blood pressure medicine for the past year.

629
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,502
It would be weird if your blood pressure
was normal with that temper of yours!

630
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,255
Please be quiet, sir.
I'm trying to treat you!

631
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,965
Ms. Eom.

632
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,883
Have Dr. Lee Seonung look at this patient.

633
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:31,968
Yes, Doctor.

634
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,636
-Dr. Ung!
-SEONUNG: Yes.

635
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,557
-PATIENT 4: What did you say?
-PATIENT 3: Just sit down.

636
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,516
Just sit back down.

637
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,351
-Sir, please stop!
-PATIENT 3: Take him away.

638
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,354
-PATIENT 4: Don't be such a baby.
-PATIENT 3: You should have him arrested.

639
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,898
-He's out of his mind.
-Nurse Euntak, what about the flowers?

640
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,067
Still no flowers today?

641
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,113
I don't think this is the right time
to be talking about that.

642
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,199
-HYEONJEONG: Dr. Dong!
-Yes, coming.

643
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,958
-Close the curtains.
-Okay.

644
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,627
-It might be an embolism. We'll need a CT.
-Okay.

645
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,381
SEONUNG: How long
has your leg been like this?

646
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,599
PARAMEDIC: We have a patient!

647
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,808
PATIENT 5: It hurts!

648
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,227
-It hurts!
-AREUM: Sir, how does it hurt?

649
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,063
-Stop that!
-He's crazy!

650
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,065
-WOMAN: How could you do this?
-(people clamoring)

651
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,524
NURSE: Coming through!

652
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,151
WOMAN: You did this when you were drunk.

653
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,278
-Stop that.
-You shouldn't even treat him.

654
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,446
-Doctor.
-No, stop it.

655
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,782
Don't bother treating him, Doctor.

656
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,873
(sighs)
Ms. Oh.

657
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,166
Yes?

658
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,419
Can we really do this?

659
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,171
What do you mean?

660
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,547
We have so much…

661
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,009
free time.

662
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,678
Goodness. Dr. Cha.

663
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,180
You're right.

664
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,475
We did have a sudden decrease in customers

665
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,268
for the past few days.

666
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,353
Dr. Jung.

667
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,064
See? The jinx is gone.
The phone won't even ring.

668
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,107
Dr. Cha!

669
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,401
I wish the phone would ring.

670
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,694
Dr. Jung!

671
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,822
YEONGMI: It's hard
when there's a lot of work,

672
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,950
but it's also very hard
when there's no work to do.

673
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:24,122
They say you keep
learning new things until your life ends.

674
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,666
I never thought I'd suffer
from not having any work.

675
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,085
Gosh, how amazing.

676
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,337
Ms. Joo.

677
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,256
-(groans)
-(phone vibrates)

678
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,260
DR. LEE SEONUNG

679
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,804
Dr. Lee. What's up?

680
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,097
Dr. Cha.

681
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,725
There's a patient with an embolism.

682
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,311
He had surgery last year
for second-stage colon cancer.

683
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,855
We got a CT scan,

684
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,817
and I think his abdominal aorta
is blocked by a blood clot.

685
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,945
SEONUNG: He says he has
no sensation in his lower body.

686
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,822
EUNJAE: How long has it been?

687
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,324
Since this morning.
I just uploaded the CT scans.

688
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,664
(Eunjae sighs)

689
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,584
EUNJAE: There was an adhesion
in the abdominal aorta.

690
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,252
And the blood clot got stuck there.

691
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,422
Where's Master Kim?

692
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,300
SEONUNG: He's now performing a discectomy.

693
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,469
I think he'll be gone
for another two or three hours.

694
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,265
SEONUNG: What do I do?

695
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,810
The patient's leg is turning purple.

696
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,190
EUNJAE: Wait a second.

697
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,486
Doctor!

698
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,074
I just got a call from Doldam's ER.

699
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,492
There's an embolism patient.

700
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,745
It seems like
an acute abdominal aortic occlusion.

701
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,205
Did you report this to Master Kim?

702
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,165
He's in surgery
for a discectomy right now.

703
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,250
EUNJAE: It will take about two hours.

704
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,086
Can't we take that patient
and do the surgery?

705
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,339
Isn't there another CT surgeon at Doldam?

706
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,091
He's only a first-year fellow,
so he can't lead the surgery yet.

707
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,054
Report it to Master Kim first.
He will handle it himself.

708
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,223
Don't you think you're being too much?

709
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,101
(tense music)

710
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,020
Since you joined us,

711
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:14,398
there hasn't been a single surgery
in the trauma center for three days.

712
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,652
You sent all the patients
over to Doldam's ER.

713
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,988
Those patients were mistakenly sent here
instead of Doldam's ER.

714
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,657
I just sent them where they should go.

715
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,450
Is something wrong?

716
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,911
You're not accepting patients
who are in critical situations.

717
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,164
Don't you know trauma doctors aren't
allowed to handle non-trauma cases?

718
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,543
But I'm the only CT surgeon who can
do that surgery besides Master Kim!

719
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,130
Am I not allowed to do it despite that?
You don't want me to do anything?

720
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,507
That's right. Don't do anything.

721
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,716
Dr. Kang!

722
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,177
Don't do anything
other than report it to Master Kim.

723
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,513
I made myself clear.

724
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,523
(scoffs)

725
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,734
(phone vibrates)

726
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,029
Dr. Lee.

727
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,197
Dr. Cha.

728
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,659
The patient was losing consciousness,
so I moved him into the hybrid OR.

729
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:10,329
-(machine beeping)
-(tense music)

730
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,956
Dr. Ung! He's in cardiac arrest!

731
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,543
-EUNTAK: Help me out here.
-NURSE 3: Okay.

732
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,798
What should I do?
Should I tell Master Kim?

733
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,261
Resuscitate the patient
and move him to the OR.

734
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,138
I'll be right there.

735
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,521
Dr. Cha.

736
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,690
Where are you going?

737
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,275
INSU: Hey.

738
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,694
What's going on?

739
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,072
(sighs deeply)

740
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,203
(grunts)

741
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,914
(grunts)

742
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,833
(sighs)

743
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,752
-(clattering)
-(sighs)

744
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:01,922
(Woojin grunts)

745
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,176
(breathes heavily)

746
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,098
(Woojin grunts)

747
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,066
(grunts)

748
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,572
(Woojin exhales)

749
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,456
SEONUNG: They started anesthesia.

750
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,541
-EUNJAE: Okay.
-(phone vibrates)

751
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,044
DR. JUNG INSU

752
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,516
Is she not answering?

753
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:55,976
No, she's not.

754
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,105
-(sighs)
-(phone rings)

755
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,153
Doldam Hospital Trauma Center.

756
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,909
There was a three-car pileup
in a nearby tunnel.

757
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,162
(tense music)

758
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,542
(machines beeping in the background)

759
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,043
EUNJAE: Can we begin surgery?

760
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,837
DR. YANG: Yes, you may begin.

761
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:24,630
EUNJAE: Scalpel.

762
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,647
(phone vibrates)

763
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,692
(nurse gasps)

764
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,068
NURSE: Dr. Cha.

765
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,945
It's Ms. Joo in the trauma center.

766
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,239
Patients are headed
to the trauma center now.

767
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:51,907
EUNJAE: What?

768
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,203
(Eunjae gasps)

769
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,919
The patients are
the driver of a cargo truck,

770
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,046
the driver
and his teenage daughter in a van,

771
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,965
and a family of three in a sedan.

772
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,341
That's a total of six patients.

773
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:10,843
Dr. Kang!

774
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,097
For severe cases,
one has an abdominal injury with a low BP

775
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,308
and one with multiple injuries
to the chest and abdomen.

776
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,602
And there's a child
with a seatbelt injury.

777
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,687
INSU: There's muscle guarding
in the abdomen.

778
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,230
What should we do?

779
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,235
NURSE 5: It's Dr. Kang Dongju
from the Trauma Center.

780
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,988
SABU: Hey, what's going on?

781
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,617
DONGJU: We're getting patients
from a three-car pileup right now.

782
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,660
We'll take the two severe trauma patients,

783
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,621
and the other four will go to the ER.

784
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,749
There's a child
with a possible seatbelt injury as well.

785
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,709
Can you cover that?

786
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,129
SABU: Dr. Kang, do you have experience
with child trauma patients?

787
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,339
Yes, I do.

788
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,967
SABU: Then you should cover that one.

789
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,886
I still have a way to go
with this surgery.

790
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,472
Yes, got it.

791
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,435
We'll take the torso injury patients
and the child trauma patient only.

792
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,312
You'll take the child trauma patient?

793
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,981
Why not just send that one to Master Kim?

794
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,484
He said we should take it
since his surgery will take a while.

795
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,613
Let's activate the medical staff first.

796
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,532
I already called the activation team.

797
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,575
But, the thing is…

798
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,081
MUNJEONG: Why did you tell him that?

799
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,749
We're almost done here.

800
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,921
SABU: He meant that he wanted to try
treating a child trauma patient.

801
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,798
I should let him do so.

802
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,841
(Munjeong chuckles softly)

803
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,386
MUNJEONG: Is that what that meant?

804
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,804
(Munjeong laughs)

805
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,432
How can you read
between the lines so well?

806
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,896
SABU: Once you know the person,
you can see his intention.

807
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,233
Once you see his intention,
you can read between the lines too.

808
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,110
Cut.

809
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,320
MUNJEONG: Cut.

810
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,407
SABU: Right, then I'll step out here.

811
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,867
I'll leave you to take care
of the orthopedic part.

812
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,078
-MUNJEONG: Good work, Master Kim.
-SABU: Thanks.

813
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,790
MUNJEONG: Let's insert the screws.

814
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,675
(uneasy music)

815
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,020
What do you mean
Dr. Cha went into surgery?

816
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,315
I guess the patient in the ER was
in critical condition.

817
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,150
Master Kim was in surgery,

818
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,027
so I think she had no choice but to go in.

819
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,154
(sighs)

820
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,822
DONGJU: Oh.

821
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,158
The ambulance is arriving in four minutes.

822
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,413
(sighs)

823
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,839
(tense music)

824
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,641
EUNJAE (sighing): The adhesion is
pretty bad. Metz, please.

825
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,898
Ms. An, let me know
how things are going at the trauma center.

826
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,399
MS. AN: Yes, Doctor.

827
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,248
I can't believe that kid.

828
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,173
Dr. Yoon.

829
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:37,966
Yes?

830
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,679
Cha Eunjae is in the OR. What happened?

831
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:42,846
SABU: Did someone call her?

832
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,432
AREUM: Well, it was a patient
with an embolism.

833
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,477
Dr. Ung called her since it was
an acute abdominal aortic occlusion.

834
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,853
It was Dr. Ung?

835
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,816
You should've reported that to me first.

836
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,611
I think he did so because he thought
your surgery would take a little longer.

837
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,072
My goodness.

838
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,159
Master Kim, patients are coming in
from a three-car pileup now.

839
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,452
HYEONJEONG: Two severe patients

840
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,204
and one child will go
to the trauma center.

841
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,623
The other patients with minor injuries are
on their way here.

842
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:14,169
If the child patient goes
to Trauma Center as well,

843
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,381
Kang Dongju won't be able
to handle it on his own.

844
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,551
SABU: Ms. Eom.

845
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,846
Can you check how much longer
Cha Eunjae's surgery will take?

846
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,639
-Yes, Master Kim.
-SABU: Okay.

847
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,932
(sirens wailing)

848
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,142
Start 200 ml of fluids.

849
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,101
NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

850
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,644
PARAMEDIC: We have a patient!

851
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,231
Hurry. To the hybrid OR.

852
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,566
AREUM: To the hybrid OR, please.

853
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,984
-Dr. Jang.
-Yes?

854
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,610
-SABU: Come here.
-Yes, Master Kim.

855
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,320
-What do we have?
-It's a laceration.

856
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,572
This way.

857
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,871
Over here.

858
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,833
PARAMEDIC: Let's move the patient.
In one, two, three.

859
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,087
Removing the gurney. In one, two, three.

860
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,716
He's in his sixties.
He was driving the cargo truck.

861
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,676
PARAMEDIC: His vitals are 60/30,
heart rate 150.

862
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,804
He went into cardiac arrest on the way,
but we managed to bring him back.

863
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,014
Get blood and norepinephrine.

864
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,640
Call for a trauma series.

865
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,267
Let's have a FAST too.

866
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,351
This way.

867
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,689
Let's move the patient.

868
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,441
-In one, two, three.
-In one, two, three.

869
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,903
-In one, two, three.
-In one, two, three.

870
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,115
PARAMEDIC: This is the sedan driver.

871
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,992
Vitals are 90/50, heart rate 120.

872
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,869
He was found in the driver's seat

873
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,288
and was unconscious when we got there.
The airbag did go off,

874
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,040
but the driver's side
was severely crushed.

875
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,750
We had a hard time getting him out.

876
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,376
Start two lines and an MTP.

877
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,377
Yes, Doctor.

878
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,546
DONGJU: Give me two ampoules of calcium
and tranexamic acid.

879
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,341
Dr. Kang, the child patient is here.
What should we do?

880
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,554
Let's move her to the observation area.

881
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:48,972
Yes, Doctor.

882
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,560
Where is my daughter?

883
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,729
What about my husband?

884
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,439
She was in the passenger seat.

885
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,775
PARAMEDIC: She has many lacerations
from the broken window.

886
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,402
It seems her clavicle is broken,
so we put her in an arm sling.

887
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,822
What happened to my daughter?
(cries)

888
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,366
Why wasn't she brought
to the same hospital as me?

889
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,993
Is she badly hurt?

890
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,454
Nothing bad happened to her, right?

891
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,624
Don't worry. If something happens,
I'll let you know right away.

892
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,877
Nurse, let's get an X-ray and CT for her.

893
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,338
-Call Dr. Ortho once he's done in the OR.
-Yes, Doctor.

894
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,589
PATIENT 6: Over here.

895
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,675
Yes, how can I help?

896
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,886
The car in front of me
suddenly slammed on the brakes.

897
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,721
How could I keep myself from crashing?

898
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,432
This is purely the other car's fault.

899
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,685
PATIENT 6: I did nothing wrong, got it?

900
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,771
You'll see once you look
at the dashcam footage, right?

901
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:42,025
Yes, you can tell the police
or your insurance provider about that.

902
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,694
Can I borrow your penlight?

903
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,238
-You hit your head, right?
-PATIENT 6: Yes.

904
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,031
SABU: Look at this light.

905
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,367
I told you to look at the light.

906
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,996
Do you feel like
you might vomit or feel dizzy?

907
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,331
No, I'm fine.

908
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,126
I have a hard head.

909
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,295
It doesn't crack that easily.

910
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,922
There's a reason
why my nickname is Doctor Hardhead.

911
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,173
Goodness.

912
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,218
(retches)

913
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,012
Here you go.

914
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:13,348
(patient vomits loudly)

915
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,603
Dr. Jang, once he's done vomiting,
take him in for a head CT.

916
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,271
-Yes, Master Kim.
-A head CT?

917
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,149
Doesn't that cost a lot?

918
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,484
You were in a car accident.

919
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,404
It'll be covered by your insurance.
Don't worry.

920
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,405
Okay.

921
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,658
(retching)

922
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,875
Let me take a look.

923
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,721
Ma'am, please wait here for a bit.

924
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,223
The doctors will be with you
after they finish with the others.

925
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,642
Okay.

926
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,604
You don't look so great.

927
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,064
Do you feel any pain?

928
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,858
No, it's just my stomach.

929
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,068
Was it from the car accident?

930
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,362
No, it's not that.

931
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,447
I just have period cramps.

932
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,824
Oh, I see.

933
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,576
Uh…

934
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:15,994
Just a second.

935
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,789
ADMISSION DESK

936
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,751
(labored breathing)

937
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,712
Hold this to your stomach.

938
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,797
It'll feel better.

939
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,382
Thank you.

940
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,060
(gasping breath)

941
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,775
INSU: This patient has
a massive hemoperitoneum.

942
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,443
The liver injury seems really bad.

943
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,570
This one is pretty bad too.

944
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,822
DONGJU: He has a rib fracture,

945
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,865
flail chest, and a bad heart sound.

946
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,450
What are the patient's vitals?

947
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,036
It's 100/60, with a heart rate of 110
and a saturation of 90.

948
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,246
(sighs)

949
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,791
Dr. Kang, we moved
the child trauma patient to observation.

950
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:05,168
Her vitals are 75/40,
and heart rate is 130.

951
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,587
But the kid seems lethargic.

952
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,839
(sighs)

953
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,020
Let's get a CT for this patient first.

954
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,104
Yes, Doctor.

955
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,481
DONGJU: Insu.

956
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,400
I'll take this patient.

957
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,694
You go to the observation area
and check on the child.

958
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,112
Will you be okay on your own?

959
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,740
The child is our priority. Please go.

960
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,575
Okay.

961
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,495
Is the anesthetist not here yet?

962
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,581
-Ah--
-I'm here now.

963
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,585
DONGJU: It's a massive hemoperitoneum
from a liver injury.

964
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,503
We're not sure about any other injuries.

965
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,673
He's in impending arrest, so I'll block
the aorta for damage control.

966
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,134
I'll do a crash laparotomy,
pack him, and stop the bleeders.

967
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,928
Then see if he needs anything else
in the second look surgery.

968
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,513
Will you be okay on your own?

969
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,016
I'll have to try. It's just me now.

970
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,771
Why not ask Doldam for backup instead?

971
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,898
DOIL: There's the patient
who just went in for a CT,

972
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,441
this hemoperitoneum patient,

973
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,860
and even a child trauma patient.

974
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,196
You can't handle all of this on your own.

975
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,826
I'll block off the aorta
with a REBOA first.

976
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,454
Get the REBOA ready.

977
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,580
Yes, Doctor.

978
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,588
Should I call Master Kim?

979
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,967
No, if we have to call Master Kim,
Dr. Kang will do it himself.

980
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,221
Still, Dr. Kang can't handle
three trauma patients on his own.

981
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,848
(sighs)

982
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,061
(dramatic music)

983
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,588
I'll follow along.

984
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,465
Are we doing REBOA first?

985
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,844
DONGJU: With three fingers?

986
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,428
The left hand only helps.

987
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,682
I still have a talented right hand.

988
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,023
DONGJU: Ms. Oh, make the preparations.

989
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,152
(upbeat music)

990
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,786
Short guide wire.

991
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,256
Scalpel.

992
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,220
Sheath.

993
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:08,935
Syringe, 10 cc.

994
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,274
Long guide wire.

995
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:28,496
WOOJIN: Got it.

996
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,332
DONGJU: Stiff wire.

997
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,423
Syringe, 20 cc.

998
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,052
Suture.

999
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,437
DOIL: Systolic BP is up to 100.

1000
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:55,982
-DONGJU: Cut.
-WOOJIN: Cut.

1001
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,028
DONGJU: Let's open the abdomen now.
Scalpel.

1002
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,029
WOOJIN: Gauze.

1003
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,202
DONGJU: Mayo.

1004
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,208
Richardson.

1005
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,753
(Dongju grunts)

1006
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,713
WOOJIN: I need lots of gauze.

1007
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,133
DONGJU: Gauze.

1008
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,221
DONGJU: Okay.

1009
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,728
Right angle.

1010
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:38,900
Nylon tape.

1011
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,402
WOOJIN: Ms. Joo.

1012
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,405
DONGJU: That's it.

1013
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,830
Vascular tourniquet.

1014
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,962
Curved mosquito.

1015
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,343
-DONGJU: Got it.
-(machine beeping)

1016
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,429
DOIL: The patient's vitals are dropping.

1017
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,728
DONGJU: It's a retro-hepatic IVC injury.

1018
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,731
Gauze.

1019
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,483
-WOOJIN: I need more.
-DONGJU: Keep them coming.

1020
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,572
This side.

1021
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,240
All right. Now the opposite side.

1022
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,704
DONGJU: Hang on.

1023
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,248
I'll have to look at the mesentery.

1024
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:39,878
DONGJU: Vascular clamp.

1025
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,632
DONGJU: One more.

1026
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,304
DONGJU: Suture.

1027
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:51,931
Forceps.

1028
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,231
-DONGJU: Cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

1029
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,171
DONGJU: Cut.

1030
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,257
Suture.

1031
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,302
DOIL: Ten more FFPs.

1032
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,309
DONGJU: Cut.

1033
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,022
Irrigation.

1034
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,858
Warm saline. Give me more.

1035
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,364
DONGJU: There.

1036
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,078
(machine beeps frantically)

1037
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,788
DOIL: He's in cardiac arrest!

1038
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,956
Push epi.

1039
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,376
WOOJIN: Give me a footstool.

1040
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,006
(Woojin grunts)

1041
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,471
DONGJU: Let's do Transdiaphragmatic
Open Cardiac Massage. Kelly!

1042
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:19,894
Mayo.

1043
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,814
DOIL: Push one more of epi.

1044
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,232
DONGJU: Hang on.

1045
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,362
(Dongju grunts, pants)

1046
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,283
WOOJIN: I'll do a complete occlusion
of the REBOA.

1047
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,046
EUNJAE: How are things going
in the trauma center?

1048
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,174
MS. AN: Dr. Seo Woojin went over there.

1049
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:52,260
He's doing damage control
with Dr. Kang Dongju.

1050
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,595
EUNJAE: Seo Woojin?

1051
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,556
And the patient
with the thoracoabdominal bleed?

1052
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,224
MS. AN: They're waiting
for the CT results.

1053
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,977
EUNJAE: Tell them to send
the CT results here too.

1054
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,020
MS. AN: Yes, Doctor.

1055
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,188
EUNJAE: Dr. Lee, hold this.

1056
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,816
It'll tear if you pull too hard.

1057
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,359
Loosen up.

1058
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,945
-Is the graft ready?
-EUNTAK: It's ready.

1059
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:13,239
EUNJAE: What are you doing, Dr. Lee?

1060
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,324
SEONUNG: Right.

1061
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,620
EUNJAE: You need to hold the graft.

1062
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,582
-EUNTAK: Dr. Cha.
-EUNJAE: Hang on, Nurse Euntak.

1063
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,417
EUNTAK: Dr. Cha.

1064
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:27,003
Take a breath, okay?

1065
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,094
(Eunjae exhales deeply)

1066
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,396
EUNJAE: Scalpel blade no. 12.

1067
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,369
(Eunjae murmuring)

1068
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,343
Irrigation.

1070
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:24,852

KANG DONGJU

1074
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,625
DONGJU: Promise me one thing.

1075
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:48,710
Mm?

1076
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,296
As long as you put me in charge,

1077
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,007
please trust me until the very end.

1078
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,217
DONGJU: If I need help,

1079
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,303
I'll ask you for it.

1080
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,345
But in the meantime,

1081
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,265
please just trust me.

1082
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,606
KANG DONGJU

1083
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:13,985

-(Dongju pants)
-(machine flatlining)

1085
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,203
DONGJU: Let's check the rhythm.

1086
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:30,752
DOIL: There's no pulse.

1087
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,963
(Dongju pants)

1088
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,182
DONGJU: Let's check the rhythm.

1089
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:51,939
DOIL: Nothing.

1090
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,400
(Dongju continues panting)

1091
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,284
INSU: The child patient keeps
losing consciousness.

1092
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,621
The CT shows a bleeder in the spleen.
What should I do?

1093
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,040
(Dongju continues panting)

1094
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,471
SABU: But you should promise me
one thing too.

1095
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,973
Don't overwork yourself

1096
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,476
for your own drive and performance. Okay?

1097
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,896
(Dongju continues panting)

1098
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:35,775
MYEONGSIM: Dr. Kang.

1099
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,361
-(Dongju continues panting)
-(machine continues flatlining)

1100
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,670
DONGJU: Time of death, 3:38 p.m.

1101
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,467
The patient is deceased.

1102
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:07,265
(sighs)

1103
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,391
(Doil sighs)

1104
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,359
NURSE: The CT results for
the thoracoabdominal injury are up.

1105
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,539
WOOJIN: The liver and spleen are damaged.

1106
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:34,041
There are six flail segments in the ribs.

1107
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,961
The top two seem
to be puncturing the lungs.

1108
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,755
We'll have to call in a CT surgeon.

1109
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,882
Should I call Master Kim?

1110
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,802
Can you get Dr. Cha Eunjae on the line?

1111
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:45,928
NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

1112
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:47,847
(line beeps)

1113
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,354
DONGJU: Dr. Cha.

1114
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,441
EUNJAE: Yes, I'm listening.

1115
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,485
The trauma patient
from the traffic accident

1116
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,488
is bleeding in the lungs
because of a rib fracture. What'll you do?

1117
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:07,450
DONGJU: Dr. Cha.

1118
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,869
Don't you work for the trauma center?

1119
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,581
A patient who needs a CT surgeon
is lying in the trauma center right now.

1120
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,750
DONGJU: It's a flail chest
with a damaged lung.

1121
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,918
I'm asking what you will do.

1122
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,297
(Eunjae sighs)

1123
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:22,965
DONGJU: Dr. Cha.

1124
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,884
Aren't you going to answer me?

1125
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,429
EUNJAE: I'm sorry.

1126
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:31,182
I'm doing an aorto-biiliac bypass now.

1127
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:32,850
That's why I told you.

1128
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,936
A member of the trauma center
is not allowed to treat

1129
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,229
or operate on non-trauma cases!

1130
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,570
Cha Eunjae, don't let it get to you.

1131
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:48,407
WOOJIN: According to the CT,
the worst of the bleeding is by the liver.

1132
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,076
WOOJIN: I'll take care of that for now.

1133
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,328
You can finish up
your surgery and come over.

1134
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,664
Focus on the patient in front of you now.

1135
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:57,041
-WOOJIN: Got it?
-(Eunjae exhales)

1136
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,125
WOOJIN: Over and out.

1137
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,795
What are you doing?

1138
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,713
And what do you think you're doing?

1139
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,590
Didn't you hear me scolding Cha Eunjae?

1140
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,259
Are you scolding her for saving a life?

1141
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,636
Yes, in this situation,
she should be scolded.

1142
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,931
She has no common sense
as a trauma surgeon.

1143
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,517
DONGJU: She forgot her duties
and broke the rules as she pleased!

1144
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,894
She put the patients
in the trauma center in danger.

1145
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:18,980
She's saving a life?

1146
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,857
Does it look like
she's saving lives here right now?

1147
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,233
Rules or whatever,

1148
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,279
we're just doing
what Master Kim taught us to do.

1149
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,321
Hey.

1150
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,115
Why are you guys doing this?

1151
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,199
INSU: Dongju.

1152
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,701
Woojin.

1153
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:35,246
DOIL: You two shouldn't be arguing
right now.

1154
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,164
We need to get ready for surgery.

1155
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,374
Dr. Seo Woojin.

1156
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,460
Do you know why the parrotbill dies
while chasing the stork?

1157
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,796
It's not because
it can't keep up with the strides.

1158
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:48,259
It's because the parrotbill loses its way
while hurrying to chase the stork.

1159
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:49,719
The moment it loses its way,

1160
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,721
everything is over.

1161
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:54,807
What do you mean?

1162
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:58,394
The only person who can be like Master Kim
is Master Kim himself.

1163
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:02,064
Don't hurry after him,
trying to keep up with his pace.

1164
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,152
You might lose something else
and not just your hand next time.

1165
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,199
-DONGJU: Insu.
-Yes?

1166
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,620
Move the child trauma patient
to Doldam Hospital.

1167
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,165
I'll go into the OR
for the thoracoabdominal injury patient.

1168
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:39,143
DONGJU: Do you know what?

1169
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:43,189
You might represent
what our approach should be,

1170
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:45,483
but you cannot be our goal.

1171
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,653
If you do,

1172
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,197
we will never be able to succeed.

1173
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,493
(soft music)

1174
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,304
(sobbing)

1175
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,142
What do I do?

1176
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:24,188
SURGERY CONSENT FORM

1177
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:27,650
(sobbing continues)

1178
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,754
(tense music)

1179
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:04,812

01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,114
(cries)

1181
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:22,955
EUNJAE: Is there any bleeding?

1182
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,331
SEONUNG: No, there isn't any.

1183
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:25,708
EUNTAK: It looks good.

1184
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,836
EUNJAE: Dr. Lee, you should close up.

1185
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,921
SEONUNG: Yes, Dr. Cha. Don't worry.

1186
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,590
-EUNJAE: Nurse Euntak.
-EUNTAK: Go ahead.

1187
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,843

DOIL: The patient is stable.

1191
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,642

OPERATING ROOM 1, OPERATING ROOM 2

1194
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,918
Why do you think she's mad?

1195
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,837
Why do you think he doesn't know that?

1196
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:57,925
I must've done something wrong, right?

1197
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,803
If I said that I was upset,

1198
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:02,847
he should understand.

1199
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,725
I thought it would be
more comfortable as we were closer.

1200
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,813
But I'm only getting more and more upset.

1201
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,273
What do I do

1202
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:14,233
in times like these?

1203
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:18,821
I'm just asking him
to understand how I feel.

1204
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,323
That's really all there is.

1205
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,117
I really have no idea.

1206
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:26,287
How can he not know that?

1207
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:31,458
Did you perhaps

1208
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:33,919
forget about an anniversary?

1209
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:38,591
-No.
-Then her birthday?

1210
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,801
I was thinking of that too.

1211
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:43,971
Areum's birthday is in February.

1212
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:45,806
(Hyeonjeong groans)

1213
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,058
Don't feel too bad, Areum.

1214
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:51,687
Goodness, you look so gaunt.

1215
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:54,106
I didn't think
Nurse Euntak would be like that.

1216
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,443
How could he
not even talk to you for days?

1217
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:00,070
Nurse Euntak might seem nice,

1218
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:02,364
but he can be quite callous.

1219
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,618
Areum, you're going through
so much in your difficult relationship.

1220
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,161
You poor thing!

1221
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,246
You must be so stressed out.

1222
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,374
In times like these,
you should just tell him to break up.

1223
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,712
Then he'll suddenly come to his senses.

1224
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,922
(slams hand)

1225
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:21,091
Let's talk about this
in detail after work.

1226
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:23,219
Soonyoung's Restaurant? How about it?

1227
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,179
Count me in.

1228
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:26,931
HYEONJEONG: Count me in.

1229
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,725
EUNJAE: You can't tell a book
by its cover.

1230
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:31,268
YEONGMI: He has to say how he feels.

1231
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,187
-Right?
-Has Areum been talking less lately?

1232
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,146
HYEONJEONG: No.

1233
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:36,398
Then how come he hasn't spoken to her?

1234
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,319
-This is hard.
-I know.

1235
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:45,032
Come on. Flowers are the answer.

1236
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,077
Flowers? As if.

1237
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,829
Are you really that clueless
about what women want?

1238
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,790
DONGHWA: What would you guys know?

1239
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,334
Flowers are the answer.

1240
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,882
(closing theme music)

1241
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,997
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

1242
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,457
EUNJAE: What happens if I can't stay?

1243
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,251
DONGJU: You don't need to worry
about that.

1244
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:39,461
MINGUK: I don't think
showing favoritism toward someone

1245
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,880
will help this situation at all,
Master Kim.

1246
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,299
(sighs)

1247
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:44,967
EUNJAE: Dr. Yoon Areum, hurry!

1248
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,635
EUNTAK: What is this?

1249
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:49,555
EUNJAE: What's with that crazy speed?

1250
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:52,474
He's going that fast
even though it's just him and Nurse Oh.

1251
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:55,060
This is an emergency situation, Dr. Kang.

1252
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,604
MINGUK: Bring the trauma staff
from the lounge this instant.
