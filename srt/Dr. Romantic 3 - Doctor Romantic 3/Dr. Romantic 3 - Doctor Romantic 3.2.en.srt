00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:03,670

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,005
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,543
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS

4
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,962
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA
ARE WORKS OF FICTION

5
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,132
(light music)

6
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,135
-SABU: Ms. Ha Yoonkyung?
-Yes.

7
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,596
Why did you apply to Doldam Hospital?

8
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,349
I watched your video from seven years ago

9
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,268
about the artificial heart surgery.

10
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,480
As a doctor myself, it was so inspiring...

11
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,026
(in emotional voice)
One moment, please.

12
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,322
Here.

13
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,116
I've heard a lot
about the water and air being good,

14
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,744
as well as the mountains.

15
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,122
By the way, I'm a really big fan of yours.
Really. A real big fan.

16
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,749
-APPLICANT 1: I like you.
-(chuckles)

17
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,001
What makes a good doctor?

18
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,461
-Do you provide food?
-How much is

19
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,546
the annual salary
for someone of my status?

20
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,548
(voice breaking)
For me to get this far...

21
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,968
-(sighs)
-APPLICANT 2: Let's be honest.

22
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,346
General surgeons and CT surgeons
don't really get paid a lot

23
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,931
and they're extreme jobs.

24
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,267
If you look there, you'll see
that I have overseas training experience.

25
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,228
For a week?

26
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,271
It's plenty of time
for a life-changing experience.

27
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,065
Is food delivery available out here?

28
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,609
Having you, Dr. Bu Yongju,
as a mentor would really...

29
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,694
boost my recognition
when I open my own hospital...

30
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,738
I cried a lot, didn't I?
(soft chuckle)

31
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,573
-May I shake your hand?
-Sure.

32
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,242
(squeals, giggles)

33
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,036
-Nurse!
-Nurse!

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,162
Nurse!

35
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,664
Nurse, please bring us some water.

36
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,833
APPLICANT 3: I...

37
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,751
was curious.

38
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,128
Curious?

39
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,505
About what?

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,841
APPLICANT 3: You.

41
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,845
Also, the people at Doldam Hospital.

42
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,724
(papers rustle)

43
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,770
Hold on...
(inhales deeply)

44
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,397
Aren't you...

45
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,858
LEE SEONUNG, R.O.K. NAVY

46
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,340
(soft grunt)

47
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,020
Ah!

48
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,771
Ah...

49
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,317
There's a lounge over there.
You can rest there if you'd like.

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,069
Okay... No, it's okay.

51
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,788
(grunts, sighs)

52
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,053
EUNJAE'S MOM: Eunho.

53
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,056
His doctor's license is suspended
for a year.

54
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,226
Is this what you meant
by fairness and justice?

55
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,685
Do you feel better now?

56
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,562
It was Eunho's fault.

57
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,273
There's even a victim.

58
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,860
Even now, you care more
about the victim than your own family?

59
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,028
Just because you're family...

60
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,406
does it mean you're supposed
to cover for them no matter what?

61
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,076
Of course. That's what family is.

62
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,869
It's common sense.

63
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,623
What about Dad?

64
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,208
(breathes shakily)

65
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,086
Does Dad...

66
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,255
see it that way too?

67
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,313
It's been a long time, Eunjae.

68
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,233
Have you been well?

69
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:37,902
Dad.

70
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,078
What brings you here?

71
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,456
I just had some business to attend to.

72
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,584
The hospital building is nice.

73
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:55,962
JINMAN: But...

74
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,256
I heard there hasn't been
a final building inspection yet.

75
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,799
You're not...

76
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,802
receiving patients, are you?

77
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,638
(tense music)

78
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,394
(mouthing)

79
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,733
The final building inspection is
for the building itself.

80
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,820
As doctors,
our job is to receive patients.

81
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,823
Also, as a visitor,

82
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,784
if you're done with your business,
you should be on your way.

83
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,624
Dr. Park.

84
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,879
Didn't you say you would show me
the Trauma Center today?

85
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,424
Yes, well, I was planning on it.

86
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,884
However,

87
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,679
it seems a few issues
I wasn't aware of have occurred.

88
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,182
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,892
Isn't a hospital's chief decision-maker

90
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,769
the hospital director?

91
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,480
JINMAN: But how is it

92
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,607
that the unopened Trauma Center
is being used

93
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:02,153
without the Director's
knowledge or permission?

94
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,698
How is that possible, Director Park?

95
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,409
(breathes deeply)

96
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,538
(phones buzz)

97
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,172
You should go.
There's nothing to worry about here.

98
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,840
You too, Dr. Cha Eunjae.

99
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,428
Go.

100
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,973
Let's go, Cha Eunjae.

101
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,482
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

102
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:46,447
As of today, the Trauma Center
is temporarily closed to the public.

103
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:51,202
Also, everything that occurs in here
is a security matter.

104
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,247
Please escort him out, Director Park.

105
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,833
Your nonsense hasn't changed.

106
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,670
(tense music continues)

107
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,145
(whispering)
Those two...

108
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,980
What's with them?

109
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:24,152
They were well-known for their rivalry
ever since their undergrad years.

110
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,696
It's a "dragon versus tiger" situation,

111
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,866
or as they say nowadays, "TVPG."

112
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,159
"TVPG?"

113
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,495
It means "Two Very Proud Geniuses."

114
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,582
To make a comparison,

115
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,751
they were the Ronaldo and Messi
of Keosan Medical School.

116
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,211
I see.

117
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,298
Who was Messi?

118
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,719
Excuse me,

119
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,471
Dr. Cha Jinman?

120
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,099
Master Kim.

121
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,018
(chuckles)

122
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,144
(chuckles)

123
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,485
(upbeat music)

124
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,825
VOLUME 2
BETWEEN ETHICS AND REALITY

125
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,620
EPISODE 2

126
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,205
(camera shutters clicking)

127
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,623
REPORTER 1: Here he comes.

128
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,916
REPORTER 2: He's here.

129
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,585
(camera shutters clicking)

130
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,340
REPORTER 3:
Are the negotiations going well?

131
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,425
REPORTER 4: Is it true
the agreed inter-Korean exchange will have

132
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,052
over 40 trillion won of economic value?

133
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,387
REPORTER 5:
Is it true that there are negotiations

134
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,056
for demolishing
the DMZ military facilities?

135
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,224
Is that why
the former Secretary of Defense

136
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,059
is present on the council?

137
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,771
For the first time in a long time,
the South and North have come together

138
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,148
to establish many agreements.

139
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,609
WOONGIL:
Everything seems to be going well.

140
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,862
Please send your support
so that we may yield good results.

141
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,823
REPORTER 6: Is there any chance
of restarting business with the North?

142
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,909
REPORTER 7: Do you have any suggestions

143
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,120
-for alleviating military tension?
-(reporters clamoring)

144
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,132
(tense music)

145
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,096
Something's come up, sir.

146
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,099
The officials from the North
are not departing from the hotel.

147
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,976
Why? What's happened?

148
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:24,146
Yesterday, our Coast Guard found
a boat stranded in the East Sea.

149
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,566
Apparently, there were
North Korean defectors on it.

150
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,693
SECRETARY: It seems
this info was relayed to the officials.

151
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,944
Here you go, sir.

152
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,574
If we don't implement this,

153
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,492
they say they'll overturn
all their decisions from this summit

154
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,786
and return to Pyongyang tomorrow morning.

155
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,832
Where are the defectors now?

156
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,360
Are you really going to be like this,
Master Kim?

157
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,071
You left it up to me
to organize the Trauma Center.

158
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,282
Well, I told you not him.

159
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,826
He wouldn't come down
to a place like this anyway.

160
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,704
Was I a person who would come down
to a place like this then?

161
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,333
Director Park, you're different.

162
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,170
You were moderately pure
with some serious craziness.

163
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,172
You were our guy from the beginning.

164
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:35,092
Anyway, we would be lucky to have someone
as overqualified as Dr. Cha.

165
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,553
Sometimes, being overqualified
isn't everything.

166
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,389
I admit that he is a talented person,

167
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,435
but that doesn't necessarily mean
he's dedicated to his patients.

168
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,813
I'm telling you,
he's completely different from us.

169
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,107
JINMAN: As I expected.

170
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:54,111
I heard that everything at Doldam Hospital
starts and stops at Bu Yongju's word.

171
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,740
I suppose the rumors were true,
Dr. Park Minguk.

172
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,116
Not in the slightest.

173
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,452
I am the Director of Doldam Hospital.

174
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,287
I make the final decisions.

175
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,455
SABU: So what?

176
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,624
Did he say he'd come if we tell him to?

177
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,042
I'm going to try and convince him.

178
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,836
If you have any objections, tell me now.

179
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,381
Otherwise, just keep your mouth shut.

180
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,174
You...

181
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,717
JINMAN: To be honest,

182
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,512
Bu Yongju isn't at a level
to raise any objections about me.

183
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,557
In that case, you can finish looking
around the Trauma Center as planned.

184
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,685
MINGUK: I will guide you.

185
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,603
(door opens)

186
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,944
Director Park Minguk,
may we speak with you for a second?

187
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,797
EUNJAE: Take this to Labs.

188
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,881
EUNTAK: How much blood should I take?

189
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,884
EUNJAE: Just one liter.
Please run an ABGA as well.

190
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,472
SABU: How is she?

191
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,808
EUNJAE: Her fever keeps rising,
and her RR is fast.

192
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,268
And she still has hemoptysis.

193
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,825
SABU: You can't hear anything on one side.

194
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,577
What about the Xpert results?

195
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,120
EUNTAK: They came back TB-positive.

196
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,038
It is confirmed
to be resistant to rifampin.

197
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,457
(Eunjae sighs)

198
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,208
EUNJAE: I'm sure it's MDR...

199
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,128
What should we do?
The condition of her lungs is very bad.

200
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,798
SABU: When will Pulmonologist Dr. Na
be back from the conference?

201
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,633
EUNTAK: Dr. Na should be back
next week on Monday.

202
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:43,554
SABU: Send her the photos, videos,
and test results for now.

203
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,848
Ask Dr. Na to contact us
after taking a look.

204
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,183
EUNTAK: Yes, sir.

205
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,190
(door opens)

206
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,192
(alarm beeping)

207
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,820
(tense music)

208
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,071
WOOJIN: It's a PEA arrest.

209
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,449
-Nurse Euntak!
-NURSE: He's in the ICU next door.

210
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,124
WOOJIN: In the meantime, give one ampule
of epinephrine every three minutes.

211
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,918
-Can you help me with the ambu bag?
-NURSE: Okay.

212
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,002
SABU: I can do that.

213
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,712
Can you bring the ultrasound?

214
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,963
NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

215
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,136
WOOJIN: Please page Dr. Jang Donghwa.

216
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,971
NURSE: About that...

217
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,600
We've been paging him this whole time,
but he hasn't been responding.

218
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,603
SABU: Since this is an emergency,

219
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,397
call Dr. Jung Insu and Dr. Nam Doil.

220
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,732
NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

221
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,740
I sent the files to Dr. Na
and left a message.

222
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,409
EUNJAE: The patient next door
seems to have gone into arrest.

223
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,912
(Woojin panting)

224
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,250
(panting continues)

225
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,047
WOOJIN: I'll check his rhythm now.

226
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,260
There's no pulse. Continuing CPR.

227
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,344
I'll take over.

228
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,348
(Woojin panting)

229
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,273
EUNJAE (sighs):
Where the hell is Jang Donghwa?

230
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,941
Did he scram again?

231
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,026
DONGHWA: Let's check together.
We have to move together.

232
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,778
We can't die, you guys.

233
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,197
You can't die. Think of this as real life.

234
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,032
Slowly.

235
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,871
Come quickly, everyone!
This is a warzone! Hurry!

236
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,915
-(gunshot in video game)
-(man groans in video game)

237
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,625
-(exhales loudly)
-(keyboard clacking)

238
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,003
Pay attention! This is a warzone!

239
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,337
(laughs)

240
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,089
(tense music)

241
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,257
INSU: I'll do it.

242
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,051
SABU: Dr. Jung Insu, run an echo.

243
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,219
INSU: Yes, sir.

244
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,930
-EUNTAK: Let's switch.
-WOOJIN: Checking rhythm.

245
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,271
PEA arrest. Continuing CPR!

246
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,483
INSU: Ah...

247
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,068
It's cardiac tamponade, Master Kim.

248
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,112
SABU:
Get me a c-line for a pericardiocentesis.

249
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,788
(Woojin panting)

250
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,257
SABU: Don't stop the compressions.

251
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,592
WOOJIN (panting): Yes, sir.

252
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,653
(panting continues)

253
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,537
Wasn't he a general surgeon?

254
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,290
How does he know
how to deal with a cardiac tamponade?

255
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,251
-(door opens)
-(footsteps approaching)

256
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,093
INSU: I'm going to check his rhythm.

257
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,767
ROSC. His pulse is back.

258
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,730
-(Euntak sighs)
-(Woojin exhales in relief)

259
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,233
SABU: Good job, everyone.

260
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,403
Keep this pericardial catheter in
and keep an eye on the patient.

261
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,197
-The LV contractility is too low.
-(Woojin panting)

262
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,574
There's a chance
of another cardiac arrest.

263
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,203
WOOJIN: The patient's nutritional status
and health are very bad.

264
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,497
I'm worried that the patient
may not be able to endure it.

265
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,086
SABU: Double the amount of norepinephrine.

266
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,296
WOOJIN:
Should we give Vasopressin as well?

267
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,382
SABU: Yes. Let's do that.

268
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,469
-EUNTAK: Master Kim.
-SABU: Yeah?

269
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,392
(Woojin panting)

270
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,152
SABU: What nonsense is this?
What do you mean by repatriation?

271
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,112
Director Park.

272
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,741
Where are you trying to send
these dying people?

273
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,910
There seems to be a major figure
among the defectors.

274
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,041
If we don't return all the people
that were on that boat by midnight,

275
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:26,545
the summit in Seoul
will be suspended immediately.

276
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,547
Listen here.

277
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,425
Those people are critically ill patients.

278
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,428
One of them went into cardiac arrest,
and we just barely brought him back.

279
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,805
SABU: Also, those people clearly expressed

280
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,516
their intention to become naturalized
in the Republic of Korea.

281
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,604
The Republic of Korea is obligated
to protect those people.

282
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,731
We're not obligated to do that yet.

283
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,815
SABU: Hmm?

284
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:51,987
As you know, they haven't officially
entered our territory yet.

285
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,074
AGENT: At stake is 40 trillion won,

286
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,868
depending on the outcome
of the summit meeting.

287
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,581
Should we lose out on 40 trillion won
because of a few defectors?

288
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,542
Are you asking me, a doctor,

289
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,670
to decide what is more important?

290
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,506
A human's life or 40 trillion won?

291
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,717
AGENT: I'm just informing you
about the current circumstances.

292
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,513
The fishing boat stranded in the East Sea
was a North Korean vessel.

293
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,433
Both the boat and its passengers
will be sent back to North Korea.

294
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,685
Before midnight.

295
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,978
(Sabu sighs)

296
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,690
Damn it...

297
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,826
Have you heard from Dr. Jang Donghwa yet?

298
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:40,994
No, not yet.

299
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,289
NURSE: We're still paging him,
but no response at all.

300
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,959
Dr. Seo, this...

301
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,462
DONGHWA.JJANG

302
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,089
DONGHWA: Emergency overtime again today.

303
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,591
Staying up all night,
and getting off work at dawn.

304
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,553
Current time, 3:49 a.m.

305
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:58,929
Is this for real?

306
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,597
(sighs, scoffs)

307
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,349
(Donghwa exhales deeply)

308
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,686
(phone buzzes)

309
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,481
What's this?

310
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,068
EUNJAE: Hey, Dr. Jang Donghwa!
Where are you?

311
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
Come to the hospital right now.

312
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,696
Whatever.

313
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,615
-(keyboard clacking)
-(phone buzzes)

314
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,702
EUNJAE: Seo Woojin is totally pissed.

315
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,204
(clacking continues)

316
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,333
(breathes deeply)

317
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,919
EUNJAE: Come immediately.
I'll give you ten seconds.

318
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,798
(clacking continues)

319
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,633
(phone buzzes)

320
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,343
(annoyed groan)

321
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,637
EUNJAE: Are you ignoring me?

322
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,183
You're confident you can handle
the consequences, right?

323
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,851
-(gunshots in video game)
-Oh!

324
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,894
Oh!

325
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,853
Wait!

326
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,314
-(exclaims, yelling)
-(man groans in video game)

327
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,481
Damn it!

328
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,905
(sighs)

329
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,908
IT HAPPENS. SOME DAYS ARE LIKE THAT.

330
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,466
Dr. Jang Donghwa!

331
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,259
What time is it?

332
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,140
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.

333
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,603
You!

334
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,606
I heard you didn't come
to the OR last night and ran away.

335
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,108
EUNJAE: There was a patient
whose life was on the balance.

336
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,526
How could you just leave?

337
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,737
Would you leave the battlefield
during an enemy invasion

338
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,197
just because your time was up?

339
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,533
I worked the morning shift
and overtime yesterday.

340
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,661
Hey, are you the only one?

341
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,955
Everyone here worked overtime.

342
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:52,334
We are legally protected
to work only 80 hours a week.

343
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,669
Plus eight hours

344
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,963
for educational purposes
or emergency cases.

345
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,715
In other words, 88 hours in total.
Why are you leaving that out?

346
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,677
Residents aren't allowed
to work 36 hours straight.

347
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,595
What?

348
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,059
You worked 20 hours straight,
including both day and night shifts.

349
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,811
Even if you included the surgery time,

350
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,146
that's still approximately 24 hours.

351
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,943
There was an emergency patient
who required surgery.

352
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,821
It was a surgery
you needed to be here for,

353
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,281
but you left.

354
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,201
Even though you didn't work
over the legal amount of hours.

355
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,995
Got anything to say?

356
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,250
Sure, work-life balance.

357
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,044
I also think that's important.

358
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,923
But you wanted to be a doctor.

359
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,342
Then do what you must.

360
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,386
(sighs)

361
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,345
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,596
Don't apologize to me.

363
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,474
If you don't practice properly,

364
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,476
your patients deal with the repercussions.

365
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,941
Unless told otherwise,

366
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,027
the patient in ICU Room No.1
is your responsibility.

367
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,321
He went into cardiac arrest this morning,

368
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,740
so if he seems unstable,
call someone immediately.

369
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,751
Get it together, Jang Donghwa.

370
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,420
You're lucky this is Dr. Seo Woojin.

371
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,757
If it was Dr. Yang Hojun,
you would have taken a beating.

372
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,096
(sighs)

373
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,187
Stop it. I can see you giggling.

374
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,523
(both snicker)

375
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,909
CAFE AU LAIT

376
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,911
MILK COFFEE

377
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,791
Let's just try to be understanding.

378
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,417
We were residents

379
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,420
and the third year of residency
is the hardest, most sensitive time.

380
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,882
He's going into fellowship next year,
and he can't even perform first-aid.

381
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,509
Fine.

382
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,511
It isn't a crime to not be able to do it.

383
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,055
But he doesn't even try,
nor is he diligent.

384
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,473
Is there any hope for him?

385
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,395
Dr. Insu said we were the same way.

386
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,521
Not me.

387
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,899
Well, I guess you were good at everything
from the start.

388
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,484
(laughs softly)

389
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,777
(Eunjae slurps)

390
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,827
Did your father leave?

391
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,203
Hmm?

392
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,332
Oh, I'm not sure. Did he?
(soft chuckle)

393
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,960
It's been a while since you last saw him.

394
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,002
Yeah.

395
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,798
I saw him briefly
on his birthday last year.

396
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,176
Is he still upset...

397
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,720
about your brother?

398
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,473
I don't know.

399
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,768
JINMAN: What are you doing here?

400
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,937
(soft music)

401
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,564
Actually,

402
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,775
I have to operate,
so I'll talk to you later.

403
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,784
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD

404
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,663
I don't regret what I did.

405
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,084
Don't I look cool?

406
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,211
(soft chuckle)

407
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,634
Now wouldn't be the right time

408
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,845
to introduce myself, would it?

409
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,140
I guess not. Let's do that later.

410
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,894
Is that all right?

411
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,896
Yeah.

412
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,815
(phone buzzes)

413
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,651
Master Kim is calling for me.

414
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,945
-Thanks for the coffee.
-Wait.

415
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,281
-What is it?
-Stay like that just a moment.

416
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,075
-Why?
-Turn your head this way.

417
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,036
Is there something on my face? Where?

418
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,995
EUNJAE: Here?

419
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,580
Or is it here?

420
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,998
There's something...

421
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,792
Hey!

422
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,837
In the middle of the hospital!

423
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,838
(soft chuckle)

424
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,632
Hurry up and go. Master Kim is waiting.

425
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,013
EMPLOYEE LOUNGE

426
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,223
(soft chuckle)

427
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,323
(tense music)

428
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,043
Nobody cares. Not a single one of you!

429
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,838
Using facilities that aren't even ready!

430
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,006
Darn it.

431
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,551
What are they going to do

432
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,553
if a new official suddenly comes in?

433
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,888
GITAE: Darn it.

434
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,144
Hold on.

435
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,814
Which is stronger?
The Ministry of Health and Welfare?

436
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,691
Or National Intelligence Service?

437
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:16,992
Damn it! I've been so distracted
by the final building inspection.

438
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,786
Hold on.

439
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,291
Come to think of it,
there was something going on today.

440
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,130
MY SCHEDULE

441
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,423
GITAE: At 4 p.m.?

442
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,259
What's at 4 p.m.?

443
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,721
-Here's your helmet.
-Thank you.

444
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,681
EMPLOYEE: You're here!

445
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,057
Hello!

446
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,394
Did you receive the notice
for the electrical inspection today?

447
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,312
Yes, of course.

448
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,272
For 30 minutes, from 4 p.m.,

449
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,858
power in the new trauma center
will be shut off.

450
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,194
Is there anything else
we need to know before that?

451
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,240
Actually, we weren't able
to install the UPS battery yet.

452
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,075
EMPLOYEE: There was a problem
in the bidding process

453
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,077
and the company was changed,
so it was delayed.

454
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,579
It'll come within the week.

455
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,081
I understand.
Where is the electrical room?

456
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,000
EMPLOYEE:
It's on the second basement level.

457
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:10,503
If you turn left around that building,
you'll see the entrance to the basement.

458
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,422
ELECTRICIAN: Let's move.

459
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,507
-Let's go down together.
-Yes, let's go.

460
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,218
-This way.
-ELECTRICIAN: Okay.

461
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,596
(door opens)

462
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,266
Master Kim,
I just received an email from Dr. Na.

463
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,771
EUNTAK: Dr. Na suggests kanamycin.
If that doesn't work,

464
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,939
prothionamide and cycloserine,

465
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,359
since we don't know if it is XDR-TB.

466
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,070
Did you tell her about the BUN levels?

467
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,740
Yes, I told her that creatinine levels
and urea output are decreasing.

468
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,908
I also mentioned

469
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,410
that the ABGA indicated
a PaCO2 value of 60 mmHg.

470
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,630
(sighs)

471
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,216
Master Kim, I'm here.

472
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,134
Did Dr. Na send an opinion?

473
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,386
Here you go, Dr. Cha.

474
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,099
As expected,
Dr. Na says to go with medicine.

475
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,560
At this rate,
it would take another week or two.

476
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,647
What are your thoughts then, Eunjae?

477
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,107
Mm...

478
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,944
I think it's better
to remove the lesion site with surgery.

479
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,904
EUNJAE: The patient's BUN levels are bad

480
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,823
and there's constant hemorrhaging,

481
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,742
meaning that the lungs
are still being destroyed locally.

482
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,912
Have you ever performed a lung lobectomy?

483
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,455
No, not for the lung.

484
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,250
You can give it a try this time then.

485
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,088
(phone ringing)

486
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,507
This is the Trauma Center.

487
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,342
Yes, Nurse Euntak.

488
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,469
What?

489
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,055
Okay.

490
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,018
Master Kim says to prepare for surgery.

491
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,479
ANESTHESIOLOGIST NAM DOIL

492
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,523
Surgery?

493
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,608
What surgery are you talking about?

494
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,360
A lung lobecto--

495
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,363
(splutters)
Where is Master Kim?

496
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,535
No, tell him not to do anything
until I get there.

497
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,120
(breathes deeply)

498
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:08,913
(sighs deeply)

499
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,333
Master Kim.

500
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,420
Master Kim!

501
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,761
Your name?

502
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,264
My name is Seo Woojin.

503
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,402
JINMAN: Eunjae is

504
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,321
my precious daughter

505
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,698
whether you knew that or not.

506
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,663
When she chose to go into CT surgery,

507
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,334
I was so proud of her.

508
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,920
I almost cried.

509
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,633
Her brother Eunho was also happy
when she made her choice.

510
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,760
And so,

511
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,598
we respected and supported each other.

512
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,312
Our family didn't have any problems

513
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,607
until you showed up,

514
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,735
Dr. Seo Woojin.

515
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,196
(soft tense music)

516
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,159
I'm just saying.

517
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,666
(door closes)

518
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,178
(door sliding open)

519
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,306
Master Kim,
you're operating on patient Ri Bokyoung?

520
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,725
SABU: Yes, that's what we've decided.
What is it?

521
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,019
Now, why are you doing this?

522
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,771
Why are you trying to open up someone

523
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,481
who'll be repatriated by midnight tonight?

524
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,608
(breathes deeply)

525
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,026
Master Kim!

526
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,071
-(clanks)
-SABU: That's why I'm doing it.

527
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,490
So what about politics

528
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,576
and economic whatever

529
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,286
-of 40 trillion won?
-(sighs)

530
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,496
It's none of my business.

531
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,417
The least I can do
is to make sure they can live.

532
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,002
In any case, they're our patients.

533
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,378
My gosh.

534
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,464
Do you really have to do this surgery?

535
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,926
SABU: It's our job and ethos
to save people, Director Park.

536
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,928
No matter how the world moves,

537
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,098
let's keep it "world and peace" for us,
Director Park.

538
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,266
Okay?

539
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,603
(clanks)

540
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,229

541
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,405
(Sabu breathes deeply)

542
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:48,948
SABU: Dr. Nam?

543
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,285
DOIL: Vitals are good. You may begin.

544
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,244
SABU: Scalpel.

545
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,421
(Sabu grunts)

546
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:04,881
Bovie.

547
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,134
(sizzling)

548
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,059
Lift it a little.

549
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,187
Rib shears.

550
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,194
CURRENT TIME
OPERATION TIME, ANESTHESIA TIME

551
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,073
GITAE: 4 p.m.?

552
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,908
What was at 4 p.m.?

553
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,994
I swear there was something then.

554
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,748
EMPLOYEE: This way.

555
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,960
The electrical room is this way.

556
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,047
It's dark here, so please be careful.

557
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,758
Watch your head.

558
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,051
ELECTRICIAN: Ah, yes.

559
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,806

561
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,353
(whispering)

562
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,400
I need to go to the bathroom.

563
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,579
-(man clears throat)
-(ominous sting)

564
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:26,838

565
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,465
EUNJAE: I'm sorry.

566
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,426
SABU: Gauze.

567
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,847
EUNTAK: Are you okay, Dr. Cha?

568
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,392
EUNJAE: I'm okay, just a little nervous
since it's my first time performing this.

569
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,814
SABU: Be careful of the bronchial artery
when you remove the adhesion.

570
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,274
EUNJAE: Okay.

571
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,821
SABU: All right, we're going to separate
the pulmonary ligament.

572
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,072
(exhales deeply)

573
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,167
JINMAN:
Our family didn't have any problems

574
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,294
until you showed up,

575
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,463
Dr. Seo Woojin.

576
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,884
(sighs)

577
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,188
WOOJIN: What are you doing here?

578
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,523
I was just watching the patient

579
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,192
who went into cardiac arrest earlier.

580
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,488
Did you see the resident
who was watching the patient?

581
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,657
He left to go to the bathroom, it seems.

582
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,576
How long has it been?

583
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:42,747
About 20 or 30 minutes, I would say?

584
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,499
(exhales sharply)

585
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,042

-(suspenseful music)
-(gasps)

603
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,732

605
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,195
Sir!

I'm sorry! Sir!

(whimpering, screams)

608
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,666
No, don't go in.

609
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,711
The man in there killed my dad

610
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,506
and shot a doctor.

611
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,677
He said he would kill us all.

612
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,513
Don't go in.

613
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,773

00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,865
please save me.

618
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,702
Please, help me.

627
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,453
JINMAN: It's me, Cha Jinman.

628
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,913
Hello, Dr. Cha Jinman.

629
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,625
My apologies for making you wait.

630
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,754
No, it's okay. I have been looking around.

631
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,758
Actually, Master Kim
just went into surgery just now.

632
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,219
MINGUK: A lobectomy of the right lung.

633
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,098
MINGUK (over phone):
You haven't seen him operate in a while.

634
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,933
How about it?

635
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,644
Would like to come and observe?

636
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,401
Where should I go?

637
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,696
EUNJAE: There's no adhesion
and less bleeding than I thought.

638
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,031
DOIL: The patient's vitals are fine too.

639
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,366
SABU: Hold this.

640
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,535
Right angle.

641
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,789
A 5-0 black silk suture, please.

642
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,712
(bright music)

643
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,845

644
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,641
-SABU: Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

645
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,518
SABU: One more.

646
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,460
This is the reason why
I stay at Doldam Hospital.

647
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,965
Master Kim is a different person
when he's in the operating room.

648
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,259
MINGUK: When he's in his zone,

649
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,845
there is nothing else I can think of.

650
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,640
I only have respect for him.

651
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,560
SABU: Metzenbaum.

652
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,699

We're removing the right upper lobe now.

00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,427
May I turn off the power now?

656
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,221
Are we ready?

657
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,181

I'm going to turn off the transformer.

ELECTRICIAN: The transformer is now off.

660
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,772
All right, turning off the ACB.

661
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,483
-Turning off the ACB.
-(tense music)

662
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:50,943
What are you doing?

663
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,946
This is a hospital.
Put down those tweezers.

664
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,782
MAN (shouts): Don't play with me!
This isn't a hospital.

665
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,702
Why don't I see any other patients?

666
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,955
That's because this place was just built.
(breathing nervously)

667
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,373
It hasn't been--

668
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,416
I don't want to hear it!

669
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,961
Give me back my boat!
I'm going back to North Korea.

670
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,505
If you don't, I'll kill everyone!

671
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,340
Dr. Seo!
(chokes)

672
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,427
-(exhales softly)
-(Donghwa grunting)

673
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,470
Turn off the VCB.

674
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,431
Okay, turning off the VCB.

675
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:23,976
GITAE: At 4 p.m....

676
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,978
Just what was it?

677
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,397
(breathes deeply)

678
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,232
At 4 p.m....

679
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,735
What was it?

680
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,238
(music intensifies)

681
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,948
Oh, 4 p.m.!

682
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:38,907
No!

MAN: What?

688
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,275
Lastly, turning off the LBS!

689
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,074
DOIL: What? What's going on?

690
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,584
It's a relief though,

691
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,087
the monitor and ventilators
are rechargeable so...

692
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,006
Oh...

693
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,887
(sighs)
It wasn't charging properly.

694
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,723
Ambu bag. Where is it?

695
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,184
(tense music)

696
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:00,989
(phone beeps)

697
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:05,160
Chief Jang, what is going on?
Why is the power out?

698
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,370
So about that,

699
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,331
there was an electrical inspection today.

700
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:13,627
I'm sorry, I should have given you
another notice this morning.

701
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,130
There was a sudden issue
at the trauma center,

702
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,006
so I completely forgot.

703
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,133
I'm really sorry.

704
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:23,053
Do you know that the emergency power
is not running in the OR right now?

705
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,266
The OR? There's an operation
going on right now?

706
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,394
Hurry downstairs
and turn the power back on!

707
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,730
Yes, sir. Please wait a moment.

708
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,690
-(phone beeps)
-Manager Lee...

709
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,026
Manager Lee! Where are you?

710
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,822
SABU: For now, use cellphone flashlights.

711
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,458
Here.

712
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,420
(squelching)

713
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,838
EUNJAE (gasps): Oh, no.

714
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,424
I think I touched a vein
when the lights went out.

715
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,217
SABU: It's okay.

716
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,594
We can control the bleeding.

717
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,970
EUNJAE: I'm sorry.

718
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,306
SABU: Relax. It's okay.

719
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,022
It's not the worst situation ever.

720
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,149
Don't get flustered.

721
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,111
Give me a lot of gauzes.

722
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,072
(phone buzzes)

723
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,617
DOIL: It's Director Park.

724
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,578
MINGUK (over phone): Master Kim.
It's me, Park Minguk.

725
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,830
DOIL: What is going on right now?

726
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,166
MINGUK: There was an inspection
for the electrical equipment.

727
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,044
They didn't realize anyone was inside.

728
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,506
The administration staff didn't know
what was going on at the Trauma Center.

729
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,967
MINGUK (breathes deeply): Chief Jang
is heading down to the electrical room,

730
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,595
but I don't know how long it will take.
What should I do?

731
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:51,225
DOIL: Could you send me
a portable ventilator and a monitor first?

732
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,976
Okay. Anything else?

733
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,230
SABU: Are you saying
the whole building is without power?

734
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,024
Yes, I'm afraid so.

735
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,609
(Sabu sighs)

736
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:05,155
Then, quickly go to the ICU
and check it out.

737
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,742
There's a patient that went
into cardiac arrest in the morning.

738
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,953
We're going to have
to go check him quickly.

739
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,498
Okay, I'll take care of the ICU.

740
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,879
What kind of game are you guys playing at?

741
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,756
MAN: Turn the lights back on!

742
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,675
(Donghwa breathes heavily)

743
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,968
(Donghwa groans)

744
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,804
(suspenseful music)

745
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:31,932
(Donghwa pants)

746
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,727
MAN: Stay still, you bastard.

747
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,521
(Donghwa breathes shakily)

748
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,702
Excuse me.

749
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:53,620
Excuse me!

750
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,540
MYEONGSIM: What should we do, Master Kim?

751
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,083
Are we just going to keep using gauze

752
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,502
until the power comes back?

753
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,462
(Sabu sighs)

754
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,884
(Sabu breathes deeply)

755
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:10,804
SABU: Shine a light where my forceps are.
Here, Doil.

756
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:11,972
DOIL: Okay.

757
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,349
SABU: Dr. Kim, over here.

758
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,436
Nurse Choi, here.

759
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,568
SABU: It would be better
if there were two more lights.

760
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,736
MYEONGSIM: I'll do it.

761
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,654
Nurse Euntak and Dr. Cha,
give me your phones.

762
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,364
EUNJAE: I didn't bring mine.

763
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,490
EUNTAK: It's in my pocket.

764
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,624
SABU: Okay, this way.

765
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,417
-A little higher.
-MYEONGSIM: Yes, Doctor.

766
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,543
SABU: Mm.

767
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,296
MYEONGSIM: It's still a little weak.

768
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,881
And the shadows get in the way.

769
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,633
Is this okay, Master Kim?

770
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:48,717
SABU: Well...

771
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,595
Let's do what we can.

772
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,222
Cha Eunjae, press here.

773
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,434
-Nurse Euntak?
-EUNTAK: Don't worry.

774
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:58,977
I'll cover you two.

775
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,145
SABU: Okay.

776
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:01,688
All right.

777
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,732
Focus.

778
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,902
(intense music)

779
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,248
(huffs)

780
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,920
You're going to find it
only with your sense of touch?

781
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:31,134
GITAE: Turn on the power, please! Hurry!

782
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,719
They're in the middle of a surgery!

783
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,888
Please!

784
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,617
(Sabu gasps softly)

785
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,078
-SABU: Okay.
-EUNJAE: Did you find it?

786
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,788
SABU: I think so.

787
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,915
(light music)

788
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:03,583
MYEONGSIM: Nurse Euntak.

789
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,962
EUNTAK: Here's a hemoclip.

790
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:08,797
SABU: Right here.

791
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,093
EUNJAE: One more, please.

792
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,553
SABU: You have to clip it twice.

793
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,730
EUNJAE: I got it.
Is it the bronchial artery?

794
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,190
SABU: Yes, it seems that way. Suture.

795
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,111
(hopeful music)

796
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,583
-SABU: Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

797
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,004
GITAE (shouts): Flip the switch! Now!

798
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,756
(wheezes)

799
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,758
Turn on the power. Hurry!

800
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,718
Right now!

801
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,026
CONTINUE BATTLE

802
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,569
(gunshots in video game)

803
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,740
(gunshots in video game)

804
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:30,253
-(suspenseful music)
-(both grunting)

805
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,507
(grunts)

806
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,261
-(devices whir)
-(all exclaim)

807
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,305
(all sigh in relief)

808
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,224
(Eunjae and Sabu sigh)

809
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,559
(Sabu and Myeongsim sigh)

810
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,855
(Sabu chuckles softly)

811
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,657
-(both grunting)
-(suspenseful music continues)

812
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,202
-(shouts)
-(grunts)

813
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,204
-(clattering)
-AGENT: Sergeant Kim!

814
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,916
-(man shouts)
-(Woojin grunts)

815
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,002
Die, you son of a bitch!

816
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,295
(breathing heavily, rapidly)

817
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,673
-(whimpers)
-(grunts)

818
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,925
-(guns click)
-Put your hands up!

819
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,388
(Woojin breathing heavily, rapidly)

820
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,103
(wailing)

821
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,107
-Let go of me, you bastard!
-(boy continues wailing)

822
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,109
MAN: You damn bastards!

823
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:38,989
Why are you doing this to me?
Let go of me, you bastards!

824
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,782
MAN: Let go of me, you bastards!

825
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,620
(wailing)

826
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,168
I'm sorry.

827
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,795
(footsteps approaching)

828
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,802
(sighs)

829
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,308
(grunts)
One moment, please.

830
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,728
I think he's only fainted.

831
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,479
(Donghwa pants)

832
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,942
His pulse was fine when I last checked.

833
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,111
But just in case,

834
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,489
you can have a brain CT taken.

835
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,749
(sighs)

836
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:38,673
Who are you?

837
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,093
SEONUNG: Oh.

838
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,679
I'm a military doctor from the Navy

839
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,599
and the first to treat the patients
while out at sea.

840
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,604
Is this your doing, Captain?

841
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,982
SEONUNG:
I'm sorry I did this without permission.

842
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,400
Everyone seemed distracted, so...

843
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,570
But I have a professional license

844
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,113
so don't worry.

845
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:04,699
You did well.

846
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,620
Thank you.

847
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,706
(soft chuckle)

848
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,630
How did you know his pulse was stable?

849
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,467
His arm happened to fall near me
when he collapsed.

850
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,352
(clattering)

851
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,191
Good job, everyone.

852
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,317
Good job.

853
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,735
-Good job, you guys.
-Good job.

854
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,820
You did a good job.

855
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,572
Dad?

856
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:00,672
(pensive music)

857
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,568
Cha Eunjae...

858
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,702
She's very special to me too.

859
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,538
Whether you knew that or not.

860
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:39,836
I'm just saying.

861
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,687
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

862
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,608
DOIL: Careful.

863
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,443
Care...

864
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,029
(Myeongsim sighs)

865
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,947
The aftereffects seem to be severe.

866
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,240
Why wouldn't they be?

867
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,742
A power outage during surgery

868
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,827
is the worst accident
that can happen in a hospital.

869
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,413
What's he doing?

870
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,751
(scoffs)

871
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,717
(groans)

872
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:28,968
What was I thinking...

873
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,561
(somber music)

874
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,331
What are you doing here alone?

875
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,875
What? Oh, hey.

876
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,629
Just thinking over a few things.

877
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,148
Those people...

878
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,191
Hmm?

879
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,193
Was it really right for us...

880
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,028
to send them back?

881
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,408
Was there no way for us...

882
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,535
to protect them?

883
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:39,998
(sighs)

884
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,542
Woojin,

885
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,880
it's enough that we did what we could.

886
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,300
Oftentimes, between ethics and reality...

887
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:53,303
(inhales deeply)
...what is right and what the solution is

888
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,390
is hard to balance.

889
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,645
It's just better for us
to do our best as doctors.

890
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,647
Okay?

891
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,949
MYEONGSIM: I wonder what happened.

892
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,119
To what?

893
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,746
MYEONGSIM: Master Kim.

894
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,832
He's not one to give up
on his patients that easily.

895
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,629
Even Master Kim wouldn't have
the ability to do anything.

896
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,464
The higher-ups made the decision.

897
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,300
By any chance,

898
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,886
could he be involved in something?

899
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:40,934
Politics is what determines
the balance between ethics and reality.

900
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:45,647
And Master Kim is a man
who absolutely hates such politics.

901
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,358
You know that, Ms. Oh.

902
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:52,237
It's strange for him to do nothing
and send away surgical patients.

903
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,531
And that young child as well.

904
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:57,158
He's not the type to just send them away.

905
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:00,787
(smacks lips)
We just did our job,

906
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,748
so let's just say that was enough. Here.

907
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,089
REPORTER (on TV): Early this morning,
in the East Sea,

908
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,882
a stranded North Korean fishing boat

909
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,468
was rescued
by the South Korean Coast Guard.

910
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,680
A total of five sailors were rescued
from the North Korean ship

911
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:22,058
that had been drifting in the East Sea
for ten days due to engine failure.

912
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,560
Unfortunately, four of the sailors

913
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:27,063
died of extreme malnourishment,
dehydration, and injuries.

914
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:30,108
Only one engineer survived

915
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,193
and was repatriated
to North Korea this evening.

916
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,362
As a result, the inter-Korean summit

917
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:37,198
that was scheduled for this afternoon
was delayed for about two hours.

918
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,118
Many voiced their concerns
about how this could potentially

919
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:41,661
cause the summit to fall apart.

920
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,870
-(scoffs)
-REPORTER: However,

921
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:46,124
around 4 p.m.,
two hours after the scheduled meeting,

922
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:49,460
the North Korean representatives
appeared at the meeting,

923
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,755
seemingly ending
the concerns of the involved officials.

924
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,133
We cautiously await the results

925
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:58,761
of the summit,
in hopes that it will pave the way

926
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,680
for practical inter-Korean
economic cooperation.

927
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,308
With that, we end our broadcast.

You brought the present, right?

963
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:17,960
Of course.

It's safely packed away in this bag.

-It's cold. Let's go in.
-Okay.

969
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,764

01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,697
There was a collision at a ski resort.

-Four in total, one with a fracture.
-Okay.

01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,764

JINMAN (over phone): It's me, Cha Jinman.

1040
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,900
Hello, Dr. Cha. It's been awhile.

1041
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:11,652
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1042
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,822
I'm calling about the position
at Doldam Trauma Center that you offered.

1043
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:17,533
I have a condition
if you want me to work there.

1044
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:19,744
(tense music)

1045
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:20,953
Yes, what is it?

1046
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,248
Bu Yongju...

1047
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,668
I want you to remove him
from the Trauma Center.

1048
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,465
The Trauma Center without Bu Yongju,

1049
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,217
then I'll consider it.

1050
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,808
(tense music continues)

1051
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,980

1053
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:05,289
SABU: This will be a test for us too.

1054
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,834
You're the only one
who can evaluate me as a doctor.

1055
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,628
What kind of plot are you hiding

1056
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:13,130
behind this ridiculous
personnel appointment?

1057
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,965
(in childish voice)
Open the lid for me too. Please?

1058
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,468
-Your roommate is a doctor?
-What?

1059
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:21,055
JINMAN: To be honest, it's obvious
how they'd be if they learned from you.

1060
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,850
DONGHWA:
Look at what happened to that patient.

1061
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:27,812
That patient was the patient I sent away.

1062
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:31,482
Do you think that's a surgery
to save a person's life?

1063
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:33,150
Are you trying to get someone killed?
